[•], 2016
Dear Stockholder:
The Board of Directors and officers of Lucas Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation, join us in extending
to you a cordial invitation to attend a special meeting of our stockholders. This meeting will be held on
[•], 2016 at 9:00 a.m. Central Standard Time at The Houston Club, Bush Ballroom, 910 Louisiana St.,
49th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002 (the “Special Meeting”).
In December 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”),
as purchaser, with twenty-one separate sellers (the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire from the Sellers (the
“Acquisition”), working interests in producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Texas and
Oklahoma, including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-
Continent region of the United States, and related wells, leases, records, equipment and agreements
associated therewith as well as producing shale properties in Glasscock County, Texas (collectively,
the “Assets”).
Because the shares of our common stock (the “Common Stock”), including the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of our amended and restated designated form of Series B
redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), to be issued to finance the
Acquisition, represent greater than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and a change in control
(as defined by NYSE MKT), Sections 712 and 713 of the NYSE MKT rules mandate stockholder
approval to issue any such shares of Common Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock to purchase the
Assets, to be paid to International Bank of Commerce (“IBC”) as a fee to refinance the Sellers’ debt
being assumed in the Acquisition and finance the cash portion of the Acquisition consideration.
Accordingly, at the Special Meeting, stockholders will be asked to approve two proposals involving the
prospective issuance of our Common Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock in connection with the
Acquisition, including: (1) the issuance of 13,009,664 shares of Common Stock to the Sellers, the
issuance of 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers and its affiliates, and the
issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B
Preferred Stock, including shares issuable pursuant to the dividend provisions of the Series B
Preferred Stock, exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, to acquire the Assets; and (2)
the issuance of 390,290 shares of Common Stock to IBC as a fee to refinance the Sellers’ debt being
assumed in the Acquisition and finance the cash portion of the Acquisition consideration.
In April 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”)
with an accredited institutional investor, pursuant to which we issued a $530,000 face amount
redeemable convertible subordinated debenture at a 5% original issue discount convertible into
163,077 shares of Common Stock and a warrant to purchase 1,384,616 shares of Common Stock. In
April 2016, we also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with
the same accredited institutional investor, pursuant to which we agreed, subject to certain conditions,
to issue 527 shares of newly designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Series
C Preferred Stock”) at a 5% original issue discount convertible into 1,618,462 shares of Common
Stock, and a warrant to purchase 1,111,112 shares of Common Stock. Because the shares of our
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible debenture (including shares issuable for
interest and conversion premiums) and exercise of the warrant (including shares issuable for
premiums and conversion premiums) issued pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, and
upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock (including shares issuable for dividends and
conversion premiums) and exercise of the warrant (including shares issuable for premiums and
conversion premiums) issuable pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, collectively represent
greater than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and a change in control (as defined by NYSE
MKT), Section 713 of the NYSE MKT rules mandate stockholder approval to issue any such shares of
Common Stock. Accordingly, at the Special Meeting, stockholders will be asked to approve two
proposals involving the prospective issuance of our Common Stock in connection with the Securities
Purchase Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement, including: (1) the issuance of such number of
shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable upon
conversion of principal and interest under the $530,000 face amount redeemable convertible
subordinated debenture, including shares issuable for conversion premiums thereon, and upon
exercise of the warrant, including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon,
issued under the Securities Purchase Agreement, and ratification of the terms of such Securities
Purchase Agreement and of the terms and issuance of such redeemable convertible subordinated
debenture and such warrant; and (2) the issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock
exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable upon conversion of the 527 shares of
newly designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, including shares issuable for
dividends and conversion premiums thereon, and upon exercise of the warrant, including shares
issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon, to be issued under the Stock Purchase
Agreement, and issuable upon conversion of up to an additional 4,473 shares of newly designated
Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, including shares issuable for dividends and
conversion premiums thereon, that may be sold to the same investor on substantially the same terms
within 90 days after stockholder approval, and ratification of the terms of such Stock Purchase
Agreement and of the terms and issuance of such Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock
and such warrant.
In August 2015, we entered into a Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Line of
Credit”) with Silver Star Oil Company and have, to date, issued $1 million in convertible promissory
notes under the Line of Credit. In March 2016, we entered into a Convertible Promissory Note
Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with HFT Enterprises, LLC, pursuant to which
we agreed to issue an aggregate of $600,000 in convertible promissory notes. We also agreed to issue
HFT Enterprises warrants to purchase 124,285 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.50
per share, at such time as the aggregate of $600,000 in convertible promissory notes have been
issued. In April 2016, we entered into an Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit
and Notes Agreement (the “Line of Credit Amendment”) with Target Alliance London Limited,
pursuant to which we agreed to issue the remaining $1.4 million in convertible promissory notes under
the Line of Credit at a conversion price of $3.25 per share to Target Alliance London Limited and to
issue warrants to purchase 51,562 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.25 per share for
each $250,000 in convertible promissory notes that are issued to Target Alliance London Limited.
Because the shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion of principal and interest under
convertible promissory notes and upon exercise of warrants issued or to be issued in connection with
the Line of Credit, the Note Purchase Agreement, the Line of Credit Amendment or similar facility,
represent greater than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and a change in control (as defined by
NYSE MKT), Section 713 of the NYSE MKT rules mandate stockholder approval to issue any such
shares of Common Stock. Accordingly, at the Special Meeting, stockholders will be asked to approve
the issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding
Common Stock, issuable upon conversion of principal and interest under convertible promissory
notes and upon exercise of warrants issued or to be issued in connection with the Line of Credit, the
Note Purchase Agreement, the Line of Credit Amendment or, within 90 days after stockholder
approval, similar future facilities on substantially the same or better terms, not to exceed $3.0 million in
the aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory notes and not to exceed warrants to
purchase 500,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate.
Our Board of Directors determined that it was advisable and in the best interests of the Company and
our stockholders to enter into the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the
Line of Credit, and the transactions related to the Line of Credit, in order to improve our ability to
continue as a going concern and to raise the working capital necessary to execute on our business
strategy, including but not limited to our plans to acquire, develop, and produce crude oil and natural
gas from areas located in, or near, established oil fields that can provide long-term growth and
sustainability for us.
In addition, at the Special Meeting, stockholders will be asked to approve an amendment to our
Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Camber Energy, Inc., to ratify the appointment of GBH
CPAs, PC as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 and to approve the
adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting for a quorum or to approve any of the proposals.
Details regarding the business to be conducted are more fully described in the accompanying Notice
of Special Meeting and Proxy Statement.
Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting, it is important that your shares be represented
and voted at the meeting. Therefore, you are urged to complete, sign, date and promptly return the
enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. Returning your completed proxy card will
ensure your representation at the Special Meeting. If you later decide to attend the Special Meeting and
wish to change your vote, you may do so simply by voting in person at the meeting. Due to voting
rules that may prevent your bank or broker from voting your uninstructed shares on a discretionary
basis, it is very important that you cast your vote.
So that we may accommodate attendees, and if you plan to attend, we ask that you RSVP to
info@lucasenergy.com. We look forward to seeing you on [•], 2016. Your vote and participation in our
governance is very important to us.
Sincerely yours,

Please note: If you hold your shares in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, your nominee
may determine to vote your shares at its own discretion, absent instructions from you. However, due
to voting rules that may prevent your bank or broker from voting your uninstructed shares on a
discretionary basis for non-routine matters, it is very important that you cast your vote. Accordingly,
please provide appropriate voting instructions to your broker or bank to ensure your vote will count.
The enclosed proxy statement is also available at https://www.iproxydirect.com/LEI. This website also

PROXY STATEMENT
FOR A SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
TO BE HELD ON [•], 2016
General
The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of Lucas Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Lucas,” “we,”
“us”, “our” or the “Company”), by our Board of Directors (the “Board”) for use at our Special Meeting
of Stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) to be held on [•], 2016 at 9:00 a.m. Central Standard Time at
The Houston Club, Bush Ballroom, 910 Louisiana St., 49th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002, or at any
adjournments or postponements thereof, for the purposes set forth in this proxy statement and in the
accompanying notice. These proxy solicitation materials were first sent or given on or about [•], 2016
to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
Purpose of the Meeting
In December 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”),
as purchaser, with twenty-one separate sellers (the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire from the Sellers (the
“Acquisition”), working interests in producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Texas and
Oklahoma, including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-
Continent region of the United States, and related wells, leases, records, equipment and agreements
associated therewith as well as producing shale properties in Glasscock County, Texas (collectively,
the “Assets”).
Because the shares of our common stock (the “Common Stock”), including the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of our amended and restated designated form of Series B
redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), to be issued to finance the
Acquisition, represent greater than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and a change in control
(as defined by NYSE MKT), Sections 712 and 713 of the NYSE MKT rules mandate stockholder
approval to issue any such shares of Common Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock to purchase the
Assets, to be paid to International Bank of Commerce (“IBC”) as a fee to refinance the Sellers’ debt
being assumed in the Acquisition and finance the cash portion of the Acquisition consideration. Also
in connection with the Acquisition, we are required to rebrand and change our name to Camber
Energy, Inc. Proposals One, Two and Seven specifically authorize: (1) the issuance of 13,009,664
shares of Common Stock to the Sellers, the issuance of 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to
one of the Sellers and its affiliate, and the issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, including shares issuable pursuant to the
dividend provisions of the Series B Preferred Stock, exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common
Stock, to acquire the Assets; (2) the issuance of 390,290 shares of Common Stock to IBC as a fee to
refinance the Sellers’ debt being assumed in the Acquisition and finance the cash portion of the
Acquisition consideration; and (3) an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to change our name
to Camber Energy, Inc.

In April 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”)
with an accredited institutional investor, pursuant to which we issued a $530,000 face amount
redeemable convertible subordinated debenture at a 5% original issue discount convertible into
163,077 shares of Common Stock and a warrant to purchase 1,384,616 shares of Common Stock. In
April 2016, we also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with
the same accredited institutional investor, pursuant to which we agreed, subject to certain conditions,
to issue 527 shares of newly designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Series
C Preferred Stock”) at a 5% original issue discount convertible into 1,618,462 shares of Common
Stock, and a warrant to purchase 1,111,112 shares of Common Stock. Because the shares of our
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible debenture (including shares issuable for
interest and conversion premiums) and exercise of the warrant (including shares issuable for
premiums and conversion premiums) issued pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, and
upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock (including shares issuable for dividends and
conversion premiums) and exercise of the warrant (including shares issuable for premiums and
conversion premiums) issuable pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, collectively represent
greater than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and a change in control (as defined by NYSE
MKT), Section 713 of the NYSE MKT rules mandate stockholder approval to issue any such shares of
Common Stock. Proposals Three and Four specifically authorize: (1) the issuance of such number of
shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable upon
conversion of principal and interest under the $530,000 face amount redeemable convertible
subordinated debenture, including shares issuable for conversion premiums thereon, and upon
exercise of the warrant, including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon,
issued under the Securities Purchase Agreement, and ratification of the terms of such Securities
Purchase Agreement and of the terms and issuance of such redeemable convertible subordinated
debenture and such warrant; and (2) the issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock
exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable upon conversion of the 527 shares of
newly designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, including shares issuable for
dividends and conversion premiums thereon, and upon exercise of the warrant, including shares
issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon, to be issued under the Stock Purchase
Agreement, and issuable upon conversion of up to an additional 4,473 shares of newly designated
Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, including shares issuable for dividends and
conversion premiums thereon, that may be sold to the same investor on substantially the same terms
within 90 days after stockholder approval, and ratification of the terms of such Stock Purchase
Agreement and of the terms and issuance of such Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock
and such warrant.
In August 2015, we entered into a Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Line of
Credit”) with Silver Star Oil Company and have, to date, issued $1 million in convertible promissory
notes under the Line of Credit. In March 2016, we entered into a Convertible Promissory Note
Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with HFT Enterprises, LLC, pursuant to which
we agreed to issue an aggregate of $600,000 in convertible promissory notes. We also agreed to issue
HFT Enterprises warrants to purchase 124,285 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.50
per share, at such time as the aggregate of $600,000 in convertible promissory notes have been
issued. In April 2016, we entered into an Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit
and Notes Agreement (the “Line of Credit Amendment”) with Target Alliance London Limited,
pursuant to which we agreed to issue the remaining $1.4 million in convertible promissory notes under
the Line of Credit at a conversion price of $3.25 per share to Target Alliance London Limited and to
issue warrants to purchase 51,562 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.25 per share for
each $250,000 in convertible promissory notes that are issued to Target Alliance London Limited.
Because the shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion of principal and interest under
convertible promissory notes and upon exercise of warrants issued or to be issued in connection with
the Line of Credit, the Note Purchase Agreement, the Line of Credit Amendment or similar facility,
represent greater than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and a change in control (as defined by
NYSE MKT), Section 713 of the NYSE MKT rules mandate stockholder approval to issue any such
shares of Common Stock. Proposal Five specifically authorizes the issuance of such number of
shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable upon
conversion of principal and interest under convertible promissory notes and upon exercise of
warrants issued or to be issued in connection with the Line of Credit, the Note Purchase Agreement,
the Line of Credit Amendment or, within 90 days after stockholder approval, similar future facilities on
substantially the same or better terms, not to exceed $3.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of
convertible promissory notes and not to exceed warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of common
stock in the aggregate.
If all of the proposals in this proxy statement are approved by our stockholders and all of the
transactions described herein are consummated, the effect would be to increase our total outstanding
shares of Common Stock from 1,739,397 to a range of between approximately 27,769,944 and
40,137,913 shares, depending on our stock price and the interest rate, dividend rate, premium,
conversion premium and holding period of the Debenture, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, First Warrant, Second Warrant and convertible notes. Please see pages 51, 80, 85, 90
and 94 of this proxy statement for more detailed information, including the assumptions we have relied
upon in estimating such potential number of outstanding shares of Common Stock that could result
from the consummation of the transactions described in this proxy statement.

The specific proposals to be considered and acted upon at the Special Meeting are summarized in the
accompanying notice and are described in more detail in this proxy statement.

Providing and Revoking Proxies
Any stockholder giving a proxy may revoke it at any time provided written notice of the revocation is
received by our Corporate Secretary before the proxy is voted; otherwise, if received prior to or at the
Special Meeting, properly executed proxies will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the
instructions specified on the proxy or, if no such instructions are given, in accordance with the
recommendations of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) described herein. Stockholders attending
the Special Meeting may revoke their proxies and vote in person.
Attendance at the Special Meeting
Attendance at the Special Meeting is limited to holders of record of our Common Stock at the close of
business on the Record Date and the Company’s guests. Admission will be on a first-come, first-
served basis. You will be asked to present valid government-issued picture identification, such as a
driver’s license or passport, in order to be admitted into the Special Meeting. If your shares are held in
the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and you plan to attend the Special Meeting, you must
present proof of your ownership of our common stock or preferred stock, such as a bank or brokerage
account statement indicating that you owned shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock at the
close of business on the Record Date, in order to be admitted. For safety and security reasons, no
cameras, recording equipment or other electronic devices will be permitted in the Special Meeting. A
written agenda and rules of procedure for the Special Meeting will be distributed to those persons in
attendance at the Special Meeting.
Conduct at the Meeting
The Chairman of the Special Meeting has broad responsibility and legal authority to conduct the
Special Meeting in an orderly and timely manner. This authority includes establishing rules for
stockholders who wish to address the Meeting. Only stockholders or their valid proxy holders may
address the meeting. Copies of these rules will be available at the Meeting. The Chairman may also
exercise broad discretion in recognizing stockholders who wish to speak and in determining the
extent of discussion on each item of business. In light of the number of business items on this year’s
agenda and the need to conclude the meeting within a reasonable period of time, we cannot ensure
that every stockholder who wishes to speak on an item of business will be able to do so.
Quorum
The presence at the Special Meeting of the holders of at least 33% of the outstanding shares of voting
stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting (1,739,397 shares of common stock) is necessary to
constitute a quorum. Broker non-votes and abstentions are counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present.

Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed
for the Meeting and who will determine whether a quorum is present. The inspector of election will treat
abstentions and broker non-votes (i.e., shares held by a broker or nominee that are represented at the
Special Meeting, but with respect to which such broker or nominee is not instructed to vote on a
particular proposal and does not have discretionary voting power) as shares that are present for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. With respect to Proposals One through Five and
Proposals Seven and Eight, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of
determining whether such proposal has been approved and will not have the effect of negative votes.
With respect to Proposal Six, both abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the
tabulations of votes cast on such proposal presented to the stockholders and will have the same
effect as negative votes.
If your shares are held by a bank or broker in street name, it is very important that you cast your vote if
you want it to count in voting on non-routine matters as determined by the New York Stock Exchange.
Voting rules may prevent your bank or broker from voting your uninstructed shares on a discretionary
basis for non-routine matters. Accordingly, if your shares are held by a bank or broker in street name
and you do not instruct your bank or broker how to vote for the proposals in this proxy statement, no
votes will be cast on your behalf.

Mailing Costs and Solicitation of Proxies
We have retained Issuer Direct Corporation, located at 500 Perimeter Park Drive, Morrisville, North
Carolina 27560, to assist us with the solicitation of proxies for a fee, which we believe will be
approximately $20,000 to $30,000, plus expenses.
We will bear the cost of this solicitation. In addition, we may reimburse brokerage firms and other
persons representing beneficial owners of shares for reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding
solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies also may be solicited by our directors, officers
or employees, personally, by telephone, facsimile, Internet or other means, without additional
compensation. Except as described above, we do not presently intend to solicit proxies other than by
mail.
Inspector of Election
Representatives of Issuer Direct Corporation will tabulate the votes and act as inspector of election at
the Special Meeting.
List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote
A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available to view during
the Special Meeting. You may also access this list at our principal executive offices, for any purpose
germane to the Special Meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of ten days prior to the
Special Meeting.
Voting Instructions
Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting, we encourage you
to read this proxy statement and submit your proxy or voting instructions as soon as possible. For
specific instructions on how to vote your shares, please refer to the instructions on your enclosed
proxy card.

Confidential Voting
Independent inspectors count the votes. Your individual vote is kept confidential from us unless
special circumstances exist. For example, a copy of your proxy card will be sent to us if you write
comments on the card.
Stockholder of Record and Shares Held in Brokerage Accounts
If on the Record Date your shares were registered in your name with the Company’s transfer agent,
then you are a stockholder of record and you may vote in person at the meeting, by proxy or by any
other means supported by the Company. If on the Record Date your shares were held in an account at
a brokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of
shares held in “street name” and these proxy materials are required to be forwarded to you by that
organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for
purposes of voting at the Special Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your
broker or other agent on how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the
Special Meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares
in person at the meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from your broker or other agent.
Multiple Stockholders Sharing the Same Address
In some cases, one copy of this proxy statement and the documents incorporated by reference herein
are being delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address, at the request of such stockholders.
We will deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of this proxy statement and the
documents incorporated by reference herein to such a stockholder at a shared address to which a
single copy of the documents was delivered. Stockholders sharing an address may also submit
requests for delivery of a single copy of this proxy statement and/or the documents incorporated by
reference herein, but in such event will still receive separate forms of proxy for each account. To
request separate or single delivery of these materials now or in the future, a stockholder may submit a
written request to our Corporate Secretary, at our principal executive offices at 450 Gears Road, Suite
860, Houston, Texas 77067, or a stockholder may make a request by calling our Corporate Secretary at
(713) 528-1881.
If you receive more than one proxy card, it means that your shares are registered differently and are
held in more than one account. To ensure that all shares are voted, please either vote each account as
discussed above under “Voting Instructions”, or sign and return by mail all proxy cards or voting
instruction forms.
Voting Results
The preliminary voting results will be announced at the Special Meeting. The final voting results will be
tallied by the inspector of election and published in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which

SUMMARY TERM SHEET
The following summary term sheet provides information to help you understand the essential features
and material terms of our proposed acquisition of working interests in producing properties and
undeveloped acreage in Texas and Oklahoma, including varied interests in two largely contiguous
acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent region of the United States, and related wells, leases,
records, equipment and agreements associated therewith as well as producing shale properties in
Glasscock County, Texas, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement. The term sheet also contains
cross-references to more detailed discussions elsewhere in the proxy statement, for your further
information and review. Please refer to the Asset Purchase Agreement, which is attached as Annex A-
1 to this proxy statement, and the form of First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement, which is
attached as Annex A-2 to this proxy statement, for further details.
The Acquisition (see page 56). On December 30, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (as
amended by the First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement, the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), as
●
purchaser, with twenty-one separate sellers (the “Sellers”) and Segundo Resources, LLC, as a Seller and as
a representative of the sellers named therein (the “Representative”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire from the Sellers (the
“Acquisition”), working interests in producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Texas and Oklahoma,
including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent region
of the United States, and related wells, leases, records, equipment and agreements associated therewith, as
well as producing shale properties in Glasscock County, Texas (collectively, the “Assets”). The properties
currently produce approximately 1,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), of which 53% are
liquids from 114 producing wells. The bulk of the production is from the Hunton formation holding
approximately 43,000 gross acres (9,900 net acres) in central Oklahoma. Additionally, further, offset
development drilling opportunities for at least 40 additional wells have been identified. Revenues generated
from the Assets effective from April 1, 2016 will be credited to us. Any sale by the Sellers of the properties in
Glasscock County, Texas prior to closing the Acquisition must be approved by us, and the proceeds from
any such sale will be placed in escrow until the closing of the Acquisition, where they can be drawn upon by
mutual consent of the parties.
●
Acquisition Consideration (see page 56). As consideration for the Acquisition, we agreed to assume $31.35
million of commercial bank debt; issue 552,000 shares of our amended and restated designated form of
Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) to one of the Sellers and its
affiliate, which are under common control with the Seller Representative, with a total liquidation value of
$13.8 million; issue 13,009,664 shares of Common Stock to certain of the Sellers (together with the Series B
Preferred Stock, the “Acquisition Shares”); and pay $4,975,000 in cash to certain of the Sellers.
Notwithstanding the above, in the event there are any title or other material issues associated with the
Assets, the parties agreed to work in good faith to address such issues, and if such issues cannot be
addressed, to adjust the purchase price, provided that no adjustment will be made unless such issues in
aggregate total more than 5% of the aggregate purchase price, and provided further that if such issues in
aggregate total more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price, we can terminate the Asset Purchase
Agreement, all of which are subject to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. We and the Sellers also
agreed to a true-up for certain joint interest billings and authorization for expenditures at and/or after closing,
and to effect a true-up in connection with any material agreements, if the rights thereto are not provided by
the Sellers at closing. We may pay fees and expenses attributable to the Sellers incurred prior to April 1,
2016 as long as those expenses do not exceed $960,000.
10
●
Financing for the Acquisition (see page 57). In order to finance the debt and cash portions of the Acquisition
consideration, at the closing of the Acquisition, we intend to enter into a three-year $40 million senior
secured term loan (subject to a loan-to-value ratio of 50% or less) with International Bank of Commerce
(“IBC”). The term loan is expected to require repayment in monthly installments of the greater of 50% of net
monthly income or monthly principal and interest payments of $425,000, and to require a sinking fund to be
created with an initial deposit of $3.36 million to be used for principal reductions. The term loan is expected
to bear interest at the prime rate plus 2.0% with a floor of 5.50%. We expect to be required to pay IBC (1) a
loan commitment fee of $400,000, with half due at closing and half due six months thereafter, (2) an annual
engineering fee of $10,000, and (3) an underwriting equity fee of 390,290 shares of Common Stock.
●Name Change (see page 57). We agreed that, after the closing of the Acquisition, we will rebrand and
change our name to “Camber Energy, Inc.”
Board Representation (see page 57). The Sellers will have the right pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement to appoint three members to our Board, and it is anticipated that one of their director nominees
●
will be Richard N. Azar II. Mr. Azar is the principal Seller and manager of the properties being acquired, and
is planned to be appointed as Executive Chairman following the closing of the Acquisition. By the sixth
month anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition, one of the three current members of our Board will be
required to resign in order that we will have five members of our Board, including three appointed by the
Sellers, on such date.
●
Fairness Opinion (see page 61). We obtained the opinion of Canaccord Genuity Inc. (“Canaccord”)
providing that in the opinion of Canaccord, the Acquisition is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
Company, prior to the approval of the Asset Purchase Agreement by our Board.
●
Conditions to Closing (see page 58). The Acquisition is subject to customary conditions which must be
satisfied or waived prior to the closing, including (1) approval of the issuance of the Acquisition Shares by
our stockholders, (2) receipt by us of the $4.975 million required to be paid to the Sellers at closing, which
we plan to raise from the Sellers’ debt holders from whom we are required to assume the $31.35 million in
debt; (3) receipt of required regulatory approvals, (4) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the
consummation of the Acquisition, and (5) approval by the NYSE MKT of the continued listing of our
Common Stock on the NYSE MKT prior to and following the closing. Each party’s obligation to complete the
Acquisition is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (a) subject to certain
exceptions, the accuracy of the respective representations and warranties of the other parties, and (b)
performance in all material respects by the other parties of their respective obligations under the Asset
Purchase Agreement.
●
Accounting Treatment (see page 65). The Acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase of assets, so that
the operating revenues and expenses pertaining to the Assets will be included in our consolidated financial
statements following the Acquisition.
11
●
Tax Treatment (see page 65). The transactions contemplated by the Acquisition are intended to constitute a
single transaction for purposes of Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, such that
the Acquisition is expected to be a tax-free transfer for the Sellers.
●
Registration or Exemption of Securities (see page 66). The Acquisition Shares that will be issued to the
Sellers in connection with the Acquisition will be exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and/or Regulation D thereunder.
Board Recommendation (see page 53). Our Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the issuance of
13,009,664 shares of Common Stock to the Sellers, the issuance of 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock to one of the Sellers and its affiliate, and the issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, including shares issuable pursuant to the
dividend provisions of the Series B Preferred Stock, exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock,
to acquire the Assets. Our Board also unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the issuance of 390,290
shares of Common Stock to IBC as a fee to refinance the Sellers’ debt being assumed in the Acquisition and
finance the cash portion of the Acquisition consideration, and a vote “FOR” an amendment to our Articles of
Incorporation to change our name to Camber Energy, Inc.

and Oklahoma, including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich
Mid-Continent region of the United States, and related wells, leases, records, equipment and
agreements associated therewith as well as producing shale properties in Glasscock County, Texas.
The properties currently produce approximately 1,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), of
which 53% are liquids from 114 producing wells. The bulk of the production is from the Hunton
formation holding approximately 43,000 gross acres (9,900 net acres) in central Oklahoma.
Additionally, further, offset development drilling opportunities for at least 40 additional wells have been
identified.

caption “The Parties to the Acquisition—The Sellers.”
Summary of Reasons for the Acquisition
The decision of our Board to enter into the Asset Purchase Agreement was based on a thorough
analysis of the Company’s strengths and weaknesses. This analysis allowed our Board to identify
several potential benefits to us and our stockholders that, if realized, could increase stockholder value.
These reasons for the Acquisition include:
●an increase in our operating revenues;
an increase in our production. The properties being acquired currently produce approximately 1,000 net
barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), of which 53% are liquids from 114 producing wells. The bulk of the
production is from the Hunton formation holding approximately 43,000 gross acres (9,900 net acres) in
central Oklahoma. Further, offset development drilling opportunities for at least 40 additional wells have
already been identified. We believe total proved developed reserves (PDP) are 5.4 million barrels of oil
●
equivalent (MMBOE) comprised of 6% oil, 47% natural gas liquids (NGL) and 47% natural gas;
●obtaining stable, long-lived reserves with substantial current production and ample drilling opportunities
providing growth prospects for us;
    
 ●geographic expansion into the Mid-continent; and
    
 ●rebranding our organization and redirecting our strategic vision.
13
Subject to the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series B Preferred Stock, your rights as a
stockholder will not change following the closing of the Acquisition. In addition, the Sellers and IBC
who become new common stockholders of Lucas Energy will have the same rights as you do (except
for the Seller receiving Series B Preferred Stock). Please refer to the section entitled “Effect upon
Rights of Existing Stockholders” on page 51 of this proxy statement for more detailed information.
To fully understand the proposed Acquisition and the legal terms of the transactions, we urge you to
read the Asset Purchase Agreement carefully. The entire text of the Asset Purchase Agreement is set
forth as Annex A-1 to this proxy statement and the entire text of the form of First Amendment to Asset
Purchase Agreement is set forth as Annex A-2 to this proxy statement.

Looking Statements” in this proxy statement, where we describe additional uncertainties associated
with our business and the forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement.
Risks Relating to the Acquisition
In the event the Asset Purchase Agreement closes, it will cause immediate and substantial dilution to
existing stockholders and will result in a change of control of the Company.
Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and in consideration for the Assets, we agreed to assume
$31.35 million of commercial bank debt; issue 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to one of the
Sellers and its affiliate, which are under common control with the Seller Representative, with a total
liquidation value of $13.8 million; issue 13,009,664 shares of common stock to certain of the Sellers;
and pay $4,975,000 in cash to certain of the Sellers. The Series B Preferred Stock will have a liquidation
preference of $25 per share. The Series B Preferred Stock will be convertible into common stock at a
rate of approximately 7.14:1 (issuable into an aggregate of 3,942,857 shares of common stock if fully
converted), at the option of the holder thereof, and also will be subject to certain automatic conversion
provisions. Each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to one vote per share
on all stockholder matters. As such, in the event the contemplated Acquisition closes, the issuance of
the common stock consideration and Series B Preferred Stock will result in immediate and substantial
dilution to the interests of our then stockholders and result in a change of control of the Company.
17
Additionally, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Sellers will have the right to appoint three
members to our Board of Directors, and it is anticipated that one of their director nominees will be
Richard N. Azar II. Mr. Azar, the principal Seller and manager of the properties, is planned to be
appointed as Executive Chairman following the closing. Mr. Azar is a founding partner of the Seller
Representative, and for over 20 years has been instrumental in developing the Hunton resource play
in Central Oklahoma through his direction of the Seller Representative, ownership in Altex Resources,
Inc., and various other successful oil and gas ventures. Mr. Azar will also be receiving a significant
amount of the shares of common stock issuable upon closing of the Acquisition and all of the Series B
Preferred Stock issuable at closing, either personally or through entities which he controls. By the six
month anniversary of the closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, one of the three current members
of our Board of Directors will be required to resign in order that we will have five members of our Board
of Directors, including three appointed by the Sellers, on such date.
In the event the Asset Purchase Agreement closes, we will be required to assume significant amounts
of debt and our operation and management of the Assets may not be able to generate sufficient cash
flows to meet our debt service obligations, which could reduce our financial flexibility, increase interest
expenses and adversely impact our operations.
As described above, one of the requirements of the closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement is that
we assume $31.35 million of commercial bank debt. Our ability to make payments on such
indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash from the Assets. The Assets may not
generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to repay this indebtedness and to fund
other liquidity needs, including capital expenditure requirements. Such indebtedness could affect our
operations in several ways, including the following:
●a significant portion of our cash flows could be required to be used to service such indebtedness;
 ●a high level of debt could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
 ●any covenants contained in the agreements governing such outstanding indebtedness could limit our ability
to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;
a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less
leveraged and, therefore, our competitors may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our
indebtedness may prevent us from pursuing; and
 ●debt covenants to which we may agree may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in
the economy and in our industry.
●
The indebtedness to be incurred by us in connection with the Acquisition will bear interest at variable
rates, and therefore if interest rates increase, our debt service requirements will increase. In such case,
we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We
may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the assumed indebtedness, on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
A high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may
not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal or interest on our debt. If we cannot
service or refinance our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling significant assets,
seeking additional equity financing (which will result in additional dilution to stockholders) or reducing
or delaying capital expenditures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations
and financial condition. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to arrange
financing, our assets may be foreclosed upon which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
18
The Asset Purchase Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the acquisition.
The Asset Purchase Agreement contains provisions that could adversely impact competing proposals
to acquire us and for us to acquire properties. These provisions include the prohibition on us
generally from soliciting any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction. These
provisions, might discourage a third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant
part of our company from considering or proposing an acquisition, even if that party were prepared to
pay consideration with a higher value than the current proposed acquisition consideration.
Failure to complete the Acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and future business and
financial results.
If the Acquisition is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we would be
subject to a number of risks, including the following:
●
we will not realize the benefits expected from the Acquisition, including a potentially enhanced competitive
and financial position, expansion of assets and therefore opportunities, and will instead be subject to all the
risks we currently face as an independent company;
●
●we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our partners and employees;
 ●we may have to repay the Debenture, and we may not receive the remaining $14.5 million in funding under
our April 2016 private placement;
the Asset Purchase Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the
completion of the Acquisition or the termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Such restrictions may
prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing
business opportunities during the pendency of the Acquisition; and
matters relating to the Acquisition (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of
time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities
that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.
●
We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Acquisition is
pending.
Uncertainty about the effect of the Acquisition on employees and partners may have an adverse effect
on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the
Acquisition is completed, and could cause partners and others that deal with us to seek to change
existing business relationships, cease doing business with us or cause potential new partners to
delay doing business with us until the Acquisition has been successfully completed. Retention of
certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the Acquisition, as certain employees
may experience uncertainty about their future roles or compensation structure. If key employees
depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to
remain with the business, our business following the Acquisition could be negatively impacted. In
addition, the Asset Purchase Agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions and taking other
specified actions until the Acquisition is completed. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing
attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Acquisition.
19
The total number of shares to be issued by us as consideration to the Sellers in the Acquisition, and
the resulting dilution that our current stockholders will experience because of it, will be significant.
Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we have agreed to issue to the Sellers, in the
aggregate, 13,009,664 shares of our Common Stock and 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at
the closing of the Acquisition. Although following the Acquisition, shares held by our current
stockholders will each represent a piece of a larger company, our issuance of the Acquisition Shares
to the Sellers at closing will result in significant dilution to our current stockholders in terms of their
ownership percentages. Immediately after the closing of the Acquisition, we estimate the outstanding
shares held by our current stockholders will represent only 11.8% of our outstanding shares of
Common Stock.
The newly issued shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be convertible into shares of Common Stock
and, when and if converted, will result in additional dilution to our current stockholders.
Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will be convertible, at the option of the holder, into that number
of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price
for the Series B Preferred Stock ($25.00, as may be adjusted for recapitalizations) by the Conversion
Price ($3.50, as may be adjusted for recapitalizations). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will
automatically convert into shares of Common Stock under certain conditions set forth in the
Certificate of Designations of the Series B Preferred Stock. Assuming the conversion of all such
shares as of the closing of the Acquisition, this would result in the issuance of approximately
3,942,857 shares of Common Stock, which is equivalent to approximately 21.1% of our Common Stock
that will be outstanding as of immediately after the closing of the Acquisition.
Concentration of share ownership by our largest stockholders may prevent other stockholders from
influencing significant corporate decisions.
If the Acquisition is completed, certain Sellers will own significant portions of our stock. For example,
RAD2 Minerals, Ltd and its affiliate will beneficially own approximately 37.0% of our outstanding shares
of Common Stock, Coyle Manna Management LLC will beneficially own approximately 12.1% of our
outstanding shares of Common Stock and, collectively, the Sellers will beneficially own approximately
90.7% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, certain Sellers, and the persons and
entities that control such Sellers, will have the ability to exert significant influence over matters
requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, and on the
outcome of corporate actions, including a change of control of the Company, a business combination
involving the Company, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of equity securities and the
payment of dividends on our stock. This concentration of ownership could be disadvantageous to
other stockholders with differing interests from such persons.
The Sellers will have significant control over our Board of Directors following the Acquisition.
Following the Acquisition, the Sellers will have the right to appoint three members to our Board of
Directors, and it is anticipated that one of their director nominees will be Richard N. Azar II. Upon such
appointments, the Sellers will have significant control over our Board of Directors and the decisions
made by our Board of Directors.
Servicing debt could limit funds available for other purposes.
Following the Acquisition, we will use cash from operations to pay the principal and interest on our
consolidated debt. These payments limit funds available for other purposes, including expansion of
our operations through acquisitions and funding future capital expenditures.
20
The Acquisition may go forward even if the Assets experience a material adverse change.
Although we have the right to not consummate the Acquisition if the Assets suffer certain material
adverse changes in financial condition prior to the closing (subject to certain exceptions), we may
elect to proceed with the Acquisition despite such a material adverse change, and can do so without
approval of our stockholders. If the Assets suffer a material adverse change, but we still complete the
Acquisition, neither we nor our stockholders will have the benefit, if any, of the condition waived.
Completion of the Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions and if these conditions are not
satisfied or waived, the Acquisition will not be completed.
The Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including (1) approval by our stockholders
of the issuance of the shares of Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock in connection with the
Acquisition, (2) receipt by us of the $4.975 million required to be paid to the Sellers at closing, which we
plan to raise from the Sellers’ debt holders from whom we are required to assume the $31.35 million in
debt; (3) receipt of required regulatory approvals, (4) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the
consummation of the Acquisition, and (5) approval of the NYSE MKT of the continued listing of our
Common Stock on the NYSE MKT prior to and following the closing. Each party’s obligation to
complete the Acquisition is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (a)
subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other parties,
and (b) performance in all material respects by the other parties of its obligations under the Asset
Purchase Agreement. Failure to fulfill any of such closing conditions could prevent us from
completing the Acquisition and have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Asset Purchase Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both the
Company and the Sellers and, if the Asset Purchase Agreement is terminated prior to closing, such
termination could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Asset Purchase Agreement includes customary termination provisions for both us and the
Sellers, which include, subject to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement and in certain
circumstances rights to cure or other prerequisites, that the Asset Purchase Agreement can be
terminated by us, if (i) any issues arise in connection with our due diligence on the Assets which in
aggregate would constitute a material adverse effect on such Assets (as described in the Asset
Purchase Agreement) and such issues cannot be reasonably cured by the parties; (ii) our
stockholders fail to approve the issuance of the Acquisition Shares at a meeting called for such
purpose; (iii) we fail to obtain all required consents; (iv) we fail to raise the cash necessary to acquire
the Assets; (v) the Sellers fail to provide all required closing deliverables; or (vi) the Sellers breach any
representation or warranty in the Asset Purchase Agreement, subject to the right to cure. The
termination rights of the Sellers include a termination by the Sellers if (i) any issues arise in connection
with the Seller’s due diligence of us which in aggregate would constitute a material adverse effect (as
described in the Asset Purchase Agreement) and such issues cannot be reasonably cured by the
parties; (ii) we have more than 1.8 million shares of Common Stock outstanding at closing, or the
Sellers would own less than 80% of each class of our outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis, at
closing; (iii) our stockholders fail to approve the items required to be approved for closing; (iv) we fail
to maintain our listing on the NYSE MKT prior to and following closing; (v) we fail to assume the $31.35
million in debt required to be assumed at closing; (vi) we fail to provide all required closing
deliverables; (vii) we breach any representation or warranty in the Asset Purchase Agreement, subject
to the right to cure; or (viii) our Board withdraws its recommendation for the stockholders to approve
the issuance of the Acquisition Shares because we have been presented with a superior acquisition
proposal. The Asset Purchase Agreement can also be terminated by either party with five days prior
written notice if the Acquisition has not been completed by September 30, 2016, provided that such
failure is not the result of the breach of the agreement by the terminating party. As a result of the
above, the Asset Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us or the Sellers prior to closing.
21
Termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement could negatively impact us.
In the event the Asset Purchase Agreement is terminated, our business may have been adversely
impacted by our failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on
the Acquisition, and the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current
market price reflects a market assumption that the Acquisition will be completed. If the Asset Purchase
Agreement is terminated and our Board of Directors seeks another acquisition or business
combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer
equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration provided for by the acquisition.
Misrepresentations made to us by the Sellers regarding the Assets could cause us to incur substantial
financial obligations and harm our business.
If we were to discover that there were misrepresentations made to us by the Sellers or their
representatives regarding the Assets, we would explore all possible legal remedies to compensate us
for any loss, including our rights to indemnification under the Asset Purchase Agreement. However,
there is no assurance that legal remedies would be available or collectible. If such unknown liabilities
exist and we are not fully indemnified for any loss that we incur as a result thereof, we could incur
substantial financial obligations, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and
harm our business.
If we are not able to integrate the Assets into our operations in a timely manner, the anticipated
benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized in a timely fashion, or at all, and our existing
businesses may be materially adversely affected.
The success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the growth opportunities
and synergies of combining the Assets with ours and our ability to effectively utilize the additional
resources we will have following the Acquisition. The integration of the Assets may involve unforeseen
difficulties. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and
employees and increase our expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and operating results.
The Acquisition will result in significant costs to us, whether or not it is completed, which could result
in a reduction in our income and cash flows.
We will be required to pay our costs related to the Acquisition even if the Acquisition is not completed,
such as amounts payable to legal and financial advisors and independent accountants, and such
costs will be significant. All of these costs will be incurred whether or not the Acquisition is completed.
Because the valuation of the Assets is based in part on certain financial projections about future
results, and projections are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, the Sellers may receive
Acquisition consideration that is greater than the fair market value of the Assets.
The Sellers provided financial projections to us in connection with the determination of the
consideration to be paid for the Assets, and we, our Board and our financial advisor relied in part on
the Sellers’ projections for purposes of valuing the Assets and agreeing on the purchase price set
forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Our valuation is not necessarily indicative of the actual value
of the Assets. Accordingly, if actual financial results in the future are lower than the projections we
relied upon, the Acquisition consideration may be greater than the fair market value of the Assets.
22
The financial projections we relied upon may not be accurate and may not be met in the future
because the projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other
matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Sellers’ and our control.
As a result, actual results may differ materially from these projections. It is expected that there will be
differences between actual and projected results because the projections cover multiple years and
such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year.
If the benefits of the Acquisition do not meet the expectations of the marketplace, or financial or
industry analysts, the market price of our Common Stock may decline.
The market price of our Common Stock may decline as a result of the Acquisition if the Assets do not
perform as expected, or we do not otherwise achieve the perceived benefits of the Acquisition as
rapidly as, or to the extent, anticipated by the marketplace, or financial or industry analysts.
Accordingly, investors may experience a loss as a result of a decreasing stock price and we may not
be able to raise future capital, if necessary, in the equity markets.
Transaction-related accounting impairment and amortization charges may delay and reduce our
profitability.
Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Assets and assumed liabilities of the Sellers will
be recorded on our books post-Acquisition at their fair values at the date the Acquisition is completed.
Any excess of the value of the consideration paid by us at the date the Acquisition is completed over
the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets of the Sellers will be treated as excess of
purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Under current accounting standards, to the
extent applicable, intangible assets, other than goodwill, will be amortized to expense over their
estimated useful lives, which will affect our post-Acquisition profitability over several years beginning
in the period in which the Acquisition is completed. The Assets will be tested at a minimum on an
annual basis for impairment, which may result in additional accounting impairment charges.
Any weakness in internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could
result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and lead to a stock price decline.
We are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and report the results in our annual report on Form 10-K. We are also
required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. After the Acquisition, our internal
controls and our disclosure controls and procedures will need to expand to encompass activities
related to the Assets. If material weaknesses arise as a result and they are not remedied, we will be
unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. Any failure to have effective internal control
over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures covering the combined business post-
Acquisition could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our
financial reports, limit our ability to raise financing or lead to regulatory sanctions, any of which could
result in a material adverse effect on our business or decline in the market price of our Common Stock
post-Acquisition.
23
The loss of key executives could adversely affect our operations up to and following the closing of the
Acquisition.
The success of the Acquisition will be dependent upon the continued service of a relatively small
group of our key executives. Following the closing of the Acquisition, we expect that our existing
executives will remain with us and Mr. Azar, the principal Seller, is planned to be appointed as
Executive Chairman of our Board. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these
executives or members of our Board could adversely affect our ability to manage the business going
forward and to manage our operations following the closing of the Acquisition.
Risks Relating to Our Operations and Industry
We require financing to execute our business plan and fund capital program requirements.
Our anticipated cash flow from operations, possible proceeds from sales of properties and funding
provided by leveraging our capital structure, may not be sufficient to meet our working capital and
operating needs for approximately the next twelve months. Additionally, in order to continue growth
and to fund our business and expansion plans, we will require additional financing. Moving forward,
we hope to pursue third party capital in the form of debt (subordinated to IBC), equity or some
combination of the two for certain funding requirements. We may be unsuccessful in obtaining
additional financing on attractive terms, if at all. We currently require approximately $2.0 million of
additional funding within the next few months related to the closing and finance costs associated with
the transactions contemplated by and requirements set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, Stock
Purchase Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement, and additional funding of approximately
$0.5 million for additional drilling and workover activities on existing properties.
Due to our need for immediate funding, in the event we do not receive the full amount of the proceeds
expected under the Securities Purchase Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement entered into in
April 2016 due to the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to receive such proceeds, we may be
forced to raise capital through the sale of debt (subordinated to IBC) or equity in the near term. In order
to issue additional securities, we must, subject to certain exceptions, obtain the consent of the
investor in our April 2016 financing. If we are unable to obtain the consent of this investor in
connection with future financings, we may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or
at all. If external financing sources are not available in a timely manner or at all, or are inadequate to
fund our operations, it could materially harm our financial condition and results of operation.
Additionally, we may not have the time or resources available to seek stockholder approval (if required
pursuant to applicable NYSE MKT rules and requirements) for such transactions which may result in
the issuance of more than 20% of our outstanding common stock. As such, we may instead rely on an
exemption from the NYSE MKT stockholder approval rules which allows an NYSE MKT listed company
an exemption from such rules when a delay in securing stockholder approval would seriously
jeopardize the financial viability of the company. Consequently, our stockholders may not be offered
the ability to approve transactions we may undertake in the future, including those transactions which
would ordinarily require stockholder approval under applicable NYSE MKT rules and regulations,
and/or those transactions which would result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.
24
We require significant additional financing to continue as a going concern and pay outstanding
liabilities and our lack of available funding raises questions regarding our ability to continue as a
going concern.
Due to the nature of oil and gas interests, i.e., that rates of production generally decline over time as oil
and gas reserves are depleted, if we are unable to drill additional wells and develop our proved
undeveloped reserves (PUDs), either because we are unable to raise sufficient funding for such
development activities, or otherwise, or in the event we are unable to acquire additional operating
properties; we believe that our revenues will continue to decline over time. Furthermore, in the event
we are unable to raise additional funding in the future, we will not be able to participate with Earthstone
Energy, Inc. in the drilling of planned additional wells, will not be able to complete other drilling and/or
workover activities, and may not be able to make required payments on our outstanding liabilities,
including amounts owed on the Letter Loan Agreement with Louise H. Rogers (as amended and
modified to date, the “Rogers Loan”). Therefore, in the event we do not raise additional funding in the
future we will be forced to scale back our business plan, sell or liquidate assets to satisfy outstanding
debts and/or take other steps which may include seeking bankruptcy protection.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next
twelve months. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern. The financial statements incorporated by reference herein also
include a going concern footnote from our auditors.
Additionally, due to our need for immediate funding, in the event we do not receive the full amount of
the proceeds expected under the Securities Purchase Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement
entered into in April 2016 due to the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to receive such proceeds,
we may be forced to raise capital through the sale of debt (subordinated to IBC) or equity in the near
term. In order to issue additional securities, we must, subject to certain exceptions, obtain the consent
of the investor in our April 2016 financing. If we are unable to obtain the consent of this investor in
connection with future financings, we may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or
at all. If external financing sources are not available in a timely manner or at all, or are inadequate to
fund our operations, it could materially harm our financial condition and results of operation. We may
not have the time or resources available to seek stockholder approval (if required pursuant to
applicable NYSE MKT rules and requirements) for such transactions which may result in the issuance
of more than 20% of our outstanding common stock. As such, we may instead rely on an exemption
from the NYSE MKT stockholder approval rules which allows an NYSE MKT listed company an
exemption from such rules when a delay in securing stockholder approval would seriously jeopardize
the financial viability of the company. Consequently, our stockholders may not be offered the ability to
approve transactions we may undertake in the future, including those transactions which would
ordinarily require stockholder approval under applicable NYSE MKT rules and regulations, and/or
those transactions which would result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.
In the event we are unable to raise funding in the future or complete a business combination or similar
transaction in the near term, we will not be able to pay our liabilities. In the event we are unable to raise
adequate funding in the future for our operations and to pay our outstanding debt obligations or in the
event we fail to enter into a business combination or similar transaction, we would be forced to
liquidate our assets (or our creditors may undertake a foreclosure of such assets in order to satisfy
amounts we owe to such creditors) or may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection, which could result
in the value of our outstanding securities declining in value or becoming worthless.
25
We are subject to production declines and loss of revenue due to shut-in wells.
The majority of our production revenues come from a small number of producing wells. In the event
those wells are required to be shut-in (as they were for various periods in the past), our production and
revenue could be adversely effected. Our wells are shut-in from time-to-time for maintenance,
workovers, upgrades and other matters outside of our control, including repairs, adverse weather
(including hurricanes, flooding and tropical storms), inability to dispose of produced water or other
regulatory and market conditions. Any significant period where our wells, and especially our top
producing wells, are shut-in, would have a material adverse effect on our results of production,
revenues and net income or loss for the applicable period.
Many of our leases are in areas that have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells.
Many of our leases are in areas that have been partially depleted or drained by offset drilling.
Interference from offset drilling may inhibit our ability to find or recover commercial quantities of oil
and/or may result in an acceleration in the decline in production of our wells, which may in turn have
an adverse effect on our recovered barrels of oil and consequently our results of operations.
Crude oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile in general and low prices will negatively affect our
financial results.
Our revenues, operating results, profitability, cash flow, future rate of growth and ability to borrow
funds or obtain additional capital, as well as the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties,
are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas. Lower crude oil and
natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce
economically. Historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been very volatile, and such
markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely
in response to a variety of factors beyond our control, such as:
●overall U.S. and global economic conditions;
 ●weather conditions and natural disasters;
 ●seasonal variations in oil and natural gas prices;
 ●price and availability of alternative fuels;
 ●technological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;
 ●consumer demand;
 ●domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;
 ●variations in levels of production;
 ●regional price differentials and quality differentials of oil and natural gas; price and quantity of foreign
imports of oil, NGLs and natural gas;
 ●the completion of large domestic or international exploration and production projects;
 ●restrictions on exportation of our oil and natural gas;
 ●the availability of refining capacity;
 ●the impact of energy conservation efforts;
 ●political conditions in or affecting other oil producing and natural gas producing countries, including the
current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America and Russia; and
 ●domestic and foreign governmental regulations, actions and taxes.
Further, oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other. Our
revenue, profitability, and cash flow depend upon the prices of supply and demand for oil and natural
gas, and a drop in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. In
particular, declines in commodity prices may:
26
●negatively impact the value of our reserves, because declines in oil and natural gas prices would reduce the
value and amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;
 ●reduce the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness, and other
corporate purposes; and
 ●limit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital.
We may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business
plan in a timely fashion.
Because of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plans, if achieved, will place a
significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. If we expand our
activities, development and production, and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in
which we participate, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical and management
resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial
control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the inability to
recruit and retain experienced managers, geoscientists, petroleum engineers and landmen could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability
to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.
We face intense competition.
We are in direct competition for properties with numerous oil and natural gas companies, drilling and
income programs and partnerships exploring various areas of Texas and will face competition for
properties in Oklahoma in the event the Acquisition closes. Many competitors are large, well-known
energy companies, although no single entity dominates the industry. Many of our competitors
possess greater financial and personnel resources enabling them to identify and acquire more
economically desirable energy producing properties and drilling prospects than us. Additionally, there
is competition from other fuel choices to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry.
Management believes that a viable marketplace exists for smaller producers of natural gas and crude
oil.
Our competitors may use superior technology and data resources that we may be unable to afford or
that would require a costly investment by us in order to compete with them more effectively.
Our industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the
introduction of new products and services using new technologies and databases. As our competitors
use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive
pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, many of our
competitors will have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy
technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we
can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost
that is acceptable to us. One or more of the technologies that we will use or that we may implement in
the future may become obsolete, and we may be adversely affected.
27
Our wholly-owned subsidiary currently owes significant funds under an outstanding promissory note,
the repayment of which is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our
subsidiary’s assets.
Effective on August 13, 2013, we entered into the Rogers Loan, as described in greater detail under
“Note 6 – Notes Payable” to our consolidated financial statements included in “Part II – Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary data”, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed July 13, 2016,
which is incorporated herein by reference. The maturity date of the Rogers Loan is currently October
31, 2016. We have also (i) transferred all of our oil and gas interests and equipment existing as of
December 16, 2015 (the “CATI Properties”) to our wholly-owned Texas subsidiary, CATI; (ii) clarified
that following the transfer, Louise H. Rogers (“Rogers”) has no right to foreclose upon us (at the
Nevada corporate parent level) upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Rogers Loan, and
that instead Rogers can only take action against CATI and the CATI Properties; and (iii) required
Rogers to release all UCC and other security filings on us (provided that Rogers is allowed to file the
same filings on CATI and its assets). Finally, we have entered into an Assignment, Novation, and
Assumption Agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”). Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, we
assigned our obligations under the Rogers Loan and related loan documents, to CATI, as if CATI had
originally been a party thereto, CATI agreed to assume such obligations and to take whatever actions
requested by Rogers in order for Rogers to secure the amounts owed under the Rogers Note, and
Rogers agreed to release us (at the parent company level) from any obligations under the Rogers
Loan and related loan documents, other than under the amendment above. Notwithstanding the
above, we do not have sufficient funds to repay the Rogers Loan. In the event of the default in the
payment when due of the amounts owed under the Rogers Loan, as amended, Rogers may seek to
secure her interest pursuant to the aforementioned security rights in CATI and the CATI Properties. If
CATI is in default of the Rogers Loan, Rogers can take certain actions under the Rogers Loan,
including demanding immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding or initiating foreclosure
proceedings against CATI and the CATI Properties. As the Rogers Loan is secured by substantially all
of the CATI Properties, Rogers (or where applicable, her agent) can foreclose on the CATI Properties
which would cause us to significantly curtail or cease operations. Because our ownership interest in
CATI currently constitutes significantly all of our assets, a foreclosure on the CATI Properties could
cause the value of our securities to decline or become worthless. Additionally, as a result of the above,
CATI may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.
The future occurrence or continuance of an event of default under the Rogers Loan or the acceleration
of amounts owed thereunder could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.
The Rogers Loan and note issued in connection therewith include standard and customary events of
default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, Rogers may declare the entire unpaid balance (as
well as any interest, fees and expenses) immediately due and payable. Funding to repay such
amounts, if required by Rogers, may not be available timely, on favorable terms, if at all, and if Rogers
were to require immediate repayment of the amounts owed, it would likely have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.
We may not timely receive funds under the April 2016 Securities Purchase Agreement and Stock
Purchase Agreement and/or may not receive such funds at all.
Pursuant to our April 2016 Securities Purchase Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement, we may
not receive up to $14.5 million in proceeds if the Acquisition does not close, stockholder approval of
Proposals Three and Four in this proxy statement is not obtained, certain equity conditions are not
met, or there is not an effective registration statement covering the common stock underlying the
securities issued or to be issued to the Investor. In the event that we do not timely receive funds under
the April 2016 Securities Purchase Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement, and/or we do not
receive such funds at all, it will have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liabilities and
could force us to curtail our operations or seek bankruptcy protection, which could result in the value
of our securities declining in value or becoming worthless.
28
We have various outstanding Convertible Promissory Notes which are convertible into shares of our
common stock at a discount to our current market price.
Through the Record Date we have issued or agreed to issue $3,000,000 in Convertible Promissory
Notes. The Convertible Promissory Notes are due and payable on various dates between October 1,
2016, and April 26, 2017. The Convertible Promissory Notes accrue interest at the rate of 6% per
annum (15% upon the occurrence of an event of default), and allow the holders thereof the right to
convert the principal and interest due thereunder into our common stock at a conversion price of
$1.50 per share or $3.25 per share, as applicable, provided that any conversion is subject to us first
receiving approval for the issuance of shares of our common stock under the Convertible Promissory
Notes under applicable NYSE MKT rules and regulations (“NYSE Approval”). Each conversion is also
subject to a per holder 9.99% ownership limitation upon conversion. We have the right to prepay the
Convertible Promissory Notes. The Convertible Promissory Notes include customary events of default
for facilities of similar nature and size. Upon the conversion of the Convertible Promissory Notes
(which are each limited to 19.9% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock on the date each
transaction was entered into, prior to shareholder approval for such issuances), the notes will be
convertible into a significant number of shares of our common stock at $1.50 per share or $3.25 per
share, as applicable, which is a discount to the trading price of our common stock as of the Record
Date. As a result, any conversion of the Convertible Promissory Notes and sale of shares of common
stock issuable in connection with the conversion thereof will likely cause the value of our common
stock, if any, to decline in value, as described in greater detail under the Risk Factors below.
The issuance and sale of common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Promissory Notes, the
Debenture and, if the proposals in this proxy statement are approved by stockholders, the other
convertible securities to be issued, may depress the market price of our common stock.
If there are sequential conversions of the Convertible Promissory Notes, the Debenture and, if the
proposals in this proxy statement are approved by stockholders, the other convertible securities to be
issued, and sales of such converted shares take place, the price of our common stock may decline.
The shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of these securities may be sold without
restriction after the applicable holding period under Rule 144 has elapsed. In addition, we have agreed
to file resale registration statements for the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Debenture and related warrant, Series C Preferred Stock and related warrant, and certain of the
Convertible Promissory Notes and related warrants subject to certain conditions, which will make
those shares freely tradable when the registration statements become effective. As a result, the sale of
these shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
In addition, the common stock issuable upon conversion of these convertible securities may represent
overhang that may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs
when there is a greater supply of a company’s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock.
When this happens the price of the company’s stock will decrease, and any additional shares which
shareholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. The Convertible
Promissory Notes are currently convertible into shares of our common stock at a discount to the
current market price of our common stock as described above, and such discount to market provides
the holders with the ability to sell their common stock at or below market and still make a profit. In the
event of such overhang, the note holders will have an incentive to sell their common stock as quickly
as possible. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb the discounted shares, then the
value of our common stock will likely decrease.
29
The issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and other convertible
securities will cause immediate and substantial dilution.
The issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and other convertible
securities will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders.
Restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our
ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.
Oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or
permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions
may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield
equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when
drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our
operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to
protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of
expensive mitigation measures. Specifically, applicable laws protecting endangered species prohibit
the harming of endangered or threatened species, provide for habitat protection, and impose stringent
penalties for noncompliance. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or
endangered in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species
protection measures or could result in limitations, delays, or prohibitions on our exploration and
production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our
reserves.
The derivatives legislation adopted by Congress, and implementation of that legislation by federal
agencies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.
On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, sets forth the new framework for
regulating certain derivative products including the commodity hedges of the type that we may elect to
use, but many aspects of this law are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several
years. As a result, it is difficult to anticipate the overall impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our ability or
willingness to enter into and maintain such commodity hedges and the terms of such hedges. There is
a possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act could have a substantial and adverse impact on our ability to
enter into and maintain these commodity hedges. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act could result in the
implementation of position limits and additional regulatory requirements on derivative arrangements,
which could include new margin, reporting and clearing requirements. In addition, this legislation
could have a substantial impact on our counterparties and may increase the cost of our derivative
arrangements in the future. If these types of commodity hedges become unavailable or uneconomic,
our commodity price risk could increase, which would increase the volatility of revenues and may
decrease the amount of credit available to us. Any limitations or changes in our use of derivative
arrangements could also materially affect our future ability to conduct acquisitions.
30
If we do not hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices, we may be subject to
significant reductions in prices. Alternatively, we may use oil and natural gas price hedging contracts,
which involve credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant
fluctuations in our profitability.
In the event that we choose not to hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices by
purchasing futures and by using other hedging strategies, we may be subject to significant reduction
in prices which could have a material negative impact on our profitability. Alternatively, we may elect to
use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve
more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging
transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use also may limit future revenues from
price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to
satisfy its obligations.
Our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to
obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.
Water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling
and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking processes. Our operations in West Texas and future operations in
other areas could be adversely impacted if we are unable to locate sufficient amounts of water, or
dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations. Currently, the quantity
of water required in certain completion operations, such as hydraulic fracturing, and changing
regulations governing usage may lead to water constraints and supply concerns (particularly in some
parts of the country). As a result, future availability of water from certain sources used in the past may
be limited. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and conditions could include
restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of
waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the
exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. The federal Clean Water Act, or CWA
and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants,
including produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste, into navigable waters or other
regulated federal and state waters. Permits or other approvals must be obtained to discharge
pollutants to regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in such waters and wetlands.
Uncertainty regarding regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands and other regulated waters has, and will
continue to, complicate and increase the cost of obtaining such permits or other approvals. The CWA
and analogous state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized
discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other
hazardous substances. Many state discharge regulations, and the Federal National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System General permits issued by the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced
water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and natural
gas industry into coastal waters. While generally exempt under federal programs, many state agencies
have also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production
facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. In October 2011, the EPA announced its
intention to develop federal pretreatment standards for wastewater discharges associated with
hydraulic fracturing activities. If adopted, the pretreatment rules will require coalbed methane and
shale gas operations to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to treatment facilities Some states
have banned the treatment of fracturing wastewater at publicly owned treatment facilities. There has
been recent nationwide concern over earthquakes associated with Class II underground injection
control wells, a predominant storage method for crude oil and gas wastewater. It is likely that new rules
and regulations will be developed to address these concerns, possibly eliminating access to Class II
wells in certain locations, and increasing the cost of disposal in others. Finally, the EPA study noted
above has focused and will continue to focus on various stages of water use in hydraulic fracturing
operations. It is possible that, following the conclusion of the EPA’s study, the agency will move to
more strictly regulate the use of water in hydraulic fracturing operations. While we cannot predict the
impact that these changes may have on our business at this time, they may be material to our
business, financial condition, and operations. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit
requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary
for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal or recycling of water will increase our operating costs
and may cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be
predicted. In addition, our inability to meet our water supply needs to conduct our completion
operations may impact our business, and any such future laws and regulations could negatively affect
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
31
If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties in the future, our failure to fully identify existing and
potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively
integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
From time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties. Although we perform
reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with
industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential
problems, and may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully
assess their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we may
assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant
to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further below), actual future production
rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and
costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. We may be unable to locate or
make suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms and future acquisitions may not be effectively and
profitably integrated. Acquisitions involve risks that could divert management resources and/or result
in the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired operations. For the reasons
above, among others, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and
results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties
are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the
acquired properties into our ongoing operations.
If we make any acquisitions or enter into any business combinations in the future, they may disrupt or
have a negative impact on our business.
If we make acquisitions or enter into any business combinations in the future, funding permitting, we
could have difficulty integrating the acquired companies’ assets, personnel and operations with our
own. Additionally, acquisitions, mergers or business combinations we may enter into in the future
could result in a change of control of the Company, and a change in the Board of Directors or officers
of the Company. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for
us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we
are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination, the negotiations could
disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In
addition to the risks described above, acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a
number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:
●the difficulty of integrating acquired companies, concepts and operations;
 ●the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management
of acquired companies;
 ●difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;
 ●the potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new
management personnel;
 ●the potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees;
 ●our ability to successfully manage the companies and/or concepts acquired;
 ●the failure to realize efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; or
 ●the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired.
Our business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in
addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or
business combination, many of which cannot be presently identified. These risks and problems could
disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and
adversely affect our results of operations.
32
Any acquisition or business combination transaction we enter into in the future could cause
substantial dilution to existing stockholders, result in one party having majority or significant control
over the Company or result in a change in business focus of the Company.
We depend significantly upon the continued involvement of our present management.
We depend to a significant degree upon the involvement of our management, specifically, our Chief
Executive Officer and director, Anthony C. Schnur, who is in charge of our strategic planning and
operations. Our performance and success are dependent to a large extent on the efforts and
continued employment of Mr. Schnur. We do not believe that Mr. Schnur could be quickly replaced
with personnel of equal experience and capabilities, and his successor(s) may not be as effective. If
Mr. Schnur or any of our other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present
roles and if they are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be adversely affected.
We have an active Board of Directors that meets several times throughout the year and is intimately
involved in our business and the determination of our operational strategies. Members of our Board of
Directors work closely with management to identify potential prospects, acquisitions and areas for
further development. If any of our directors resign or become unable to continue in their present role, it
may be difficult to find replacements with the same knowledge and experience and as a result, our
operations may be adversely affected.
Certain of our undeveloped leasehold assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several
years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.
Leases on natural gas and oil properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they
expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities
is established. If our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to
develop the related properties. Although we seek to actively manage our undeveloped properties, our
drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling
results, natural gas and oil prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs,
availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation
constraints and regulatory approvals.
Our business is subject to extensive regulation.
As many of our activities are subject to federal, state and local regulation, and as these rules are
subject to constant change or amendment, our operations may be adversely affected by new or
different government regulations, laws or court decisions applicable to our operations.
33
Government regulation and liability for environmental matters may adversely affect our business and
results of operations.
Crude oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government
regulations, which may be changed from time to time. Matters subject to regulation include discharge
permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells,
unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have
imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil and
natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of crude oil and
natural gas. There are federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of
human health and the environment applicable to the development, production, handling, storage,
transportation and disposal of crude oil and natural gas, byproducts thereof and other substances
and materials produced or used in connection with crude oil and natural gas operations. In addition,
we may inherit liability for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we
purchase or lease. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental
entities. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations could have a
material adverse effect on us.
Future increases in our tax obligations; either due to increases in taxes on energy products, energy
service companies and exploration activities or reductions in currently available federal income tax
deductions with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, may adversely affect our
results of operations and increase our operating expenses.
Federal, state and local governments have jurisdiction in areas where we operate and impose taxes on
the oil and natural gas products we sell. There are constant discussions by federal, state and local
officials concerning a variety of energy tax proposals, some of which, if passed, would add or increase
taxes on energy products, service companies and exploration activities. Additionally, the current
administration has proposed legislation which would make significant changes to federal tax laws,
including the elimination of certain key United States federal income tax incentives currently available
to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These proposed changes include, but
are not limited to: (1) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas
properties, (2) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (3)
the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (4) an extension of the
amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any
such changes will be enacted into law or how soon any such changes could become effective in the
event they were enacted into law. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any
other changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could impact or increase the taxes that we are required
to pay and consequently adversely affect our results of operations and/or increase our operating
expenses.
The crude oil and natural gas reserves we report in our SEC filings are estimates and may prove to be
inaccurate.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their
estimated values. The reserves we report in our filings with the SEC now and in the future will only be
estimates and such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because of these uncertainties. Reservoir
engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil
and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable
crude oil and natural gas reserves depend upon a number of variable factors, such as historical
production from the area compared with production from other producing areas and assumptions
concerning effects of regulations by governmental agencies, future crude oil and natural gas prices,
future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and work-over and remedial
costs. Some or all of these assumptions may in fact vary considerably from actual results. For these
reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable
to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery, and
estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom prepared by different engineers or by the
same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserve estimates may be
subject to downward or upward adjustment. Actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect
to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and such variances may be material.
34
Additionally, “probable” and “possible reserve estimates” are considered unproved reserves and as
such, the SEC views such estimates to be inherently unreliable, may be misunderstood or seen as
misleading to investors that are not “experts” in the oil or natural gas industry. Unless you have such
expertise, you should not place undue reliance on these estimates. Except as required by applicable
law, we undertake no duty to update this information and do not intend to update this information.
The calculated present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be
the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.
You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows as included in our public filings
is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. We generally base the
estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on current costs held constant over
time without escalation and on commodity prices using an unweighted arithmetic average of first-day-
of-the-month index prices, appropriately adjusted, for the 12-month period immediately preceding the
date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices
and costs used for these estimates and will be affected by factors such as:
●actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;
 ●actual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;
 ●the amount and timing of actual production; and
 ●changes in governmental regulations or taxation.
In addition, the 10% discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net
revenues for reporting purposes under GAAP is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor
based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the
oil and natural gas industry in general.
Crude oil and natural gas development, re-completion of wells from one reservoir to another reservoir,
restoring wells to production and exploration, drilling and completing new wells are speculative
activities and involve numerous risks and substantial and uncertain costs.
Our growth will be materially dependent upon the success of our future development program. Even
considering our business philosophy to avoid wildcat wells, drilling for crude oil and natural gas and
reworking existing wells involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive
crude oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of exploration, drilling, completing
and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or
cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: unexpected drilling
conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; inability to obtain
leases on economic terms, where applicable; adverse weather conditions and natural disasters;
compliance with governmental requirements; and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs
or crews and the delivery of equipment. Furthermore, we cannot provide investors with any assurance
that we will be able to obtain rights to additional producing properties in the future and/or that any
properties we obtain rights to will contain commercially exploitable quantities of oil and/or gas.
35
Drilling or reworking is a highly speculative activity. Even when fully and correctly utilized, modern well
completion techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling do not guarantee that we
will find crude oil and/or natural gas in our wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a fluid with or
without particulates into a formation at high pressure, thereby creating fractures in the rock and
leaving the particulates in the fractures to ensure that the fractures remain open, thereby potentially
increasing the ability of the reservoir to produce oil or natural gas. Horizontal drilling involves drilling
horizontally out from an existing vertical well bore, thereby potentially increasing the area and reach of
the well bore that is in contact with the reservoir. Our future drilling activities may not be successful
and, if unsuccessful, such failure would have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and
financial condition. Our overall drilling success rate and/or our drilling success rate for activities within
a particular geographic area may decline in the future. We may identify and develop prospects through
a number of methods, some of which do not include lateral drilling or hydraulic fracturing, and some of
which may be unproven. The drilling and results for these prospects may be particularly uncertain. Our
drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. The final determination with respect to the drilling
of any scheduled or budgeted prospects will be dependent on a number of factors, including, but not
limited to: the results of previous development efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of data;
the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants, if any, for the drilling of
the prospects; the approval of the prospects by other participants, if any, after additional data has
been compiled; economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and
anticipated prices for crude oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs and crews; our
financial resources and results; the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the
prospects; and the success of our drilling technology.
These projects may not be successfully developed and the wells discussed, if drilled, may not
encounter reservoirs of commercially productive crude oil or natural gas. There are numerous
uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control. If
we are unable to find commercially exploitable quantities of oil and natural gas in any properties we
may acquire in the future, and/or we are unable to commercially extract such quantities we may find in
any properties we may acquire in the future, the value of our securities may decline in value.
Recent commodity price declines have resulted in impairment of our oil and gas properties, and future
natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amount of our
assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
The value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and oil. Declines in these prices as well as
increases in development costs, changes in well performance, delays in asset development or
deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our
estimated proved reserves, and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding write-down
of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties. For example, in March 2016, we recorded
an impairment of approximately $21.4 million associated with oil and gas properties in certain non-core
fields in south Texas. The impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity
prices during the 2016 fiscal year.
We evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment using the full cost method whereby the carrying
value of property and equipment is compared to the “estimated present value” of its proved reserves
discounted at a 10-percent interest rate of future net revenues, based on current economic and
operating conditions at the end of the period, plus the cost of properties not being amortized, plus the
lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties included in costs being amortized, less the
income tax effects related to book and tax basis differences. In the event that commodity prices
decline further, there could be a significant revision in the future.
Because of the inherent dangers involved in oil and gas exploration, there is a risk that we may incur
liability or damages as we conduct our business operations, which could force us to expend a
substantial amount of money in connection with litigation and/or a settlement.
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks such as well
blowouts, pipe failures, casing collapse, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well
fluids, fires, spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These
hazards and risks could result in substantial losses to us from, among other things, injury or loss of
life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other
environmental damage, cleanup responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and
suspension of operations. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damages caused by
previous owners of property purchased and leased by us in the future. As a result, substantial
liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could reduce
or eliminate the funds available for the purchase of properties and/or property interests, exploration,
development or acquisitions or result in the loss of our properties and/or force us to expend
substantial monies in connection with litigation or settlements. As such, our current insurance or the
insurance that we obtain in the future may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. We cannot
predict the availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify our
purchase. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could
materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations. We may elect to self-insure if
management believes that the cost of insurance, although available, is excessive relative to the risks
presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The
occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations, which could lead to any investment in us declining in
value or becoming worthless.
36
Unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which
would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The rate of production from our oil and natural gas properties will decline as our reserves are depleted.
Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our income and cash flow, are
highly dependent on our success in (a) efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves on
properties owned by us or by other persons or entities and (b) economically finding or acquiring
additional oil and natural gas properties. In the future, we may have difficulty acquiring new properties.
During periods of low oil and/or natural gas prices, it will become more difficult to raise the capital
necessary to finance expansion activities. If we are unable to replace our production, our reserves will
decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies and
personnel, including hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel, could adversely affect our ability
to establish and execute exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies or personnel
could delay or adversely affect our operations. When drilling activity in the United States increases,
associated costs typically also increase, including those costs related to drilling rigs, equipment,
supplies and personnel and the services and products of other vendors to the industry. These costs
may increase, and necessary equipment and services may become unavailable to us at economical
prices. Should this increase in costs occur, we may delay drilling activities, which may limit our ability
to establish and replace reserves, or we may incur these higher costs, which may negatively affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
We incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to
environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future.
Our exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state
and local levels and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory
authorities based on environmental or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will
continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, safety and
other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment in the oil and natural gas industry could change
in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in
turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Specifically, as an owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject
to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and
the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us
for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages
and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Moreover, we are subject to the
United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency’s (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could lead to
increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition.
We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on
GHG emissions and climate change issues. In addition to the U.S. EPA’s rule requiring annual
reporting of GHG emissions, we are also aware of legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers to reduce
GHG emissions.
37
Additionally, there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level,
including possible regulations limiting the ability to dispose of produced waters. Currently, the
regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other
compliance requirements. Any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing
could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements (such as the reporting and public
disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process) and in additional operating
restrictions. In addition to the possible federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, some states and local
governments have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and
completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells, testing of
nearby water wells, restrictions on the access to and usage of water and restrictions on the type of
chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Such federal and state
permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to
operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or
effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be
economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing.
We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the
areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where
necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future
laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if
enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in
increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.
Hydraulic fracturing is a common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from
tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into
rock formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. There has been increasing
public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the transportation and use of
fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of waters, and the potential for impacts to
surface water, groundwater, air quality and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and
enforcement actions have been initiated implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. Additional
legislation or regulation could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing, cause operational
delays, increase our operating costs or make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic
fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. New legislation or regulations in the future could have
the effect of prohibiting the use of hydraulic fracturing, which would prevent us from completing our
wells as planned and would have a material adverse effect on production from our wells. If these
legislative and regulatory initiatives cause a material delay or decrease in our drilling or hydraulic
fracturing activities, our business and profitability could be materially impacted.
38
Possible regulation related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our
operations and demand for oil and gas.
Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to
warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have begun adopting
domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the
emission of greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a
by-product of the burning of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered
greenhouse gases. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through
multi-state regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional
greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or have begun considering adopting greenhouse gas
regulatory programs. At the federal level, Congress has considered legislation that could establish a
cap and trade system for restricting greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. The ultimate
outcome of this federal legislative initiative remains uncertain. In addition to pending climate
legislation, the EPA has issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations. Beyond
measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an “Endangerment Finding” under section 202(a) of the
Clean Air Act, concluding that greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of
current and future generations. The finding served as a first step to issuing regulations that require
permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. Moreover, the EPA has
begun regulating greenhouse gas emission from certain facilities pursuant to the Prevention of
Significant Deterioration and Title V provisions of the Clean Air Act. In the courts, several decisions
have been issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by government entities and private
parties against companies that have significant greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to
challenge air emissions permits that greenhouse gas emitters apply for and seek to force emitters to
reduce their emissions or seek damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment,
people, and property. Any existing or future laws or regulations that restrict or reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating and compliance costs. In addition,
such laws and regulations may adversely affect demand for the fossil fuels we produce, including by
increasing the cost of combusting fossil fuels and by creating incentives for the use of alternative
fuels and energy.
The lack of availability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, insurance, personnel and
oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans
on a timely basis and within our budget.
Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies
or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and
supplies tend to increase, in some cases substantially. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of,
qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases within a geographic
area. If increasing levels of exploration and production result in response to strong prices of oil and
natural gas, the demand for oilfield services will likely rise, and the costs of these services will likely
increase, while the quality of these services may suffer. The future lack of availability or high cost of
drilling rigs, as well as any future lack of availability or high costs of other equipment, supplies,
insurance or qualified personnel, in the areas in which we operate could materially and adversely
affect our business and results of operations.
Our officers and directors have limited liability, and we are required in certain instances to indemnify
our officers and directors for breaches of their fiduciary duties.
We have adopted provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws which limit the liability of our
officers and directors and provide for indemnification by us of our officers and directors to the full
extent permitted by Nevada corporate law. Our articles generally provide that our officers and directors
shall have no personal liability to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of their
fiduciary duties as directors, except for breaches of their duties of loyalty, acts or omissions not in
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, acts involving unlawful
payment of dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions, or any transaction from which a
director derives an improper personal benefit. Such provisions substantially limit our stockholders’
ability to hold officers and directors liable for breaches of fiduciary duty, and may require us to
indemnify our officers and directors.
39
We currently have outstanding indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness which could
reduce our financial flexibility, increase interest expense and adversely impact our operations and our
unit costs.
We currently have outstanding indebtedness and in the future, we may incur significant amounts of
additional indebtedness in order to make acquisitions or to develop our properties (including, but not
limited to, in connection with the Acquisition). Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in
several ways, including the following:
●a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;
 ●a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
 ●any covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness could limit our ability
to borrow additional funds,
 ●dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;
●
a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less
leveraged and, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness may prevent
us from pursuing; and
 ●debt covenants to which we may agree may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in
the economy and in our industry.
A high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may
not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal or interest on our debt, and future
working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. If
we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to arrange financing, we may have to sell
significant assets or have a portion of our assets foreclosed upon which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our CATI Properties are located in the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford trends, making us vulnerable to
risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.
Our CATI Properties are located in the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford trends south, and southeast of
San Antonio, Texas. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or
interruptions of production from wells caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of
production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental
regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, or interruption of transportation of oil or
natural gas produced from the wells in this area. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and
demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and gas producing areas such
as the ones we operate in, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or
magnify the effect of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of CATI
Properties, a number of our CATI Properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same
time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other
companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, which we may not have available when
payments are due.
Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our
indebtedness, will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to general
economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which we
cannot control. In the future, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to make future
acquisitions or to develop our properties, including under our current liabilities. If we do not have
sufficient funds on hand to pay our debt, we may be required to seek a waiver or amendment from our
lenders, refinance our indebtedness, sell assets or sell additional securities. Our ability to refinance
our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time. We may
not be able obtain such financing or complete such transactions on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In
addition, we may not be able to consummate an asset sale to raise capital or sell assets at prices that
we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service
obligations then due. Our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our debts or to undertake any of
these actions successfully could result in a default on our debt obligations, which would materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
40
Future acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating
recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.
Successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control.
These factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future natural gas and
oil prices, operating costs, production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities. These
assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. Our review of the properties we acquire may not
reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the
potential deficiencies of the properties. We do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well
we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise. There
may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to
environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which
could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. We may not
be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities,
and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. At times, we acquire interests in properties
on an “as is” basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of
such representations and warranties. In addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our
operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and
geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties.
We have limited control over activities in properties we do not operate, which could reduce our
production and revenues, affect the timing and amounts of capital requirements and potentially result
in a dilution of our respective ownership interest in the event we are unable to make any required
capital contributions.
We do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest. As a result, we may have a limited
ability to exercise influence over normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of
underlying properties and their associated costs. For all of the properties that are operated by others,
we are dependent on their decision-making with respect to day-to-day operations over which we have
little control. The failure of an operator of wells in which we have an interest to adequately perform
operations, or an operator’s breach of applicable agreements, could reduce production and revenues
we receive from that well. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on
properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the
timing and amount of capital expenditures, the available expertise and financial resources, the
inclusion of other participants and the use of technology. Since we do not own the majority interest in
many of the wells we do not operate, we may not be in a position to remove the operator in the event of
poor performance.
The employment agreement of our Chief Executive Officer includes certain provisions which may
prevent or delay a change of control.
Effective November 1, 2012, we entered into an Employment Agreement with Anthony C. Schnur, our
Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, which agreement was amended and
restated effective December 12, 2012. The agreement had a term of two years, expiring on October 31,
2014, provided that the agreement is automatically extended for additional one year terms, unless
either party provides notice of their intent not to renew within the 30 day period prior to any automatic
renewal date and because neither party has provided notice, the agreement has been automatically
extended until October 31, 2016. The Company agreed to pay Mr. Schnur a base annual salary of
$310,000 during the term of the agreement, of which $290,000 is payable in cash and $20,000 is
payable in shares of the Company’s common stock. In the event the agreement is terminated by the
Company for a reason other than cause (as described in the agreement) or by Mr. Schnur for good
reason (as described in the agreement), Mr. Schnur is due in the form of a lump sum payment, the
product of the base salary and bonus he was paid under the agreement for the prior 12 month period,
provided that if such termination occurs six months before or 24 months following the occurrence of a
Change of Control (as described in the agreement), Mr. Schnur is due 200% of the amount described
above upon such termination. The requirement to pay severance fees under the Employment
Agreement may prevent or delay a change of control of the Company.

Risks Relating To Our Outstanding Securities
If we are unable to maintain compliance with NYSE MKT continued listing standards, our common
stock may be delisted from the NYSE MKT equities market, which would likely cause the liquidity and
market price of our common stock to decline.
Our common stock currently is listed on the NYSE MKT. The NYSE MKT will consider suspending
dealings in, or delisting, securities of an issuer that does not meet its continued listing standards. If we
cannot meet the NYSE MKT continued listing requirements, the NYSE MKT may delist our common
stock, which could have an adverse impact on us and the liquidity and market price of our stock.
We may be unable to comply with NYSE MKT continued listing standards. Our business has been and
may continue to be affected by worldwide macroeconomic factors, which include uncertainties in the
credit and capital markets. External factors that affect our stock price, such as liquidity requirements of
our investors, as well as our performance, could impact our market capitalization, revenue and
operating results, which, in turn, could affect our ability to comply with the NYSE MKT’s listing
standards. The NYSE MKT has the ability to suspend trading in our common stock or remove our
common stock from listing on the NYSE MKT if in the opinion of the exchange: (a) the financial
condition and/or operating results of the Company appear to be unsatisfactory; or (b) it appears that
the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of our common stock has become so
reduced as to make further dealings on the exchange inadvisable; or (c) we have sold or otherwise
disposed of our principal operating assets, or have ceased to be an operating company; or (d) we
have failed to comply with our listing agreements with the exchange; or (e) any other event shall occur
or any condition shall exist which makes further dealings on the exchange unwarranted.
If we are unable to maintain compliance with the NYSE MKT criteria for continued listing, our common
stock would be subject to delisting. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by,
among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock and reducing the
number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our
ability to raise equity financing. In addition, delisting from the NYSE MKT might negatively impact our
reputation and, as a consequence, our business. Additionally, if we were delisted from the NYSE MKT
and are not able to list our common stock on another national exchange we will no longer be eligible to
use Form S-3 registration statements and will instead be required to file a Form S-1 registration
statement for any primary or secondary offerings of our common stock, which would delay our ability
to raise funds in the future, may limit the type of offerings of common stock we could undertake, and
would increase the expenses of any offering, as, among other things, registration statements on Form
S-1 are subject to SEC review and comments whereas take downs pursuant to a previously filed Form
S-3 are not.
42
If we are delisted from the NYSE MKT, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock would also
be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.
If our common stock is delisted from the NYSE MKT, it would come within the definition of “penny
stock” as defined in the Exchange Act and would be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That
Rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons
other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9,
the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the
purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were
to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and
accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These
additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.
We do not intend to pay cash dividends to our stockholders.
We currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and
development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any
payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings
and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As a result, only appreciation of the price
of our common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.
We currently have an illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, and the market for our
common stock is and may remain illiquid and volatile in the future.
We currently have a highly sporadic, illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, which market is
anticipated to remain sporadic, illiquid and volatile in the future. Factors that could affect our stock
price or result in fluctuations in the market price or trading volume of our common stock include:
●our actual or anticipated operating and financial performance and drilling locations, including reserve
estimates;
 ●quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income/loss per share, net
income/loss and cash flows, or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;
 ●changes in revenue, cash flows or earnings estimates or publication of reports by equity research analysts;
 ●speculation in the press or investment community;
 ●public reaction to our press releases, announcements and filings with the SEC;
 ●sales of our common stock by us or other stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;
 ●the amount of our freely tradable common stock available in the public marketplace;
 ●general financial market conditions and oil and natural gas industry market conditions, including fluctuations
in commodity prices;
 ●the realization of any of the risk factors that we are subject to;
 ●the recruitment or departure of key personnel;
 ●commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;
 ●the prices of oil and natural gas;
 ●the success of our exploration and development operations, and the marketing of any oil and natural gas we
produce;
 ●changes in market valuations of companies similar to ours; and
 ●domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.
43
Our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT under the symbol “LEI.” Our stock price may be
impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. The stock
markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating
performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the
trading price of our common stock. Additionally, general economic, political and market conditions,
such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the
market price of our common stock. Due to the limited volume of our shares which trade, we believe
that our stock prices (bid, ask and closing prices) may not be related to our actual value, and not
reflect the actual value of our common stock. You should exercise caution before making an
investment in us.
Additionally, as a result of the illiquidity of our common stock, investors may not be interested in
owning our common stock because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our
common stock at one time. Such illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our
common stock. In addition, a stockholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common stock
as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of securities having such a limited
market. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if one develops, may not
be sustained.
A prolonged decline in the market price of our common stock could affect our ability to obtain
additional financing which would adversely affect our operations.
Historically, we have relied on equity and debt financing as primary sources of financing. A prolonged
decline in the market price of our common stock or a reduction in our accessibility to the global
markets may result in our inability to secure additional financing which would have an adverse effect
on our operations.
If the holders of our outstanding convertible securities and warrants sell a large number of shares all at
once or in blocks after converting such convertible securities and exercising such warrants, or the
holders of our registered shares sell a large number of shares, the trading value of our shares could
decline in value.
As of the Record Date, we have Series B Warrants outstanding to purchase an aggregate of 100,422
shares of common stock which have an exercise price of $71.50 per share; outstanding warrants to
purchase 41,300 shares of common stock sold in April 2012, which have an exercise price of $57.50
per share; outstanding warrants to purchase 13,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price
of $37.50 per share, which were issued in connection with our April and May 2013 loan agreements;
outstanding warrants to purchase 11,195 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per
share, which were issued in connection with our August 2013 Rogers Loan; outstanding warrants to
purchase 66,668 shares of our common stock at a current exercise price of $9.75 per share, which
were issued in connection with our April 2014 offering; outstanding convertible promissory notes
convertible into 966,667 shares of our common stock at $1.50 per share; an outstanding Debenture
convertible into 163,077 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $3.25 per share; and
outstanding warrants to purchase 1,384,616 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.25
per share, which were issued in connection with the sale of the Debenture. The trading price of our
common stock has fluctuated significantly during the last 52 weeks.
44
We have 1,739,397 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the Record Date and, if
Proposals One and Two in this proxy statement are approved by stockholders, we will have 15,139,351
shares of common stock issued and outstanding after the issuance of common stock pursuant to the
Asset Purchase Agreement described herein and in connection with refinancing the Sellers’ debt
being assumed in the Acquisition and financing the cash portion of the Acquisition consideration. As
a result, the exercise of outstanding warrants, or conversion of outstanding convertible promissory
notes or Debenture, and the subsequent resale of such shares of common stock (which shares of
common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series B Warrants, the warrants sold in our April and
September 2012 offerings and the warrants sold in our April 2014 offering, will be eligible for immediate
resale, and which shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible promissory
notes and Debenture and exercise of the warrants issued in April, May and August 2013, will be eligible
for immediate resale subject to the terms and conditions of Rule 144) may cause dilution to existing
stockholders and cause the market price of our securities to decline in value. Additionally, the
common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants or conversion of the convertible promissory
notes or Debenture may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market price of our
common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a Company’s stock in the market
than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of the Company’s stock will
decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market will only further
decrease the share price. Finally, the offer or sale of large numbers of shares of common stock in the
future, including those shares previously registered in our registration statements and prospectus
supplements, and/or in connection with future registration statements or prospectus supplements
may cause the market price of our securities to decline in value.
The warrants sold in our April 2014 offering and the warrants issuable pursuant to our March 2016
Note Purchase Agreement have anti-dilution rights which could cause their exercise price to be
reduced.
The warrants sold in our April 2014 offering include anti-dilution rights, which provide that if at any time
the warrants are outstanding, we issue or are deemed to have issued (which includes shares issuable
upon exercise of warrants and options and conversion of convertible securities) for consideration less
than the then current exercise price of the warrants, the exercise price of such warrants is
automatically reduced (a) to the lowest price per share of consideration provided or deemed to have
been provided for such securities, not to be deemed less than $0.01 per share, during the one year
period following the closing date of the offering (April 21, 2014), which date has passed without any
required adjustments; and thereafter (b) to the product of (x) the exercise price then in effect, and (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration
received by us would purchase at the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and
the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to
such issuance plus the number of such additional shares of common stock issued. Notwithstanding
the above, no adjustment of the exercise price is required in connection with any issuances or deemed
issuance of shares of common stock (1) to our officers, directors, consultants or employees pursuant
to stock option or stock purchase plans or agreements on terms approved by our Board of Directors,
subject to adjustment for all subdivisions and combinations; and (2) in connection with the re-
negotiation, modification, extension or re-pricing of debt of the Company outstanding on the closing
date, subject to the prior written approval of the holders of the warrants. Additionally, in the event we
acquire ownership of another entity or a significant amount of assets from another person or entity by
way of an asset purchase agreement, merger (pursuant to which we are the surviving entity and our
common stock is not converted or exchanged), business combination or share exchange pursuant to
which shares of our common stock or convertible securities (including options or warrants) are issued
or granted by us as partial or sole consideration to the counterparty or counterparties in such
transaction or series of transactions (a “Company Combination”), then and in such event, the exercise
price of the warrants is automatically reduced, to the average of the highest bid and lowest asked
prices of our common stock averaged over the thirty (30) business days after the closing of the
Company Combination if such exercise price as adjusted is less than the exercise price in effect on
the date such Company Combination Price is determined.
45
The warrants issuable pursuant to our March 2016 Note Purchase Agreement include anti-dilution
rights, for the first 12 months following the issuance date of such warrants, which automatically reduce
the exercise price of the warrants to any lower priced security sold, granted or issued by us during
such anti-dilution period, subject to certain exceptions, including officer and director grants and the
transactions contemplated by the Acquisition.
We may be forced to expend significant resources and pay significant costs and expenses associated
with outstanding registration rights.
In connection with our entry into the April 2014 Securities Purchase Agreement, we provided the
investors in the offering registration rights pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement. Pursuant to
the Registration Rights Agreement, the purchasers in the April 2014 Securities Purchase Agreement
have demand and piggy-back registration rights. We also agreed to register certain securities in
connection with the April 2016 Stock Purchase Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement. We
also have agreed to register for resale the shares of common stock issuable in connection with the
Acquisition. We will have to expend significant resources and pay significant costs and expenses,
including filing fees, legal fees and accounting fees, in connection with such registration statements.
Nevada law and our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue shares of stock which shares may
cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.
We have authorized capital stock consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value
per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. As of the Record Date,
we have 1,739,397 shares of common stock outstanding and, if Proposals One and Two in this proxy
statement are approved by stockholders, we will have 15,139,351 shares of common stock
outstanding after issuance of the shares of common stock issuable in connection with the Asset
Purchase Agreement described herein and in connection with refinancing the Sellers’ debt being
assumed in the Acquisition and financing the cash portion of the Acquisition consideration, but does
not take into account the 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock issuable in connection with the
Asset Purchase Agreement described herein, each convertible into approximately 7.14 shares of our
common stock, or the Series C Preferred Stock we have agreed to sell upon the closing of the
Acquisition and subject to certain conditions. As a result, our Board of Directors has the ability to
issue a large number of additional shares of common stock without stockholder approval, subject to
the requirements of the NYSE MKT (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions
which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock
or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock), which if issued could
cause substantial dilution to our then stockholders. Shares of additional preferred stock may also be
issued by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval, with voting powers and such
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and powers as determined by
our Board of Directors, which may be greater than the shares of common stock currently outstanding.
As a result, shares of preferred stock may be issued by our Board of Directors which cause the
holders to have majority voting power over our shares, provide the holders of the preferred stock the
right to convert the shares of preferred stock they hold into shares of our common stock, which may
cause substantial dilution to our then common stock stockholders and/or have other rights and
preferences greater than those of our common stock stockholders. Investors should keep in mind that
the Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred
stock, which could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. Additionally, the dilutive
effect of any preferred stock which we may issue may be exacerbated given the fact that such
preferred stock may have super voting rights and/or other rights or preferences which could provide
the preferred stockholders with substantial voting control over us subsequent to the date of this proxy
statement and/or give those holders the power to prevent or cause a change in control. As a result, the
issuance of shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock may cause the value of our securities to
decrease and/or become worthless.
46
Stockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and/or satisfy
obligations through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock.
Wherever possible, our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy
obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our
common stock. Subject to certain consent rights of the investor in our April 2016 financing, our Board
of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, to issue all or part of the
authorized but unissued shares of common stock (subject to NYSE MKT rules which limit among other
things, the number of shares we can issue without stockholder approval to no more than 20% of our
outstanding shares of common stock). These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests
of existing stockholders, and that dilution may be material.
If persons engage in short sales of our common stock, including sales of shares to be issued upon
exercise of our outstanding warrants, the price of our common stock may decline.
Selling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the
price of a security. In addition, holders of options and warrants will sometimes sell short knowing they
can, in effect, cover through the exercise of an option or warrant, thus locking in a profit. A significant
number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can
create downward pressure on the market price of a security. Further sales of common stock issued
upon exercise of our outstanding warrants could cause even greater declines in the price of our
common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market upon such exercise,
which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock. You
could, therefore, experience a decline in the value of your investment as a result of short sales of our
common stock.
The market price for our common stock may be volatile, and our stockholders may not be able to sell
our stock at a favorable price or at all.
Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall, including: actual or
anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations; changes in market valuations of
companies in our industry; changes in expectations of future financial performance; fluctuations in
stock market prices and volumes; issuances of dilutive common stock or other securities in the future;
the addition or departure of key personnel; announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions,
investments or strategic alliances; and the increase or decline in the price of oil and natural gas.
47
Substantial sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress
the market price of our common stock.
We cannot predict whether future issuances of our common stock or resales in the open market will
decrease the market price of our common stock. The impact of any such issuances or resales of our
common stock on our market price may be increased as a result of the fact that our common stock is
thinly, or infrequently, traded. The exercise of any options that we have or that we may grant to
directors, executive officers and other employees in the future, the issuance of common stock in
connection with acquisitions and other issuances of our common stock (including shares previously
registered in our registration statements and prospectus supplements, and/or in connection with
future registration statements or prospectus supplements) could have an adverse effect on the market
price of our common stock. In addition, future issuances of our common stock may be dilutive to
existing stockholders. Any sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or
the perception that such sales might occur, could lower the market price of our common stock.
We face potential liability in the event we do not satisfy the current public information requirements of
Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, prior to the date the Series B Warrants and
shares of common stock issuable upon exercise thereof have been sold by the holders thereof or
have expired.
Pursuant to an agreement entered into with the Series B Warrant holders, we agreed that if at any time
prior to the date that all of the Series B Warrants and any shares of common stock issuable upon
exercise of such warrants are sold by the holders thereof, we fail to satisfy the current public
information requirement of Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (a “Public
Information Failure”), as partial relief for the damages to any holder of warrants, we would pay the
holders, based on their pro rata ownership of non-exercised and non-expired warrants on the first day
of a Public Information Failure, an aggregate of $80,000 for the first thirty calendar days that there is a
Public Information Failure (pro-rated for a period of less than thirty days) and an amount in cash equal
to one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the aggregate Black Scholes Value (as defined in the warrants) of
such holder’s non-exercised and non-expired warrants on the sixty-first (61st) calendar day after the
Public Information Failure (covering the 31st to 60th calendar days) and on every thirtieth day (pro-
rated for periods totaling less than thirty days) thereafter until the earlier of (i) the date such Public
Information Failure is cured; (ii) such time that such public information is no longer required pursuant
to Rule 144; and (iii) the expiration date of the warrants. Additionally, upon the occurrence of any
Public Information Failure during the 12 months prior to the expiration of any warrant, the expiration
date of such warrant will be automatically extended for one day for each day that a Public Information
Failure occurs and is continuing. As such, in the event of the occurrence of a Public Information
Failure, we will face liability and penalties.
We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a fully reporting publicly traded company and our
management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.
We incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our status as a fully
reporting public company. Specifically, we are required to prepare and file annual, quarterly and
current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Additionally, our officers,
directors and significant stockholders are required to file Form 3, 4 and 5’s and Schedule 13D/G’s with
the SEC disclosing their ownership of the Company and changes in such ownership. Furthermore, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and rules subsequently implemented by the
SEC have imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in
corporate governance practices. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things,
that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure of controls and
procedures. The costs and expenses of compliance with SEC rules and our filing obligations with the
SEC, or our identification of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are
deemed to be material weaknesses, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or
cause the market price of our stock to decline in value.
48
Securities analyst coverage or lack of coverage may have a negative impact on our common stock’s
market price.
The trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that
securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over
these analysts. If securities or industry analysts stop their coverage of us or additional securities and
industry analysts fail to cover us in the future, the trading price for our common stock would be
negatively impacted. If any analyst or analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, changes
their opinion of our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our
stock price would likely decline. If any analyst or analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish
reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in
the financial markets, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.
Due to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, we are subject to financial and other
reporting and corporate governance requirements which increase our cost and expenses.
We are currently required to file annual and quarterly information and other reports with the SEC that
are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Additionally, due to the fact that our
common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, we are also subject to the requirements to maintain
independent directors, comply with other corporate governance requirements and are required to pay
annual listing and stock issuance fees. These obligations require a commitment of additional
resources including, but not limited, to additional expenses, and may result in the diversion of our
senior management’s time and attention from our day-to-day operations. These obligations increase
our expenses and may make it more complicated or time consuming for us to undertake certain
corporate actions due to the fact that we may require the approval of the NYSE MKT for such
transactions and/or NYSE MKT rules may require us to obtain stockholder approval for such
transactions.
You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings or other equity issuances.
We may in the future issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into
or exchangeable for our common stock.
Additional Risks Related to our Business, Industry and an Investment in our common stock
For a discussion of additional risks associated with our business, our industry and an investment in
our common stock, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on July 13, 2016, as well as the disclosures contained in documents
filed by us thereafter pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, which are incorporated by reference into, and deemed to be a part of, this proxy statement.
49
MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT SPECIAL MEETING
PROPOSAL ONE:
APPROVAL OF ISSUANCE OF 13,009,664 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO THE SELLERS, THE
ISSUANCE OF 552,000 SHARES OF SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK TO ONE OF THE SELLERS AND
ITS AFFILIATE, AND THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK
ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK, INCLUDING SHARES
ISSUABLE PURSUANT TO THE DIVIDEND PROVISIONS OF THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK,
EXCEEDING 19.99% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, TO ACQUIRE THE ASSETS
Acquisition of Assets
In December 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”),
as purchaser, with twenty-one separate sellers (the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire from the Sellers (the
“Acquisition”), working interests in producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Texas and
Oklahoma, including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-
Continent region of the United States, and related wells, leases, records, equipment and agreements
associated therewith as well as producing shale properties in Glasscock County, Texas (collectively,
the “Assets”), in consideration for, among other things, the issuance of 13,009,664 shares of Common
Stock to the Sellers and its affiliate and the issuance of 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to
one of the Sellers and its affiliate, upon approval of the Company’s stockholders.
Because the shares of our Common Stock, including the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, to be issued to finance the Acquisition,
represent greater than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and a change in control (as defined by
NYSE MKT), Sections 712 and 713 of the NYSE MKT rules mandate stockholder approval to issue any
such shares of Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock to purchase the Assets. Accordingly,
stockholders are being asked to approve the issuance of 13,009,664 shares of Common Stock to the
Sellers and its affiliate, the issuance of 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers
and its affiliate, and the issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, including shares issuable pursuant to the dividend
provisions of the Series B Preferred Stock, exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, to
acquire the Assets.
Our Board has unanimously determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and our stockholders to issue 13,009,664 shares of Common Stock to the Sellers and to issue 552,000
shares of Series B Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers and its affiliate in consideration for the Assets
in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Under Nevada law, the Company’s
stockholders do not have any “dissenters’ rights” or rights to an appraisal of the value of their shares
in connection with the Acquisition.
Our Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote FOR approval of the issuance of
13,009,664 shares of Common Stock to the Sellers and its affiliate, the issuance of 552,000 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers and its affiliate, and the issuance of such number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, including shares
issuable pursuant to the dividend provisions of the Series B Preferred Stock, exceeding 19.99% of our
outstanding Common Stock, to acquire the Assets.
50
Reasons for the Issuance of Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock to the Sellers
Given our current balance sheet, our Board believes that the issuance of Common Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock to the Sellers is the only currency available for the Company to acquire the Assets.
Reasons for Stockholder Approval
Our Common Stock is listed on the NYSE MKT. Section 712(b) of the NYSE MKT rules requires
stockholder approval in connection with a transaction involving the issuance by the issuer of common
stock (or securities convertible into common stock) as sole or partial consideration for an acquisition
of assets where the present or potential issuance of common stock (or securities convertible into
common stock) could result in an increase in outstanding common shares of 20% or more. Section
713(a) of the NYSE MKT rules requires stockholder approval in connection with a transaction involving
the sale, issuance, or potential issuance by the issuer of common stock (or securities convertible into
common stock) equal to 20% or more of presently outstanding shares of common stock at a price less
than the greater of book value or market value. Section 713(b) of the NYSE MKT rules requires
stockholder approval in connection with a transaction involving the issuance or potential issuance of
additional shares which would result in a change of control of the issuer.
Because the shares of our Common Stock, including the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, to be issued to finance the Acquisition,
represent greater than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and a change in control (as defined by
NYSE MKT), we are asking our stockholders to approve the issuance of 13,009,664 shares of Common
Stock to the Sellers and its affiliate, the issuance of 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to one
of the Sellers and its affiliate, and the issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, including shares issuable pursuant to the dividend
provisions of the Series B Preferred Stock, exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, to
acquire the Assets. Stockholder approval of this proposal is being sought solely to comply with
Sections 712 and 713 of the NYSE MKT rules governing the issuance of securities in connection with
an acquisition when any such issuances in the aggregate would exceed 20% of an issuer’s
outstanding capital stock or might be considered a change of control (as defined by NYSE MKT). The
Asset Purchase Agreement requires us to submit this Proposal to stockholders at our Special
Meeting. Because this transaction is an acquisition of assets, however, our stockholders are not being
asked to approve the Acquisition itself or the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Description of Series B Preferred Stock
Please refer to the description of the Series B Preferred Stock under “Description of Capital Stock of
Lucas Energy, Inc.” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement.
Effect upon Rights of Existing Stockholders
Our current stockholders will continue to own their existing shares after the transaction described in
this proposal. Our stockholders are not participating in nor receiving any consideration from the
transaction described in this proposal. Our stockholders should not send in their share certificates
because their share certificates will not be exchanged in connection with the transaction described in
this proposal.
If stockholders approve this proposal, and 13,009,664 shares of Common Stock are issued to the
Sellers, and 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock are issued to one of the Sellers and its affiliate,
the principal effect upon the rights of existing stockholders will be a dilution in their current
percentage ownership in the Company. The Sellers will hold in the aggregate approximately 88.2% of
our outstanding voting securities upon consummation of the Acquisition and approximately 90.7% of
our outstanding voting securities upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock. These
percentages do not give effect to (i) the issuance of securities in connection with any of the other
proposals in this proxy statement, (ii) the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to our other
outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities, or (iii) any other future issuances of our
Common Stock. The sale into the public market of the shares issued to the Sellers also could
materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.
The total number of shares of Common Stock potentially issuable in connection with Proposal One is
approximately 18,608,521, which consists of approximately (i) 13,009,664 shares of Common Stock
issuable to the Sellers, (ii) 3,942,857 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion in full of the
Series B Preferred Stock issuable to the Sellers at the assumed initial conversion price per share of
$3.50 and (iii) 1,656,000 shares of Common Stock issuable as dividends on the Series B Preferred
Stock (assuming dividends are paid in shares of Common Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock is held
for seven years, the dividend rate is 6% per annum, the conversion price is $3.50, there are no defaults,
and dividends are not paid in kind with Series B Preferred Stock). If any of the foregoing assumptions
change, additional shares of Common Stock will be issuable.
51
If stockholders approve this proposal and the Acquisition is closed, the exercise price of our April
2014 warrants will be reduced, if applicable, to the fair market value of our Common Stock on the date
30 days after the closing of the Acquisition.
Interests of Directors, Officers and Affiliates
None of our current directors, officers or affiliates have an interest in the Acquisition. However, the
Sellers will have the right pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement to appoint three members to the
Board of Directors, and it is anticipated that one of their director nominees will be Richard N. Azar II.
Mr. Azar, who is the principal Seller and manager of the properties and is planned to be appointed as
Executive Chairman following the closing. Mr. Azar will also be receiving a significant amount of the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon closing of the Acquisition and all of the Series B Preferred
Stock issuable at closing, either personally or through entities which he controls. By the sixth month
anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition, one of the three current members of our Board will be
required to resign in order that we will have five members of our Board, including three appointed by
the Sellers, on such date.
Stockholders are urged to carefully consider the present and future interests described above prior to
voting on this Proposal One.
Registration Rights
The shares of Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock issued to the Sellers in connection with
the Acquisition will be issued in reliance on one or more exemptions from the registration
requirements of federal and state securities laws. As a result, the Sellers may not sell any of the shares
of Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Series B Preferred Stock that they receive in the Acquisition except pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering
the resale of those shares, or an applicable exemption under the Securities Act. We have agreed to
register for resale the shares of Common Stock issued to the Sellers. Upon such registration, these
shares will be freely tradable in the public market without restriction (other than restrictions imposed
on any affiliates of the Company).
Vote Required
We will not be able to complete the Acquisition unless all of the conditions to closing contemplated by
the Asset Purchase Agreement are satisfied, including (i) the approval of the issuance of shares of
Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock by a majority of the votes cast on Proposal One and (ii)
the approval of the issuance of 390,290 shares of our Common Stock to IBC as an underwriting equity
fee for the term loan, which will be considered by the stockholders at the Special Meeting as Proposal
Two and is described herein beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement.
A majority of the votes cast is required by the NYSE MKT rules to approve the issuance of 13,009,664
shares of Common Stock to the Sellers and its affiliate, the issuance of 552,000 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers and its affiliate, and the issuance of such number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, including shares issuable
pursuant to the dividend provisions of the Series B Preferred Stock, exceeding 19.99% of our
outstanding Common Stock, to acquire the Assets.
52
Consequences of Not Approving this Proposal
If we do not obtain stockholder approval of this Proposal at the Special Meeting, we will not be able to
consummate the Acquisition or acquire the Assets, the failure of which could materially adversely
affect our results of operations, our financial condition, our stock price and our ability to continue as a
going concern.
Recommendation of Our Board
Our Board has unanimously determined that the issuance of shares of Common Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock to the Sellers in consideration for the Assets is fair to, and advisable and in the best
interests of, the Company and our stockholders. Our Board unanimously recommends that
stockholders vote “FOR” the issuance of 13,009,664 shares of Common Stock to the Sellers and its
affiliate, the issuance of 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers and its
affiliate, and the issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Series B Preferred Stock, including shares issuable pursuant to the dividend provisions of the
Series B Preferred Stock, exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, to acquire the Assets.

The Assets
The Assets consist of working interests in producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Texas
and Oklahoma, including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich
Mid-Continent region of the United States, and related wells, leases, records, equipment and
agreements associated therewith as well as producing shale properties in Glasscock County, Texas.
The properties currently produce approximately 1,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), of
which 53% are liquids from 114 producing wells. The bulk of the production is from the Hunton
formation holding approximately 43,000 gross acres (9,900 net acres) in central Oklahoma.
Additionally, further, offset development drilling opportunities for at least 40 additional wells have been
identified.
Please refer to Exhibits A-1 and A-2 to the Asset Purchase Agreement, which is attached as Annex A-1
to this proxy statement, for a summary description of each of the Assets, consisting of (a) the wells
being sold to us by the Sellers and (b) the working interests and net revenue interests in such wells
owned by each Seller and being sold to us pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Reasons for the Acquisition
Our Board, having concluded that the Acquisition is fair to, and in the best interests of, us and our
stockholders, unanimously approved the Acquisition and all transactions and documents necessary
to its consummation.
The decision of our Board to enter into the Asset Purchase Agreement was based on a thorough
analysis of the Company’s strengths and weaknesses. This analysis allowed our Board to identify
several potential benefits to us and our stockholders that, if realized, could increase stockholder value.
These reasons for the Acquisition include:
●an increase in our operating revenues;
●
an increase in our production. The properties being acquired currently produce approximately 1,000 net
barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), of which 53% are liquids from 114 producing wells. The bulk of the
production is from the Hunton formation holding approximately 43,000 gross acres (9,900 net acres) in
central Oklahoma. Further, offset development drilling opportunities for at least 40 additional wells have
already been identified. We believe total proved developed reserves (PDP) are 5.4 million barrels of oil
equivalent (MMBOE) comprised of 6% oil, 47% natural gas liquids (NGL) and 47% natural gas;
●obtaining stable, long-lived reserves with substantial current production and ample drilling opportunities
providing growth prospects for us;
54
●geographic expansion into the Mid-continent; and
    
 ●rebranding our organization and redirecting our strategic vision.
Our Board reviewed a number of additional factors in evaluating the Acquisition, including, but not
limited to the following:
●the terms and conditions of the Acquisition;
    
 ●the terms and conditions of the financing required to close the Acquisition;
    
 ●information regarding our business focus, historical financial performance and condition, operations, and
management;
    
 ●our desire to take advantage of the low commodity price environment and to gain stability;
    
 ●the operational performance of the Assets;
    
 ●the requirements for a successful integration of the Assets with our operations; and
    
 ●results of our due diligence review of the Assets.
Our Board also considered a number of countervailing factors that may pose a risk to the success of
the Acquisition after its consummation including:
●the possibility that the benefits anticipated from the Acquisition might not be achieved or might not occur as
rapidly or to the extent currently anticipated;
    
 ●the risk that integration of the Assets might not be accomplished smoothly and might require more time,
expense and management attention than anticipated;
    
 ●the risk that our stockholders do not approve the issuance of the Common Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock and the Acquisition is not completed;
    
 ●the risk that a continued and prolonged period of continued depressed commodity prices may hamper our
ability to obtain financing and grow; and
    
 ●the risk that the debt service associated with the Acquisition may strain our financial resources if the
expected results of operations of the Assets are not achieved to the degree anticipated.
For a discussion of the existing risk factors and their possible effect on the success of the Acquisition,
see “Risk Factors” beginning on page 17.
In the view of our Board, these potentially countervailing factors did not, individually or in the
aggregate, outweigh the advantages of the Acquisition.
55
TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION
Stockholders are urged to carefully read the Asset Purchase Agreement that is attached to this Proxy
Statement as Annex A-1 and the form of First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement that is
attached as Annex A-2 because they are the legal documents that govern the Acquisition.
The Acquisition
On December 30, 2015, we entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement, as purchaser, with twenty-one
separate Sellers and Segundo Resources, LLC, as a Seller and as the Representative. Pursuant to the
Asset Purchase Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire
from the Sellers, working interests in producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Texas and
Oklahoma, including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-
Continent region of the United States, and related wells, leases, records, equipment and agreements
associated therewith, as well as producing shale properties in Glasscock County, Texas. The
properties currently produce approximately 1,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), of
which 53% are liquids from 114 producing wells. The bulk of the production is from the Hunton
formation holding approximately 43,000 gross acres (9,900 net acres) in central Oklahoma.
Additionally, further, offset development drilling opportunities for at least 40 additional wells have been
identified. Revenues generated from the Assets effective from April 1, 2016 will be credited to us. Any
sale by the Sellers of the properties in Glasscock County, Texas prior to closing the Acquisition must
be approved by us, and the proceeds from any such sale will be placed in escrow until the closing of
the Acquisition, where they can be drawn upon by mutual consent of the parties.
Acquisition Consideration
As consideration for the Acquisition, we agreed to assume $31.35 million of commercial bank debt;
issue 552,000 shares of our amended and restated designated Series B Preferred Stock to one of the
Sellers and its affiliate, which are under common control with the Seller Representative, with a total
liquidation value of $13.8 million; issue 13,009,664 shares of Common Stock to certain of the Sellers;
and pay $4,975,000 in cash to certain of the Sellers. Notwithstanding the above, in the event there are
any title or other material issues associated with the Assets, the parties agreed to work in good faith to
address such issues, and if such issues cannot be addressed, to adjust the purchase price, provided
that no adjustment will be made unless such issues in aggregate total more than 5% of the aggregate
purchase price, and provided further that if such issues in aggregate total more than 20% of the
aggregate purchase price, we can terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement, all of which are subject to
the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. We and the Sellers also agreed to a true-up for certain
joint interest billings and authorization for expenditures at and/or after closing, and to effect a true-up
in connection with any material agreements, if the rights thereto are not provided by the Sellers at
closing. We may pay fees and expenses attributable to the Sellers incurred prior to April 1, 2016 as
long as those expenses do not exceed $960,000.
Terms of Series B Preferred Stock
The Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $25 per share. The Series B Preferred
Stock is convertible into Common Stock at a rate of approximately 7.14:1; therefore, if fully converted,
such shares of Series B Common Stock will convert into an aggregate of 3,942,857 shares of Common
Stock, at the option of the holder thereof, or automatically as to 25% of the Series B Preferred Stock
shares if our Common Stock trades above $6.125 per share for at least 20 consecutive trading days,
and trades with at least 75,000 shares of average volume per day during such period; an additional
50% of the Series B Preferred Stock shares if our Common Stock trades above $7.00 per share for at
least 20 consecutive trading days, and trades with at least 75,000 shares of average volume per day
during such period; and as to the remaining Series B Preferred Stock shares, if our Common Stock
trades above $7.875 per share for at least 20 consecutive trading days, and trades with at least 75,000
shares of average volume per day during such period. Each outstanding share of Series B Preferred
Stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all stockholder matters. The Series B Preferred Stock is
redeemable at any time by the Company upon the payment by the Company of the face amount of the
Series B Preferred Stock ($25 per share) plus any and all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon.
Among other things, we agreed to not take any action to adversely affect the rights of the holders of
the Series B Preferred Stock so long as the Series B Preferred Stock is outstanding and to not
designate any capital stock with powers greater than the Series B Preferred Stock, without the
approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock shares.
56
Financing for the Acquisition
In order to finance the debt and cash portions of the Acquisition consideration, at the closing of the
Acquisition, we intend to enter into a three-year $40 million senior secured term loan (subject to a loan-
to-value ratio of 50% or less) with IBC. The term loan is expected to require repayment in monthly
installments of the greater of 50% of net monthly income or monthly principal and interest payments of
$425,000, and to require a sinking fund to be created with an initial deposit of $3.36 million to be used
for principal reductions. The term loan is expected to bear interest at the prime rate plus 2.0% with a
floor of 5.50%. We expect to be required to pay IBC (1) a loan commitment fee of $400,000, with half due
at closing and half due six months thereafter, (2) an annual engineering fee of $10,000, and (3) an
underwriting equity fee of 390,290 shares of Common Stock. Our obligations under the term loan are
expected to be secured by a first priority lien on various working interests in our oil and gas properties
located in Texas and Oklahoma.
Name Change
We agreed that, after the closing of the Acquisition, we will rebrand and change our name to “Camber
Energy, Inc.”
Board Representation
There are no significant management changes planned at this time in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, as Anthony C. Schnur will maintain his role as our
President and Chief Executive Officer following the closing. However, the Sellers will have the right
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement to appoint three members to our Board, and it is
anticipated that one of their director nominees will be Richard N. Azar II. Mr. Azar is the principal Seller
and manager of the properties being acquired, and is planned to be appointed as Executive Chairman
following the closing of the Acquisition. Mr. Azar is a founding partner of the Representative, and for
over 20 years has been instrumental in developing the Hunton resource play in Central Oklahoma
through his direction of the Representative, ownership in Altex Resources, Inc., and various other
successful oil and gas ventures. Mr. Azar will also be receiving a significant amount of the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon closing of the Acquisition and all of the Series B Preferred Stock
issuable at closing, either personally or through entities which he controls. By the sixth month
anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition, one of the three current members of our Board will be
required to resign in order that we will have five members of our Board, including three appointed by
the Sellers, on such date.
Representations and Covenants
The parties have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Asset Purchase
Agreement including, among others, covenants relating to (1) the conduct of each party’s business
during the interim period between the execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions described therein, (2) the Company’s obligations to facilitate its

terms set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement.
57
The Sellers’ representations and warranties are set forth in Article V to the Asset Purchase Agreement
(See Annex A-1 and Annex A-2). Please refer to Article V of the Asset Purchase Agreement for further
details regarding the Sellers’ representations and warranties, breaches of which may trigger the
Sellers’ indemnification obligations.

Agreement (See Annex A-1 and Annex A-2). Please refer to Article VIII of the Asset Purchase
Agreement for further details regarding the Sellers’ covenants and agreements, breaches of which

The Asset Purchase Agreement requires that the parties deliver, on or prior to twenty days from the
date of the parties’ entry into the Asset Purchase Agreement, to be updated at least seven days prior
to closing, copies of the disclosure schedules required pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase
Agreement. In the event there are any issues associated with such disclosures, the parties agreed to
negotiate such issues in good faith, and if such differences cannot be addressed within the time

complete the Acquisition is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (a)
subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the respective representations and warranties of the
other parties, and (b) performance in all material respects by the other parties of their respective
obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Termination Provisions
The Asset Purchase Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both the
Company and the Sellers, which include, subject to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement and in
certain circumstances rights to cure or other prerequisites, that the Asset Purchase Agreement can be

Purchase Agreement) and such issues cannot be reasonably cured by the parties; (ii) our
stockholders fail to approve the issuance of the Acquisition Shares at a meeting called for such
purpose; (iii) if we fail to obtain all required consents; (iv) if we fail to raise the cash necessary to

been presented with a superior acquisition proposal. The Asset Purchase Agreement can also be
terminated by either party with five days prior written notice if the Acquisition has not been completed
by September 30, 2016, provided that such failure is not the result of the breach of the Asset Purchase
Agreement by the terminating party.
58
Background of the Transaction
In early September 2015, a representative of ROTH Capital Partners met with Richard N. Azar II in San
Antonio about the concept of selling a series of oil and gas assets to a public company. On October 8,
2015, Anthony C. Schnur, our Chief Executive Officer, met with Mr. Azar in San Antonio. Mr. Azar
intimated to Mr. Schnur that there may be a transaction for us with Segundo Resources, LLC, a
holding company owned by Mr. Azar with ownership in and management of certain non-operated oil
and gas assets in Central Oklahoma and West Texas. As a result of the meeting, the parties executed a
Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement on October 13, 2015 and decided to meet again in person at a later
date with participation from ROTH as their financial advisor to explore in more detail the potential for a
business combination. Shortly after this meeting, Segundo determined to pursue a transaction with
Lucas. During the week of October 19, 2015, ROTH and Segundo made preparations to meet with
Segundo’s senior lender, International Bank of Commerce of San Antonio (“IBC Bank”). On October
27, 2015, Mr. Richard Azar, Mr. Benjamin Azar and representatives of ROTH met with Mr. Schnur to
discuss the plausibility from a business perspective to effect a merger between Segundo and Lucas.
During the meeting, various pros and cons of the transaction were discussed as well as critical
conditions that would need to be met in the near-term in order for both parties to be comfortable in
moving forward with a transaction. On October 28, 2015, ROTH and Segundo met with IBC Bank in San
Antonio, where they provided a prepared presentation as to the acquisition of certain oil and gas
assets from Segundo and other Sellers, the pledging of additional debt collateral to IBC Bank and the
strategy to roll all of the Segundo assets into a publicly listed company. On November 10 and 11, 2015,
meetings were held with certain Sellers in San Antonio at Segundo offices to discuss the value of the
pro forma assets and the potential acquisition of their assets by Lucas in exchange for common stock,
cash and any combination thereof. Over this period, ROTH, Segundo and Lucas met with several of
the Sellers to discuss the transaction. In addition, the parties meet with a representative of Silver Star
Oil Company, which was the unsecured lender to Lucas, and whose consent would be required to
pursue a transaction. Discussions related to the concept of Lucas acquiring the Assets and a go-
forward plan after the Acquisition. On November 16, 2015, ROTH finalized the allocation of
consideration to each of the individual Sellers, which consisted of a combination of cash, shares of
common stock, shares of preferred stock and assumption of debt held by IBC Bank. On November 18,
2015, ROTH prepared form letters which provided an attributed dollar value for the Sellers’ assets and
a transaction proposal by Lucas to acquire the Assets for a combination of Lucas common stock and
required cash. In addition, individuals in receipt of the transaction proposal agreed to confidentiality
and restrictions on transacting in any Lucas securities until the earlier of public announcement of the
transaction or notification by ROTH of the abandonment of the transaction. Segundo distributed the
transaction proposal to the Sellers via e-mail. On November 23, 2015, ROTH received responses from
the potential Sellers indicating their interest in selling their assets. On November 24, 2015, Segundo
and Lucas executed a non-binding letter of intent. On November 25, 2015, ROTH hosted an
Organizational Call between Segundo and Lucas to discuss the status of the transaction. ROTH
subsequently circulated organizational materials containing details of the transaction. On November
30, 2015, representatives of ROTH and Segundo met with representatives of IBC Bank in San Antonio
to discuss the signed letter of intent and request financing for the acquisition of the assets owned by
the Sellers. Discussions included the value of the assets to be acquired, and the impact to IBC from a
lending perspective. IBC agreed to present a preliminary financing proposal related to the transaction.
On November 30, 2015, ROTH and Segundo met with another Seller and subordinated lender to
Segundo, in San Antonio to discuss the transaction and outcome of the meeting with IBC Bank. On
December 1, 2015, ROTH and Segundo met with another Seller at Segundo offices, to discuss the
potential transaction with Lucas and exchange of that Seller’s assets for Lucas common stock. On
December 8, 2015, ROTH hosted a conference call which included participation from representatives
of ROTH, Segundo, the Sellers and their respective legal and accounting advisors. On December 7,
2015, a representative of ROTH met with management of Segundo in San Antonio, to review the oil and
gas assets to be acquired. On December 9, 2015, Segundo received a discussion term sheet from IBC
Bank outlining proposed terms on a credit facility from IBC Bank for purpose of refinancing existing
debt and purchasing additional interest in various oil and gas properties owned by the Sellers.
59
On December 15, 2015, ROTH hosted a conference call, which included participation from
representatives of ROTH, Segundo, the Sellers and their respective legal and accounting advisors, to
discuss the status of several agreements including the Asset Purchase Agreement, Designation of
Preferred Stock, Assignments and a Registration Rights Agreement. It was also discussed that Lucas
engage an investment bank that would be able to deliver a fairness opinion on the transaction. On
December 16, 2015, ROTH was introduced by Mr. Schnur to a representative of Canaccord Genuity Inc.
(“Canaccord”), whom Lucas had engaged to render a fairness opinion on the transaction. Starting on
December 28, 2015, Mr. Azar began to send the final forms of the Asset Purchase Agreement to the
Sellers for their review, comment and execution. On December 29, 2015, the executed Asset Purchase
Agreement was delivered to Segundo legal counsel to hold in escrow.
On December 28, 2015, Lucas held a meeting of its board of directors to approve the transaction in
consideration of the draft fairness opinion as provided by Canaccord. Due to holiday conflicts, it was
going to take several days to receive a final approved opinion. At this meeting, the Lucas board of
directors approved the Asset Purchase Agreement and its terms and conditions, substantially in the
form presented to the board of directors contingent on the final approval of the fairness opinion. On
December 30, 2015, Canaccord delivered to Lucas its oral fairness opinion, with the final written
opinion to be delivered within several days. On January 5, 2016, Canaccord delivered to Lucas its
written fairness opinion on the fairness of the transaction, from a financial point of view, to Lucas of
the consideration to be paid by it under the terms of the transaction. On December 30, 2015, the Sellers
and Lucas executed the Asset Purchase Agreement. On December 31, 2015, Lucas publicly
announced that it had signed a purchase agreement with the Sellers.
On February 5, 2016, we received a non-binding term sheet for senior debt financing from IBC. Also in
April 2016, we negotiated a First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement with the Sellers.
On March 28, 2016 and on June 13, 2016, we borrowed $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, from Alan
Dreeben, who is one of the sellers of the Assets, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Short Term
Promissory Note (the “Short Term Note”). The Short Term Note has a principal balance of $385,000
(the $350,000 borrowed plus a 10% original issue discount), does not accrue interest unless an event
of default occurs thereunder, at which time the note accrues interest at 15% per annum, has a maturity
date of August 31, 2016 and contains standard and customary events of default. The Short Term Note
may be prepaid at any time without penalty. As additional consideration for Mr. Dreeben agreeing to
make the loan we agreed to issue Mr. Dreeben 15,000 restricted shares of common stock.
60
Fairness Opinion
In connection with the Acquisition, our Board received a written opinion, dated December 30, 2015, of
our financial advisor, Canaccord Genuity Inc. (“Canaccord”), as to the fairness, from a financial point
of view, to the Company, of the consideration to be paid by us in the Acquisition. The full text of
Canaccord’s written opinion, dated December 30, 2015, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B
and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. Canaccord has consented to the use of its
opinion in this proxy statement and to the references thereto. Canaccord’s opinion was prepared for
the information of Lucas’ Board only in connection with its evaluation of the total Acquisition
consideration from a financial point of view. Canaccord’s opinion does not address any other aspect
of the Acquisition or any matter to be presented to our stockholders. The summary of Canaccord’s
opinion described below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its opinion. Holders of
our Common Stock are encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Canaccord, among other things:
●reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company;
●
●
analyzed certain internal financial statement and other business and financial information, including certain
projected financial and operating data concerning the Company provided to Canaccord by Company
management;
analyzed certain internal financial statements and other business and financial information, including certain
projected financial and operating data concerning the Assets provided to Canaccord by senior management
of the Company;
 ●conducted discussions with members of senior management of the Company regarding past and current
operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company and the Assets;
 ●compared the projected results of operations of Segundo with those of certain publicly traded companies
Canaccord deemed to be relevant and comparable to each of the Company and the Assets;

Company which, for purposes of the fairness opinion, Canaccord has assumed, with the Company’s
permission, to be identical in all material respects to the agreements to be executed; and
reviewed such other financial studies and analyses, performed such other investigations, and took into
account such other matters as Canaccord deemed necessary, including an assessment of general
economic, market and monetary conditions.
●
●
61
In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, Canaccord relied and assumed, with Lucas’
consent, upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information provided to
or discussed with Canaccord by Lucas or otherwise publicly available, and further assumed, with
Lucas’s consent, that there were no material changes in Lucas’ business operations, financial
condition or prospects since the respective dates of such information. Canaccord did not
independently verify such information. With respect to the financial forecasts and estimates reviewed
by or discussed with Canaccord, Canaccord was advised by Lucas’ management, and assumed at
Lucas’ direction, that such financial forecasts and estimates were reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of each of Segundo’s management and
Lucas’ management. Canaccord expressed no view as to such financial forecasts or estimates or the
assumptions underlying such financial forecasts or estimates. Canaccord did not conduct a physical
inspection of any of Lucas’ or Segundo’s assets, properties or facilities, nor did it make or obtain any
independent evaluation or appraisals of any such assets, properties or facilities or any liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Lucas or Segundo.
Canaccord further assumed, with Lucas’ consent, that the Acquisition would be consummated in
accordance with the terms described in the original asset purchase agreement and related documents,
without amendments, modifications or waivers, and that all governmental, regulatory or other
approvals, consents and agreements required for the Acquisition and related transactions would be
obtained without any adverse effect on Lucas or the Acquisition.
Canaccord expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or aspects of the form or structure of the
Acquisition. Canaccord was not asked to consider, and its opinion did not address, the relative merits
of the Acquisition as compared to any alternative business strategy that might exist for Lucas. In
addition, Canaccord expressed no opinion as to the merits of the underlying business decision of
Lucas’ board of directors to proceed with the Acquisition or any related transaction. Canaccord’s
opinion was directed to and for the information of the Board of Directors of Lucas only in connection
with its evaluation of the Acquisition, and does not constitute advice or a recommendation to any
stockholder of Lucas as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Acquisition or any
matter related to the Acquisition. Canaccord’s opinion did not constitute an opinion as to the price at
which Lucas common stock may trade at any time. Except as described above, Lucas imposed no
other instructions or limitations on Canaccord with respect to the investigations made or the
procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.
This summary is not a complete description of Canaccord’s opinion or the financial analyses
performed and factors considered by Canaccord in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a
financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary
description. Canaccord arrived at its ultimate opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken
by it and assessed as a whole, and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any
one factor or method of analysis for purposes of its opinion. Accordingly, Canaccord believes that its
analyses and this summary must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses
and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses
and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view
of the processes underlying Canaccord’s analyses and opinion.
62
In performing its analyses, Canaccord considered market, economic and other conditions and
circumstances involving the assets to be acquired, Lucas and its industry existing as of the date of its
opinion, many of which are beyond Lucas’ control. No company, business or transaction used in the
analyses is identical or directly comparable to the assets to be acquired, Lucas or the Acquisition, and
an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve
complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other
factors that could affect the Acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, business
segments or transactions analyzed.
The estimates contained in Canaccord’s analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by its analyses. In addition, analyses
relating to the value of businesses or securities do not necessarily purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates
used in, and the results derived from, Canaccord’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the Acquisition were determined through negotiation
between Lucas and Segundo, and the decision to enter into the Acquisition was solely that of Lucas’
board of directors. Canaccord’s opinion was only one of many factors considered by Lucas’ board of
directors in its evaluation of the Acquisition and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of
Lucas’ board of directors or management with respect to the Acquisition or Acquisition consideration.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed with the Lucas board of
directors in connection with Canaccord’s opinion dated December 30, 2015. The financial analyses
summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand
Canaccord’s financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The
tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in
the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including
the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of Canaccord’s financial analyses. Financial data of Lucas utilized in the analyses described
below were prepared by Lucas’ management. Financial data with respect to the assets to be acquired
and utilized in the analyses described below were prepared by Segundo management and provided to
Canaccord by Lucas management.

Canaccord reviewed, among other things, enterprise values of the selected companies, calculated as
equity value based on closing stock prices on December 30, 2015, plus book value of debt, plus the
liquidation value of preferred stock, less excess cash and cash equivalents, as multiples of latest net
daily production, expressed as dollar value per barrel of oil equivalent per day. Canaccord then
applied a range of selected multiples of latest net daily production, based on the median and mean
valuation multiples, derived from the selected companies to corresponding data of Segundo.
Canaccord also added the adjusted net value of undeveloped acreage to be acquired. Financial data
of the selected companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates and public
filings. Financial data of Lucas were based on internal financial data prepared by Segundo’s
management. This analysis indicated the following range of implied enterprise values as compared to
the original proposed Acquisition consideration:
Implied Enterprise Value Range Original Proposed Acquisition Consideration
$96.257 Million — $97.781 Million$80.698 Million

Canaccord reviewed transaction values in the selected transactions, calculated as the purchase price
multiples of acquired assets’ net daily production plus an adjustment for value of undeveloped
acreage. Canaccord then applied a range of selected multiples, based on the mean and median
valuation multiples, derived from the selected transactions to corresponding data of Segundo.
Multiples for the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of
announcement of the relevant transaction. Financial data of Segundo were based on internal financial
data prepared by Segundo’s management. This analysis indicated the following range of implied
enterprise values as compared to the original proposed Acquisition consideration:
Implied Enterprise Value Range
$100.657 Million — $111.780 Million$80.698 Million
Original Proposed Acquisition Consideration
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Canaccord reviewed a management prepared engineering report dated December 1, 2015 in order to
determine the present value of Segundo’s oil and natural gas reserves discounted at an industry
standard annual discount rate of 10% (“PV-10”). Canaccord further applied a 10% discount and
premium to the PV-10 value to establish a range of valuation. This analysis indicated the following
range of implied enterprise values as compared to the original proposed Acquisition consideration:
Implied Enterprise Value Range Original Proposed Acquisition Consideration
$83.657 Million — $102.247 Million$80.698 Million
In the two years prior to the issuance of its opinion, Canaccord has not had a material relationship with
Lucas or Segundo where compensation was received or that it contemplates will be received after the
closing of the Acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of the engagement of Canaccord, Lucas paid
Canaccord a fee of $170,000 upon delivery of the opinion. No portion of such fee is based upon
whether Canaccord delivered a favorable opinion with respect to the Acquisition, and such fee was not
contingent upon consummation of the Acquisition. Lucas also agreed to reimburse Canaccord for
reasonable expenses, and to indemnify Canaccord and related parties against certain liabilities arising
out of its engagement, including liabilities and expenses which may arise under the federal securities
laws.
Accounting Treatment
The Acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase of assets, so that the operating revenues and
expenses pertaining to the Assets will be included in our consolidated financial statements following
the Acquisition.
Tax Treatment
The transactions contemplated by the Acquisition are intended to constitute a single transaction for
purposes of Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, such that the Acquisition
is expected to be a tax-free transfer for the Sellers.
65
Regulatory Approvals
NYSE MKT Notification
Due to the number of shares of our Common Stock proposed to be issued in connection with the
Acquisition, we must file a notification with, and meet the initial listing standards of, NYSE MKT prior to
the closing of the Acquisition.
Securities and Exchange Commission and Applicable State Securities Commissions
The Acquisition Shares that will be issued to the Sellers in connection with the Acquisition will be
exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and/or
Regulation D thereunder, and similarly exempt from registration under applicable state securities laws.
Please note that the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable state securities
commissions do not provide regulatory review or approvals for these transactions.
We do not believe that any regulatory review or approvals are necessary.
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
The unaudited pro forma financial information presented below combine the historical financial
information of Lucas and the historical statements of revenues and direct operating expenses of the
Assets, giving effect to the Acquisition, as if it had occurred on March 31, 2016. The historical financial

Acquisition and (ii) factually supportable. With respect to the operational financial information, the pro
forma events must be expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. You should read
this information in conjunction with the:
●accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma financial information;
●

year ended March 31, 2016 included in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on July 13, 2016,

information (the “Notes”).
The pro forma financial information has been prepared based on information currently available to us,
using assumptions that our management believes are reasonable. The pro forma financial information
does not purport to represent the actual results of operations that would have occurred if the

necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved in the future. The pro forma
financial information includes certain reclassifications to conform the historical results of operations
of the Assets to our results of operations.
The assumptions used and adjustments made in preparing the pro forma financial information are
described in the Notes, which should be read in conjunction with the pro forma financial information.

LUCAS ENERGY, INC.
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION
The properties currently produce approximately 1,000 net barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) per day, of
which 53% are liquids, from 114 producing wells. The bulk of the production is from the Hunton
formation holding approximately 43,000 gross acres (9,900 net acres) in central Oklahoma.
Additionally, further, offset development drilling opportunities for at least 40 additional wells have been
identified.
As consideration for the acquisition, we agreed to assume $31,350,000 of commercial bank debt; issue
552,000 shares of newly designated Series B Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers and its affiliate,
which are under common control with the Seller Representative, with a total liquidation value of
$13,800,000; issue 13,009,664 shares of Common Stock to certain of the Sellers with a fair value of
$21,465,946; and pay $4,975,000 in cash to certain Sellers. Notwithstanding the above, in the event
there are any title or other material issues associated with the assets, the parties agreed to work in
good faith to address such issues, and if such issues cannot be addressed, to adjust the purchase
price, provided that no adjustment will be made unless such issues in aggregate total more than 5% of
the aggregate purchase price, and provided further that if such issues in aggregate total more than
20% of the aggregate purchase price, we can terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement. We and the
Sellers also agreed to a true-up for certain joint interest billings and authorization for expenditures at
and/or after closing, and to effect a true-up in connection with any material agreements, if the rights
thereto are not provided by the Sellers at closing.
Since the Asset Purchase agreement was entered into on December 30, 2015, the Company has
entered into the following transactions that have been deemed significant and are included in the
Combined Pro Forma financial statements under Other Significant Transactions.
Silver Star Notes
On February 10, 2016, we received additional funding per our letter of credit with Silver Star Oil
Company (“Silver Star”), and have therefore included the receipt of an additional $200,000, for which
the Company issued a convertible note. To date, the Company has drawn $1,000,000 under the line of
credit and issued five convertible notes.
We are seeking shareholder approval for the potential issuance of common shares upon conversion
of these notes exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding common stock. If all of the Silver Star notes were
converted at closing of the Asset Purchase agreement, 444,416 additional common shares would be
issued and outstanding. As the conversion is not a condition of the acquisition closing, we have made
no adjustments to the pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 or to the pro forma statements of
operations for the year ended March 31, 2016.
HFT Notes
On March 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement
with HFT Enterprises, LLC (“HFT”). The note purchase agreement provided us the right to sell up to
$600,000 in convertible promissory notes to HFT. To date, the Company has drawn $600,000 under the
note purchase agreement during the months of March and April 2016. The note purchase agreement
also included the issuance of 124,285 warrants that are exercisable at $1.50 per common share.
We are seeking shareholder approval for the potential issuance of common shares upon the
conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants issued HFT exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding
common stock. If the HFT notes and warrants were converted at closing of the Asset Purchase
agreement, 548,956 additional common shares would be issued and outstanding. As the conversion of
the note and the exercise of warrants are not conditions of the acquisition closing, we have made no
adjustments to the pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 or to the pro forma statements of
operations for the year ended March 31, 2016.
70
Securities Purchase Agreement
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase
Agreement”) with an accredited institutional investor, pursuant to which we sold and issued a
redeemable convertible subordinated debenture, with a face amount of $530,000, convertible into
163,077 shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $3.25 per share (the “Debenture”) and
a warrant to purchase 1,384,616 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment thereunder) at an
exercise price equal to $3.25 per share (the “First Warrant”). The accredited institutional investor
purchased the Debenture at a 5.0% original issue discount for the sum of $500,000 and agreed that it
will exercise the 1,384,616 warrants, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, for the sum of $4.5 million.
As a result of the inclusion of the warrants, we recorded the fair value of the warrants as a full discount
on the Debenture.
As the conversion of the Debenture and the exercise of the warrants are conditions to closing the
acquisition, we have recognized the additional 163,077 shares of common stock for conversion of the
Debenture and 1,384,661 shares of common stock for the exercise of the First Warrant as adjustments
to the pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 and to the pro forma statements of operations for
the year ended March 31, 2016.
Stock Purchase Agreement
Also on April 6, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”)
with the same accredited institutional investor as the Securities Purchase Agreement above, pursuant
to which we agreed, subject to certain conditions, to issue 527 shares of Series C redeemable
convertible preferred stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”)(with a face value of $5.26 million) at a 5%
original issue discount, convertible into 1,618,462 shares of common stock at a conversion price of
$3.25 per share, and a warrant to purchase 1,111,112 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$4.50 per share. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, 1,111,112 warrants and 53 shares
of Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and issued for $500,000 after the closing of the Asset Purchase
agreement, and assuming the Acquisition closes, the remaining 474 shares of Series C Preferred
Stock will be sold and issued for $4.5 million immediately after approval by our stockholders for NYSE
MKT purposes, of the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion/exercise
thereof, and at such time as there is an effective registration statement in place covering the shares of
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the 1,111,112
warrants.
As the issuance of the 527 shares of Series C preferred stock for $5,000,000 is a condition of closing,
we made adjustments to reflect the sale of the Series C preferred stock as well as recognizing the
original issue discount of 5.0% in the amount of $263,000 in the pro forma balance sheet as of March
31, 2016 and to the pro forma statements of operations for the year ended March 31, 2016,
As the exercise of the additional 1,111,112 warrants is not a condition to closing the Acquisition, we
have made no adjustments to the in the combined pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 or to
the combined pro forma statements of operations for the year ended March 31, 2016. However, we are
seeking shareholder approval for the potential issuance of common shares relating to the conversion
of the preferred shares and warrants exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding common stock. If the
preferred shares and warrants were converted, 2,729,574 additional common shares would be issued
and outstanding.
The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements are presented for illustrative purposes only
and do not purport to represent what our financial position or results of operations would have been if
the transactions had occurred as presented, or to project our financial position or results of
operations for any future periods. The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and
certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The pro forma adjustments are directly
attributable to the transactions and are expected to have a continuing impact on our results of
operations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements have been made.

2. PRO FORMA COMBINED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCING
ACTIVITIES (UNAUDITED)
The following unaudited supplemental pro forma oil and natural gas reserve tables present how the
combined oil and gas reserves and standardized measure information of the Lucas Energy, Inc. (the
“Company”) and the Properties may have appeared had the transaction occurred on April 1, 2015. The
Proforma Combined Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities are for illustrative
purposes only.
All of the reserves are located in the United States. Reserves are based as follows:
a)
For Lucas Energy, Inc. (As Reported) – as reported in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended March 31, 2016, upon a reserve report prepared by the independent petroleum
engineers of Ralph E. Davis Associates, LLC as of March 31, 2016.
b)
Acquisition (the Properties) – upon a reserve report prepared by the independent petroleum engineers
of Ralph E. Davis Associates, LLC as of January 1, 2016. For the Acquisition (the Properties), using the
reserve report prepared as of January 1, 2016, the Company mathematically “rolled forward” reserve
values from January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2016 by using actual sales volumes, prices, severance and
production taxes, and lease operating expense realized for each month between January 1, 2016 and
March 31, 2016 (the “Rollforward Data”). The source of the Rollforward Data is revenue and lease
operating data received from the Seller Representative for the relevant periods.

3. PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION
The table below summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired. This
allocation is for illustration purposes only and is based on the price of our Common Stock as of July
12, 2016 of $3.78. How the Acquisition is booked and any potential impairment to the Assets we are
acquiring will depend on the actual price of our Common Stock as of the time of closing the
Acquisition, which could differ materially from the price reflected in the table below:

Acquisition, measured at different hypothetical prices of our Common Stock ranging from $1.65 (the
price of our Common Stock on December 30, 2015 when the Asset Purchase Agreement was
executed) to $5.00. The actual price of our Common Stock at the time of closing the Acquisition could
differ materially from the prices reflected in the table below. If the price of our Common Stock at the
time of closing the Acquisition is above a certain level, there could be a potential significant
impairment to the Assets we are acquiring.

4. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
As pro forma adjustments related to the pro forma statement of operations are to be computed
assuming that the transaction was consummated at the beginning of the fiscal year presented and are
to include adjustments which give effect to events that are directly attributable to the transaction,
expected to have a continuing impact on the Company, and factually supportable, the Company
recognized the following pro forma adjustments to depletion and interest expenses.
Depletion Expense
The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas producing activities.
Therefore, costs of oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the units of production method,
and the amortization base is comprised of the total capitalized costs and total future investment costs
associated with all proved reserves.
In order to record the effects of the property acquisition under the full cost method, the Company is
required to combine its oil and gas properties and the acquired oil and gas properties for each period
presented. For the year ended March 31, 2016, the amortization rate for the acquired properties is
approximately $10/BOE while the amortization rate for the Company properties is approximately
$27/BOE. Calculation of the blended rate of the combined properties is approximately $16/BOE. The
higher blended BOE rate is a result of the business mix where the acquired properties are
approximately 90% natural gas and liquids compared to the Company properties, which are 100%
crude oil. Since the acquired properties also represent approximately 90% of the total production of
the combined entities, a pro form adjustment to depletion expense is required for the year ended
March 31, 2016.
Interest Expense
As the Company intends to enter into a new loan agreement for $40,000,000 at the closing of the
Acquisition, which is to have a three-year term and to bear an annual interest rate with a floor of 5.5%,
the Company has recorded an adjustment to recognize interest expense of $2,200,000 in the pro forma
statement of operations the year ended March 31, 2016.
Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties
In order to record the effects of the property acquisition under the full cost method, the Company is
required to perform an impairment test (ceiling test) at each reporting date, whereby the carrying value
of property and equipment is compared to the “estimated present value,” of its proved reserves
discounted at a 10-percent interest rate of future net revenues, based on current economic and
operating conditions at the end of the period, plus the cost of properties not being amortized, plus the
lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties included in costs being amortized, less the
income tax effects related to book and tax basis differences of the properties. If capitalized costs
exceed this limit, the excess is charged as an impairment expense. Therefore, the Company has
recorded an adjustment to recognize a $13.3 million impairment expense associated with oil and gas
properties as of March 31, 2016.

Audited Financial Information of Assets
The following statements of revenues and direct operating expenses of the Assets for the years ended
March 31, 2016 and 2015, including the notes thereto, are included in this proxy statement beginning at
page F-1. The statements of revenues and direct operating expenses of the Assets for the years ended
March 31, 2016 and 2015 were audited by GBH CPAs, PC, an independent registered public
accounting firm.
The full S-X Rule 3-05 financial statements and other financial information, including balance sheet and
cash flow information, are not available and not presented due to the following reasons: The Assets
were maintained as an asset and not a separate company in the accounting records of the Sellers;
therefore, the assets, liabilities, indirect operating costs and other expenses applicable to the
operations were not allocated to the Assets being acquired. Separate, audited financial statements of
the Assets have never been prepared and the Sellers have not maintained the distinct and separate
accounts necessary to present the full financial statements of the Assets. It would be extremely costly
and impractical to obtain complete financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles because separate financial statements were never historically required nor were
such statements ever prepared with respect to the Assets. The preparation of such statements would
involve many subjective assumptions, unreasonable effort and expense.

Reserves
The estimated net proved crude oil and natural gas reserves at January 1, 2016 were approximately 6.9
million Boe (Barrel of Oil Equivalent.) Additionally, there are 9.3 million Boe of probable reserves.
Natural gas equivalents are determined using a ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 Bbl of crude oil or
NGLs based on 42 gallons to 1 Bbl of crude oil.
A majority of the reserves are in leases in Lincoln, Logan and Payne Counties Oklahoma. Volumes
produced are valued using SEC guidelines in effect on December 31, 2015 and adjusted for pricing
differentials resulting in average monthly crude oil price of $45.44 per Bbl, natural gas price of $2.33
per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) and NGL pricing was held constant at $14.57 per Bbl for the life of the
property. The estimated discounted future net cash flow (PV-10) before tax expenses for our proved
reserves was approximately $24.2 million. The estimated capital costs as of January 1, 2016 to realize
the proved undeveloped reserves is approximately $4.8 million.

Proved reserves.    Proved reserves are those quantities, which, by analysis of geoscience and
engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a
given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions and operating
methods prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence
indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic
methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract hydrocarbons must have commenced or
the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a
reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the twelve-month period prior
to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic
average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are
defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
Reasonable certainty.    If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree
of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be
at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A
high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as
changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical),
engineering, and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably
certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
Probable reserves.    Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be
recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely not to be
recovered.
Booking Undeveloped Reserves
Certain undeveloped reserves, such as shale, are booked based on a reasonable certainty standard
where companies report undeveloped locations at distances greater than one legal offset from
economically producing wells. The Hunton reservoir, of which certain assets being purchased are a
part, is considered a conventional or traditional reservoir and subject to the more stringent booking
requirements where a proved undeveloped (PUD) drilling location must directly offset or adjacent to a
producing well.
Booking Hunton reserves is also impacted by a business decision to minimize leasehold and other
investment until drilling is imminent. This economic decision is made to preserve capital and made
possible by the rules in Oklahoma referred to as forced pooling. Through this process, an operator
can create a drilling unit without having leased the entire unit. Any unleased mineral owners will have
an election to either participate and become a working interest owner or sign-on as a lessor. From the
data available on the acreage being purchased, the operator ultimately leases a minimum of 95% of the
acreage in the unit. This allows the operator to more broadly deploy capital across a greater number of
units and gain a larger leasehold footprint.
However, a downside to this strategy is that reserves for undeveloped locations are booked consistent
with the amount of acreage that is owned in a drilling unit at the time of booking. If an operator has
leased 160 acres of a 640 acre drilling unit, then it may only book 25% of the value of a future well or
wells to be drilled in that unit. Once the well is drilled, the working interest will reflect the total
accumulation of interests including through pooling.

PROPOSAL TWO: APPROVAL OF ISSUANCE OF 390,290 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO
INTERNATIONAL BANK OF COMMERCE AS A FEE TO REFINANCE THE SELLERS’ DEBT BEING
ASSUMED IN THE ACQUISITION AND FINANCE THE CASH PORTION OF THE ACQUISITION
CONSIDERATION
General
In connection with the Acquisition, we have agreed to assume $31.35 million of the Sellers’ commercial
bank debt held by International Bank of Commerce (“IBC”) and to pay $4.975 million in cash to certain
of the Sellers upon the closing of the Acquisition. In order to finance the debt and cash portions of the
Acquisition consideration, at the closing of the Acquisition, we intend to enter into a three-year $40
million senior secured term loan (subject to a loan-to-value ratio of 50% or less) with IBC (the
“Refinancing”). In connection with the Refinancing, we intend to agree, among other things, to issue
390,290 shares of our Common Stock to IBC as an underwriting equity fee for the term loan.
Because the issuance of 390,290 shares of our Common Stock to IBC as an underwriting equity fee for
the term loan, when aggregated with the issuance of other securities in connection with financing the
Acquisition, would exceed 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and constitute a change in control
(as defined by NYSE MKT), Sections 712 and 713 of the NYSE MKT rules mandate stockholder
approval to issue any such shares of Common Stock. Accordingly, stockholder approval of this
proposal is being sought solely to comply with the NYSE MKT rules governing the issuance of
securities in connection with the acquisition of stock of another company when any such issuances in
the aggregate would exceed 20% of an issuer’s outstanding capital stock or constitute a change in
control (as defined by NYSE MKT). Our stockholders are not being asked to approve the terms of the
term loan with IBC.
Our Board has unanimously determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and our stockholders to issue 390,290 shares of our Common Stock to IBC as an underwriting equity
fee for the term loan, and unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote FOR approval of the
issuance of 390,290 shares of our Common Stock to IBC as an underwriting equity fee for the term
loan.
Reasons for the Issuance of Common Stock to IBC
Given our current balance sheet, our Board believes that the issuance of Common Stock to IBC, which
will facilitate the Refinancing, is necessary in order to obtain the funding required to consummate the
Acquisition.
Reasons for Stockholder Approval
Our Common Stock is listed on the NYSE MKT. Section 712(b) of the NYSE MKT rules requires
stockholder approval in connection with a transaction involving the issuance by the issuer of common
stock (or securities convertible into common stock) as sole or partial consideration for an acquisition
of assets where the present or potential issuance of common stock (or securities convertible into
common stock) could result in an increase in outstanding common shares of 20% or more. Section
713(a) of the NYSE MKT rules requires stockholder approval in connection with a transaction involving
the sale, issuance, or potential issuance by the issuer of common stock (or securities convertible into
common stock) equal to 20% or more of presently outstanding shares of common stock at a price less
than the greater of book value or market value. Section 713(b) of the NYSE MKT rules requires
stockholder approval in connection with a transaction involving the issuance or potential issuance of
additional shares which would result in a change of control of the issuer.
79
Because the issuance of 390,290 shares of our Common Stock to IBC as an underwriting equity fee for
the term loan, when aggregated with the issuance of other securities in connection with financing the
Acquisition, would exceed 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and constitute a change in control
(as defined by NYSE MKT), we are asking our stockholders to approve the issuance of 390,290 shares
of our Common Stock to IBC as an underwriting equity fee for the term loan. Stockholder approval of
this proposal is being sought solely to comply with Sections 712 and 713 of the NYSE MKT rules
governing the issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition when any such issuances in
the aggregate would exceed 20% of an issuer’s outstanding capital stock or might be considered a
change of control (as defined by NYSE MKT). Our stockholders are not, however, being asked to
approve the terms of the term loan with IBC.
Terms of the Financing
In order to finance the debt and cash portions of the Acquisition consideration, at the closing of the
Acquisition, we intend to enter into a three-year $40 million senior secured term loan (subject to a loan-
to-value ratio of 50% or less) with IBC. The term loan is expected to require repayment in monthly
installments of the greater of 50% of net monthly income or monthly principal and interest payments of
$425,000, and to require a sinking fund to be created with an initial deposit of $3.36 million to be used
for principal reductions. The term loan is expected to bear interest at the prime rate plus 2.0% with a
floor of 5.50%. We expect to be required to pay IBC (1) a loan commitment fee of $400,000, with half due
at closing and half due six months thereafter, (2) an annual engineering fee of $10,000, and (3) an
underwriting equity fee of 390,290 shares of Common Stock. Our obligations under the term loan are
expected to be secured by a first priority lien on various working interests in our oil and gas properties
located in Texas and Oklahoma.
Effect upon Rights of Existing Stockholders
Our current stockholders will continue to own their existing shares after the transaction described in
this proposal. Our stockholders are not participating in nor receiving any consideration from the
transaction described in this proposal. Our stockholders should not send in their share certificates
because their share certificates will not be exchanged in connection with the transaction described in
this proposal.
If stockholders approve this proposal, and we enter into the term loan with IBC and issue 390,290
shares of our Common Stock to IBC as an underwriting equity fee for the term loan, the principal effect
upon the rights of existing stockholders will be a dilution in their current percentage ownership in the
Company. IBC will hold in the aggregate approximately 2.6% of our outstanding voting securities upon
consummation of the Acquisition and the term loan. This percentage does not give effect to (i) the
issuance of securities in connection with any of the other proposals in this proxy statement other than
the Acquisition, (ii) the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to our other outstanding
options, warrants and convertible securities, or (iii) any other future issuances of our Common Stock.
The sale into the public market of the shares issued to IBC also could materially and adversely affect
the market price of our Common Stock.
If stockholders approve all of the proposals in this proxy statement, as a result of the issuance of the
Common Stock to IBC, we estimate the exercise price of our April 2014 warrants would be adjusted to
$7.01 per share (not taking into account securities issued in the Acquisition).
Interests of Directors, Officers and Affiliates
The term loan with IBC will be used in connection with the Acquisition in part to finance the
assumption of $31.35 million of the Sellers’ commercial bank debt held by IBC. Certain of the Sellers,
including Richard N. Azar II, who is the principal Seller and manager of the properties, are expected to
be directors or affiliates of ours after the Acquisition. Certain of the Sellers also are expected to be
guarantors under the term loan with IBC. Stockholders are urged to carefully consider the present and
future interests described above prior to voting on this Proposal Two.
80
Vote Required
A majority of the votes cast is required by the NYSE MKT rules to approve the issuance of 390,290
shares of our Common Stock to IBC as a fee to refinance the Sellers’ debt being assumed in the
Acquisition and finance the cash portion of the Acquisition consideration.
Consequences of Not Approving this Proposal
If we do not obtain stockholder approval of this Proposal at the Special Meeting, we will not be able to
obtain the term loan from IBC and, accordingly, we would not be able to consummate the Acquisition
or acquire the Assets.
Recommendation of Our Board
Our Board has unanimously determined that the issuance of 390,290 shares of our Common Stock to
IBC as an underwriting equity fee for the term loan is fair to, and advisable and in the best interests of,
the Company and our stockholders. Our Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote
“FOR” the issuance of 390,290 shares of our Common Stock to IBC as a fee to refinance the Sellers’
debt being assumed in the Acquisition and finance the cash portion of the Acquisition consideration.
81
PROPOSAL THREE: APPROVAL OF THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON
STOCK EXCEEDING 19.99% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, ISSUABLE UPON
CONVERSION OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST UNDER THE $530,000 FACE AMOUNT REDEEMABLE
CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE, INCLUDING SHARES ISSUABLE FOR CONVERSION
PREMIUMS THEREON, AND UPON EXERCISE OF THE WARRANT, INCLUDING SHARES ISSUABLE
FOR PREMIUMS AND CONVERSION PREMIUMS THEREON, ISSUED UNDER THE SECURITIES
PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AND RATIFICATION OF THE TERMS OF SUCH SECURITIES PURCHASE
AGREEMENT AND OF THE TERMS AND ISSUANCE OF SUCH REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE
SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE AND SUCH WARRANT
General
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Discover Growth Fund, an
accredited institutional investor (the “Investor”), pursuant to which we sold and issued a redeemable
convertible subordinated debenture, with a face amount of $530,000, convertible into 163,077 shares of
Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $3.25 per share (the “Debenture”) and a warrant to
purchase 1,384,616 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment thereunder) at an exercise price
equal to $3.25 per share. The Investor purchased the Debenture at a 5.0% original issue discount for
the sum of $500,000 and agreed that it will exercise the warrant, upon satisfaction of certain conditions,
for the sum of $4.5 million.
Our Board has unanimously determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and our stockholders to be able to issue shares of our Common Stock upon the conversion of
principal and interest under the Debenture (including shares issuable for conversion premiums
thereon) and upon exercise of the warrant (including shares issuable for premiums and conversion
premiums thereon), and unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote FOR approval of the
issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common
Stock, issuable upon conversion of principal and interest under the $530,000 face amount redeemable
convertible subordinated debenture, including shares issuable for conversion premiums thereon, and
upon exercise of the warrant, including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums
thereon, issued under the Securities Purchase Agreement, and ratification of the terms of such
Securities Purchase Agreement and of the terms and issuance of such redeemable convertible
subordinated debenture and such warrant.
Reasons for the Issuance
Our Board believes that the ability to issue shares of our Common Stock upon the conversion of
principal and interest under the Debenture (including shares issuable for conversion premiums
thereon) and upon exercise of the warrant (including shares issuable for premiums and conversion
premiums thereon) will improve our balance sheet.
Reasons for Stockholder Approval
Our Common Stock is listed on the NYSE MKT. Section 713(a) of the NYSE MKT rules requires
stockholder approval in connection with a transaction involving the sale, issuance, or potential
issuance by the issuer of common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) equal to 20% or
more of presently outstanding shares of common stock at a price less than the greater of book value
or market value. Section 713(b) of the NYSE MKT rules requires stockholder approval in connection
with a transaction involving the issuance or potential issuance of additional shares which would result
in a change of control of the issuer.

Because the shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Debenture and exercise of
the warrant represent greater than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and may constitute a
change in control (as defined by NYSE MKT), we are asking our stockholders to approve the issuance
of such number of shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock,
issuable upon conversion of principal and interest under the $530,000 face amount redeemable
convertible subordinated debenture, including shares issuable for conversion premiums thereon, and
upon exercise of the warrant, including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums
thereon, issued under the Securities Purchase Agreement, and ratify the terms of such Securities
Purchase Agreement and the terms and issuance of such redeemable convertible subordinated
debenture and such warrant.
Stockholder approval of this proposal is being sought solely to comply with Section 713 of the NYSE
MKT rules governing the issuance of securities when any such issuances in the aggregate would
exceed 20% of an issuer’s outstanding capital stock or might be considered a change of control (as
defined by NYSE MKT).
Description of Debenture and Warrant
The Debenture matures in seven years and accrues interest at a rate of 6.0% per annum, subject to
adjustment as provided in the Debenture. The Debenture converts into shares of common stock at
$3.25 per share automatically upon the earlier of (i) the maturity date or (ii) the last to occur of the
closing of the Acquisition or the date on which certain equity conditions (as defined in the Debenture)
have been met. The Debenture also may be converted into shares of common stock at $3.25 per share
(i) in the sole and absolute discretion of Investor at any time or times after issuance, or (ii) at our option
if certain equity conditions are met. Upon conversion of the Debenture, we will pay a conversion
premium equal to the amount of unpaid interest that would have otherwise been due if the Debenture
had been held through the maturity date, with respect to the portion of Debenture being converted.
Accrued interest under the Debenture is payable upon conversion, redemption or maturity of the
Debenture, in cash or, at our discretion, shares of common stock calculated by using 95% of the
average of the lowest 5 individual daily volume weighted average prices during the measuring period,
not to exceed 100% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of such period, less $0.05 per share of
common stock. Following a default trigger event (as defined in the Debenture), the number of shares to
be issued will be calculated by using 85% of the average of the lowest 5 individual daily volume
weighted average prices during the measuring period, less $0.10 per share of Common Stock not to
exceed 85% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of such period less $0.10 per share.
The interest rate on the Debenture will adjust upward by 100 basis points for each $0.10 that the
volume weighted average price of our Common Stock on any trading day as of which the interest rate
is determined and calculated is below $2.75, subject to a maximum interest rate of 24.95%. The interest
rate also will adjust upward by 10.0% following the occurrence of any trigger event. The interest rate on
the Debenture will adjust downward by 100 basis points for each $0.10 that the volume weighted
average price of our Common Stock on any trading day as of which the interest rate is determined and
calculated is above $3.75, subject to a minimum interest rate of 0%.
To the extent the Debenture has not automatically converted in full into shares of common stock prior
to the maturity date, the face value of the outstanding Debenture, together with all interest accrued
thereunder, is payable in cash by us on the maturity date. Prior to the maturity date, provided that no
trigger event has occurred (as defined in the Debenture), we have the right at any time upon 30 trading
days’ prior written notice to redeem all or any portion of the Debenture then outstanding by paying the
investor in cash an amount per portion of Debenture equal to the face value, plus the interest payable
as if such portion was outstanding until the maturity date, minus any interest already paid for such
portion. The outstanding Debenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest, automatically
becomes payable in the event of a deemed liquidation event (as defined in the Debenture).
83
The warrant entitles the Investor, upon exercise thereof, to purchase 1,384,616 shares of Common
Stock at a purchase price of $3.25 per share. The warrant will be automatically exercised upon the last
to occur of the approval by our stockholders of this Proposal, the Acquisition, and the registration
statement for the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Debenture
and exercise of the warrant being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
warrant accrues a premium at a rate equal to 6.0% per annum, subject to adjustment as provided in the
warrant, payable upon redemption or exercise. Upon exercise of the warrant, we will pay the
conversion premium that would have otherwise been due if the warrant had been held through the
maturity date, with respect to the portion of warrant being exercised. The warrant may not be exercised
on a cashless basis.
The conversion premium under the warrant is payable and adjustable on the same terms and
conditions as accrued interest is payable and adjustable under the Debenture. The warrant has a
maturity date that is seven years after the date of issuance and, if the warrant has not been wholly
exercised into shares of Common Stock prior to such date, we may redeem the warrant on such date
by repaying to the Investor in cash the purchase price paid under the warrant. Prior to the maturity
date, provided that no trigger event has occurred (as defined in the warrant), we have the right at any
time upon 30 trading days’ prior written notice to redeem all or any portion of the warrant then
unexercised by paying Investor in cash an amount per portion of unexercised warrant equal to the
purchase price paid under the warrant, plus the conversion premium payable as if such portion was
unexercised until the maturity date, minus any conversion premium already paid for such portion. The
purchase price paid under the warrant, together with the conversion premium, automatically becomes
payable with respect to the unexercised portion of the warrant in the event of a liquidation, dissolution
or winding up by us.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may not issue shares of common stock upon conversion of the
Debenture or exercise of the warrant to the extent such conversion or exercise would result in the
Investor owning more than 4.99% of all Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to
such issuance, as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder; provided, however, that the Investor may increase such amount
to 9.99% upon not less than 61 days’ prior notice to us.
We also agreed that, subject to certain customary exceptions, (i) until 60 days after the registration
statement described above is declared effective, we will not issue or enter into an agreement to issue
any shares of Common Stock and (ii) until 6 months after the entire Debenture and warrant have been
converted, redeemed or exercised, we will not (1) enter into any agreement that in any way restricts our
ability to enter into any agreement, amendment or waiver with Investor, including without limitation any
agreement to offer, sell or issue to Investor any preferred stock, common stock or other securities or
(2) enter into any equity or convertible financing pursuant to which shares of Common Stock or
Common Stock equivalents may effectively be issued (i) at a discount, (ii) at a variable price, or (iii)
where the price or number of shares are subject to any type of variability or reset feature.
Please refer to the Securities Purchase Agreement and the exhibits contained therein, which are
attached as Annex C to this proxy statement, for further details.
84
Effect upon Rights of Existing Stockholders
Our current stockholders will continue to own their existing shares after the transaction described in
this proposal. If stockholders approve this proposal, the principal and interest under the Debenture
(including conversion premiums thereon) will be convertible into shares of Common Stock and the
warrant (including premiums and conversion premiums thereon) will be exercisable into shares of
Common Stock, each pursuant to the terms thereof, without additional stockholder approval.
If stockholders approve this proposal, the principal effect upon the rights of existing stockholders
upon the conversion of the Debenture and exercise of the warrant will be a dilution in their current
percentage ownership in the Company. Upon conversion of the Debenture and exercise of the
warrant, the Investor will hold in the aggregate approximately 47.1% of our outstanding shares of
Common Stock. This percentage does not give effect to (i) the issuance of shares of Common Stock
for interest, premiums or conversion premiums under the Debenture or warrant, (ii) the issuance of
securities in connection with any of the other proposals in this proxy statement, (iii) the issuance of
shares of Common Stock pursuant to our other outstanding options, warrants and convertible
securities, or (iv) any other future issuances of our Common Stock. The issuance of shares of
Common Stock pursuant to the conversion of the Debenture and exercise of the warrant, and the sale
of such shares by Investor into the public market, also could materially and adversely affect the market
price of our Common Stock.
The total number of shares of Common Stock potentially issuable in connection with Proposal Three
is approximately 5,000,000, which consists of approximately (i) 163,077 shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the principal amount of the Debenture, (ii) 1,384,616 shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the First Warrant, and (iii) 3,452,307 additional shares of Common
Stock that the Company may issue, at its sole discretion in lieu of cash, as conversion premiums or in
payment of interest on such Debenture and First Warrant, assuming the payment of interest on the
Debenture and the payment of the conversion premiums on the First Warrant solely in shares of
Common Stock, for a period of seven years, which is the maturity date of each of the securities. The
number of additional shares of Common Stock that the Company may issue as conversion premiums
or in payment of interest is dependent on the interest rate and conversion premium rate which can
range from 0% to 24.95% depending on the Company’s underlying stock price at the time of
conversion or maturity and assuming no triggering event has occurred. For purposes of the interest
and conversion premium calculations in the preceding sentences, the Company assumed (i) the
interest rate and conversion premium rate to be 16.0% per annum, and (ii) $1.63 to be 95% of the
average of the lowest 5 individual daily volume weighted average prices during the 30 trading day
period immediately prior to payment of the interest, dividends and conversion premiums, as
applicable, not to exceed 100% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of such period, less $0.05 per
share of Common Stock (the “VWAP Measurement”) with respect to the Debenture and First Warrant.
If the VWAP Measurement is, in any case, an amount less than the amount assumed in the preceding
sentences and/or the interest rate and conversion premium rate is, in any case, higher than the rate
assumed in the preceding sentences, additional shares of Common Stock will be issuable.
As a result of the issuance of the Debenture and related warrant, the exercise price of our April 2014
warrants was adjusted to $10.17 per share.
Interests of Directors, Officers and Affiliates
None of our current directors, officers or affiliates has an interest in the Debenture or warrant.
Registration Rights
We have agreed to register for resale the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Debenture and exercise of the warrant. Upon such registration, these shares will be freely tradable in
the public market without restriction (other than restrictions imposed on any affiliates of the Company).
Vote Required
A majority of the votes cast is required by the NYSE MKT rules to approve the issuance of such
number of shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable
upon conversion of principal and interest under the $530,000 face amount redeemable convertible
subordinated debenture, including shares issuable for conversion premiums thereon, and upon
exercise of the warrant, including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon,
issued under the Securities Purchase Agreement, and ratify the terms of such Securities Purchase
Agreement and the terms and issuance of such redeemable convertible subordinated debenture and
such warrant.
85
Consequences of Not Approving this Proposal
If we do not obtain stockholder approval of this Proposal at the Special Meeting, we will not receive
$4.5 million of proceeds from the Investor for the exercise of the warrant, we may become in default
under the terms of the Debenture, the warrant and our other agreements with Investor due to our
inability to issue shares of Common Stock, or we may be forced to repay the Debenture and redeem
the warrant in cash, and may need to obtain stockholder approval at a later date in order to effect the
conversion of the Debenture and exercise of the warrant into shares of Common Stock.
Recommendation of Our Board
Our Board has unanimously determined that the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the
conversion of the Debenture (including shares issuable for conversion premiums thereon) and
exercise of the warrant (including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon) is
fair to, and advisable and in the best interests of, the Company and our stockholders. Our Board
unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the issuance of such number of shares of
Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable upon conversion of
principal and interest under the $530,000 face amount redeemable convertible subordinated
debenture, including shares issuable for conversion premiums thereon, and upon exercise of the
warrant, including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon, issued under the
Securities Purchase Agreement, and ratification of the terms of such Securities Purchase Agreement
and of the terms and issuance of such redeemable convertible subordinated debenture and such
warrant.
86
PROPOSAL FOUR: APPROVAL OF THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON
STOCK EXCEEDING 19.99% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, ISSUABLE UPON
CONVERSION OF THE 527 SHARES OF NEWLY DESIGNATED SERIES C REDEEMABLE
CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, INCLUDING SHARES ISSUABLE FOR DIVIDENDS AND
CONVERSION PREMIUMS THEREON, AND UPON EXERCISE OF THE WARRANT, INCLUDING
SHARES ISSUABLE FOR PREMIUMS AND CONVERSION PREMIUMS THEREON, TO BE ISSUED
UNDER THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AND ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF UP TO AN
ADDITIONAL 4,473 SHARES OF NEWLY DESIGNATED SERIES C REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED STOCK, INCLUDING SHARES ISSUABLE FOR DIVIDENDS AND CONVERSION
PREMIUMS THEREON, THAT MAY BE SOLD TO THE SAME INVESTOR ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE
SAME TERMS WITHIN 90 DAYS AFTER STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, AND RATIFICATION OF THE
TERMS OF SUCH STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND OF THE TERMS AND ISSUANCE OF SUCH
SERIES C REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND SUCH WARRANT
General
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Discover Growth Fund, an
accredited investor (the “Investor”), pursuant to which we agreed, subject to certain conditions, to
issue 527 shares of newly designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Series C
Preferred Stock”) at a 5% original issue discount, convertible into 1,618,462 shares of Common Stock
at a conversion price of $3.25 per share, and a warrant to purchase 1,111,112 shares of Common Stock
at an exercise price of $4.50 per share. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the warrant
and 53 shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and issued for $500,000 after the Acquisition
closes, and, assuming the Acquisition closes, the remaining 474 shares of Series C Preferred Stock
will be sold and issued for $4.5 million immediately after this Proposal is approved by our stockholders
and there is an effective registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the warrant.
Potential Issuances of Additional Authorized Series C Preferred Stock to Investor
Following the completion of the transactions under the Stock Purchase Agreement, we may decide to
issue up to the remaining 4,473 authorized shares of Series C Preferred Stock to the same Investor on
substantially the same terms contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement. If our stockholders approve
this proposal at the Special Meeting, then we would be able to issue any remaining shares of Series C
Preferred Stock to the same Investor on substantially the same terms and the issuance of Common
Stock upon conversion of such remaining shares of Series C Preferred Stock, including shares
issuable for dividends and conversion premiums thereon, would not be limited by, or require further
stockholder approval under, applicable NYSE MKT listing rules. Approval of this proposal would not
apply to (i) the issuance of any remaining Series C Preferred Stock to an investor other than the
current Investor under the Stock Purchase Agreement, or (ii) the issuance of any remaining Series C
Preferred Stock on terms that were significantly different than those contained in the Stock Purchase
Agreement. We do not currently have any agreements in place regarding the issuance and sale of
Series C Preferred Stock other than the Stock Purchase Agreement. There is no assurance that we
would actually issue any of the remaining shares of Series C Preferred Stock to the Investor on
substantially the same terms if our stockholders approve this proposal at the Special Meeting.
87
Our Board has unanimously determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and our stockholders to be able to issue shares of our Common Stock upon the conversion of the
Series C Preferred Stock (including shares issuable for dividends and conversion premiums thereon)
and upon exercise of the warrant (including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums
thereon), and unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote FOR approval of the issuance of
such number of shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock,
issuable upon conversion of the 527 shares of newly designated Series C redeemable convertible
preferred stock, including shares issuable for dividends and conversion premiums thereon, and upon
exercise of the warrant, including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon, to
be issued under the Stock Purchase Agreement, and issuable upon conversion of up to an additional
4,473 shares of newly designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, including shares
issuable for dividends and conversion premiums thereon, that may be sold to the same investor on
substantially the same terms within 90 days after stockholder approval, and ratification of the terms of
such Stock Purchase Agreement and of the terms and issuance of such Series C redeemable
convertible preferred stock and such warrant.
Reasons for the Issuance
Our Board believes that the ability to issue shares of our Common Stock upon the conversion of the
Series C Preferred Stock and upon exercise of the warrant will improve our balance sheet.
Reasons for Stockholder Approval
Our Common Stock is listed on the NYSE MKT. Section 713(a) of the NYSE MKT rules requires
stockholder approval in connection with a transaction involving the sale, issuance, or potential
issuance by the issuer of common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) equal to 20% or
more of presently outstanding shares of common stock at a price less than the greater of book value
or market value. Section 713(b) of the NYSE MKT rules requires stockholder approval in connection
with a transaction involving the issuance or potential issuance of additional shares which would result
in a change of control of the issuer.
Because the shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock
(including shares issuable for dividends and conversion premiums thereon) and exercise of the
warrant (including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon) represent greater
than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and may constitute a change in control (as defined by
NYSE MKT), we are asking our stockholders to approve the issuance of such number of shares of
Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable upon conversion of
the 527 shares of newly designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, including shares
issuable for dividends and conversion premiums thereon, and upon exercise of the warrant, including
shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon, to be issued under the Stock
Purchase Agreement, and issuable upon conversion of up to an additional 4,473 shares of newly
designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, including shares issuable for dividends
and conversion premiums thereon, that may be sold to the same investor on substantially the same
terms within 90 days after stockholder approval, and ratify the terms of such Stock Purchase
Agreement and the terms and issuance of such Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock and
such warrant.
Stockholder approval of this proposal is being sought solely to comply with Section 713 of the NYSE
MKT rules governing the issuance of securities when any such issuances in the aggregate would
exceed 20% of an issuer’s outstanding capital stock or might be considered a change of control (as
defined by NYSE MKT).
88
Description of Series C Preferred Stock and Warrant
Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to cumulative dividends in the amount of 6.0%
per annum, payable upon redemption, conversion, or maturity, and when, as and if declared by our
Board of Directors in its discretion. The Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Common Stock
and pari passu with respect to our Series B Preferred Stock.
The Series C Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock at any time at the option
of the holder, or at our option if certain equity conditions (as defined in the Certificate of Designation)
are met. Upon conversion, we will pay the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock being converted a
conversion premium equal to the amount of dividends that such shares would have otherwise earned
if they had been held through the maturity date, and issue to the holders such number of shares of
Common stock equal to $10,000 per share of Series C Preferred Stock (the “Face Value”) multiplied by
the number of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock divided by the conversion rate.
The conversion premium under the Series C Preferred Stock is payable and the dividend rate under
the Series C Preferred Stock is adjustable on the same terms and conditions as accrued interest is
payable and adjustable under the Debenture described under Proposal Three in this proxy statement.
The Series C Preferred Stock has a maturity date that is seven years after the date of issuance and, if
the Series C Preferred Stock has not been wholly converted into shares of Common Stock prior to
such date, we may redeem the Series C Preferred Stock on such date by repaying to the Investor in
cash 100% of the Face Value plus an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon. Prior
to the maturity date, provided that no trigger event has occurred (as defined in the Certificate of
Designation), we have the right at any time upon 30 trading days’ prior written notice to redeem all or
any portion of the Series C Preferred Stock by paying Investor in cash 100% of the Face Value, plus
the conversion premium, minus any dividends already paid on the Series C Preferred Stock being
redeemed. 100% of the Face Value, plus an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid dividends
thereon, automatically becomes payable in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up by us.
We may not issue any other Preferred Stock (other than the Series B Preferred Stock) that is pari
passu or senior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to any rights for a period of one year after
the earlier of such date (i) a registration statement is effective and available for the resale of all shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, or (ii) Securities Act Rule
144 is available for the immediate unrestricted resale of all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock.
The warrant entitles the Investor, upon exercise thereof, to purchase 1,111,112 shares of Common
Stock at a purchase price of $4.50 per share. The warrant has the same terms and conditions as the
warrant described under Proposal Three in this proxy statement, except that (i) it may be exercised
before March 31, 2017 by mutual agreement of us and Investor upon delivery of notice from us or
Investor, (ii) the exercise price is $4.50 per share and (iii) the conversion premium adjustment
thresholds are set at $4.00 and $5.00, respectively.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may not issue shares of common stock upon conversion of the
Series C Preferred Stock or exercise of the warrant to the extent such conversion or exercise would
result in the Investor owning more than 4.99% of all Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to such issuance, as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; provided, however, that the Investor may
increase such amount to 9.99% upon not less than 61 days’ prior notice to us.
We also agreed that, subject to certain customary exceptions, (i) until 60 days after the registration
statement described above is declared effective, we will not issue or enter into an agreement to issue
any shares of Common Stock and (ii) until 6 months after the entire Series C Preferred Stock and
warrant have been converted, redeemed or exercised, we will not (1) enter into any agreement that in
any way restricts our ability to enter into any agreement, amendment or waiver with Investor, including
without limitation any agreement to offer, sell or issue to Investor any preferred stock, common stock
or other securities or (2) enter into any equity or convertible financing pursuant to which shares of
Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents may effectively be issued (i) at a discount, (ii) at a
variable price, or (iii) where the price or number of shares are subject to any type of variability or reset
feature.

Please refer to the Stock Purchase Agreement and the exhibits contained therein, which are attached
as Annex D to this proxy statement, for further details.
Effect upon Rights of Existing Stockholders
Our current stockholders will continue to own their existing shares after the transaction described in
this proposal. If stockholders approve this proposal, the Series C Preferred Stock (including dividends
and conversion premiums thereon) will be convertible into shares of Common Stock and the warrant
(including premiums and conversion premiums thereon) will be exercisable into shares of Common
Stock, each pursuant to the terms thereof, without additional stockholder approval.
If stockholders approve this proposal, the principal effect upon the rights of existing stockholders
upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the warrant will be a dilution in
their current percentage ownership in the Company. Upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock
and exercise of the warrant, the Investor will hold in the aggregate approximately 61.1% of our
outstanding shares of Common Stock. This percentage does not give effect to (i) the issuance of
shares of Common Stock for dividends, premiums or conversion premiums under the Series C
Preferred Stock or warrant, (ii) the issuance of securities in connection with any of the other proposals
in this proxy statement, (iii) the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to our other
outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities, or (iv) any other future issuances of our
Common Stock. The issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the conversion of the Series C
Preferred Stock and exercise of the warrant, and the sale of such shares by such holders into the
public market, also could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.
If stockholders approve all of the proposals in this proxy statement, and the Series C Preferred Stock
and related warrant are issued, we estimate the exercise price of our April 2014 warrants would be
adjusted to $7.40 per share (not taking into account securities issued in the Acquisition).
The total number of shares of Common Stock potentially issuable in connection with Proposal Four is
approximately 9,779,390, which consists of approximately (i) 1,618,462 shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, (ii) 1,111,112 shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Second Warrant, and (iii) 7,049,816 additional shares of Common Stock
that the Company may issue, at its sole discretion in lieu of cash, as conversion premiums or in
payment of interest or dividends on such Series C Preferred Stock and Second Warrant, assuming the
payment of dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock and the payment of the conversion premiums
on the Second Warrant solely in shares of Common Stock, for a period of seven years, which is the
maturity date of each of the securities. The number of additional shares of Common Stock that the
Company may issue as conversion premiums or in payment of dividends is dependent on the
dividend rate and conversion premium rate which can range from 0% to 24.95% depending on the
Company’s underlying stock price at the time of conversion or maturity and assuming no triggering
event has occurred. For purposes of the dividend and conversion premium calculations in the
preceding sentences, the Company assumed (i) the dividend rate and conversion premium rate to be
16.0% per annum, and (ii) $1.63 to be 95% of the average of the lowest 5 individual daily volume
weighted average prices during the 30 trading day period immediately prior to payment of the interest,
dividends and conversion premiums, as applicable, not to exceed 100% of the lowest sales prices on
the last day of such period, less $0.05 per share of Common Stock (the “VWAP Measurement”) with
respect to the Series C Preferred Stock and Second Warrant. If the VWAP Measurement is, in any case,
an amount less than the amount assumed in the preceding sentences and/or the interest rate,
dividend rate and conversion premium rate is, in any case, higher than the rate assumed in the
preceding sentences, additional shares of Common Stock will be issuable. In the event the Company
issues the remaining 4,473 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, approximately (i) 13,763,077 shares of
Common Stock will be issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and (iii) 30,734,724
additional shares of Common Stock may be issued by the Company, at its sole discretion in lieu of
cash, as conversion premiums or in payment of dividends on such Series C Preferred Stock, based on
the same assumptions set forth in this paragraph.
Interests of Directors, Officers and Affiliates
None of our current directors, officers or affiliates has an interest in the Series C Preferred Stock or
warrant.
Registration Rights
We have agreed to register for resale the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the warrant. Upon such registration, these shares will be
freely tradable in the public market without restriction (other than restrictions imposed on any affiliates
of the Company).
Vote Required
A majority of the votes cast is required by the NYSE MKT rules to approve the issuance of such
number of shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable
upon conversion of the 527 shares of newly designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred
stock, including shares issuable for dividends and conversion premiums thereon, and upon exercise
of the warrant, including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon, to be
issued under the Stock Purchase Agreement, and issuable upon conversion of up to an additional
4,473 shares of newly designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, including shares
issuable for dividends and conversion premiums thereon, that may be sold to the same investor on
substantially the same terms within 90 days after stockholder approval, and ratify the terms of such
Stock Purchase Agreement and the terms and issuance of such Series C redeemable convertible
preferred stock and such warrant.
90
Consequences of Not Approving this Proposal
If we do not obtain stockholder approval of this Proposal at the Special Meeting, we will not receive $10
million in proceeds from the Investor, we may become in default under the terms of the Series C
Preferred Stock, the warrant and our other agreements with Investor due to our inability to issue
shares of Common Stock, or we may be forced to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock and the warrant
in cash, and may need to obtain stockholder approval at a later date in order to effect the conversion
of the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the warrant into shares of Common Stock.
Recommendation of Our Board
Our Board has unanimously determined that the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the
conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock (including shares issuable for dividends and conversion
premiums thereon) and exercise of the warrant (including shares issuable for premiums and
conversion premiums thereon) is fair to, and advisable and in the best interests of, the Company and
our stockholders. Our Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the issuance of
such number of shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock,
issuable upon conversion of the 527 shares of newly designated Series C redeemable convertible
preferred stock, including shares issuable for dividends and conversion premiums thereon, and upon
exercise of the warrant, including shares issuable for premiums and conversion premiums thereon, to
be issued under the Stock Purchase Agreement, and issuable upon conversion of up to an additional
4,473 shares of newly designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock, including shares
issuable for dividends and conversion premiums thereon, that may be sold to the same investor on
substantially the same terms within 90 days after stockholder approval, and ratification of the terms of
such Stock Purchase Agreement and of the terms and issuance of such Series C redeemable
convertible preferred stock and such warrant.
91
PROPOSAL FIVE: APPROVAL OF THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON
STOCK EXCEEDING 19.99% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, ISSUABLE UPON
CONVERSION OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST UNDER CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES AND
UPON EXERCISE OF WARRANTS ISSUED OR TO BE ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE LINE OF
CREDIT, THE NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, THE LINE OF CREDIT AMENDMENT OR, WITHIN 90
DAYS AFTER STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, SIMILAR FUTURE FACILITIES ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE
SAME OR BETTER TERMS, NOT TO EXCEED $3.0 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL
AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES AND NOT TO EXCEED WARRANTS TO
PURCHASE 500,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN THE AGGREGATE
Line of Credit and Convertible Note Purchase Agreement
On August 30, 2015, we entered into a Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Line
of Credit”) with Silver Star Oil Company (“Silver Star”). The Line of Credit, which had an effective date
of August 28, 2015, provided us the right, from time to time, subject to the terms of the Line of Credit, to
sell up to $2.4 million in convertible promissory notes. Under the terms of the Line of Credit, we issued
$1 million in convertible promissory notes to Silver Star pursuant to notes effective on September 28,
2015, October 21, 2015, November 23, 2015, December 31, 2015 and February 8, 2016 (collectively, the
“Silver Star Notes”). All of the Silver Star Notes have been assigned to other parties, including a
portion to Target Alliance London Limited.
To date, we have had difficulty in obtaining the remaining funding required from Silver Star under the
Line of Credit. In an effort to raise funding for ongoing expenses and as a replacement for the amounts
previously sought from Silver Star, on March 29, 2016, and effective March 11, 2016, we entered into a
Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with HFT
Enterprises, LLC (“HFT”). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed to sell and HFT
agreed to purchase, an aggregate of $600,000 in convertible promissory notes, including $300,000 in
convertible promissory notes purchased on March 29, 2016, to be effective on March 11, 2016,
$150,000 in convertible promissory notes purchased on March 29, 2016, to be effective on March 25,
2016, and $150,000 in convertible promissory notes required to be purchased by HFT or its assigns on
or prior to April 30, 2016. We also agreed to issue HFT warrants to purchase 124,285 shares of
common stock with an exercise price of $1.50 per share, at such time as an aggregate of $600,000 in
convertible promissory notes have been sold.
On April 11, 2016, we entered into an Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit and
Notes Agreement (the “Line of Credit Amendment”) with Target Alliance London Limited, pursuant to
which we agreed to issue the remaining $1.4 million in convertible promissory notes under the Line of
Credit at a conversion price of $3.25 per share to Target Alliance London Limited and to issue warrants
to purchase 51,562 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.25 per share for each $250,000
in convertible promissory notes that are issued to Target Alliance London Limited.
Potential Issuances of Additional Convertible Promissory Notes and Warrants
If we have any difficulty obtaining the remaining funding under the Line of Credit, Note Purchase
Agreement or Line of Credit Amendment described above, we may decide to issue the remaining
principal amount of Convertible Promissory Notes and related warrants on substantially the same or
better terms contained in the Line of Credit, Note Purchase Agreement or Line of Credit Amendment. If
our stockholders approve this proposal at the Special Meeting, then we would be able to issue such
remaining Convertible Promissory Notes and related warrants on substantially the same or better
terms and the issuance of Common Stock upon conversion of such Convertible Promissory Notes
and exercise of such warrants would not be limited by, or require further stockholder approval under,
applicable NYSE MKT listing rules. As of the Record Date, we do not have any agreements in place
regarding the issuance and sale of the remaining Convertible Promissory Notes and related warrants
other than the Line of Credit, the Note Purchase Agreement and the Line of Credit Amendment. There
is no assurance that we would actually issue any of the remaining Convertible Promissory Notes and
related warrants on substantially the same or better terms if our stockholders approve this proposal at
the Special Meeting.
92
Our Board has unanimously determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and our stockholders to be able to issue shares of our Common Stock upon conversion of principal
and interest under convertible promissory notes and upon exercise of warrants issued or to be issued
in connection with the Line of Credit, the Note Purchase Agreement, the Line of Credit Amendment or
similar future facilities on substantially the same or better terms, and unanimously recommends that
the stockholders vote FOR approval of the issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock
exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable upon conversion of principal and
interest under convertible promissory notes and upon exercise of warrants issued or to be issued in
connection with the Line of Credit, the Note Purchase Agreement, the Line of Credit Amendment or,
within 90 days after stockholder approval, similar future facilities on substantially the same or better
terms, not to exceed $3.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory notes
and not to exceed warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate.
Reasons for the Issuance
Our Board believes that the ability to issue shares of our Common Stock upon the conversion of
principal and interest under the convertible promissory notes and upon exercise of warrants will
improve our balance sheet.
Reasons for Stockholder Approval
Our Common Stock is listed on the NYSE MKT. Section 713(a) of the NYSE MKT rules requires
stockholder approval in connection with a transaction involving the sale, issuance, or potential
issuance by the issuer of common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) equal to 20% or
more of presently outstanding shares of common stock at a price less than the greater of book value
or market value. Section 713(b) of the NYSE MKT rules requires stockholder approval in connection
with a transaction involving the issuance or potential issuance of additional shares which would result
in a change of control of the issuer.
Because the shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion of principal and interest under
convertible promissory notes and upon exercise of warrants issued or to be issued in connection with
the Line of Credit, the Note Purchase Agreement, the Line of Credit Amendment or similar future
facilities on substantially the same or better terms, represent greater than 20% of our outstanding
Common Stock and may constitute a change in control (as defined by NYSE MKT), we are asking our
stockholders to approve the issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99%
of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable upon conversion of principal and interest under
convertible promissory notes and upon exercise of warrants issued or to be issued in connection with
the Line of Credit, the Note Purchase Agreement, the Line of Credit Amendment or, within 90 days after
stockholder approval, similar future facilities on substantially the same or better terms, not to exceed
$3.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory notes and not to exceed
warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate.
93
Stockholder approval of this proposal is being sought solely to comply with Section 713 of the NYSE
MKT rules governing the issuance of securities when any such issuances in the aggregate would
exceed 20% of an issuer’s outstanding capital stock or might be considered a change of control (as
defined by NYSE MKT). Our stockholders are not being asked to approve the Line of Credit, Note
Purchase Agreement, Line of Credit Amendment or similar future facilities, the convertible promissory
notes or the warrants.
Description of Convertible Promissory Notes and Warrants
The Silver Star Notes are due and payable on October 1, 2016. The HFT convertible promissory notes
are due and payable on the anniversary of their respective issuance dates. The Target Alliance
London Limited convertible promissory notes are due and payable on April 11, 2017 unless otherwise
agreed between the parties. All the convertible promissory notes accrue interest at the rate of 6% per
annum (15% upon the occurrence of an event of default), and allow the holder thereof the right to
convert the principal and interest due thereunder into Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.50
per share with respect to the Silver Star Notes and HFT convertible promissory notes and at a
conversion price of $3.25 per share with respect to the Target Alliance London Limited convertible
promissory notes, provided that any conversion is subject to us first receiving approval for the
issuance of shares of our common stock under the convertible promissory notes under applicable
NYSE MKT rules and regulations. We have the right to prepay the convertible promissory notes. The
convertible promissory notes include customary events of default for facilities of similar nature and
size.
The warrants allow for cashless exercise rights, to the extent that such shares of common stock
issuable upon exercise thereof are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
include anti-dilutive rights, for the first 12 months following the issuance date of such warrants, which
automatically reduce the exercise price of the warrants to any lower priced security sold, granted or
issued by us during such anti-dilutive period, subject to certain exceptions, including officer and
director grants and the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition. The warrants issuable under the
Note Purchase Agreement have an exercise price of $1.50 per share and the warrants issuable under
the Line of Credit Amendment have an exercise price of $3.25 per share.
At no time may the convertible promissory notes be converted, or the warrants be exercised, into
shares of our common stock if such conversion or exercise, as applicable, would result in the holder
of such security and its affiliates owning an aggregate of in excess of 9.99% of the then outstanding
shares of our common stock, subject to the ability of holder to modify such limitation with 61 days
prior written notice to us.
Please refer to the Line of Credit, form of Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement, Line of
Credit Amendment, form of Convertible Promissory Note and form of warrant, which are attached as
Annex E to this proxy statement, for further details.
Effect upon Rights of Existing Stockholders
Our current stockholders will continue to own their existing shares after the transactions described in
this proposal. If stockholders approve this proposal, the holders of the convertible promissory notes
and warrants will be permitted to convert their respective convertible promissory notes and exercise
their respective warrants into shares of Common Stock, pursuant to the terms thereof, without
additional stockholder approval. Assuming $3.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of
convertible promissory notes and warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of Common Stock are issued,
upon the conversion of the convertible promissory notes and exercise of the warrants, approximately
1,997,435 shares of Common Stock, in the aggregate, will be issued to the holders thereof on account
of the principal payable under the convertible promissory notes and on account of the exercise of the
warrants, and additional shares of Common Stock may be issued with respect to accrued and unpaid
interest payable under the convertible promissory notes.
The total number of shares of Common Stock potentially issuable in connection with Proposal Five is
approximately 4,620,315, which consists of approximately (i) 3,497,436 shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the various convertible notes issued or potentially to be issued, (ii)
913,033 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the various warrants issued or potentially
to be issued, and (iii) 209,846 additional shares of Common Stock that the Company may issue in
payment of interest on the various convertible notes, for a period of one year, which is the maturity
date of each of the securities.
94
The principal effect upon the rights of existing stockholders upon the conversion of the convertible
promissory notes and exercise of warrants will be a dilution in their current percentage ownership in
the Company. Assuming $3.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory
notes and warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of Common Stock are issued, the holders of the
convertible promissory notes and warrants, upon conversion and exercise thereof, will hold in the
aggregate approximately 52.3% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. This percentage does
not give effect to (i) the issuance of shares of Common Stock with respect to accrued and unpaid
interest payable under the convertible promissory notes or upon exercise of any warrants issued in
connection with convertible promissory notes, (ii) the issuance of securities in connection with any of
the other proposals in this proxy statement, (iii) the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to
our other outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities or (iv) any other future issuances of
our Common Stock. The issuance of shares of Common Stock to the holders of the convertible
promissory notes and related warrants, and the sale of such shares by such holders into the public
market, also could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.
As a result of the issuance of the convertible promissory notes through the Record Date, the exercise
price of our April 2014 warrants was adjusted to $9.75 per share. If stockholders approve all of the
proposals in this proxy statement and we issue the additional convertible promissory notes and
related warrants, we estimate the exercise price of our April 2014 warrants would be adjusted to $6.38
per share (not taking into account securities issued in the Acquisition).
Interests of Directors, Officers and Affiliates
None of our current directors, officers or affiliates has an interest in the convertible promissory notes
or warrants.
Registration Rights
We have agreed to register for resale the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
certain of the convertible promissory notes and exercise of the warrants, subject to certain conditions.
Upon such registration, these shares will be freely tradable in the public market without restriction
(other than restrictions imposed on any affiliates of the Company).
Vote Required
A majority of the votes cast is required by the NYSE MKT rules to approve the issuance of such
number of shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99% of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable
upon conversion of principal and interest under convertible promissory notes and upon exercise of
warrants issued or to be issued in connection with the Line of Credit, the Note Purchase Agreement,
the Line of Credit Amendment or, within 90 days after stockholder approval, similar future facilities on
substantially the same or better terms, not to exceed $3.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of
convertible promissory notes and not to exceed warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of common
stock in the aggregate.
Consequences of Not Approving this Proposal
If we do not obtain stockholder approval of this Proposal at the Special Meeting, we will need to obtain
stockholder approval at a later date in order to effect the conversion of the convertible promissory
notes and exercise of warrants into shares of Common Stock.
95
Recommendation of Our Board
Our Board has unanimously determined that the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the
conversion of the convertible promissory notes and exercise of warrants is fair to, and advisable and
in the best interests of, the Company and our stockholders. Our Board unanimously recommends that
stockholders vote “FOR” the issuance of such number of shares of Common Stock exceeding 19.99%
of our outstanding Common Stock, issuable upon conversion of principal and interest under
convertible promissory notes and upon exercise of warrants issued or to be issued in connection with
the Line of Credit, the Note Purchase Agreement, the Line of Credit Amendment or, within 90 days after
stockholder approval, similar future facilities on substantially the same or better terms, not to exceed
$3.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory notes and not to exceed
warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate.
96
PROPOSAL SIX: APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO OUR ARTICLES OF
INCORPORATION TO CHANGE OUR NAME TO CAMBER ENERGY, INC.
General
We were incorporated in Nevada on December 16, 2003 under the name “Panorama Investments
Corp.” and were renamed to “Lucas Energy, Inc.” effective June 9, 2006. In connection with the
Acquisition, we have agreed to rebrand and change our name to “Camber Energy, Inc.” Similarly, we
intend to adopt a new corporate logo that reflects our new name.
Our Board has determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our
stockholders to change our name to “Camber Energy, Inc.” in order to, among other things, fulfill our
obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement in connection with the Acquisition. Our
stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation, in the form
attached to this proxy statement as Annex F, to effect a change in our name from “Lucas Energy, Inc.”
to “Camber Energy, Inc.” Upon approval of such an amendment by our stockholders and
consummation of the Acquisition, we plan to file a certificate of amendment to our Articles of
Incorporation to effect the name change.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting will be required for approval of the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to
change our name to Camber Energy, Inc.
Recommendation of Our Board
Our Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation
to change our name to Camber Energy, Inc.
97
PROPOSAL SEVEN: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF GBH CPAs, PC AS OUR
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2017
The Audit Committee of our Board has selected the firm of GBH CPAs, PC (“GBH”) as our
independent auditors for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, and our Board recommends that
stockholders ratify this appointment.
We do not anticipate a representative from GBH to be present at the Special Meeting. In the event that a
representative of GBH is present at the Special Meeting, the representative will have the opportunity to
make a statement if he/she desires to do so and we will allow such representative to be available to
respond to appropriate questions.
Effective September 29, 2015, our Audit Committee approved the dismissal of Hein & Associates LLP
(“Hein”) as our registered independent accounting firm and appointed GBH as our new independent
registered accounting firm, effective as of the same date.
During the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2015, and through September 30, 2015, we did not (i) have
any disagreements (as defined in Item 304(a)(1(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to
Item 304 of Regulation S-K) with Hein on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of Hein, would have caused it to make reference thereto in their reports on our
consolidated financial statements for such years; or (ii) experience any reportable events (as defined
in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). Hein’s audit reports on our consolidated financial statements as
of and for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of
opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles,
except to indicate that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
During the two most recent fiscal years, and any subsequent interim period prior to engaging GBH,
neither we, nor anyone on our behalf, consulted GBH regarding (i) either the application of accounting
principles to a specified transaction, completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be
rendered on our financial statements, and no written report or oral advice was provided to us by GBH
that was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or
financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of either a disagreement (as defined in
paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event (as
described in paragraph 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). Notwithstanding the above, GBH previously
served as our independent registered accounting from October 9, 2007, until the October 31, 2011
engagement of Hein.
Audit and Other Fees
Our Audit Committee of the Board approves in advance the scope and cost of the engagement of an
auditor before the auditor renders audit and non-audit services.
Audit Fees
The aggregate fees billed by our former independent auditors, Hein, and our current independent
auditors, GBH, for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements
included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, and for the
review of quarterly financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
quarters ending June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2015 and 2014, were:
Hein & Associates, LLP $13,000  $114,757 
 
GBH CPAs, PC
$78,000    —
2016
2015
98
Audit fees incurred by us were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
Audit-Related Fees: None.
Tax Fees: None.
All Other Fees: None.
We do not use the auditors for financial information system design and implementation. Such
services, which include designing or implementing a system that aggregates source data underlying
the financial statements or that generates information that is significant to our financial statements, are
provided internally or by other service providers. We do not engage the auditors to provide
compliance outsourcing services.
The Audit Committee of our Board has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by GBH and
Hein and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with
maintaining GBH’s and Hein’s independence.
The Audit Committee of our Board has appointed GBH to audit our consolidated financial statements
for the year ending March 31, 2017, and such appointment has been approved by the Board. While the
Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, termination and
oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee and our Board
are requesting, as a matter of policy, that the stockholders ratify the appointment of GBH as our
independent registered public accounting firm.
Vote Sought
A majority of the votes cast is being sought for ratification of the appointment of GBH CPAs, PC as our
independent auditors for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.
Our Board is not required to take any action as a result of the outcome of the vote on this proposal. In
the event stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, our Board may reconsider this appointment. Even
if the appointment is ratified, our Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a
different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines
that such a change would be in the Company’s and the stockholders’ best interests.
Recommendation of Our Board
Our Board recommends that the stockholders vote “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of GBH
CPAs, PC as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.
99
PROPOSAL EIGHT: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING
Our stockholders may be asked to consider and act upon one or more adjournments of the Special
Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of any or all of the other
proposals set forth in this proxy statement.
If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, our stockholders may be asked to vote on the
proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to solicit additional proxies. If a quorum is present at the
Special Meeting, but there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve one or
more of the proposals, our stockholders may also be asked to vote on the proposal to approve the
adjournment of the Special Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies in favor of the other
proposals. However, a stockholder vote may be taken on one of the proposals in this proxy statement
prior to any such adjournment if there are sufficient votes for approval on such proposal.
If the adjournment proposal is submitted for a vote at the Special Meeting, and if our stockholders vote
to approve the adjournment proposal, the meeting will be adjourned to enable our Board to solicit
additional proxies in favor of one or more proposals. If the adjournment proposal is approved, and the
Special Meeting is adjourned, our Board will use the additional time to solicit additional proxies in favor
of any of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting, including the solicitation of proxies
from stockholders that have previously voted against the relevant proposal.
Our Board believes that, if the number of shares of our Common Stock voting in favor of any of the
proposals presented at the Special Meeting is insufficient to approve a proposal, it is in the best
interests of our stockholders to enable our Board, for a limited period of time, to continue to seek to
obtain a sufficient number of additional votes in favor of the proposal. Any signed proxies we receive
in which no voting instructions are provided on such matter will be voted in favor of an adjournment in
these circumstances. The time and place of the adjourned meeting will be announced at the time the
adjournment is taken. Any adjournment of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies will allow our stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time
prior to their use at the Special Meeting as adjourned or postponed.
Vote Required
Authority to adjourn the Special Meeting pursuant to this proposal, to another place, date or time, if
deemed necessary or appropriate, in the discretion of our Board, requires a majority of the votes cast
in favor of the proposal.
Recommendation of Our Board
Our Board recommends that the stockholders vote “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies.
OTHER MATTERS
We know of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the Special Meeting.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK OF LUCAS ENERGY, INC.
The following is a brief description of our capital stock. This summary does not purport to be complete
in all respects. This description is subject to and qualified entirely by the terms of our certificate of
incorporation, as amended, or our certificate of incorporation, and our bylaws, as amended, or our
bylaws, copies of which have been filed with the SEC and are also available upon request from us, and
by the Nevada Corporation Law.
Capital Stock
We have authorized capital stock consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value
per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share (“Preferred Stock”). As
of the Record Date, we have 1,739,397 shares of common stock outstanding, 2,000 designated shares
of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, none of which are outstanding, and 3,000 designated shares
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, none of which are outstanding. If Proposals One and Two in
this proxy statement are approved by stockholders and we consummate the Acquisition and the other
transactions contemplated thereby, we will have 15,139,351 shares of common stock outstanding and
600,000 designated shares of Series B Preferred Stock, of which 552,000 shares will be outstanding. If
Proposal Four in this proxy statement is approved by stockholders, and we have consummated the
Acquisition, we will have 5,000 designated shares of Series C Preferred Stock, of which 527 shares will
be outstanding.
The following description of our capital stock is a summary only and is subject to applicable
provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as
amended and restated, from time to time. You should refer to, and read this summary together with,
our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended and restated from time to time, to review all
of the terms of our capital stock.
Common Stock
Holders of our common stock: (i) are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for
distribution upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs; (ii) do not have preemptive,
subscription or conversion rights, nor are there any redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable
thereto; and (iii) are entitled to one vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote at all
stockholder meetings. Each stockholder is entitled to receive the dividends as may be declared by our
directors out of funds legally available for dividends. Our directors are not obligated to declare a
dividend. Any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our directors and will depend upon,
among other things, future earnings, the operating and financial condition of our Company, our capital
requirements, general business conditions and other pertinent factors.
The presence of the persons entitled to vote 33% of the outstanding voting shares on a matter before
the stockholders shall constitute the quorum necessary for the consideration of the matter at a
stockholders’ meeting.
The vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast on the matter at a meeting at which a quorum is
present shall constitute an act of the stockholders, except for the election of directors, who shall be
appointed by a plurality of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum is present. The
common stock does not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of 51% of the
common stock voting for election of directors can elect 100% of our directors if they choose to do so.
101
Preferred Stock
Subject to the terms contained in any designation of a series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors

and the terms and provisions relative to the operation thereof;
Whether the shares of such class or series shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of stock

rate, condition or time of payment; and
Any other powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and any
qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of
the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, to the full extent permitted by the laws of the
State of Nevada.
11)
12)
102
The powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of each class or
series of Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ
from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding.
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has no voting rights, no liquidation rights and no redemption
rights, but has conversion rights providing the holder thereof the right to convert each outstanding
share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 40 shares of our common stock. The Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock contains a provision that limits the amount of common shares that the
holder can own at any time upon conversion to an aggregate of 4.99% of our then issued and
outstanding shares of common stock.
Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
The Series B Preferred Stock to be issued in connection with the Acquisition will have dividend rights
that accrue at an annual rate of 6% until such Series B Preferred is no longer outstanding either due to
conversion, redemption or otherwise. The Series B Preferred Stock also will have liquidation rights
equal to the original issue price of such shares and will be payable upon our liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, either voluntary or involuntary. Each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock will be
entitled to one vote on all stockholder matters to come before our stockholders and will not be entitled
to series voting except as required by law.
Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will be convertible, at the option of the holder, into that number
of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price
for the Series B Preferred ($25.00, as may be adjusted for recapitalizations) by the Conversion Price
($3.50, as may be adjusted for recapitalizations). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will
automatically convert into shares of Common Stock under certain conditions set forth in the
Certificate of Designations.
Subject to the terms of any credit or debt agreements in place which prevent us from redeeming the
Series B Preferred Stock for cash, we will have the option, exercisable from time to time after the
Original Issue Date, to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock
which have not been previously converted into Common Stock, by paying each applicable holder, an
amount equal to (a) the Original Issue Price multiplied by the number of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock held by each applicable Holder subject to such redemption; plus (b) the accrued dividends on
such shares.
The consent of a majority in interest of the Series B Preferred Stock will also need to be obtained prior
to certain corporate actions.
Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
Holders of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to cumulative dividends in the amount of 6.0% per
annum, payable upon redemption, conversion, or maturity, and when, as and if declared by our Board
of Directors in its discretion. The Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Common Stock and pari
passu with respect to our Series B Preferred Stock.
103
The Series C Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock at any time at the option
of the holder, or at our option if certain equity conditions (as defined in the Certificate of Designation)
are met. Upon conversion, we will pay the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock being converted a
conversion premium equal to the amount of dividends that such shares would have otherwise earned
if they had been held through the maturity date, and issue to the holders such number of shares of
Common stock equal to $10,000 per share of Series C Preferred Stock (the “Face Value”) multiplied by
the number of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock divided by the conversion rate.
The conversion premium under the Series C Preferred Stock is payable and the dividend rate under
the Series C Preferred Stock is adjustable on the same terms and conditions as accrued interest is
payable and adjustable under the Debenture described below. The Series C Preferred Stock has a
maturity date that is seven years after the date of issuance and, if the Series C Preferred Stock has not
been wholly converted into shares of Common Stock prior to such date, we may redeem the Series C
Preferred Stock on such date by repaying to the Investor in cash 100% of the Face Value plus an
amount equal to any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon. Prior to the maturity date, provided that
no trigger event has occurred (as defined in the Certificate of Designation), we have the right at any
time upon 30 trading days’ prior written notice to redeem all or any portion of the Series C Preferred
Stock by paying Investor in cash 100% of the Face Value, plus the conversion premium, minus any
dividends already paid on the Series C Preferred Stock being redeemed. 100% of the Face Value, plus
an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, automatically becomes payable in the
event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up by us.
We may not issue any other Preferred Stock (other than the Series B Preferred Stock) that is pari
passu or senior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to any rights for a period of one year after
the earlier of such date (i) a registration statement is effective and available for the resale of all shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, or (ii) Securities Act Rule
144 is available for the immediate unrestricted resale of all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock.
Warrants
As of the Record Date, we have a total of 1,617,201 warrants outstanding, which had various exercise
prices from between $0.01 and $71.50 per share and various expiration dates between July 4, 2016 and
April 21, 2019, as described in greater detail below.
In connection with our December 30, 2010 offering, we sold an aggregate of 2,510,506 units pursuant
to a Securities Purchase Agreement to certain institutional investors (the “Investors”), each consisting
of (a) one share of common stock; (b) one Series B Warrant to purchase one share of common stock
at an exercise price of $2.86 per share (the “Series B Warrants”); and (c) one Series C Warrant to
purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.62 per share (the “Series C Warrants”
and together with the Series B Warrants, the “Warrants”, and collectively with the shares of common
stock, the “Units”). An entity controlled by our former director, Joshua D. Young was one of the
Investors in the offering. Subsequently, effective July 18, 2011, the Company entered into an
Amendment, Settlement and Release Agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”) with the Investors,
pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed to reduce the exercise price of the Series
C Warrants to $2.48 per share; move up the date the Investors could exercise the Series C Warrants to
allow such Series C Warrants to be exercised by the Investors as of the effective date of the
Amendment Agreement; and provide for the immediate exercise by the Investors of 25% of the Series
C Warrants which they held (627,628 Series C Warrants) for cash. Subsequent to the parties’ entry into
the Amendment Agreement, the Investors exercised their remaining Series C Warrants. The Warrants
include a provision whereby the Investors are not eligible to exercise any portion of the Warrants that
would result in them becoming a beneficial owner of more than 9.99% of the Company’s common
stock. As a result of our 25:1 reverse stock split, which was effective on July 15, 2015, the outstanding
Series B Warrants were adjusted such that 100,422 are outstanding as of the Record Date at an
exercise price of $71.50 per share. The Series B Warrants became exercisable on July 4, 2011 and will
remain exercisable thereafter until July 4, 2016.
104
In April 2012, the Company sold an aggregate of 2,950,000 units at $2.00 each, with each unit
consisting of one share of Company common stock and 0.35 of a warrant to purchase one share of the
Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $2.30 per share in a registered direct offering. A total
of 2,950,000 shares and 1,032,500 warrants were sold in connection with the offering (one of the
investors in the offering was an entity controlled by our former director, Joshua D. Young). The
Company received an aggregate of $5,900,000 (or $2.00 per unit) in gross funding and approximately
$5,500,000 (or $1.87 per unit) in net proceeds after paying commissions and other expenses
associated with the offering. The Company used the net proceeds to pay down expenses related to
drilling, lease operating and workover activities; and for general corporate purposes, including general
and administrative expenses. The warrants became exercisable on October 18, 2012, and will remain
exercisable thereafter until October 18, 2017. If the registration statement pursuant to which the
warrants were issued is not effective and available for use at the time of any proposed exercise, the
warrants have cashless exercise rights. The warrants also include a provision whereby the investors
are not eligible to exercise any portion of the warrants that would result in them becoming the
beneficial owner of more than 4.99% of the Company’s common stock, subject to the holder’s right to
increase such amount to up to 9.99% of the Company’s common stock with at least 61 days prior
written notice to the Company. As a result of our 25:1 reverse stock split, which was effective on July
15, 2015, the outstanding warrants were adjusted such that 41,300 are outstanding as of the Record
Date at an exercise price of $57.50 per share.
Effective April 4, 2013, we entered into a Loan Agreement with various lenders (the “Loan Agreement”)
pursuant to which such lenders loaned the Company an aggregate of $2,750,000 to be used for
general working capital. The lenders included entities beneficially owned by our then directors, Ken
Daraie (which entity loaned us $2,000,000) and W. Andrew Krusen, Jr. (which entities loaned us
$250,000), as well as an unrelated third party which loaned the Company $500,000. The outstanding
principal and interest was paid in full on August 16, 2013. The Note holders were each paid their pro
rata portion of a $55,000 commitment fee in connection with the Company’s entry into the Notes and
were each granted their pro rata portion of warrants to purchase 275,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock which were evidenced by Common Stock Purchase Warrants. These warrants were
originally issued with an exercise price of $1.50 per share, a term of five years and cashless exercise
rights in the event the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of our 25:1 reverse stock split, which was effective
on July 15, 2015, the warrants were adjusted such that 11,000 are outstanding as of the Record Date at
an exercise price of $37.50 per share.
105
In May 2013, we issued warrants issued in connection with the issuance of certain May 2013 Notes, for
which the outstanding principal and interest was paid in full on August 16, 2013. The warrants were
exercisable on the grant date (May 31, 2013) and remain exercisable until May 31, 2018. As a result of
our 25:1 reverse stock split, which was effective on July 15, 2015, the warrants were adjusted such that
2,000 are outstanding as of the Record Date at an exercise price of $37.50 per share.
Effective on August 13, 2013, Lucas entered into a Letter Loan Agreement with Louise H. Rogers (as
amended and modified to date, the “Rogers Loan”). In connection with the Rogers Loan and a
Promissory Note entered into in connection therewith, the Company issued certain warrants. Such
warrants were exercisable on the grant date (August 13, 2013) and remain exercisable until the earlier
of (a) August 13, 2018; and (b) three years after the payment in full of the loan. The exercise price of
such warrants was lowered to $0.01 per share on August 12, 2015, and the Company recorded
approximately $15,000 in one-time amortization expenses related to the price reduction. As a result of
our 25:1 reverse stock split, which was effective on July 15, 2015, the warrants were adjusted such that
11,195 are outstanding as of the Record Date.
Warrants were also issued by the Company in connection with the sale of units in the Company’s unit
offering in April 2014. The Warrants became exercisable on April 21, 2014 and will remain exercisable
thereafter until April 21, 2019. As a result of our 25:1 reverse stock split, which was effective on July 15,
2015, the warrants were adjusted such that 66,668 are outstanding as of the Record Date at an
exercise price of $25.00 per share. As a result of the issuance of the Debenture and related warrant, the
exercise price of these warrants was adjusted to $10.17 per share. As a result of the issuance of the
convertible promissory notes through the Record Date, the exercise price of these warrants was
adjusted to $9.75 per share. In the event that stockholders approve all the proposals in this proxy
statement and all of the specific securities pursuant to those proposals are issued, we estimate the
exercise price of these warrants would be further adjusted to $6.38 (not taking into account securities
issued in the Acquisition). In the event that the Acquisition is closed, the exercise price of these
warrants would be reduced, if applicable, to the fair market value of our Common Stock on the date 30
days after the closing of the Acquisition.
In connection with the Note Purchase Agreement entered into on March 29, 2016, and effective March
11, 2016, we agreed to issue HFT warrants to purchase 124,285 shares of common stock with an
exercise price of $1.50 per share, at such time as an aggregate of $600,000 in convertible promissory
notes have been sold under the Note Purchase Agreement. In connection with the Line of Credit
Amendment entered into on April 11, 2016, we agreed to issue warrants to purchase 51,562 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $3.25 per share for each $250,000 in convertible promissory
notes that are issued to Target Alliance London Limited. When issued, the warrants will allow for
cashless exercise rights, to the extent that such shares of common stock issuable upon exercise
thereof are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will include anti-dilutive
rights, for the first 12 months following the issuance date of such warrants, which will automatically
reduce the exercise price of the warrants to any lower priced security sold, granted or issued by us
during such anti-dilutive period, subject to certain exceptions, including officer and director grants
and the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition.
We also issued a warrant in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement entered into on April
6, 2016 and have agreed, subject to certain conditions, to issue a warrant in connection with the Stock
Purchase Agreement entered into on April 6, 2016. The first warrant entitles the Investor, upon
exercise thereof, to purchase 1,384,616 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $3.25 per
share. The second warrant entitles the Investor, upon exercise thereof, to purchase 1,111,112 shares
of Common Stock at a purchase price of $4.50 per share.
The first warrant will be automatically exercised upon the last to occur of the approval by our
stockholders of Proposal Three in this proxy statement, the Acquisition, and the registration statement
for the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Debenture and
exercise of the warrant being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
second warrant, if and when issued, will be exercisable before March 31, 2017 by mutual agreement of
us and the Investor upon delivery of notice from us or Investor.
Both warrants accrue a premium at a rate equal to 6.0% per annum, subject to adjustment as provided
in the warrants, payable upon redemption or exercise. Upon exercise of the warrants, we will pay the
conversion premium that would have otherwise been due if the warrants had been held through the
maturity date, with respect to the portion of warrants being exercised. The warrants may not be
exercised on a cashless basis.
106
The conversion premium under the warrants is payable and adjustable on the same terms and
conditions as accrued interest is payable and adjustable under the Debenture described below, except
that the conversion premium adjustment thresholds for the second warrant are set at $4.00 and $5.00,
respectively. The warrants have a maturity date that is seven years after the date of issuance and, if the
warrants have not been wholly exercised into shares of Common Stock prior to such date, we may
redeem the warrants on such date by repaying to the Investor in cash the purchase price paid under
the warrants. Prior to the maturity date, provided that no trigger event has occurred (as defined in the
warrants), we have the right at any time upon 30 trading days’ prior written notice to redeem all or any
portion of the warrants then unexercised by paying Investor in cash an amount per portion of
unexercised warrants equal to the purchase price paid under the warrants, plus the conversion
premium payable as if such portion was unexercised until the maturity date, minus any conversion
premium already paid for such portion. The purchase price paid under the warrants, together with the
conversion premium, automatically becomes payable with respect to the unexercised portion of the
warrants in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up by us.
Stock Options
As of the Record Date, we had issued and outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of
22,920 shares of common stock (net of forfeitures, expirations and cancellations) pursuant to its 2010
Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plans”). The stock options have a
weighted average exercise price of $33.96 per share.
Convertible Promissory Notes
On August 30, 2015, we entered into a Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Line
of Credit”) with Silver Star Oil Company (“Silver Star”). The Line of Credit, which had an effective date
of August 28, 2015, provided us the right, from time to time, subject to the terms of the Line of Credit, to
sell up to $2.4 million in convertible promissory notes. Under the terms of the Line of Credit, we issued
$1 million in convertible promissory notes to Silver Star pursuant to notes effective on September 28,
2015, October 21, 2015, November 23, 2015, December 31, 2015 and February 8, 2016 (collectively, the
“Silver Star Notes”). All of the Silver Star Notes have been assigned to other parties, including a
portion to Target Alliance London Limited.
To date, we have had difficulty in obtaining the remaining funding required from Silver Star under the
Line of Credit. In an effort to raise funding for ongoing expenses and as a replacement for the amounts
previously sought from Silver Star, on March 29, 2016, and effective March 11, 2016, we entered into a
Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with HFT
Enterprises, LLC (“HFT”). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed to sell and HFT
agreed to purchase, an aggregate of $600,000 in convertible promissory notes, including $300,000 in
convertible promissory notes purchased on March 29, 2016, to be effective on March 11, 2016,
$150,000 in convertible promissory notes purchased on March 29, 2016, to be effective on March 25,
2016, and $150,000 in convertible promissory notes required to be purchased by HFT or its assigns on
or prior to April 30, 2016. We also agreed to issue HFT warrants to purchase 124,285 shares of
common stock with an exercise price of $1.50 per share, at such time as an aggregate of $600,000 in
convertible promissory notes have been sold.
On April 11, 2016, we entered into an Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit and
Notes Agreement (the “Line of Credit Amendment”) with Target Alliance London Limited, pursuant to
which we agreed to issue the remaining $1.4 million in convertible promissory notes under the Line of
Credit at a conversion price of $3.25 per share to Target Alliance London Limited and to issue warrants
to purchase 51,562 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.25 per share for each $250,000
in convertible promissory notes that are issued to Target Alliance London Limited.
107
The Silver Star Notes are due and payable on October 1, 2016. The HFT convertible promissory notes
are due and payable on the anniversary of their respective issuance dates. The Target Alliance
London Limited convertible promissory notes are due and payable on April 11, 2017 unless otherwise
agreed between the parties. All the convertible promissory notes accrue interest at the rate of 6% per
annum (15% upon the occurrence of an event of default), and allow the holder thereof the right to
convert the principal and interest due thereunder into Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.50
per share with respect to the Silver Star Notes and HFT convertible promissory notes and at a
conversion price of $3.25 per share with respect to the Target Alliance London Limited convertible
promissory notes, provided that any conversion is subject to us first receiving approval for the
issuance of shares of our common stock under the convertible promissory notes under applicable
NYSE MKT rules and regulations. We have the right to prepay the convertible promissory notes. The
convertible promissory notes include customary events of default for facilities of similar nature and
size.
Convertible Redeemable Subordinated Debenture
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited institutional
investor (the “Investor”), pursuant to which we sold and issued a redeemable convertible
subordinated debenture, with a face amount of $530,000, convertible into 163,077 shares of Common
Stock at a conversion price equal to $3.25 per share (the “Debenture”). The Investor purchased the
Debenture at a 5.0% original issue discount for the sum of $500,000.
The Debenture matures in seven years and accrues interest at a rate of 6.0% per annum, subject to
adjustment as provided in the Debenture. The Debenture converts into shares of common stock at
$3.25 per share automatically upon the earlier of (i) the maturity date or (ii) the last to occur of the
closing of the Acquisition or the date on which certain equity conditions (as defined in the Debenture)
have been met. The Debenture also may be converted into shares of common stock at $3.25 per share
(i) in the sole and absolute discretion of Investor at any time or times after issuance, or (ii) at our option
if certain equity conditions are met. Upon conversion of the Debenture, we will pay a conversion
premium equal to the amount of unpaid interest that would have otherwise been due if the Debenture
had been held through the maturity date, with respect to the portion of Debenture being converted.
Accrued interest under the Debenture is payable upon conversion, redemption or maturity of the
Debenture, in cash or, at our discretion, shares of common stock calculated by using 95% of the
average of the lowest 5 individual daily volume weighted average prices during the measuring period,
not to exceed 100% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of such period, less $0.05 per share of
common stock. Following a default trigger event (as defined in the Debenture), the number of shares to
be issued will be calculated by using 85% of the average of the lowest 5 individual daily volume
weighted average prices during the measuring period, less $0.10 per share of Common Stock not to
exceed 85% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of such period less $0.10 per share.
The interest rate on the Debenture will adjust upward by 100 basis points for each $0.10 that the
volume weighted average price of our Common Stock on any trading day as of which the interest rate
is determined and calculated is below $2.75, subject to a maximum interest rate of 24.95%. The interest
rate also will adjust upward by 10.0% following the occurrence of any trigger event. The interest rate on
the Debenture will adjust downward by 100 basis points for each $0.10 that the volume weighted
average price of our Common Stock on any trading day as of which the interest rate is determined and
calculated is above $3.75, subject to a minimum interest rate of 0%.
108
To the extent the Debenture has not automatically converted in full into shares of common stock prior
to the maturity date, the face value of the outstanding Debenture, together with all interest accrued
thereunder, is payable in cash by us on the maturity date. Prior to the maturity date, provided that no
trigger event has occurred (as defined in the Debenture), we have the right at any time upon 30 trading
days’ prior written notice to redeem all or any portion of the Debenture then outstanding by paying the
investor in cash an amount per portion of Debenture equal to the face value, plus the interest payable
as if such portion was outstanding until the maturity date, minus any interest already paid for such
portion. The outstanding Debenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest, automatically
becomes payable in the event of a deemed liquidation event (as defined in the Debenture).

Restrictions on Change of Control
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
The following provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws, as amended and restated,

Nevada Corporation Law.
Sections 78.378-78.3793 of the Nevada Revised Statutes apply to any acquisition of a controlling
interest in an issuing corporation unless the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation in
effect on the tenth day following the acquisition of a controlling interest by an acquiring person
provide that the provisions of those sections do not apply to the corporation, or to an acquisition of a
controlling interest specifically by types of existing or future stockholders, whether or not identified. A
person desiring to acquire a controlling interest in an issuing corporation must do so in accordance
with the provisions of Sections 78.378-78.3793 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
In general, Sections 78.378-78.3793 set forth the procedures for an acquiring person to obtain a
controlling interest in an issuing corporation. The securities acquired in such acquisition are denied
voting rights unless holders of a majority of the voting power of the corporation approve the granting
of such voting rights, and, if the acquisition would adversely alter or change any preference or any
relative or other right given to any other class or series of outstanding shares, the holders of a majority
of each class or series affected approve the granting of such voting rights.
The provisions of Sections 78.378-78.3793 of the Nevada Revised Statutes do not restrict the directors
of an issuing corporation from taking action to protect the interests of the corporation and its
stockholders including, but not limited to, adopting or signing plans, arrangements or instruments that
deny rights, privileges, power or authority to a holder of a specified number of shares or percentage of
share ownership or voting power.
“Controlling interest” means the ownership of outstanding voting shares of an issuing corporation
sufficient, but for the provisions of Section 78.378 to 78.3793, inclusive, to enable the acquiring person,
directly or indirectly and individually or in association with others, to exercise 1) 1/5 or more but less
than 1/3, 2) 1/3 or more but less than a majority, or 3) a majority or more of all the voting power of the
corporation in the election of directors.
“Issuing corporation” means a corporation which is organized in Nevada and which 1) has 200 or
more stockholders of record, at least 100 of whom have addresses in Nevada appearing on the stock
ledger of the corporation; and 2) does business in Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation.
The Company’s Bylaws, as amended and restated, provide that the Company is not governed by the
provisions of Section 78.378 to 78.3793, inclusive, of the Nevada Revised Statues, and such sections
do not therefore apply to the Company or to an acquisition of a controlling interest by any stockholder
of the Company.
Sections 78.411-78.444 of the Nevada Revised Statutes apply to certain combinations of the
corporation with interested stockholders.
In general, Section 78.438 prohibits a Nevada corporation from engaging in any business combination
with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder
became an interested stockholder unless the Board of Directors of the corporation approved the
business combination prior to the date the person became an interested stockholder.
110
In general, Section 78.439 provides that business combinations after the three-year period following
the date that the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder may also be prohibited unless
approved by the corporation’s directors before the person became an interested stockholder unless
the price and terms of the transaction meet the criteria set forth in the statute.
“Combination” means any of the following:
1) Any merger or consolidation of the resident domestic corporation or any subsidiary of the resident
domestic corporation with:
(a) the interested stockholder; or
(b) any other corporation, whether or not itself an interested stockholder of the resident domestic
corporation, which is, or after the merger or consolidation would be, an affiliate or associate of the
interested stockholder.
2) Any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, to or with the interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of the
interested stockholder of transactions, to or with the interested stockholder or any affiliate or
associate of the interested corporation:
(a) having an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of all the
assets, determined on a consolidated basis, of the resident domestic corporation;
(b) having an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of all the
outstanding shares of the resident domestic corporation; or
(c) representing 10% or more of the earning power or net income, determined on a consolidated basis,
of the resident domestic corporation.
3) The issuance or transfer by the resident domestic corporation or any subsidiary of the resident
domestic corporation, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of any shares of the resident
domestic corporation or any subsidiary of the resident domestic corporation that have an aggregate
market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of all the outstanding shares of the
resident domestic corporation to the interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of the
interested stockholder except under the exercise of warrants or rights to purchase shares offered, or a
dividend or distribution paid or made, pro rata to all stockholders of the resident domestic corporation.
4) The adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the resident domestic
corporation proposed by, or under any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether or not in
writing with, the interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.
5) Any:
(a) reclassification of securities, including, without limitation, any splitting of shares, dividend
distributed in shares, or other distribution of shares with respect to other shares, or any issuance of
new shares in exchange for a proportionately greater number of old shares;
(b) recapitalization of the resident domestic corporation;
111
(c) merger or consolidation of the resident domestic corporation with any subsidiary of the resident
domestic corporation; or
(d) other transaction, whether or not with or into or otherwise involving the interested stockholder,
proposed by, or under any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether or not in writing, with,
the interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder, which has the
effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any
class or series of voting shares or securities convertible into voting shares of the resident domestic
corporation or any subsidiary of the resident domestic corporation which is directly or indirectly
owned by the interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder, except
as a result of immaterial changes because of adjustments of fractional shares.
6) Any receipt by the interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder
of the benefit, directly or indirectly, except proportionately as a stockholder of the resident domestic
corporation, of any loan, advance, guarantee, pledge or other financial assistance or any tax credit or
other tax advantage provided by or through the resident domestic corporation.
“Interested stockholder” means any person, other than the resident domestic corporation or any
subsidiary of the resident domestic corporation, who is:
1) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding
voting shares of the resident domestic corporation; or
2) an affiliate or associate of the resident domestic corporation and at any time within 3 years
immediately before the date in question was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more
of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the resident domestic corporation.
To determine whether a person is an interested stockholder, the number of voting shares of the
resident domestic corporation considered to be outstanding includes shares considered to be
beneficially owned by that person through the application of Section 78.414 of the Nevada Revised
Statutes, but does not include any other unissued shares of a class of voting shares of the resident
domestic corporation which may be issuable under any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or
upon exercise of rights to convert warrants or options, or otherwise.

OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our Common
Stock as of the dates indicated below by (i) each person who is known by us to own beneficially more
than five percent (5%) of our outstanding voting stock; (ii) each of our directors; (iii) each of our
executive officers; (iv) all of our current executive officers and directors as a group, (v) each of the
Sellers to whom shares of Common Stock are issuable in connection with the Asset Purchase
Agreement, and (vi) such other persons to whom shares are issuable pursuant to the other
transactions contemplated by this proxy statement.
The percentages shown in the table under the column “Beneficially Owned Prior to Transactions
Contemplated by this Proxy Statement” are based on 1,739,397 shares of Common Stock outstanding
as of the Record Date, which number takes into account our 1:25 reverse stock split which took place
on July 15, 2015, and excludes the transactions contemplated by this proxy statement.
The percentages shown in the table under the column “Beneficially Owned Upon Completion of
Transactions Contemplated by this Proxy Statement” are based on 27,769,944 shares of Common
Stock expected to be outstanding as of immediately after the closing of the transactions contemplated
by this proxy statement, assuming conversion of the Debenture, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock and convertible notes and exercise of the First Warrant, Second Warrant and warrants
issued in connection with the convertible notes, but non including payment of interest, dividends,
premiums or conversion premiums on such securities.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes voting and/or
investing power with respect to securities. These rules generally provide that shares of Common
Stock subject to options, warrants or other convertible securities that are currently exercisable or
convertible, or exercisable or convertible within 60 days of the Record Date, are deemed to be
outstanding and to be beneficially owned by the person or group holding such options, warrants or
other convertible securities for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of such person or
group, but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of
any other person or group.
To our knowledge, except as indicated in the footnotes to this table and pursuant to applicable
community property laws, the persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with
respect to all shares of Common Stock shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to applicable
community property laws. Unless otherwise indicated, the address for each of the officers or directors
listed in the table below is 450 Gears Road, Suite 860, Houston, Texas 77067, and the address for each

conversion of $650,000 in remaining principal of outstanding Convertible Promissory Notes. All of the
Convertible Notes are due and payable on October 1, 2016, accrue interest at the rate of 6% per annum
(15% upon the occurrence of an event of default), and allow the holder thereof the right to convert the
principal and interest due thereunder into Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.50 per share,
provided that the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible
Promissory Notes cannot exceed 19.9% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock on August 30, 2015,
the date the line of credit pursuant to which the Convertible Promissory Notes were originally sold, was
agreed to, which was 289,398 shares (or the total voting power outstanding on such date), or otherwise
exceed the amount of shares that would require stockholder approval under applicable NYSE MKT rules,
unless or until we receive stockholder approval for such issuances. The issuance of the shares is also
subject to NYSE MKT listing approval. The line of credit pursuant to which the Convertible Promissory
Notes were sold also includes a 9.99% ownership limitation which prevents the holder of the Convertible
Promissory Notes from converting such Convertible Promissory Notes into Common Stock if upon such
conversion, the holder would beneficially own more than 9.99% of our then outstanding Common Stock,
subject to the ability of any holder to modify such limitation with 61 days prior written notice to us (the

Consists of (i) 163,077 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the principal amount of the
Debenture, (ii) 1,384,616 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the First Warrant, (iii)
3,452,307 additional shares of Common Stock that we may issue, at our sole discretion in lieu of cash, as
conversion premiums or in payment of interest on such Debenture and First Warrant, (iv) 1,618,462
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, (v) 1,111,112 shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Second Warrant, and (vi) 7,049,816 additional shares of
Common Stock that we may issue, at our sole discretion in lieu of cash, as conversion premiums or in
payment of interest or dividends on such Series C Preferred Stock and Second Warrant.  We have
assumed the payment of interest and dividends on the Debenture and Series C Preferred Stock and the
payment of the conversion premiums on the First Warrant and Second Warrant solely in shares of
Common Stock, for a period of seven years, which is the maturity date of each of the securities. The
number of additional shares of Common Stock that we may issue as conversion premiums or in payment
(21)
of interest or dividends is dependent on the interest rate, dividend rate and conversion premium rate
which can range from 0% to 24.95% depending on our underlying stock price at the time of conversion or
maturity and assuming no triggering event has occurred. For purposes of the interest, dividend and
conversion premium calculations in the preceding sentences, we assumed (i) the interest rate, dividend
rate and conversion premium rate to be 16.0% per annum, and (ii) $1.63 to be 95% of the average of the
lowest 5 individual daily volume weighted average prices during the 30 trading day period immediately
prior to payment of the interest, dividends and conversion premiums, as applicable, not to exceed 100%
of the lowest sales prices on the last day of such period, less $0.05 per share of Common Stock (the
“VWAP Measurement”). If the VWAP Measurement is, in any case, an amount less than the amount
assumed in the preceding sentences and/or the interest rate, dividend rate and conversion premium rate
is, in any case, higher than the rate assumed in the preceding sentences, additional shares of Common
Stock will be issuable. Discover Growth Fund is subject to a blocker that would prevent its ownership at
any given time from exceeding 4.99% (which may be increased upon 61 days prior written notice from
such stockholder, but not above 9.99%) of our outstanding Common Stock (the “Blocker”). Absent the
Blocker, Discover Growth Fund would hold an aggregate of approximately 14,779,390 shares, or 49.6%,
of our Common Stock after the Acquisition, upon conversion and exercise in full of the securities
described above and payment of all interest, dividends and conversion premiums thereunder based on
the assumptions described above.  The address of Discover Growth Fund is 4th Floor, Harbour Place,
103 South Church Street, Grand Cayman KY1-1002, Cayman Islands. David Sims serves as Director of

guarantee that it will be included.

STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES OF
OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES ACQUIRED FROM SEGUNDO RESOURCES, LLC
On December 30, 2015, we entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with twenty-one separate
Sellers and Segundo Resources, LLC (the “Sellers”) in which we agreed to acquire working interests
in producing properties and undeveloped acreage (the “Properties”) in Texas and Oklahoma,
including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent
region of the United States, and related wells, leases, records, equipment and agreements associated
therewith as well as producing shale properties in Glasscock County, Texas.
Following are the audited statements of revenues and direct operating expenses of the Properties for
the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. Complete financial and operating information related to the
Properties, including balance sheet and cash flow information are not presented because the
Properties were maintained as an asset and not a separate company in the accounting records of a
predecessors; therefore, the assets, liabilities, indirect operating costs and other expenses applicable
to the operations were not allocated to the properties acquired.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors
Lucas Energy, Inc.
Houston, TX
We have audited the accompanying statements of revenues and direct operating expenses of the oil
and gas properties acquired from Segundo Resources, LLC (the seller representative for various
sellers) for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility
of Lucas Energy, Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting
as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
The accompanying financial statements were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and are not intended to be a complete
financial presentation of the properties described above.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the revenues and direct operating expenses of the oil and gas properties acquired from Segundo
Resources, LLC (the seller representative for various sellers) for the years ended March 31, 2016 and
2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES OF
OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES ACQUIRED FROM SEGUNDO RESOURCES, LLC
1. PROPERTIES ACQUIRED AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Acquisition of Assets from the Sellers
On December 30, 2015, Lucas Energy Inc. (the “Company”) purchased oil and gas properties
(“Properties”) from Segundo Resources, LLC (the seller representative for various sellers) (“Sellers”).
The Properties currently produce approximately 1,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which
53% are liquids, from 114 producing wells. The bulk of the production is from the Hunton formation
holding approximately 43,000 gross acres (9,900 net acres) in central Oklahoma. Additionally, further,
offset development drilling opportunities for at least 40 additional wells have been identified.
As consideration for the acquisition, we agreed to assume $31,350,000 of commercial bank debt; issue
552,000 shares of newly designated Series B Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers and its affiliate,
which are under common control with the Seller Representative, with a total liquidation value of
$13,800,000; issue 13,009,664 shares of Common Stock to certain of the Sellers with a fair value of
$21,465,946; and pay $4,975,000 in cash to certain Sellers. Notwithstanding the above, in the event
there are any title or other material issues associated with the assets, the parties agreed to work in
good faith to address such issues, and if such issues cannot be addressed, to adjust the purchase
price, provided that no adjustment will be made unless such issues in aggregate total more than 5% of
the aggregate purchase price, and provided further that if such issues in aggregate total more than
20% of the aggregate purchase price, we can terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement. We and the
Sellers also agreed to a true-up for certain joint interest billings and authorization for expenditures at
and/or after closing, and to effect a true-up in connection with any material agreements, if the rights
thereto are not provided by the Sellers at closing.
The Series B Preferred to be Issued
The Company is expected to issue an aggregate of 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock which
Preferred Shares have a total value of $13,800,000 based on the $25 per Series B Preferred Stock
share par value. The Preferred Shares shall be issued to the following parties and in the following
amounts on behalf of and for the benefit of RAD2 Minerals:
1.RAD2 Minerals: 200,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock; and
 2.Tex Oak Energy, LLC (an Affiliate of RAD2 Minerals): 352,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
The Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $25 per share. The Series B Preferred
Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder at any time following the original issuance date, into
Common Stock at a rate of approximately 7.14:1 (issuable into an aggregate of 3,942,857 shares of
Common Stock if fully converted), at the option of the holder thereof, or automatically as to 25% of the
Series B Preferred Stock shares if our Common Stock trades above $6.125 per share for at least 20
consecutive trading days, and trades with at least 75,000 shares of average volume per day during
such period; an additional 50% of the Series B Preferred Stock shares if our Common Stock trades
above $7.00 per share for at least 20 consecutive trading days, and trades with at least 75,000 shares
of average volume per day during such period; and as to the remaining Series B Preferred Stock
shares, if our Common Stock trades above $7.875 per share for at least 20 consecutive trading days,
and trades with at least 75,000 shares of average volume per day during such period. Each
outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all stockholder
matters. The Series B Preferred Stock is redeemable at any time by the Company upon the payment by
the Company of the face amount of the Series B Preferred Stock ($25 per share) plus any and all
accrued and unpaid dividends thereon.
The Corporation shall have the option, exercisable from time to time after the original issue date, to
redeem all or any portion of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock by paying each
applicable holder, an amount equal to the original issue price multiplied by the number of Series B
Preferred shares held by each applicable holder plus the accrued dividends.
F-4
The 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred stock to be issued currently have the following features:
●a liquidation preference senior to all of the Company’s common stock;
 ●a dividend, payable annually, at an annual rate of six percent (6%) of the original issue price until such
Series B Preferred is no longer outstanding either due to conversion, redemption or otherwise; and
 ●voting rights on all matters, with each share having 1 vote.
As the Series B Preferred Stock is convertible at any time following the original issuance date into
Common Stock at a rate of approximately 7.14:1, the Company recognized a fair value measurement of
$6,503,112 for the Series B Preferred Stock, which is based on the 552,000 of preferred shares to be
issued times the conversion rate of approximately 7.14 times the price of Lucas’ common stock of
$1.65 per share at the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement on December 30, 2015.
The Debt to be Assumed
Upon closing, the Company is to assume $31,500,000 of debt from the Sellers which will be paid by a
new loan from International Bank of Commerce, the current lender of the Sellers, to the Company. The
Company is also expected to borrow an additional $4,975,000 at closing in order to fulfill the cash
consideration obligation due at closing. The new loan amount is expected to be for $40,000,000 and to
have a three year term and to bear an annual interest rate of NYPR + 2% with a floor of 5.5%. Although
subject to change, the payment schedule is expected to be the greater of 50% of the net monthly
income or monthly principal and interest payments of $425,000 with any unpaid principal and accrued
interest due at maturity. The Company will be required to create a sinking fund with an initial deposit of
$3,360,000 to be used for principal reductions. There is also a 1% commitment fee of $400,000 of which
$200,000 will be due on closing with the remaining amount to be due six months after closing.
Additionally 390,290 shares of common stock with a fair value of $643,979 are expected to be issued
for an underwriting equity fee.
As collateral, International Bank of Commerce is expected to have a first lien on various working
interest in the acquired properties. The loan is expected to be subject to a maximum loan-to-value ratio
of 50% at all times with a semiannual test based on semiannual reserve reports using pricing
parameters determined by International Bank of Commerce.
2. BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The statements of revenues and direct operating expenses of the Properties for the years ended
March 31, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”). Complete financial and operating information related to the properties,
including balance sheet and cash flow information, are not presented because the properties were
maintained as assets and not separate companies in the accounting records of predecessors;
therefore, the assets, liabilities, indirect operating costs and other expenses applicable to the
operations were not allocated to the properties acquired.
The accompanying financial statements include revenues from oil and gas production and direct
operating expenses associated with the Properties. The accompanying statements of revenues and
direct operating expenses varies from a complete set of statements of operations in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America in that it does not reflect
certain indirect expenses that were incurred in connection with the ownership and operation of the
Properties including, but not limited to, general and administrative expenses, interest expense and
federal and state income tax expenses. These costs were not separately allocated to the Properties in
the accounting records of the Sellers. In addition, these allocations, if made using historical general
and administrative structures and tax burdens, would not produce allocations that would be indicative
of the historical performance of the Properties had they been part of Lucas due to differing size,
structure, operations and accounting policies. The accompanying statements also do not include the
provisions for depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion; as such amounts would not be
indicative of the costs that will be incurred upon the allocation of the purchase price paid.
Furthermore, no balance sheets have been presented because the acquired properties were not
accounted for as a separate subsidiary or division of the Sellers and complete financial statements are
not available, nor has information about the Properties, operating, investing and financing cash flows
been provided for similar reasons. Accordingly, the historical statements of revenues and direct
operating expenses of the Properties are presented in lieu of the full financial statements required
under Article 8-04 of Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Regulation S-X.
F-5
These statements of revenues and direct operating expenses are not indicative of the results of
operations for the Properties on a go forward basis.
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates — The statements of revenues and direct operating expenses were derived from the
historical operating statements of the sellers. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the statements of revenues and direct operating expenses. Actual results could be
different from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition — Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues reflect the sales method of
accounting. Under the sales method, revenues are recognized based on actual volumes of oil and
natural gas sold to purchasers. Management believes there were no significant imbalances with other
revenue interest owners attributable to the Properties during any of the periods presented in these
statements.
Direct Operating Expenses — Direct operating expenses are recognized on an accrual basis and
consist of direct expenses of operating the Properties. The direct operating expenses include lease
operating expenses, severance and ad valorem taxes.
4. CONTINGENCIES
The Properties may be subject to potential claims and litigation in the normal course of operations.
The Company does not believe that any liability resulting from any pending or threatened litigation will
have a material adverse effect on the operations or financial results of the Properties.
Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)
The following unaudited supplemental reserve information summarizes the net proved reserves of oil
and gas and the standardized measure thereof for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015
attributable to the Properties. All of the reserves are located in the United States. The reserve
disclosures are based on reserve studies prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the
SEC.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves and
in projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures,
including many factors beyond the property owner’s control. Reserve engineering is a subjective
process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be
measured in an exact manner and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of
available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Because all reserve
estimates are to some degree subjective, the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered,
production and operating costs, the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future
oil and gas sales prices may each differ from those assumed in these estimates. In addition, different
reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and cash flows based upon the
same available data. The standardized measure shown below represents estimates only and should
not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the
Properties. In this regard, the information set forth in the following tables includes revisions of reserve
estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year’s estimates. Such revisions
reflect additional information from subsequent development activities, production history of the
Properties and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such property resulting from
changes in product prices.
Proved reserves, including proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves, at March 31, 2016
were estimated by the independent petroleum consulting firm, Ralph E. Davis Associates, LLC. The
proved reserves for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were calculated by rolling forward the
reserves at December 31, 2015 using the actual production for the periods. The future cash flows
presented below are based on cost rates and statutory income tax rates in existence as of the date of
the projections and average prices based on a 12-month average of first of the month commodity
prices for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.

Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (Unaudited)
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, in management’s opinion, should be
examined with caution. The basis for this table is the reserve studies prepared by independent
petroleum engineering consultants, which contain imprecise estimates of quantities and rates of future
production of reserves. Revisions of previous year estimates can have a significant impact on these
results. Therefore, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow is not necessarily
indicative of the fair value of the Company’s proved oil and natural gas properties.
Future income tax expense was computed by applying statutory rates, less the effects of tax credits
for each period presented, to calculate the difference between pre-tax net cash flows relating to the
Company’s proved reserves and the tax basis of proved properties, after consideration of available net
operating loss and percentage depletion carryovers.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors
Lucas Energy, Inc.
Houston, Texas
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Lucas Energy, Inc. as of March 31,
2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and
cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of
Lucas Energy, Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Lucas Energy, Inc. as of March 31, 2016, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company has incurred significant losses from operations and had a working capital
deficit at March 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters also are described in
Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.

LUCAS ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY
Lucas Energy Inc. (“Lucas” or the “Company”) is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the
development and acquisition of onshore properties in Texas. The Company’s main operations are
primarily located in the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk trends in Wilson, Gonzales and Karnes Counties.
Our corporate headquarters are in Houston, Texas and our field operation is located in Gonzales,
Texas where we manage the Company’s well operations.
Pursuant to the authorization provided by the Company’s stockholders at the Company’s March 25,
2015 annual meeting of stockholders, and in order to meet the continued listing standards of the NYSE
MKT, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the filing of a Certificate of Amendment to the
Company’s Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-25 reverse
stock split of all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock on July 15, 2015. The
effect of the reverse split was to combine each 25 shares of outstanding common stock prior to the
reverse split into one new share subsequent to the reverse split, with no change in authorized shares
or par value per share, and to reduce the number of common stock shares outstanding from
approximately 35.1 million shares to approximately 1.4 million shares (prior to rounding fractional
shares up to the nearest whole share). Proportional adjustments were also made to the conversion
and exercise prices of the Company’s outstanding convertible preferred stock, warrants and stock
options, and to the number of shares issued and issuable under the Company’s stock incentive plans.
All issued and outstanding shares of common stock, conversion terms of preferred stock, options and
warrants to purchase common stock and per share amounts contained in the financial statements, in
accordance with SAB TOPIC 4C, have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse split for all
periods presented.
NOTE 2 – LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS
At March 31, 2016, the Company’s total current liabilities of $11.1 million exceeded its total current
assets of $0.5 million, resulting in a working capital deficit of $10.6 million, while at March 31, 2015, the
Company’s total current liabilities of $10.3 million exceeded its total current assets of $0.6 million,
resulting in a working capital deficit of $9.7 million. The $0.9 million increase in the working capital
deficit is primarily related to cash used from our issuance of debt.
On August 28, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Rogers Loan (defined in Note 6) whereby we
agreed to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Rogers Loan to October 31, 2016 (from
September 13, 2015), pay $39,000 in monthly principal payments in lieu of interest as well as pay all
operating income of the collateralized assets (beginning October 1, 2015). Additionally, on December
14, 2015, we entered into another amendment to the Rogers Loan requiring us to transfer all of our oil
and gas interests and equipment to our newly formed wholly-owned Texas subsidiary, CATI Operating
LLC (“CATI”), which clarified that following the transfer, our lender had no right to foreclose upon
Lucas (at the Nevada corporate parent level) upon the occurrence of an event of default and that
instead our lender would only take action against CATI and its assets. For the months of January,
February and March 2016, the Company did not make the required monthly principal payments due
pursuant to the terms of the Rogers loan as amended. Instead, the Company and the loan
administrator agreed to settle any outstanding administration and legal fees in lieu of the principal
payments. The Company paid approximately $98,000 related to the fees and obtained a waiver for the
nonpayment of the principal amounts. Additionally, the Company did not make any operating income
payments on such loan as there was an operating deficit of approximately $79,000 as of March 31,
2016.
F-16
On August 30, 2015, we entered into a Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement with Silver Star. The
line of credit provided us the right to issue up to $2.4 million in convertible promissory notes to Silver
Star. Specifically, the Company had the right to request advances in an amount not to exceed
$200,000, each thirty days, and each advance was evidenced by a convertible note. To date, Lucas has
drawn $1,000,000 under the line of credit for the months of October, November, December 2015 and
January and February 2016. In February 2016, we received notice that $300,000 of the convertible
notes were assigned by Silver Star to Rockwell Capital Partners (“Rockwell”), and on March 28, 2016,
Rockwell converted $206,000 of the principal and interest due on such convertible notes into shares of
our common stock at a conversion price of $1.50 per share, for an aggregate of 137,333 shares. We
also received notice in April 2016, that $500,000 of additional convertible notes were assigned by Silver
Star to Rockwell, and on April 25, 2016, Rockwell partially converted $159,780 of the principal and
interest due on such convertible notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $1.50
per share, for an aggregate of 106,520 shares. Additionally, as discussed below, in April 2016, the
Company, Target Alliance London Limited (“TALL”), and Silver Star, entered into an Assignment,
Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit and Notes Agreement whereby Silver Star assigned its
rights and ownership of a $200,000 Convertible Promissory Note issued by us to Silver Star
thereunder dated February 10, 2016 to TALL in consideration for $200,000.
On December 30, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire, from 21 different
entities and individuals, working interests in producing properties and undeveloped acreage. The
assets agreed to be acquired include varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the
liquids-rich Mid-Continent region. In exchange for the assets being acquired, Lucas will assume
$31,350,000 in commercial bank debt, issue 552,000 shares of a newly designated form of convertible
preferred stock, issue 13,009,664 shares of common stock, and pay $4,975,000 in cash. At the closing
of the transaction, which is subject to various closing conditions, we will rebrand and change our
name to “Camber Energy, Inc.” The Asset Purchase Agreement also includes customary termination
provisions for both the Company and the sellers, which include, subject to the terms of the purchase
agreement and in certain circumstances rights to cure or other prerequisites. The Company also
obtained the opinion of Canaccord Genuity Corporation (“Canaccord”) providing that in the opinion of
Canaccord, the acquisition is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company, prior to the approval
of such purchase agreement by the Board of Directors. The Company agreed to pay Canaccord
$170,000 for the fairness opinion. We currently anticipate the closing of the acquisition, which is
subject to various closing conditions, to occur during the second quarter of the current fiscal year and
will require additional funding of approximately $1.35 million in legal expenses, investment banking
fees and other transaction costs in order to complete the acquisition (the “Acquisition”), in addition to
the cash required to be paid at closing as described above.
On March 29, 2016, Lucas entered into a Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement with HFT
Enterprises, LLC (“HFT”). The note purchase agreement provides us the right to issue up to $600,000
in convertible promissory notes to HFT. To date, Lucas has drawn $600,000 under the note purchase
agreement during the months of March and April 2016.
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited institutional
investor, pursuant to which we sold and issued a redeemable convertible subordinated debenture,
with a face amount of $530,000, convertible into 163,077 shares of common stock at a conversion price
equal to $3.25 per share (the “Debenture”) and a warrant to purchase 1,384,616 shares of common
stock at an exercise price equal to $3.25 per share (the “First Warrant”). The accredited institutional
investor purchased the Debenture at a 5.0% original issue discount for the sum of $500,000 and
agreed that it will exercise the First Warrant, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, for the sum of $4.5
million.
On April 6, 2016, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement”) with the same accredited institutional investor, pursuant to which we agreed, subject to
certain conditions, to issue a $5.26 million face amount newly designated Series C redeemable
convertible preferred stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) at a 5% original issue discount,
convertible into 1,618,462 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $3.25 per share, and a
warrant to purchase 1,111,112 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share (the
“Second Warrant”). Under the terms of the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the Second Warrant
and $530,000 of Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and issued for $500,000 after we close the
Acquisition, and, assuming the Acquisition closes, the remaining $4.73 million of Series C Preferred
Stock will be sold and issued for $4.5 million immediately after approval by our stockholders for NYSE
MKT purposes of the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series C Preferred
Stock and exercise of the Second Warrant, and there is an effective registration statement covering the
shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the
Second Warrant.
On April 11, 2016, the Company, TALL, and Silver Star, entered into an Assignment, Assumption and
Amendment to Line of Credit and Notes Agreement. Pursuant to the assignment agreement, Silver
Star assigned its rights and ownership of a $200,000 convertible note issued by us to Silver Star
thereunder dated February 10, 2016 to TALL in consideration for $200,000. Additionally, Silver Star
provided us a release from any liability in connection with the line of credit and prior convertible notes
issued to Silver Star by us. The assignment agreement also amended the line of credit and terms of
any future convertible notes issued thereunder, to, among other things, to increase the monthly
advance limit from $200,000 to $250,000 per month and increase the conversion price of any future
notes issued from $1.50 per share to $3.25 per share. As additional consideration for TALL agreeing to
the terms, we agreed, to grant TALL warrants to purchase 51,562 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $3.25 per share, for each $250,000 loaned pursuant to the terms of the amended line
of credit. To date, the Company has submitted two $250,000 advance requests for the months of May
2016 and June 2016, for which TALL has not provided to date.
F-17
In addition to the transactions noted above, Lucas is currently discussing potential financing
transactions in order to fulfill our current capital requirements as well as our planned asset acquisition,
which we believe, if finalized and completed, will ensure the future viability of the Company. However,
due to our current capital structure and the nature of oil and gas interests, i.e., that rates of production
generally decline over time as oil and gas reserves are depleted, if we are unable to obtain the
necessary financing to finalize the asset purchase or drill additional wells and develop our proved
undeveloped reserves (PUDs); coupled with the continued substantial drop in commodity prices over
the last twelve months, we believe that our revenues will continue to decline over time. Therefore, we
may be forced to scale back our business plan, sell assets to satisfy outstanding debts or take other
remedial steps which may include seeking bankruptcy protection.
The realization of the Company’s assets and satisfaction of its liabilities is contingent on the
completion of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Company anticipates that it will need approximately
$15.0 million to execute its current business plan and is currently in the later stages of getting
shareholder approval and closing on the Asset Purchase Agreement. In the event that the Company is
unable to complete the Asset Purchase Agreement, and is otherwise unable to replace such financing
on a timely basis, it would materially affect the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If
closing on the Asset Purchase Agreement is not completed, among other things, the Company
expects that it would incur additional impairment of its oil and gas properties of approximately $12.0
million and the Company’s ability to meet its obligations from existing cash flows would be
significantly affected. If the Company would be required to seek financing from other sources, such
financings may not be available or, if available, may not be on terms acceptable to the Company.
Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of
assets or classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to raise capital to meet its obligations and develop its oil and gas properties to attain
profitable operations.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next
twelve months. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The financial statements of Lucas Energy include the accounts of its wholly-owned Texas subsidiary,
CATI Operating, LLC (“CATI”), which was created in October 2015. Per an amendment to the Rogers
Loan, dated December 14, 2015, we transferred all of our oil and gas interests and equipment to CATI
(see “Note 6 – Notes Payable” below). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Lucas’s financial statements are based on a number of significant estimates, including oil and natural
gas reserve quantities which are the basis for the calculation of depreciation, depletion and
impairment of oil and natural gas properties, and timing and costs associated with its asset retirement
obligations, as well as those related to the fair value of stock options, stock warrants and stock issued
for services. While we believe that our estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the financial
statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and financial instruments which mature within three
months of the date of purchase. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit
accounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any
losses in such accounts. The Company had no cash equivalents at March 31, 2016 or 2015.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consist of uncollaterized oil and natural gas revenues due under normal trade
terms. Management reviews receivables periodically and reduces the carrying amount by a valuation
allowance that reflects management’s best estimate of the amount that may not be collectible. There
was no allowance recorded as of March 31, 2016 or 2015.
F-18
Concentration of Credit Risk
We generally sell a significant portion of our oil and gas production to a relatively small number of
customers. For the year ended March 31, 2016, 100% of our consolidated product revenues were
attributable to Shell Trading (US) Company, our current and only customer as of March 31, 2016. We
are not dependent upon any one purchaser and have alternative purchasers readily available at
competitive market prices if there is disruption in services or other events that cause us to search for
other ways to sell our production.
Oil and Natural Gas Properties, Full Cost Method
Lucas uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas producing activities. Costs to
acquire mineral interests in oil and natural gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells used to
find proved reserves, and to drill and equip development wells including directly related overhead
costs and related asset retirement costs are capitalized.
Under this method, all costs, including internal costs directly related to acquisition, exploration and
development activities are capitalized as oil and natural gas property costs on a country-by-country
basis. Costs not subject to amortization consist of unproved properties that are evaluated on a
property-by-property basis. Amortization of these unproved property costs begins when the
properties become proved or their values become impaired. Lucas assesses overall values of
unproved properties, if any, on at least an annual basis or when there has been an indication that
impairment in value may have occurred. Impairment of unproved properties is assessed based on
management’s intention with regard to future development of individually significant properties and
the ability of Lucas to obtain funds to finance their programs. If the results of an assessment indicate
that the properties are impaired, the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be
amortized.
Sales of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to the net full cost pool with
no gain or loss recognized, unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between
capitalized costs and proved reserves. If it is determined that the relationship is significantly altered,
the corresponding gain or loss will be recognized in the statements of operations.
Costs of oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the units of production method.
Amortization expense calculated per equivalent physical unit of production amounted to $31.83 and
$35.34 per barrel of oil equivalent for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Ceiling Test
In applying the full cost method, Lucas performs an impairment test (ceiling test) at each reporting
date, whereby the carrying value of property and equipment is compared to the “estimated present
value” of its proved reserves discounted at a 10-percent interest rate of future net revenues, based on
current economic and operating conditions at the end of the period, plus the cost of properties not
being amortized, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties included in costs
being amortized, less the income tax effects related to book and tax basis differences of the properties.
If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged as an impairment expense. During the year
ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment of $21.4 million associated with oil and
gas properties primarily due to a significant decline in commodity prices during the current fiscal year.
During the year ended March 31, 2015, there was no impairment of oil and natural gas properties
recorded.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company records the fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) in the period
in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset. The present value of the estimated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset and is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Lucas accrues an
abandonment liability associated with its oil and natural gas wells when those assets are placed in
service. The ARO is recorded at its estimated fair value and accretion is recognized over time as the
discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. Fair value is determined by using the
expected future cash outflows discounted at Lucas’s credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. No market
risk premium has been included in Lucas’s calculation of the ARO balance.
Other Property and Equipment
Other property and equipment are stated at cost and consist primarily of a field office, furniture and
computer equipment. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are
recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards
and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are
the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and
accrued tax liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of
enactment.
F-19
Lucas has evaluated and concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring
recognition in the Company’s financial statements as of March 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company’s
policy is to classify assessments, if any, for tax related interest expense and penalties as interest
expense.
Earnings per Common Share
Basic and diluted net income per share calculations are calculated on the basis of the weighted
average number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding during the year. Purchases
of treasury stock reduce the outstanding shares commencing on the date that the stock is purchased.
Common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation when a loss is incurred as their effect
would be anti-dilutive.
Stock options to purchase 22,920 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of
$33.96 per share and warrants to purchase 232,585 shares of common stock at a weighted average
exercise price of $47.64 per share were outstanding at March 31, 2016. Stock options to purchase
24,920 shares of common stock at an average exercise price of $33.81 per share and warrants to
purchase 232,585 shares of common stock at an average exercise price of $50.34 per share were
outstanding at March 31, 2015.
At March 31, 2016, Lucas had outstanding 500 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Each
share of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shares is convertible into an aggregate of 40 shares
of the Company’s common stock and has no liquidation preference and no maturity date. The 500
shares of outstanding Series A Preferred stock were subsequently converted into 20,000 shares of
common stock on April 25, 2016.
Using the treasury stock method, had the Company had net income, no common shares attributable to
our outstanding stock options would have been included in the fully diluted earnings per share
calculation for the year ended March 31, 2016.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances
disclosures about fair value measurements. It defines fair value as the exchange price that would be
received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring
fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
●Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and model-driven valuations whose inputs are
observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. Valuations may be obtained from, or
corroborated by, third-party pricing services.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs to measure fair value of assets and liabilities for which there is little, if any
market activity at the measurement date, using reasonable inputs and assumptions based upon the best
information at the time, to the extent that inputs are available without undue cost and effort.
●
●
As of March 31, 2016, the significant inputs to the Company’s derivative liability calculation were Level
3 inputs.
Share-Based Compensation
Lucas measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award over the vesting period.
Revenue and Cost Recognition
Lucas recognizes oil and natural gas revenue under the sales method of accounting for its interests in
producing wells as crude oil and natural gas is produced and sold from those wells. Costs associated
with production are expensed in the period incurred. Crude oil produced but remaining as inventory in
field tanks is not recorded as revenue in Lucas’s financial statements because it is not material.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued during fiscal 2016 and 2015,
none of which are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, operations
or cash flows.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), which supersedes nearly all
existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize
revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09
defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and
estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing
GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach
reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain
practical expedients; or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting
ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its
consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which the Company will
adopt the standard in 2017.
F-20
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to
Continue as a Going Concern. The new standard requires management to assess the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. Disclosures are required if there is substantial doubt as to the
Company’s continuation as a going concern within one year after the issue date of financial
statements. The standard provides guidance for making the assessment, including consideration of
management’s plans which may alleviate doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern. ASU 2014-15 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2016. We expect to
adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and do not expect the adoption of this
pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest – Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) –
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. ASU 2015-03 amends previous guidance to
require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet
as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the
amendments in this ASU. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company adopted this
ASU during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact
on our financial statements.
Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated all transactions occurring between March 31, 2016 through the date the
consolidated financial statements were issued for subsequent event disclosure consideration.

Impairment
During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment of $21.4 million
associated with oil and gas properties primarily due to a significant decline in commodity prices during
the fiscal year. During the year ended March 31, 2015, there was no impairment of oil and natural gas
properties recorded.
Acquisition of Oil and Natural Gas Properties
On September 3, 2015, per the Rogers Settlement (described and defined below under “Note 13 -
Settlement Agreements”), Lucas requested the return of certain assets granted to Victory Energy
Corporation (“Victory”) as part of the Rogers Settlement. Those assets included the assignment of a
3.28% leasehold working interest in the Dingo Unit well and a 1.48% leasehold working interest in the
Platypus Unit well; as well as 44,070 shares of common stock of Lucas. These assets were
subsequently returned to Lucas. As a result, Lucas recorded a reduction of $110,616 to our oil and gas
property full-cost pool representing the fair value of the forfeited shares ($2.51 per share) on the date
the common stock was returned to Lucas, September 24, 2015.
During the year ended March 31, 2015, we obtained new leases and were able to increase our Eagle
Ford shale working interest share in certain Karnes County and Gonzales County, Texas properties
from 15% to 100%. As a result, we capitalized approximately $400,000 in leasehold costs. We also
acquired a new lease on a 300 acre lease in certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties
located in the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas for approximately $236,000. Additionally, we entered
into agreements with Penn Virginia Corporation (“PVA”) for participation in five wells with working
interests ranging from 1.48% to 3.28% in the Eagleville field. In February 2015, per the Collaboration
Agreement (described and defined below under “Note 13 - Settlement Agreements”) with Victory, we
agreed to assign Victory all rights and interests to the five Penn Virginia wells. The Collaboration
Agreement was subsequently terminated in May 2015.
Sale of Oil and Gas Natural Properties
On June 25, 2015, we closed the sale of 139.04 net acres of oil and gas properties located in Karnes
County, Texas, to Earthstone Energy, Inc. (“Earthstone Energy”), which included the sale of all
working interest, net lease interest and contractual rights owned by us in the Copeland-Karnes Unit
and the Griffin Unit (the “Units”), but not any contractual obligations relating to the LEI Copeland-
Karnes wellbore and the LEI Griffin wellbore or production therefrom. Earthstone Energy also became
the operator of the Units. The total purchase price paid to us for the purchase was $347,600, along with
the grant from Earthstone Energy to us of an option to participate, at cost, for up to 20% of an 8/8ths
interest, in all future operations within the proposed ESTE-Boggs Unit upon successfully obtaining the
required funding, provided that we were required to exercise the option on or before August 1, 2015.
We were unable to provide the required funding and as a result, we were not able to exercise our
option to participate, which option expired.
F-21
Also, on June 25, 2015, per the Earthstone Settlement and Earthstone/Victory Settlement (described
below under “Note 13 - Settlement Agreements”), Earthstone (defined in Note 13) agreed to pay us
approximately $54,000 (representing the net of amounts previously paid by Victory to Earthstone in
connection with the terms of a prior participation agreement covering certain leases in Karnes County,
Texas and certain amounts owed to us in connection with title issues discovered in connection with
those leases) and we agreed that we are deemed a non-consenting party in connection with such
wells; and Victory agreed to assign certain oil and gas interests in the wells which we transferred to
Victory in February 2015, to Earthstone. As a result, we capitalized approximately $142,000
(approximately $196,000 paid by Victory to Earthstone less approximately $54,000 paid by Earthstone
to Lucas) to our oil and gas property full-cost pool.
In addition, on June 25, 2015, per the Victory Settlement Agreement (described below under “Note 13 -
Settlement Agreements”), Victory retained ownership and control over five Penn Virginia well-bores
and also retained the obligations to pay expenses associated with such Penn Virginia well-bores
effective after August 1, 2014; and we also assigned Victory rights to another property located in the
same field as the Penn Virginia well-bores. In total, six Penn Virginia well-bores rights were assigned to
Victory, representing a $529,860 credit to our oil and gas property full-cost pool, provided that as
described above certain of those assets were reassigned to us on September 24, 2015.
During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company signed two binding participation agreements with
Earthstone in August 2014, to jointly develop the Company’s Karnes County and Gonzales County,
Texas acreage in the Eagle Ford shale formation. At closing, Lucas received approximately $572,000
for a 50% working interest on approximately 720 acres. In February 2015, our ownership percentage in
two wells in Karnes County was then assigned to Victory as part of a proposed business combination
with Victory. The proposed business combination was subsequently terminated in May 2015 (See
“Note 13 – Settlement Agreements” for settlement terms).
On October 10, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its 100% working interest in oil and gas
leases and wells/wellbores in Madison County, Texas for $700,000. The cash transaction included
approximately 450 net mineral acres primarily in the Buda and Glen Rose formations. Management
determined this acreage to be non-core and utilized the proceeds to purchase leaseholds in Gonzales
County, Texas in addition to debt service and for general corporate purposes. All oil and natural gas
property sale proceeds were treated as a reduction in the full cost pool with no gain or loss recorded
on the sales.
Other Property and Equipment
In February 2014, the Company purchased a field office for approximately $50,000 which is used to
provide local operational support for our properties in the Eagleford and Austin Chalk areas. The land
upon which the field office resides is leased by the Company over a three-year term beginning in
January 2014 through December 2016. The lease is renewable, and the yearly lease amounts are
$7,200, $7,800 and $8,400 over the three-year term, respectively.
Office Lease
On July 27, 2015, we moved our corporate headquarters from 3555 Timmons Lane, Suite 1550,
Houston, Texas 77027 to 450 Gears Road, Suite 780, Houston, Texas 77067 in connection with the
expiration of our prior office space lease and received proceeds from our security deposit of $6,628.
We entered into a sublease on approximately 3,300 square feet of office space that expired on January
31, 2016 and had a base monthly rent of approximately $5,000 of which we had paid four months in
advance as well as a $5,000 security deposit. For the proceeding months, we paid month-to-month rent
until we were able to move into our new office suite located in Suite 860 at the same physical address
location. The new office space is approximately 4,400 square feet and has a base monthly rent of
approximately $7,700 for the first year and approximately $7,900, $8,000, $8,200 and $8,400 for
subsequent years. We also paid an $8,400 deposit and received proceeds from our prior security
deposit of $5,000.

NOTE 6 – NOTES PAYABLE
Victory Loan
On February 3, 2015, Victory Energy Corporation and Lucas entered into a letter of intent for a
business combination between Victory and Lucas that outlined the proposed terms under which
Victory and Lucas planned to combine through a merger. In anticipation of the merger, Victory desired
to provide Lucas with loans necessary to allow Lucas to meet working capital requirements and to pay
down certain payables so that Lucas could maintain key vendors and cover transaction costs during
the period prior to the merger. As collateral for the loans that were to be made by Victory to Lucas,
Lucas was to pledge to Victory shares of Lucas common stock pursuant to a pledge and security
agreement.
Victory had loaned Lucas a total of $350,000 through March 31, 2015, which was recognized as a
current liability on the balance sheet on March 31, 2015 as the maturity date for the loan was February
26, 2016. After March 31, 2015, but prior to the entry into the Victory settlement on June 24, 2015, noted
below, Victory loaned Lucas an additional $250,000 for a total loan balance of $600,000.
On May 11, 2015, Victory notified Lucas that Victory did not intend to proceed with the merger and
thereby terminated the letter of intent. Thereafter, on June 24, 2015, Lucas and Victory executed a
Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release whereby, among other things, Lucas acknowledged that
Victory had no further obligation to advance any funds to Lucas, and Lucas exchanged working
interests in certain oil and gas properties and 44,070 shares of restricted common stock (the
“Settlement Shares”) in complete satisfaction of the $600,000 owed to Victory under the Loan
Agreement.
Therefore, we recognized no liability to Victory as of March 31, 2016 on our balance sheet, as the loan
amount was allocated to oil and gas property full-cost pool as part of the $529,860 credit described in
Note 4. The 44,070 shares of restricted common stock were ultimately forfeited and returned to Lucas
on September 24, 2015 due to Victory’s failure to comply with the terms of the Rogers Settlement
(which is defined and described in greater detail below under “Note 13 - Settlement Agreements”). The
forfeited shares, along with 1,476 treasury shares (for a total of 45,546 shares of common stock), were
then sold by us in a private transaction on September 28, 2015 for an aggregate of $104,754 (see “Note
9 – Stockholders’ Equity” below).
Rogers Loan
At March 31, 2016, the Company had $7,153,734 due under the $7.5 million Letter Loan Agreement (as
amended, modified, restated and revised to date, the “Rogers Loan”) originally entered into with
Louise H. Rogers (“Rogers”) on August 13, 2013. Amortization of debt discount of $21,323 was
recorded during the year ended March 31, 2016. No unamortized discount remained as of March 31,
2016.
On August 28, 2015, we and Rogers entered into an amendment to the Rogers Loan. Pursuant to the
amendment, the parties agreed to extend the maturity date of the Rogers Loan to October 31, 2016
(from September 13, 2015); we agreed to pay all professional fees incurred by Rogers; we agreed to
make principal payments to Rogers from certain insurance proceeds to be received after the date of
the amendment, which we have not received; we agreed to pay Rogers $39,000 in lieu of interest on the
Rogers Loan as well as all operating income of collateralized assets (beginning October 1, 2015); and
the parties agreed that if after 90 days a related party of Silver Star and Rogers could not agree to a
buyout of the Rogers Loan, which did not occur, the Company would transfer all of its assets to a
wholly-owned subsidiary, which as noted below, occurred on December 16, 2015. In connection with
the amendment, Rogers also agreed to waive all past events of default which had occurred under the
terms of the Rogers Loan.
On December 14, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Rogers Loan. The amendment (i)
required us to transfer all of our oil and gas interests and equipment to our then newly formed wholly-
owned Texas subsidiary, CATI Operating LLC; (ii) clarified that following the transfer, Rogers had no
right to foreclose upon the Company (at the Nevada corporate parent level) upon the occurrence of an
event of default under the Rogers Loan, and that instead Rogers would only take action against CATI
and its assets; and (iii) required Rogers to release all UCC and other security filings on the Company
(provided that Rogers is allowed to file the same filings on CATI and its assets). Subsequently, we
formally assigned all of our oil and gas interests and equipment to CATI pursuant to an Assignment
and Bill of Sale dated December 16, 2015.
F-23
On December 16, 2015, we, CATI and Rogers entered into an Assignment, Novation, and Assumption
Agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”). Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, we assigned our
obligations under the Rogers Loan and related loan documents, to CATI, as if CATI had originally been
a party thereto, CATI agreed to assume such obligations and to take whatever actions requested by
Rogers in order for Rogers to secure the amounts owed under the Rogers Loan, and Rogers agreed to
release us (at the parent company level) from any obligations under the Rogers Loan and related loan
documents, other than under the amendment above.
Silver Star Line of Credit
On August 30, 2015, Lucas entered into a Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement with Silver Star.
The line of credit provides the Company the right, from time to time, subject to the terms of the line of
credit, to issue up to $2.4 million in convertible promissory notes to Silver Star. Specifically, the
Company has the right to request advances in an amount not to exceed $200,000, every thirty days,
subject to the conditions set forth in the line of credit.
Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, each of the convertible notes are due and payable on
October 1, 2016, accrue interest at the rate of 6% per annum (15% upon the occurrence of an event of
default), and allow the holder thereof the right to convert the principal and interest due thereunder into
common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $1.50 per share, provided that the total
number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes cannot exceed
19.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock on August 30, 2015 (or the total voting power
outstanding on such date), the date the line of credit was agreed to, which was 243,853 shares (when
factoring in certain other shares of common stock sold to an affiliate of Silver Star), or otherwise
exceed the amount of shares that would require stockholder approval under applicable NYSE MKT
rules, unless or until we receive stockholder approval for such issuances. In the event the number of
shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes exceeds such threshold,
the notes cannot be converted into common stock. We have the right to prepay the convertible notes
at any time, provided we provide the holder at least 30 days prior notice of our intention to prepay such
notes.
During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company issued five convertible notes totaling $1,000,000
to Silver Star in $200,000 increments on September 28, 2015, October 21, 2015, November 23, 2015,
December 31, 2015 and February 10, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the line of credit. If fully converted
by Silver Star (without factoring in any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, which is also convertible
into our common stock as provided in the note, or taking into account any conversion limitations
associated therewith), a total of 133,334 shares of common stock would be required to be issued to
Silver Star for each note (representing approximately between 8.4% and 9.1% of our then outstanding
shares of common stock) and if fully converted at maturity, when factoring in accrued interest thereon
through maturity, a total of approximately 700,778 shares of common stock would be required to be
issued to Silver Star for the five notes issued, of which only approximately 243,853 common shares are
eligible to be fully converted in order to not exceed the 19.9% threshold noted above.
The convertible notes contained a beneficial conversion feature with a combined intrinsic value of
$687,987 for the five notes. The intrinsic value is based upon the difference between the market price
of Lucas’s common stock on the date of issuance and the conversion price of $1.50. The total number
of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes cannot exceed 19.9% of
our outstanding shares of common stock on August 30, 2015, the date the line of credit was agreed to,
without stockholder approval. Therefore, only $227,910 in intrinsic value was recognized as a discount
based on the 243,853 common shares limitation noted above. The discount is being amortized through
interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes.
The Company determined that the remaining 456,925 common shares available for issuance are
contingently convertible based on the fact that these additional notes require stockholder approval
before they can be converted. Therefore, the Company will not record the additional debt discount of
$460,077 for the beneficial conversion feature intrinsic values for these common shares or for any
subsequent notes issued until those notes are deemed convertible by shareholder approval.
On February 1, 2016, we entered into a first amendment to the Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement
with Silver Star, which added a 9.99% ownership blocker to the convertible promissory notes and
which prevents the holder of the notes from converting such notes into common stock if upon such
conversion the holder would beneficially own more than 9.99% of our outstanding common stock,
subject to the ability of any holder to modify such limitation with 61 days prior written notice. We also
received notice on February 2, 2016, that $300,000 of the convertible notes were assigned by Silver
Star to Rockwell Capital Partners.
F-24
On March 28, 2016, Rockwell Capital Partners converted $206,000 of the principal and interest due on
such convertible notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $1.50 per share, for
an aggregate of 137,333 shares. As a result, the Company fully amortized the $73,333 discount
associated with the September 28, 2015 Note.
As of March 31, 2016, we had total convertible notes due to Silver Star and Rockwell Capital Partners
of $714,817 (net of the unamortized discount of $85,182) which is recognized as a short-term liability on
the Company’s balance sheet as of March 31, 2016. The Company has also recognized approximately
$14,100 in accrued interest as of March 31, 2016.
HFT Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement and Convertible Promissory Notes
On March 29, 2016, Lucas entered into a Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement with HFT
Enterprises, LLC. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed to issue an aggregate of
$600,000 in convertible notes, including $300,000 in convertible notes purchased on the date of the
parties’ entry into the agreement, and $150,000 in convertible notes purchased by Debra Herman, the
wife of Michael Herman, the principal of HFT, on April 26, 2016. We also granted Mrs. Herman warrants
to purchase 124,285 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.50 per share on April 26,
2016, when the final loan was made pursuant to the terms of the agreement. We also agreed pursuant
to the Note Purchase Agreement (a) to seek stockholder approval for the issuance of all of the shares
of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes and exercise of the warrants, at
such time as the Company seeks shareholder approval for the issuance of shares of common stock in
connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement (discussed in more detail in “Note 2 – Liquidity and
Going Concern Considerations”).
Each of the convertible notes are due and payable twelve months from their issuance date, accrue
interest at the rate of 6% per annum (15% upon the occurrence of an event of default), and allow the
holder thereof the right to convert the principal and interest due thereunder into common stock of the
Company at a conversion price of $1.50 per share, provided that the total number of shares of
common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes cannot exceed 19.9% of our
outstanding shares of common stock on March 29, 2016 (or the total voting power outstanding on
such date), the date the Note Purchase Agreement was agreed to, which was approximately 292,110
shares, or otherwise exceed the amount of shares that would require stockholder approval under
applicable NYSE MKT rules, unless or until we receive stockholder approval for such issuances. In the
event the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes
exceeds such threshold, the notes cannot be converted into common stock. We have the right to
prepay the convertible notes at any time, provided we provide the holder at least 10 days prior notice
of our intention to prepay such notes.
The warrants allow for cashless exercise rights, to the extent that such shares of common stock
issuable upon exercise thereof are not registered under the Securities Act, and include anti-dilutive
rights, for the first 12 months following the grant date of such warrants, which automatically reduce the
exercise price of the warrants to any lower priced security sold, granted or issued by us during such
anti-dilutive period, subject to certain exceptions, including officer and director grants and the
transactions contemplated by that certain Asset Purchase Agreement discussed and described in
greater detail in “Note 2 – Liquidity and Going Concern Considerations”.
At no time may the convertible notes be converted, or the warrants be exercised, into shares of our
common stock if such conversion or exercise, as applicable, would result in the holder of such
security and its affiliates owning an aggregate of in excess of 9.99% of the then outstanding shares of
our common stock, subject to the ability of holder to modify such limitation with 61 days prior written
notice to us.
As described above, during the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company issued two convertible notes
totaling $450,000 to HFT. If fully converted by HFT (without factoring in any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, which is also convertible into our common stock as provided in the note, or taking
into account any conversion limitations associated therewith), a total of 200,000 and 100,000 shares of
common stock would be required to be issued to HFT for each note, respectively (representing
approximately 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock) and if fully converted at maturity,
when factoring in accrued interest thereon through maturity, a total of 318,504 shares of common
stock would be required to be issued to HFT for the two notes issued, of which only approximately
292,110 common shares are eligible to be fully converted in order to not exceed the 19.9% threshold
noted above.
F-25
The convertible notes contained a beneficial conversion feature with a combined intrinsic value of
$450,000 for the two notes. The intrinsic value is based upon the difference between the market price
of Lucas’s common stock on the date of issuance and the conversion price of $1.50. As the total
number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes cannot exceed
19.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock on March 29, 2016, the date the Note Purchase
Agreement was agreed to, without stockholder approval; only $438,165 in intrinsic value was
recognized as a discount based on the 292,110 common shares limitation noted above. The discount
is being amortized through interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the
notes.
The Company determined that the remaining 7,890 common shares available for issuance are
contingently convertible based on the fact that these additional notes require stockholder approval
before they can be converted. Therefore, the Company will not record the additional debt discount of
$11,835 for the beneficial conversion feature intrinsic values for these common shares or for any
subsequent notes issued until those notes are deemed convertible by shareholder approval. However,
we fully discounted the entire notes as the fair value of the warrants far exceeds $11,835.
As of March 31, 2016, we had total convertible notes due to HFT of $25,000 (net of the unamortized
discount of $425,000) which is recognized as a short-term liability on the Company’s balance sheet as
of March 31, 2016. The Company has also recognized no accrued interest as of March 31, 2016.
Dreeben Note
On March 28, 2016, we borrowed $250,000 from Alan Dreeben, who is one of the sellers of the assets
we plan to acquire pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to a short-term promissory
note. The short-term promissory note has a principal balance of $275,000 (the $250,000 borrowed plus
a 10% original issue discount), does not accrue interest unless an event of default occurs thereunder,
at which time the note accrues interest at 15% per annum, has a maturity date of June 28, 2016 and
contains standard and customary events of default. The short-term promissory note may be prepaid at
any time without penalty. As additional consideration for Mr. Dreeben agreeing to make the loan, we
agreed to issue Mr. Dreeben 15,000 restricted shares of common stock, which to date, have not been
issued. Therefore, as of March 31, 2016, we accrued $48,000 in stock payable, which is based on the
closing price of the Company’s common stock ($3.20 per share) on March 28, 2016. We also
recognized the value of the $48,000 stock payable as a discount to the short-term promissory note in
addition to the original discount of $25,000, for a total discount of $73,000.
As of March 31, 2016, we had a short-term promissory due to Alan Dreeben of $202,000 (net of the
unamortized discount of $73,000), which is recognized as a short-term liability on the Company’s
balance sheet as of March 31, 2016.
NOTE 7 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Minimum Commitments. The Company has operating leases for office space in Houston, Texas and
land for a field office in Gonzales, Texas. The Company incurred rental expense of $95,815 and
$136,061 for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Future minimum annual rental commitments under non-cancelable leases at March 31, 2016 were
approximately $84,000 through March 31, 2017, $86,000 through March 31, 2018, $88,000 through
March 31, 2019, $90,000 through March 31, 2020, and $134,000 thereafter.
Legal Proceedings. From time to time suits and claims against Lucas arise in the ordinary course of
Lucas’s business, including contract disputes and title disputes. Lucas records reserves for
contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated.
Employment Agreements. November 1, 2012, we entered into an Employment Agreement with
Anthony C. Schnur, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, which agreement
was amended and restated December 12, 2012. The agreement had a term of two years, expiring on
October 31, 2014, provided that the agreement is automatically extended for additional one year terms,
unless either party provides notice of their intent not to renew within the 30 day period prior to any
automatic renewal date, which notice was not provided as of October 31, 2014 or 2015, and which
agreement therefore extended until October 31, 2016. The Company agreed to pay Mr. Schnur a base
annual salary of $310,000 during the term of the agreement, of which $290,000 is payable in cash and
$20,000 is payable in shares of the Company’s common stock. In the event the agreement is
terminated by the Company for a reason other than cause (as described in the agreement) or by Mr.
Schnur for good reason (as described in the agreement), Mr. Schnur is due in the form of a lump sum
payment, the product of the base salary and bonus he was paid under the agreement for the prior 12
month period, provided that if such termination occurs six months before or 24 months following the
occurrence of a Change of Control (as described in the agreement), Mr. Schnur is due 200% of the
amount described above upon such termination. The requirement to pay severance fees under the
Employment Agreement may prevent or delay a change of control of the Company.

At March 31, 2016, we had estimated net operating loss carry-forwards for federal and state income tax
purposes of approximately $43.1 million which will begin to expire, if not previously used, beginning in
the year 2030.

The above estimates are based upon management’s decisions concerning certain elections which
could change the relationship between net income and taxable income. Management decisions are
made annually and could cause the estimates to vary significantly.
The Company files income tax returns for federal and state purposes. Management believes that with
few exceptions, the Company is not subject to examination by United States tax authorities for tax
periods prior to 2011.
NOTE 9 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Common and Treasury Stock
On April 15, 2014, the Company agreed to sell an aggregate of 133,334 (post reverse split of 1:25) units
to certain institutional investors at a purchase price of $15.00 per unit or $2 million in aggregate, with
each unit consisting of one share of common stock (the “Shares”) and 0.50 of a warrant to purchase
one share of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $25.00 per share and a term of five
years (the “Warrants”, and collectively with the Shares, the “Units”). On April 21, 2014, the offering
closed, and the Company subsequently received an aggregate of $2,000,000 in gross funding and a
net of approximately $1.8 million (after deducting associated legal and placement agent fees). In total,
the Company sold 133,334 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 66,668 shares of
common stock. The Company used the funds raised in the offering to pay expenses related to lease
operating, workover activities and for general corporate purposes, including general and
administrative expenses.
On April 29, 2014, in connection with our entry into an amendment to the Rogers Loan (see “Note 6 -
Notes Payable”), we agreed to issue 3,000 shares (post reverse split of 1:25) of restricted common
stock at a purchase price of $15.75 per share (the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock
on April 29, 2014 (post reverse split of 1:25)), to Robertson Global Credit, LLC (“Robertson”), the
administrator of the loan, as additional consideration for the modifications. The listing of the shares
was formally approved by the NYSE MKT LLC on May 8, 2014 and subsequently issued to Robertson
on May 16, 2014.
On June 25, 2015, pursuant to the Victory Settlement (described below under “Note 13 - Settlement
Agreements”), we and Victory agreed that among other things, we would issue 44,070 shares of our
restricted common stock to Victory in full consideration of the $600,000 owed under the Loan
Agreement, which would be held in escrow until the payment of amounts owed to Rogers under the
Rogers Settlement (which is described in greater detail below under “Note 13 - Settlement
Agreements”).
On September 3, 2015, Lucas requested the return of 44,070 shares of common stock from the escrow
agent established as part of the Rogers Settlement. Per the settlement agreement with Victory, in the
event Victory failed to timely make the full payment of $258,000 due to our lender by August 27, 2015,
then all assets held in escrow would be promptly returned to Lucas. As a result, the escrow agent
returned the 44,070 shares of common stock to Lucas, which shares were then placed in the
Company’s treasury.
On September 17, 2015, Allied Petroleum, Inc. (“Allied”), entered into a Subscription Agreement with
Lucas and agreed to purchase 45,546 shares of the restricted common stock of Lucas (the “Allied
Shares”), which shares were held in the Company’s treasury, for $2.30 per share (a 17% discount to
the $2.78 closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 17, 2015) or $104,754 in
aggregate. The Company received funds from Allied on September 25, 2015, and issued Allied the
Allied Shares on September 28, 2015. The principal of Allied is John Chambers, who is also the
principal of Silver Star, with whom the Company entered into a Non-Revolving Line of Credit
Agreement on August 30, 2015 (see “Note 6 – Notes Payable”). Because the Allied shares were issued
from the Company’s treasury, the sale did not result in an increase in the Company’s total issued
shares.
Lucas did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the year ended March 31, 2015. The
shares previously purchased were held by Lucas’s transfer agent as treasury stock, and the shares
were treated as issued, but not outstanding, at March 31, 2015. The shares were recorded at a cost of
$49,159.
On March 28, 2016, Rockwell Capital Partners converted $206,000 of the principal and interest due on
certain convertible notes held by such entity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of
$1.50 per share, and was issued an aggregate of 137,333 shares of common stock (as described in
greater detail above under “Note 6 – Notes Payable”).
F-28
See “Note 10 – Share-Based Compensation” for information on common stock activity related to
share-based compensation, including shares granted to the Board of Directors, officers and
employees.
Preferred Stock
As of March 31, 2016, the Company has 500 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding. Each share of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 40 shares of
the Company’s common stock and has no liquidation preference and no maturity date. Additionally,
the conversion rate of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock adjusts automatically in connection
with and in proportion to any dividends payable by the Company in common stock. Subsequently, on
April 19, 2016, the holder of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, agreed to convert all 500 shares
of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 20,000 shares of our common stock. We
agreed to pay the holder $20,000 in connection with and effective upon such conversion in order for
us to comply with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement which requires that no shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding at the closing.

During the year ended March 31, 2016, no warrants were issued or exercised and no warrants expired.
However, warrants to purchase 66,668 shares of common stock issued in connection with an equity
raise completed in fiscal year 2015, contained a weighted average anti-dilutive provision in which the
exercise price of the warrants are adjusted downward based on any subsequent issuance or deemed
issuance of common stock or convertible securities by the Company for consideration less than the
then exercise price of such warrants. As a result of the anti-dilution rights, the exercise price of the
warrants were adjusted from $25.00 per share (as of March 31, 2015) to $15.56 per share (as of March
31, 2016), in connection with our issuance of common stock and convertible securities for
consideration less than the then exercise price of the warrants during the year ended March 31, 2016,
and there was a corresponding reduction in the average exercise price of all warrants outstanding
from $50.34 per share to $47.64 per share, for the years ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016,
respectively. As of March 31, 2016, the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the 66,668
warrants was $126,960. Changes in the derivative liability fair value are recorded as other expense on
the consolidated statement of operations.
During the year ended March 31, 2015, no warrants were exercised and warrants to purchase 6,026
shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $74.50 per share expired unexercised. These
warrants were granted in connection with the sale of units in the Company’s unit offering in December
2010 and had an expiration date of July 4, 2014. The Company granted warrants to purchase 66,668
shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $25.00 per share and a term of five years in
conjunction with the sale of units in the Company’s unit offering in April 2014. The warrants became
exercisable on April 21, 2014 and will remain exercisable thereafter until April 21, 2019.
At March 31, 2016, 11,195 outstanding warrants had an intrinsic value of $34,369. The intrinsic value is
based upon the difference between the market price of Lucas’s common stock on the date of exercise
and the grant price of the stock options. These warrants were initially issued in connection with the
Rogers Loan on August 13, 2013, and the exercise price was lowered from $33.75 to $0.01 per share
on August 12, 2015.

NOTE 10 – SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Common Stock
On February 8, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted, subject to the ratification of the
shareholders, the Company’s Amendment to the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (“2014 Amended Plan”). At
the annual shareholder meeting held on March 29, 2016, Company shareholders approved the 2014
Amended Plan providing for the Company to issue up to an additional 55,000 shares of common stock
under the 2014 Incentive Plan (described below, 95,000 in total) to officers, directors, employees,
contractors and consultants for services provided to the Company and amend the definition of
“Eligible Person” under the 2014 Amended Plan to exclude “instances where services are in
connection with the offer or sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction, or they directly or
indirectly promote or maintain a market for the Company’s securities”. The Company registered
shares to be issued under the 2014 Amended Plan in a Form S-8 registration statement filed with the
SEC in April 2016.
On December 27, 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted, subject to the ratification of the
shareholders, the Company’s 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (“2014 Incentive Plan”). At the annual
shareholder meeting held on February 13, 2014, Company shareholders approved the 2014 Incentive
Plan providing for the Company to issue up to 40,000 shares of common stock to officers, directors,
employees, contractors and consultants for services provided to the Company. The Company
registered shares to be issued under the 2014 Incentive Plan in a Form S-8 registration statement filed
with the SEC in May 2014 and amended in April 2016. At March 31, 2016, 95,000 shares are available for
issuance under the 2014 Incentive Plan as amended.
During the annual shareholder meeting held on March 31, 2012, Company shareholders approved the
Lucas Energy, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (“2012 Incentive Plan”) providing for the Company to
issue up to 60,000 shares of common stock to officers, directors, employees, contractors and
consultants for services provided to the Company. The Company registered shares to be issued
under the 2012 Incentive Plan in a Form S-8 registration statement filed with the SEC in April 2012. At
March 31, 2016, no shares remained available for awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan.
During the annual shareholder meeting held on March 30, 2010, Company shareholders approved the
Lucas Energy, Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan (“2010 Incentive Plan”) providing for the Company to
issue up to 36,000 shares of common stock to officers, directors, employees, contractors and
consultants for services provided to the Company. The Company registered shares to be issued
under the 2010 Incentive Plan in a Form S-8 registration statement filed with the SEC in April 2010. At
March 31, 2016, 128 shares remained available for awards under the 2010 Incentive Plan.
For the year ended March 31, 2016, Lucas issued 21,438 shares of its common stock with an aggregate
grant date fair value of $78,770, which were valued based on the trading value of Lucas’s common
stock on the date of grant. Also, on March 31, 2016, the Company awarded an additional 7,653 shares
of its common stock with an aggregate grant fair value of $23,572, which were valued based on the
trading value of Lucas’s common stock on the date of grant. Those common stock awards had yet to
be issued as of March 31 2016, and therefore, were recognized as accrued stock payable on the
balance sheet. The shares were awarded according to the employment agreements with certain
officers and other managerial personnel.
For the year ended March 31, 2015, Lucas issued 5,241 shares of its common stock with an aggregate
grant date fair value of $49,838, which were valued based on the trading value of Lucas’s common
stock on the date of grant. Also, on March 25, 2015, the Company awarded an additional 3,689 shares
of its common stock with an aggregate grant fair value of $19,363, which were valued based on the
trading value of Lucas’s common stock on the date of grant. Those common stock awards had yet to
be issued as of March 31 2015, and therefore, were recognized as accrued stock payable on the
balance sheet and settled in fiscal year 2016. The shares were awarded according to the employment
agreements with certain officers and other managerial personnel.

During the year ended March 31, 2016, Lucas granted no stock options, and of the Company’s
outstanding options, no options were exercised or forfeited, while 2,000 options expired, which were
previously issued to a director on July 2, 2013.
During the year ended March 31, 2015, Lucas granted two directors of the Company stock options to
purchase an aggregate of 4,000 shares of common stock with a fair value of $13,680, which vested
immediately upon issuance with a three year exercise period. The stock options equaled the closing
price of the Company stock on March 25, 2015 ($5.55 per share as adjusted for the subsequent 1:25
reverse stock split). As the stock options vested immediately, the Company recognized $13,860 in
compensation expense on March 25, 2015. All grants were valued at fair value on the date of grant
based on the market value of Lucas’s common stock using the Black Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions used; dividend yield of 0.00%; expected volatility of
176.26%; risk-free interest rate of .02% and expected term of three years.
Of the Company’s outstanding options, no options were exercised or forfeited during the year ended
March 31, 2015, while 8,667 options expired and 6,960 options were cancelled due to the resignation of
Ken Daraie, W. Andrew Krusen, Jr. and Ryan J. Morris from the Board of Directors of Lucas on
October 10, 2014, and an additional 32 options were cancelled due to employee terminations.
Compensation expense related to stock options during the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 was
$61,202 and $149,948, respectively.
Options outstanding and exercisable at March 31, 2016 and 2015 had no intrinsic value. The intrinsic
value is based upon the difference between the market price of Lucas’s common stock on the date of
exercise and the grant price of the stock options.
At March 31, 2016, unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options totaled
$30,505. This unrecognized expense is expected to be amortized to expense on a straight-line basis
over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.

NOTE 13 – SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS
On June 25, 2015, (a) we entered into (1) a Compromise Settlement Agreement and Mutual General
Release with Earthstone Operating, LLC, Earthstone Energy, Inc., Oak Valley Resources, LLC, Oak
Valley Operating LLC and Sabine River Energy, LLC (collectively “Earthstone” and the “Earthstone
Settlement”); (2) a Compromise Settlement Agreement and Mutual General Release with Earthstone
and Victory, AEP Assets LLC and Aurora Energy Partners (collectively the “Victory Parties” and the
“Earthstone/Victory Settlement”); and (3) a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release with Victory (the
“Victory Settlement”); and (b) Victory and Louise H. Rogers, our senior lender (“Rogers”) entered into
a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the “Rogers Settlement”).
Earthstone Settlement and Earthstone/Victory Settlement
Pursuant to the terms of the Earthstone Settlement and the Earthstone/Victory Settlement, Earthstone
agreed to pay us $54,020 (representing the net of amounts previously paid by Victory to Earthstone in
connection with the terms of a participation agreement covering certain leases in Karnes County,
Texas and certain amounts owed to us in connection with title issues discovered in connection with
those leases) and we agreed that we are deemed a non-consenting party in connection with such
Wells; and Victory agreed to assign certain oil and gas interests in the Wells which we transferred to
Victory in February 2015, to Earthstone. We and Earthstone also agreed to not disparage or talk
negatively about each other and further agreed to release each other (the Victory Parties also agreed
to release Earthstone pursuant to the Earthstone/Victory Settlement) from any and all claims, demands
and causes of action which either party had against the other prior to the June 25, 2015 effective date
of the Earthstone/Victory Settlement, whether known or unknown, except in connection with the
breach, enforcement or interpretation of the Earthstone/Victory Settlement.
F-32
Victory Settlement
Pursuant to the Victory Settlement, we and Victory agreed to terminate any and all obligations between
the parties pursuant to that certain February 2, 2015 Letter of Intent for Business Combination,
pursuant to which we and Victory previously planned to combine our companies, and that certain Pre-
Merger Collaboration Agreement dated February 26, 2015, as amended by amendment No. 1 thereto,
dated March 3, 2015 (as amended, the “Collaboration Agreement”); that Victory would retain
ownership and control over five Penn Virginia well-bores (the “Penn Virginia Well-Bores”) and would
also retain the obligations to pay expenses associated with such Penn Virginia Well-Bores effective
after August 1, 2014; and that we would also assign Victory rights to another property located in the
same field as the Penn Virginia Well-Bores. We also confirmed the amount of $600,000 previously
advanced to us by Victory pursuant to the terms of a prior Pre-Merger Loan and Funding Agreement
dated February 26, 2015 (the “Funding Agreement”); that Victory had no further obligations to
advance any additional funds to us pursuant to the terms of the Funding Agreement (which originally
provided us the right to borrow up to $2 million from Victory); and that we would issue 44,070 shares of
our restricted common stock to Victory (the “Victory Shares”) in full consideration of the $600,000
owed under the Funding Agreement (which were to be held in escrow until the payment of amounts
owed to Rogers under the Rogers Settlement described below). We and Victory also agreed to release
each other from any and all claims, demands and causes of action which either party had against the
other prior to the June 25, 2015 effective date of the Victory Settlement, whether known or unknown, in
connection with the terminated agreements. The Victory Shares were in lieu of any shares of common
stock we were required to pledge to Victory pursuant to the terms of the Funding Agreement and
related agreements. The Victory Shares were ultimately forfeited and returned to Lucas on September
24, 2015 due to Victory’s failure to comply with the terms of the Rogers Settlement described below.
The forfeited shares, along with 1,476 treasury shares (for a total of 45,546 shares of common stock),
were then sold in a private transaction on September 28, 2015 for an aggregate of $104,754 (see “Note
9 – Stockholders’ Equity” above).
Rogers Settlement
Pursuant to the Rogers Settlement, Victory and Rogers agreed, among other things, to terminate the
$250,000 contingently payable note which was issued to Rogers in connection with the entry by us
and Victory into the Collaboration Agreement and that Victory would pay Rogers, on or before July 15,
2015, approximately $253,750, and that Rogers’ legal counsel would hold the assignment of the
additional Penn Virginia property and the Victory Shares (described above) in escrow until such time
as the required payment is made by Victory.
On July 16, 2015, Victory entered into an Amendment Agreement whereby, Victory and Rogers agreed
that the amount to be paid by Victory to Rogers was $258,125, instead of $253,750. The Amendment
further specified that if Victory failed to make the payment of $258,125 on or before July 15, 2015,
Victory would be in default under the Rogers Settlement and default interest on the amount due would
begin to accrue at a per diem rate of approximately $129, and the escrow would continue until August
27, 2015, during which time Victory was required to make all payments owed to Rogers. Additionally,
Victory acknowledged in the amendment its obligation to pay Rogers’ attorney’s fees in the amount of
$22,500.
All payments owed to Rogers were not made by August 27, 2015 and on September 3, 2015, Lucas
requested from the escrow agent the return of certain assets granted to Victory as part of the Victory
Settlement. Those assets included the assignment of a 3.28% leasehold working interest in the Dingo
Unit and a 1.48% leasehold working interest in the Platypus Unit; as well as 44,070 shares of common
stock of Lucas. In turn, the escrow agent returned these assets to Lucas and the 44,070 shares were
returned to the Company and returned to treasury.
NOTE 14 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited institutional
investor, pursuant to which we issued a redeemable convertible subordinated debenture, with a face
amount of $530,000, convertible into 163,077 shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to
$3.25 per share and a warrant to purchase 1,384,616 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment
thereunder) at an exercise price equal to $3.25 per share (the “First Warrant”). The accredited
institutional investor purchased the debenture at a 5.0% original issue discount for the sum of
$500,000 and agreed that it will exercise the First Warrant, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, for
the sum of $4.5 million.
F-33
Also on April 6, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with the same accredited
institutional investor, pursuant to which we agreed, subject to certain conditions, to issue 527 shares
of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”)(with a face value
of $5.26 million) at a 5% original issue discount, convertible into 1,618,462 shares of common stock at
a conversion price of $3.25 per share, and a warrant to purchase 1,111,112 shares of common stock at
an exercise price of $4.50 per share (the “Second Warrant”). Under the terms of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, the Second Warrant and 53 shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and issued for
$500,000 after the Acquisition (as defined and described in “Note 2 – Liquidity and Going Concern
Considerations”) closes, and, assuming the Acquisition closes, the remaining 474 shares of Series C
Preferred Stock will be sold and issued for $4.5 million immediately after approval by our stockholders
for NYSE MKT purposes, of the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion/exercise thereof, and at such time as there is an effective registration statement in place
covering the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and
exercise of the Second Warrant.
The debenture matures in seven years and accrues interest at a rate of 6.0% per annum, subject to
adjustment as provided in the debenture. The debenture converts into shares of common stock, at a
rate of $3.25 per share, automatically upon the earlier of (i) the maturity date or (ii) the last to occur of
the closing of the Acquisition or the date on which certain equity conditions (as defined in the
debenture) have been met. The debenture also may be converted into shares of common stock, at a
rate of $3.25 per share, (i) in the sole and absolute discretion of the accredited institutional investor at
any time or times after issuance, or (ii) at our option if certain equity conditions are met. Upon
conversion of the debenture, we will pay a conversion premium equal to the amount of unpaid interest
that would have otherwise been due if the debenture had been held through the maturity date, with
respect to the portion of debenture being converted.
Accrued interest under the debenture is payable upon conversion, redemption or maturity of the
debenture, in cash or, at our discretion, shares of common stock calculated by using 95% of the
average of the lowest 5 individual daily volume weighted average prices during the measuring period
(equal to 30 trading days, or 60 trading days if certain triggering events described in the debenture
have occurred, after the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the
debenture as stated in any conversion notice have actually been received into investor’s designated
brokerage account in electronic form and are fully cleared for trading, subject to adjustment as
described in the debenture), not to exceed 100% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of such
period, less $0.05 per share of common stock. Following a default trigger event (as defined in the
debenture), the number of shares to be issued will be calculated by using 85% of the average of the
lowest 5 individual daily volume weighted average prices during the measuring period, less $0.10 per
share of common stock not to exceed 85% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of such period
less $0.10 per share.
The interest rate on the debenture will adjust upward by 100 basis points for each $0.10 that the
volume weighted average price of common stock on any trading day as of which the interest rate is
determined and calculated is below $2.75, subject to a maximum interest rate of 24.95%. The interest
rate also will adjust upward by 10.0% following the occurrence of any trigger event (as described in the
debenture). The interest rate on the debenture will adjust downward by 100 basis points for each $0.10
that the volume weighted average price of common stock on any trading day as of which the interest
rate is determined and calculated is above $3.75, subject to a minimum interest rate of 0%.
To the extent the debenture has not automatically converted in full into shares of common stock prior
to the maturity date, the face value of the outstanding debenture, together with all interest accrued
thereunder, is payable in cash by us on the maturity date. Prior to the maturity date, provided that no
trigger event has occurred (as described in the debenture), we have the right at any time upon 30
trading days’ prior written notice to redeem all or any portion of the debenture then outstanding by
paying the accredited institutional investor in cash an amount per portion of debenture equal to the
face value, plus the interest payable as if such portion was outstanding until the maturity date, minus
any interest already paid for such portion. The outstanding debenture, together with accrued and
unpaid interest, automatically becomes payable in the event of a deemed liquidation event (as defined
in the debenture).
The First Warrant entitles the accredited institutional investor, upon exercise thereof, to purchase
1,384,616 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $3.25 per share. The First Warrant will be
automatically exercised upon the last to occur of the approval by our stockholders for NYSE MKT
purposes, the Acquisition, and the registration statement for the resale of the shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of the debenture and exercise of the First Warrant being declared effective
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The First Warrant accrues a premium at a rate equal to
6.0% per annum, subject to adjustment as provided in the First Warrant, payable upon redemption or
exercise. Upon exercise of the First Warrant, we will pay the conversion premium that would have
otherwise been due if the First Warrant had been held through the maturity date, with respect to the
portion of First Warrant being exercised. The First Warrant may not be exercised on a cashless basis.
F-34
The conversion premium under the First Warrant is payable and adjustable on the same terms and
conditions as accrued interest is payable and adjustable under the debenture. The First Warrant has a
maturity date that is seven years after the date of issuance and, if the First Warrant has not been wholly
exercised into shares of common stock prior to such date, we may redeem the First Warrant on such
date by repaying to the accredited institutional investor in cash the purchase price paid under the First
Warrant. Prior to the maturity date, provided that no trigger event has occurred (as defined in the First
Warrant), we have the right at any time upon 30 trading days’ prior written notice to redeem all or any
portion of the First Warrant then unexercised by paying the accredited institutional investor in cash an
amount per portion of the unexercised warrant equal to the purchase price paid under the First
Warrant, plus the conversion premium payable as if such portion was unexercised until the maturity
date, minus any conversion premium already paid for such portion. The purchase price paid under the
First Warrant, together with the conversion premium, automatically becomes payable with respect to
the unexercised portion of the First Warrant in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up by
us.
The holder of the Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to cumulative dividends in the amount of
6.0% per annum, payable upon redemption, conversion, or maturity, and when, as and if declared by
our Board of Directors in its discretion. The Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common
stock and will rank pari passu with respect to our Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
(the “Series B Preferred Stock”).
The Series C Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of common stock at any time at the option
of the holder, or at our option if certain equity conditions (as defined in the Certificate of Designation)
are met. Upon conversion, we will pay the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock being converted a
conversion premium equal to the amount of dividends that such shares would have otherwise earned
if they had been held through the maturity date, and issue to the holder such number of shares of
common stock equal to $10,000 per share of Series C Preferred Stock (the “Face Value”) multiplied by
the number of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock divided by the conversion rate.
The conversion premium under the Series C Preferred Stock is payable and the dividend rate under
the Series C Preferred Stock is adjustable on the same terms and conditions as accrued interest is
payable and adjustable under the debenture described above. The Series C Preferred Stock has a
maturity date that is seven years after the date of issuance and, if the Series C Preferred Stock has not
been wholly converted into shares of common stock prior to such date, we may redeem the Series C
Preferred Stock on such date by repaying to the accredited institutional investor in cash 100% of the
Face Value plus an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon. Prior to the maturity
date, provided that no trigger event has occurred (as described in the Certificate of Designation), we
have the right at any time upon 30 trading days’ prior written notice to redeem all or any portion of the
Series C Preferred Stock by paying the accredited institutional investor in cash 100% of the Face
Value, plus the conversion premium, minus any dividends already paid on the Series C Preferred
Stock being redeemed. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up by us, 100% of the Face
Value, plus an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, automatically becomes
payable.
We may not issue any other preferred stock (other than the Series B Preferred Stock) that is pari passu
or senior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to any rights for a period of one year after the
earlier of such date that (i) a registration statement is effective and available for the resale of all shares
of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, or (ii) Rule 144 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is available for the immediate unrestricted resale of all shares of
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock.
The Second Warrant entitles the accredited institutional investor, upon exercise thereof, to purchase
1,111,112 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $4.50 per share. The Second Warrant has the
same terms and conditions as the First Warrant described above, except that (i) it may be exercised
before March 31, 2017 by mutual agreement of us and the accredited institutional investor upon
delivery of notice from us or the accredited institutional investor, (ii) the exercise price is $4.50 per
share and (iii) the conversion premium adjustment thresholds are set at $4.00 and $5.00, respectively.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may not issue shares of common stock upon conversion of the
debenture, conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock or exercise of the First Warrant and Second
Warrant, to the extent such conversion or exercise would result in the accredited institutional investor
owning more than 4.99% of all common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such
issuance, as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder; provided, however, that the accredited institutional investor may
increase such amount to 9.99% upon not less than 61 days’ prior notice to us.
We have agreed to register for resale the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the
debenture, conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the First Warrant and Second
Warrant.
F-35
We also agreed that, subject to certain customary exceptions, (i) until 60 days after the registration
statement described above is declared effective, we will not issue or enter into an agreement to issue
any shares of common stock and (ii) until 6 months after the entire debenture, Series C Preferred
Stock, First Warrant and Second Warrant have been converted, redeemed or exercised, we will not (1)
enter into any agreement that in any way restricts our ability to enter into any agreement, amendment
or waiver with the accredited institutional investor, including without limitation any agreement to offer,
sell or issue to the accredited institutional investor any preferred stock, common stock or other
securities or (2) enter into any equity or convertible financing pursuant to which shares of common
stock or common stock equivalents may effectively be issued (i) at a discount, (ii) at a variable price, or
(iii) where the price or number of shares are subject to any type of variability or reset feature.
We received notice on April 11, 2016, that $500,000 of the Convertible Notes (discussed in greater
detail at “Note 6 - Notes Payable”, above) were assigned by Silver Star to Rockwell Capital Partners,
Inc.
On April 11, 2016, the Company, Target Alliance London Limited (“TALL”), and Silver Star Oil
Company (“Silver Star”), entered into an Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit
and Notes Agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”). Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, Silver
Star assigned its rights under that certain Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement dated August 30,
2015 and effective August 28, 2015 (the “Line of Credit”) and ownership of a $200,000 Convertible
Promissory Note issued by us to Silver Star thereunder dated February 10, 2016, to be effective on
February 8, 2016 (the “February Note”), to TALL in consideration for $200,000.
Additionally, Silver Star provided us a release from any liability in connection with the Line of Credit
and prior Convertible Promissory Notes issued to Silver Star by us. The Assignment Agreement also
amended the Line of Credit and terms of any future Convertible Promissory Notes issued thereunder,
to (a) decrease the total amount available for borrowing under the Line of Credit to $1.8 million
(previously we had the right to borrow up to $2.4 million thereunder), unless the parties mutually agree
to provide for loans of up to $2.4 million (provided that $1 million has already been borrowed under
such Line of Credit to date); (b) increased the monthly advance limit under the Line of Credit from
$200,000 to $250,000 per month; (c) increased the conversion price of any future notes issued under
the Line of Credit to $3.25 per share (previously the conversion price was $1.50 per share, provided
that the conversion price of the February Note remained at $1.50 per share); (d) amended the
requirements for us to seek stockholder approval of the issuance of shares of common stock upon
conversion of the notes to require us to seek stockholder approval at the same time as we seek
stockholder approval for the shares issuable pursuant to the terms of our December 2015 Asset
Purchase Agreement, described in greater detail in “Note 2 – Liquidity and Going Concern
Considerations”; (e) ratified the addition of a 9.99% ownership blocker to the February Note and any
future notes issued under the Line of Credit; and (f) formally removed certain transaction approval
rights under the Line of Credit which previously required us to receive approval of Silver Star in the
event we desired to enter into certain transactions outside the usual course of business.
The Assignment Agreement also extended the due date of the February Note and all future notes
issued under the Line of Credit to April 11, 2017. As additional consideration for TALL agreeing to the
terms of the Assignment Agreement, we agreed, subject to NYSE MKT listing approval and where
applicable stockholder approval under applicable NYSE MKT rules and regulations, to grant TALL
warrants to purchase 51,562 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.25 per share, for each
$250,000 loaned pursuant to the terms of the amended Line of Credit. Finally, the Assignment
Agreement provided that the sale of all securities issued or granted pursuant to the Line of Credit and
all future notes issued thereunder would be subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement and Stock
Purchase Agreement entered into on April 7, 2016, including a restriction on the Company selling not
more than $250,000 per month in private placements of securities, subject to all such securities being
restricted for a period of six months from their issuance date.
On April 19, 2016, the holder of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, agreed to convert all 500
shares of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 20,000 shares of our common
stock (a conversion ratio of 40:1 as provided in the original designation of the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock adjusted for the Company’s 1:25 reverse stock split effective on July 25, 2015), which
conversion was completed on April 25, 2016. We paid the holder $20,000 in connection with and
effective upon such conversion in order to comply with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement
that no shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding at the closing.
F-36
On April 20, 2016, and effective April 1, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Asset
Purchase Agreement (the “First Amendment”), with twenty-one separate sellers and two other parties
who became sellers as a result of the First Amendment (collectively, the “Sellers”) and Segundo
Resources, LLC, as a Seller and as a representative of the Sellers named therein (the
“Representative”), amending that certain Asset Purchase Agreement discussed and described above
in “Note 2 – Liquidity and Going Concern Considerations”. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement we agreed to acquire certain assets from the Sellers in consideration for $31.35 million of
commercial bank debt; 552,000 shares of a to-be-designated form of redeemable convertible preferred
stock (convertible into 3,941,280 shares of common stock); 13,009,664 shares of common stock; and
$4,975,000 in cash, the closing of which transaction is subject to various closing conditions and
anticipated to close, subject to the satisfaction of such closing conditions, during the first quarter of
fiscal 2017.
Pursuant to the First Amendment, the parties amended the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement to
among other things: (a) make the effective date of the Acquisition April 1, 2016 (including the date that
the Company will be due consideration for the production of hydrocarbons in connection with the
assets to be acquired); (b) remove the requirement that we register the primary issuance of the shares
of common stock and preferred stock issuable to the Sellers pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement prior to the closing of the Acquisition (the “Closing”); (c) provide for the issuance of
restricted shares of common and preferred stock to the Sellers at Closing; (d) include representations
of the Sellers sufficient to enable us to confirm that an exemption from registration exists for the
issuance of the common stock and preferred stock due to be issued at Closing; (e) require us to
register the resale of the common stock shares issuable at Closing, after Closing (we are required to
file the registration statement registering such shares no later than 30 days after Closing and obtain
effectiveness thereof no later than 90 days after closing (135 days in the event the SEC reviews such
registration statement)); (f) adjust the number of shares of common and preferred stock we were
allowed to have outstanding immediately prior to Closing; (g) provide for the anticipated issuance of
additional shares of common stock in connection with the debt assumption contemplated at the
Closing; (h) adjust the required timing for our appointment of three director nominees to be nominated
by the Sellers at the Closing to 10 days after the Closing date; (i) require us to indemnify the Sellers
against losses caused by misstatements in the registration statement unless such losses are caused
by information supplied by the Sellers, in which case the Sellers providing such information are
required to indemnify us against such losses; (j) confirm that certain recent transactions undertaken
by the Company relating to the sale of securities, are approved by the Sellers and that such
transactions did not cause any breaches of the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement; (k) allow for
certain additional issuances of common stock from time to time pursuant to the terms of convertible
securities sold by the Company prior to Closing; (l) allow the Sellers to sell certain property in
Glasscock County, Texas prior to Closing, subject to the pre-approval of such sale by the Company,
and subject to such sale proceeds being placed in escrow until the earlier of Closing (and thereafter
released to the Company) or as mutually agreed by the Company and the Seller Representative; and
(m) remove certain closing conditions which have already been completed to date from the conditions
to Closing described in the Asset Purchase Agreement.
On April 21, 2016, Rockwell Capital Partners, Inc., who was previously assigned $300,000 of
convertible promissory notes by Silver Star on February 2, 2016, converted $159,780 of the principal
and interest due on such convertible notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of
$1.50 per share, for an aggregate of 106,520 shares. The convertible promissory notes were originally
acquired by Silver Star pursuant to that certain August 30, 2015, Non-Revolving Line of Credit
Agreement, and such convertible promissory notes are due and payable on October 1, 2016, accrue
interest at the rate of 6% per annum (15% upon the occurrence of an event of default), and allow the
holder thereof the right to convert the principal and interest due thereunder into common stock of the
Company at a conversion price of $1.50 per share, provided that any conversion is subject to us first
receiving approval for the issuance of shares of our common stock under the convertible promissory
notes and line of credit under applicable NYSE MKT rules and regulations (provided that we have
received NYSE MKT approval for conversion of a portion of such notes equal to 243,853 shares), and
to the extent such conversion(s) (together with certain other shares aggregated therewith in the
determination of the NYSE MKT) would exceed 19.9% of our total shares of outstanding common
stock on the date of our entry into the line of credit (totaling 243,853 shares of common stock, of which
the total amount of such shares have been issued as of April 21, 2016), stockholder approval for such
issuances.
On June 27, 2013, we entered into an amended and restated short-term promissory note, amending
and restating the note originally entered into with Alan Dreeben on March 28, 2016 whereby;
evidencing an additional $100,000 borrowed on June 13, 2016, plus a 10% original discount on such
loan amount and extending the maturity date of the note to August 31, 2016. In total, the loan amount
outstanding is $385,000 as of the date of this report. Mr. Dreeben is one of the Sellers.

Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited)
The following disclosures for the Company are made in accordance with authoritative guidance
regarding disclosures about oil and natural gas producing activities. Users of this information should
be aware that the process of estimating quantities of “proved,” “proved developed,” and “proved
undeveloped” crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant
subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for
each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of
numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production
history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from
time to time. Although reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent
the most accurate assessments possible, the significance of the subjective decisions required and
variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than
other estimates presented in connection with financial statement disclosures.
Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas that
geoscience and engineering data can estimate, with reasonable certainty, to be economically
producible from a given day forward from known reservoirs under economic conditions, operating
methods and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate
expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether
deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
Proved developed reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered under operating methods
being utilized at the time the estimates were made, through wells and equipment in place or if the cost
of any required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well.
Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required. Reserves on
undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are
reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that
establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations
can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted
indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances
justify a longer time. Estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are not attributed to any acreage for
which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless
such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous
reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

RESERVES
During the year ended March 31, 2016, Lucas adjusted its reserves downward by approximately 0.8
million Boe of proved reserves. We had a downward revision primarily due to the sale of existing
leases of 0.3 million Boe in Karnes County, Texas, the expiration of 0.4 million Boe on existing leases
and the transfer of approximately 0.2 million Boe of proved undeveloped reserves to probable
undeveloped reserves offset by the transfer of approximately 0.1 million probable undeveloped
reserves to proved undeveloped reserves.
During the year ended March 31, 2015, Lucas adjusted its reserves downward by approximately 0.5
million Boe of proved reserves. In 2015, we added approximately 1.3 million Boe of proved reserves
through the purchase of new leases whereby we increased our working interest share from 15% to
100% and through an additional lease purchase on 300 acres in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas.
We had a downward revision primarily due to the sale of existing leases of 0.9 million Boe in Madison
and Gonzales County, Texas, the expiration of 0.3 million Boe on existing leases and the transfer of
approximately 0.6 million Boe of proved undeveloped reserves to probable undeveloped reserves.
The following table sets forth Lucas’s proved developed and undeveloped reserves at March 31, 2016
and 2015:

*The Company engaged Ralph E. Davis Associates LLC, an independent reserve engineering firm, to
provide a reserve report on the Company’s properties as of March 31, 2016. The reserve report has
been included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 10-K which these financial statements are filed with.
F-40
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
For the year ended March 31, 2016, total proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) decreased by 0.8
million Boe to 4.1 million Boe. The proved undeveloped reserve increase was primarily due to the:
●transfer of approximately 0.2 million Boe of PUDs to probable undeveloped reserves as there has been no
development within five years since initial disclosure;
 ●transfer of approximately 0.1 million of Boe of probable undeveloped reserves to PUDs;
 ●reduction of approximately 0.4 million Boe of PUDS due to expiring leases; and
 ●sales of existing leases of 0.3 million Boe in Karnes County, Texas.
We had no proved developed non-producing Boe and we transferred no amounts of proved
undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. In
addition, our plan is to convert our remaining PUD balance as of March 31, 2016 to proved developed
reserves within five years or prior to the end of fiscal year 2021 provided that we are able to obtain
adequate funding and capital over the time period.
Our reserves concentrate mainly in the Eagle Ford, Austin Chalk and Buda formations. At March 31,
2016, Lucas’s proved reserves for the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk formations were 4.25 million Boe,
or 99% of the total proved developed and undeveloped reserves of 4.26 million Boe.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas
Reserves. The following information has been developed utilizing procedures prescribed by ASC
Topic 932 and based on crude oil and natural gas reserves and production volumes estimated by the
independent petroleum consultants of Lucas. The estimates were based on a 12-month average of
first-of-the-month commodity prices for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. The following
information may be useful for certain comparison purposes, but should not be solely relied upon in
evaluating Lucas or its performance. Further, information contained in the following table should not
be considered as representative of realistic assessments of future cash flows, nor should the
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows be viewed as representative of the
current value of Lucas.
The future cash flows presented below are based on cost rates and statutory income tax rates in
existence as of the date of the projections and average prices over the preceding twelve months. It is
expected that material revisions to some estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves may occur in
the future, development and production of the reserves may occur in periods other than those
assumed, and actual prices realized and costs incurred may vary significantly from those used.
Management does not rely upon the following information in making investment and operating
decisions. Such decisions are based upon a wide range of factors, including estimates of probable
and possible as well as proved reserves, and varying price and cost assumptions considered more
representative of a range of possible economic conditions that may be anticipated.

Cure Period, the number of Common Shares issuable to the Sellers at Closing (or in the discretion of
the Purchaser, the applicable Sellers and the Seller Representative, only those Sellers whose Seller’s
Assets relate to the Asset Defects will have their Common Shares adjusted), as discussed in Section

(y) the Agreed Share Value (the product of which shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number),
provided that in addition, or alternatively, the Purchaser and the Sellers (or in the discretion of the

2.7 Post-Closing True-Up for JIBs and AFEs. Purchaser and Sellers agree that all revenues and joint
interest billings (“JIB”) and authorization for expenditures (“AFEs”) related to the Assets will be

entitled to any production revenues or other amounts realized from and accruing to their interest in the
Assets before the Closing Date, and shall be liable for the payment of all JIB and AFE expenses
attributable to the interest in the Assets prior to the Closing Date; and Purchaser shall be entitled to
any production revenues or other amounts realized from and accruing to the Assets on or after the
Closing Date, and shall be liable for the payment of all JIB and AFE expenses attributable to the Assets
on or after the Closing Date. Such apportionment shall be based on the date the expense or revenue
accrued to the Assets and not the date of the invoice for the same. The Parties shall work in good faith
following the Closing to effect any true-up required by this Section 2.7.
 
2.8 Tax Proration. Ad valorem taxes attributable to the Assets shall be prorated between the Sellers
and Purchaser at Closing.
 
2.9 Required Consents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any Assets or interests therein as to which (i)
an assignment or transfer thereof or an attempt to make such an assignment or transfer without a
Consent (a “Required Consent”) would constitute a breach or violation thereof or of Applicable Law,
or would adversely affect the rights or obligations thereunder to be assigned or transferred to or for
the account of Purchaser and (ii) such Required Consent shall not have been obtained with respect to
such Assets or interests therein prior to the Closing. Any transfer or assignment to Purchaser by
Sellers of any such Asset or interest therein (a “Delayed Asset”), shall be made subject to all such
Required Consents in respect of such Delayed Asset being obtained. If there are any Delayed Assets,
each Seller whose Seller’s Assets include a Delayed Asset shall use its best efforts to obtain all
Required Consents in respect thereof as promptly as practicable following the Closing, all without any
cost or detriment to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. Until all Required Consents with respect to each
Delayed Asset have been obtained, each Seller whose Seller’s Assets include a Delayed Asset (a)
shall hold the Delayed Asset on behalf of Purchaser, (b) shall cooperate with Purchaser for no
additional consideration in any lawful arrangement (including subleasing or subcontracting, or
performance thereunder by Seller as Purchaser’s agent) requested by Purchaser to provide Purchaser
with all of the benefits of or under any such Delayed Asset and (c) shall otherwise enforce and perform
for the account of Purchaser and as directed by Purchaser any other rights and obligations of such
Seller arising from such Delayed Asset (and not waive, alter or amend any of same without the consent
of Purchaser). Each Seller whose Seller’s Assets include a Delayed Asset shall comply with its
obligations under this Agreement and to maintain its corporate or other existence until all obligations
pursuant to this Section and otherwise herein are performed in full and all Delayed Assets are
transferred and assigned hereunder. At such time and on each occasion after the Closing Date as all
Required Consents with respect to a Delayed Asset have been obtained, such Delayed Asset shall
automatically be transferred and assigned by the applicable Seller to Purchaser (or, at Purchaser’s
direction) for no additional consideration without any further act on the part of any Party. In the event
all Required Consents are not obtained, and/or good title to all Delayed Assets are not received, by the
Purchaser, within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date, the applicable Sellers with Delayed Assets and
Purchaser shall in good faith determine a reduction in the number of Common Shares and/or Cash
Consideration issuable at Closing to the applicable Sellers to take into account the decrease in the
value of the Assets created by such failure to obtain all Required Consents and to deliver all Delayed
Assets (a “Reduction”), and the applicable Sellers shall return the certificates and other documents
evidencing the Common Shares and/or Cash Consideration subject to such Reduction (based on the
Agreed Share Value) for cancellation and re-issuance and shall further take whatever actions
necessary or requested to affect such Reduction.

members of the Purchaser’s Board of Directors to six (6) members and to appoint three (3) Persons
nominated to the Board of Directors of the Purchaser by the Seller Representative with the approval of
the Required Sellers, effective at Closing, so that immediately effective upon Closing, the Board of
Directors of Purchaser will consist of six (6) members, including three (3) members nominated by the
Seller Representative with the approval of the Required Sellers (the “Seller Nominees”). The Board of
Directors of Purchaser shall have the right to make a determination as to the ability of each Seller
Nominee to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the Purchaser, and whether the
appointment of such nominee is in the best interests of the stockholders of the Purchaser, and shall
not be required to appoint any Person as a member of the Board of Directors, if the Board of Directors,
in their reasonable discretion and consistent with their fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Purchaser, believe such appointment would not be in the best interests of the stockholders of the
Purchaser. However, in each instance where the Board of Directors determines as set forth above that
the appointment of a Seller Nominee is not in the best interest of the stockholders of Purchaser, Seller
Representative with the approval of the Required Sellers, shall nominate a replacement Seller Nominee
(each a “Seller Replacement Nominee”) for consideration by the Board of Directors of Purchaser.
Seller Representative, with the approval of the Required Sellers, may nominate such additional Seller
Replacement Nominees from time to time until such time as three (3) Seller Nominees or Seller
Replacement Nominees have been appointed to the Board of Directors of Purchaser. Additionally, the
Seller Nominees shall include such number of ‘independent’ directors (as determined both prior to and

compliance with applicable rules and regulations of the NYSE MKT, including those rules and
regulations requiring certain minimum numbers of ‘independent’ directors. If necessary and deemed
required, the Purchaser shall file a Schedule 14f-1 with the SEC in connection with the change in the

Stockholders of the Purchaser. Either immediately prior to Closing, or immediately thereafter, with the
approval of the Seller Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.
 
 
21
(k) Listing on NYSE MKT. The Purchaser shall have obtained approval from the NYSE MKT, if

of Commerce, or the current holders of the Sellers’ Debt (the “Debt Assumption Agreements”),
pursuant to which $31,500,000 of the Sellers’ Debt will be paid by a new loan from International Bank of
Commerce to Purchaser and Purchaser will have raised the Cash Consideration due at Closing
(collectively, the “Debt Assumption”). The terms of the Debt Assumption and Debt Assumption
Agreements shall be acceptable to Purchaser, the guarantors of the subject debt, any other party
primarily or secondarily liable on such debt, and any grantors of liens securing such debt, in their

executive officers acquire Knowledge thereof, notify the other of: (i) any notice or other

any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder unless such failure would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Purchaser or the Assets, as the case may be; provided, however, that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.5(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect the

Stockholder Approval Matters by Purchaser’s stockholders, the Board of Directors of Purchaser may
withhold, amend, withdraw or modify the Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Sellers if,
but only if the Board of Directors of Purchaser determines in good faith, based on such matters as it
deems relevant following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to withhold,
amend, withdraw or modify such recommendation would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; provided, that the Seller Representative receives written notice from Purchaser
confirming that the Board of Directors of Purchaser has determined to change its recommendation at
least two (2) Business Days in advance of the Board Recommendation being withdrawn, withheld,

with its outside legal counsel, that such statement would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law. Purchaser shall not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Purchaser or
Seller, the Board Recommendation, unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of Section

(b) Each of the Sellers, individually, shall reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser and promptly
provide, and require its representatives, advisors, accountants and attorneys to promptly provide, the
Purchaser and its representatives, advisors, accountants and attorneys, with all such information
regarding such Party as is required by Law to be included in the Proxy Statement and Registration
Statement or reasonably requested from Purchaser to be included in the Proxy Statement and
Registration Statement. The Seller Representative will be given a reasonable opportunity to be
involved in the drafting of the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto and any such correspondence prior to its filing with the SEC. Following the
Clearance Date, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to file any amendments

the Sellers receiving such Common Shares.
 
(c) Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Common Shares (i) to be

NYSE MKT, including, if requested or required by the NYSE MKT, submitting a new listing application
relating to the post-Acquisition company. Each of the Sellers will, together with Purchaser, submit
whatever documentation, financial statements and other materials as the NYSE MKT may request from

46
8.8 Disclosure Schedules; Schedule Supplements.
 
(a) The Parties shall deliver to each other true, accurate and complete copies of their respective
Disclosure Schedules as required pursuant to the introductory paragraphs of ARTICLE V and
ARTICLE VI above. Within five (5) Business Days following such delivery, the receiving Party (i.e.,
either the Purchaser or the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers) shall provide the disclosing
Party with written notice (the “Initial Disclosure Objection Notice”) of any concerns or objections to
any matters disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules which could reasonably result in a Material
Adverse Effect on the Purchaser (as to the Sellers) or the Assets (as to the Purchaser). The Purchaser
and Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers will negotiate in good faith to resolve those matters
raised in the Initial Disclosure Objection Notice, including amendments to this Agreement as agreed to.
If, after good faith negotiations, the Purchaser and Seller Representative are unable to resolve those
matters raised in the Initial Disclosure Objection Notice no later than twenty (20) days from the Initial
Disclosure Objection Notice, this Agreement may be terminated by either Purchaser or Seller
Representative on behalf of Sellers.  If the receiving Party does not provide an Initial Disclosure
Objection Notice within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of the Disclosure Schedules, or fails to
raise an objection to any disclosures made in the Disclosure Schedules in an Initial Disclosure
Objection Notice, the receiving Party will be deemed to have waived any objection to that specific
matter disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules, unless such disclosure is discovered or uncovered
later to be false or misleading in any material respect, effective as of such date (such applicable date or
the date that no Party has any outstanding objections or concerns regarding the other Party’s
Disclosure Schedules, as applicable).
 
(b) The Parties understand and acknowledge that the Disclosure Schedules delivered at the time of
execution of this Agreement or as required pursuant to the introductory paragraphs of ARTICLE V and
ARTICLE VI above may require supplements, updates and revisions prior to Closing to make such
disclosures true, accurate and complete as of Closing. The Parties agree that at least seven (7) days
prior to the Closing, each Party shall supplement, update or amend any Disclosure Schedules
delivered to the other Party upon execution of this Agreement or as required pursuant to the
introductory paragraphs of ARTICLE V and ARTICLE VI above (collectively, the “Schedule
Supplements”). Within three (3) days following such delivery, the receiving Party shall provide the
disclosing Party with written notice (the “Disclosure Objection Notice”) of any concerns or objections
to any matters disclosed or modified in the Schedule Supplements from the Disclosure Schedules
delivered at or prior to execution hereof which could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Purchaser
(as to the Sellers) or the Assets (as to the Purchaser). The Parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve
those matters raised in the Disclosure Objection Notice prior to Closing, including amendments to this
Agreement as agreed to. If, after good faith negotiations, the Purchaser and Seller Representative are
unable to resolve those matters raised in the Disclosure Objection Notice no later than twenty (20)
days from the Disclosure Objection Notice, this Agreement may be terminated by either Purchaser or
Seller Representative on behalf of Sellers. If the receiving Party does not provide a Disclosure
Objection Notice within three (3) days of the receipt of the Schedule Supplements, or fails to raise an
objection to any changes to the Disclosure Schedules in a Disclosure Objection Notice, the receiving
Party will be deemed to have waived any objection to that specific matter disclosed or modified in the
Schedule Supplements, unless that modification or amendment disclosed in the Schedule
Supplements is discovered or uncovered later to be false or misleading in any material respect.
 
 
47
8.9 Asset Defect Determination. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser
and the Seller Representative shall have mutually determined in good faith whether (i) any Assets to be
delivered at Closing are subject to any material uncured title defects or Encumbrance or Lien not
agreed to by the Parties in connection with their entry into this Agreement and/or (ii) whether there are
any other issues or problems related to the Assets, the Wells, Leases, Assumed Contracts, or
Assumed Liabilities (together Section 8.9(i) and (ii) are defined herein as “Asset Defects” and the
determination of such Asset Defects, the “Asset Defect Determination”), which should result, in the
reasonable determination of the Purchaser or the Seller Representative, in a decrease in the value of
the Assets to be delivered at Closing as represented by the aggregate Purchase Price. Upon the
determination of any Asset Defect, the Seller Representative and each applicable Seller shall have
fifteen (15) days to cure such Asset Defect and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure
such Asset Defect (the “Asset Defect Cure Period”). In the event the Asset Defects cannot be
reasonably cured in the determination of the Purchaser, or such Asset Defects are not reasonably
cured in such Asset Defect Cure Period, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted in connection with such
Asset Defect in accordance with Section 2.6 hereof, subject to the terms and conditions of such
Section 2.6, including where applicable, the right of the Purchaser as set forth in Section 10.1(c).
Sellers agree to afford to the Representatives of Purchaser, reasonable access to the properties,
books and records of the Sellers, as the case may be, in order that it may have a full opportunity to
make such reasonable investigation as it shall desire to make of the affairs of the Sellers and the
Assets and to determine whether any Asset Defect exists, and will furnish Purchaser with such
additional financial and operating data and other information as to the Assets as the Purchaser shall
from time to time reasonably request.

or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Purchaser or

requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by Sellers against any and all
Liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. Seller Representative shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document in accordance with a request or consent of
the Sellers and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding
upon all of the Sellers.
 
9.7 Successor Seller Representative. Seller Representative may resign as Seller Representative upon
15 days’ notice to the Sellers. If Seller Representative resigns under this Agreement, the Required
Sellers shall appoint a successor Seller Representative for the Sellers. If no successor Seller
Representative is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Seller Representative,
Seller Representative may appoint, after consulting with the Sellers, a successor Seller
Representative. If Seller Representative has materially breached or failed to perform any material
provision of this Agreement or of Applicable Law, the Required Sellers may agree in writing to remove
and replace Seller Representative with a successor Seller Representative from among the Sellers. In
any such event, upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Seller Representative
hereunder, and execution of an addendum to this Agreement making the successor Seller
Representative a party hereto, such successor Seller Representative shall succeed to all the rights,
powers, and duties of the retiring Seller Representative and the term “Seller Representative” shall

Representative under this Agreement. If no successor Seller Representative has accepted
appointment as Seller Representative by the date which is 15 days following a retiring Seller
Representative’s notice of resignation, the retiring Seller Representative’s resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Sellers shall perform all of the duties of Seller
Representative hereunder until such time, if any, as the Sellers appoint a successor Seller
Representative as provided for above.

this Agreement (the “Receiving Party Personnel”). The Receiving Party Personnel who have access to
any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party will be made aware of the confidentiality provision
of this Agreement, and will be required to abide by the terms thereof. Any third party contractors that
are given access to Confidential Information of a disclosing Party pursuant to the terms hereof shall be
required to sign a written agreement pursuant to which such Receiving Party Personnel agree to be
bound by the provisions of this Agreement, which written agreement will expressly state that it is
enforceable against such Receiving Party Personnel by the disclosing Party.
 
11.5 Survival. The obligation of confidentiality under this ARTICLE XI shall survive the termination of
this Agreement for a period of two years.
 
11.6 No-Conflict With Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this ARTICLE XI to the
contrary, nothing herein shall modify or reduce the obligations of the Parties pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement.
 
ARTICLE XII.
INDEMNIFICATION
 
12.1 Indemnification by Sellers. Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE XII, each Seller, individually,
and not jointly or severally, agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates, parents,
stockholders, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (such
indemnified Persons are collectively hereinafter referred to as “Purchaser Indemnified Persons”),
harmless from and against any and all Losses that any Purchaser Indemnified Person may suffer,
sustain, incur or become subject to arising out of or due to: (a) the non-fulfillment of any covenant,
undertaking, agreement or other obligation of such Seller under this Agreement, any Schedule hereto
or any of the other Transaction Documents; (b) any action taken by such Seller prior to the Closing in
connection with the Assets and/or the use of such Assets prior to the Closing Date, or the operations
of such Seller prior to and subsequent to Closing (except in connection with the operation of the
Assets post-Closing); (c) relating to the Liabilities of such Seller not expressly assumed hereunder; or
(d) the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of such Seller in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document to which the Seller is a party and the Seller Representative shall defend and
hold each Purchaser Indemnified Person harmless from and against any Losses that any Purchaser
Indemnified Person may suffer, sustain, incur or become subject to arising out of or due to any
environmental Claims or Liabilities (i) associated with the Assets or (ii) arising from any act or omission
by any Seller or the failure of any Seller to comply with any Environmental Law in connection with the
Assets (collectively (i) and (ii), the “Environmental Liabilities”), relating to or dating back to the period
or periods that each Seller owned and/or had legal title to the Assets which are subject to the
applicable Loss (the “Seller Ownership Period”). “Losses” as used in this ARTICLE XII are not limited
to matters asserted by third parties, but includes Losses incurred or sustained in the absence of third
party Claims. Payment is not a condition precedent to recovery of indemnification for Losses. Each
Seller’s indemnification obligations under this Section 12.1 shall be limited to the aggregate amount of
consideration (including Cash Consideration, Common Shares and Preferred Shares, as applicable)
which such Seller received upon Closing or would receive had the Closing occurred, as applicable (as
applicable, the “Seller Cap”).
 
 
54
12.2 Indemnification by Purchaser. Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE XII, Purchaser agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold Sellers and their Affiliates, parents, stockholders, subsidiaries, officers,
directors, members, managers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (such indemnified
Persons are collectively hereinafter referred to as “Seller Indemnified Persons” and together with the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons, the “Indemnified Persons”), harmless from and against any and all
Losses that any Seller Indemnified Person may suffer, sustain, incur or become subject to arising out
of or due to: (a) the use of the Assets by the Purchaser after the Closing Date; (b) the non-fulfillment of
any covenant, undertaking, agreement or other obligation of Purchaser under this Agreement or any
Transaction Document; (c) any inaccuracy of any representation of Purchaser in this Agreement or
any Transaction Document; (d) any environmental Claims arising from any act or omission by the
Purchaser or the failure of Purchaser to comply with any Environmental Law in connection with the
Assets post-Closing or (d) the breach of any warranty or covenant of Purchaser in this Agreement or
any Transaction Document. The Liability of the Purchaser under this Section 12.2, shall not exceed the
Purchase Price (the “Purchaser Cap” and together with each Seller Cap, the “Cap”).
 
12.3 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The representations, warranties,
covenants and other provisions of this Agreement which by their terms or by implication are to have
continuing effect after the expiration or termination of this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, and shall remain in full force and effect.
 
12.4 Indemnification Procedure.
 
(a) Promptly following receipt by an Indemnified Person of notice by a third party (including any
Governmental Authority) of any complaint or the commencement of any audit, investigation, action or
Proceeding with respect to which such Indemnified Person may be entitled to receive payment from
the other Party for any Loss, as provided by Section 12.1 or Section 12.2, such Indemnified Person
shall notify the Party who has the responsibility to provide indemnification as provided in by Section
12.1 or Section 12.2 (i.e., the Purchaser or the applicable Seller, as applicable, the “Indemnifying
Party”), promptly following the Indemnified Person’s receipt of such complaint or notice of the
commencement of such audit, investigation, action or Proceeding; provided, however, that the failure
to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from Liability hereunder with
respect to such Claim only if, and only to the extent that, such failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party results in harm or prejudice to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party may, upon written
notice delivered to the Indemnified Person within twenty (20) days thereafter assuming full
responsibility for any Losses resulting from such investigation, action or Proceeding, assume the
defense of such investigation, action or Proceeding, to the extent such investigation, action or
Proceeding involves solely monetary damages, including the employment of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person and the payment of the fees and disbursements of such
counsel; provided, however, that an Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to assume the defense of
any investigation, action or Proceeding if (i) such Claim may result in criminal Liability of, or equitable
remedies against, the Indemnified Person; or (ii) the Indemnified Person reasonably believes that the
interests of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Person with respect to such Claim are in
conflict with one another, and as a result, the Indemnifying Party may not adequately represent the
interests of the Indemnified Person in such Claim.
 
 
55
(b) If, however, the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume, or is not permitted to assume, the
defense of the audit, investigation, action or Proceeding on the terms provided above or to employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, in either case within such twenty (20) day
period, or if the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the defense of the investigation, action or
Proceeding in accordance with the preceding sentence, then such Indemnified Person may employ
counsel to represent or defend it in any such audit, investigation, action or Proceeding and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel for the
Indemnified Person as incurred; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required
to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction in any single audit, investigation, action or Proceeding. If the Indemnifying Party fails to
diligently prosecute the defense of any audit, investigation, action or Proceeding, the Indemnified
Person may pay, compromise, and defend such audit, investigation, action or Proceeding and seek
indemnification for any and all Claims, Liabilities, losses, damages, costs, expenses, penalties, fines,
judgments and fees based upon, arising from or relating to such audit, investigation, action or
Proceeding. In any audit, investigation, action or Proceeding for which indemnification is being sought
hereunder the Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense
of such action, may participate in such matter and retain its own counsel at such Party’s own expense.
The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Person (as the case may be) shall at all times use
reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Person (as the case may be)
reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of any matter the defense of which it is maintaining
and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any such matter.
 
(c) No Indemnified Person may settle or compromise any investigation, action or Proceeding or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party fails to
assume, or is not permitted to assume, and maintain the defense of such Claim pursuant to this
ARTICLE XII or (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnifying Party and its officers, directors, managers, employees and Affiliates from all Liability
arising out of such Claim. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or
consent (x) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Person and its officers, directors,
managers, employees and Affiliates from all Liability arising out of such Claim, (y) does not contain
any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or Liability on behalf of the Indemnified
Person and (z) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term that in any manner affects,
restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Person or any of the Indemnified Person’s
Affiliates.
 
 
56
12.5 Claims Period. The period during which a Claim for indemnification may be asserted under this
ARTICLE XII by an Indemnified Party (the “Claims Period”) shall begin on the date hereof and
terminate twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date (except as otherwise set forth in this Section
12.5); provided, that the covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in
whole or in part after the Closing Date shall survive for the period provided in such covenants and
agreements, if any, or until fully performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, before the close of
business on the last day of the applicable Claims Period, the Indemnifying Party is properly notified of
a Claim for indemnity hereunder and such Claim is not finally resolved or disposed of at such date,
such Claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such Claim
is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
12.6 Liability Limits.
 
(a) The total aggregate amount of the Liability of the applicable Indemnifying Party shall not exceed the
applicable Cap; and no Indemnified Party shall be indemnified by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
ARTICLE XII for any Losses unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds $100,000
(the “Minimum Claim Amount”), after which the applicable Indemnified Party shall be obligated for
such aggregate Losses, including, but not limited to the Minimum Claim Amount, from the first dollar,
in an amount not to exceed the applicable Cap.
 
(b) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to ARTICLE XII in respect of any Loss shall be limited
to the amount of any Liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance
proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the Indemnified
Person in respect of any such Claim. The Indemnified Person shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to recover under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for
any Losses before seeking indemnification under this Agreement.
 
(c) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified Person for any punitive,
incidental, exemplary, consequential, special or indirect damages, including loss of future revenue or
income, loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document, or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of
multiple (except to the extent such types of damages constitute losses to a third party as a result of
any Claim).
 
(d) The amount of any indemnity obligation of any Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Parties
provided in this Agreement shall be computed net of any insurance proceeds actually received by an
Indemnified Person (net of any deductible amounts, increases in premiums and costs and expenses
incurred with respect to such insurance Claims) in connection with or as a result of any Claim giving
rise to an indemnification Claim hereunder. If the indemnity amount is paid to the Indemnified Parties
by any Indemnifying Party prior to the Indemnified Person’s actual receipt of insurance proceeds
related thereto, the Indemnified Person shall, if permissible by the terms of the applicable policy,
assign its right to such insurance and allow the Indemnifying Party to pursue collection of such
insurance proceeds or, if such payment has been made by any of the Indemnifying Parties, and an
Indemnified Person subsequently receives such insurance proceeds, then the Indemnified Person
shall promptly pay to or at the direction of the Indemnifying Party the amount of such insurance
proceeds subsequently received (net of all related costs, expenses and other losses), but not more, in
the aggregate, than the indemnity amount paid by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Indemnified Person shall be required to (i) pursue such insurance prior to seeking
indemnification under this ARTICLE XII or (ii) commence litigation to recover proceeds under such
insurance policies if it is unreasonable do so.
 
 
57
(e) No Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any loss in respect of any
Claim to the extent that (i) such loss would not have arisen but for the enactment of any legislation not
in effect on the Closing Date or any change of any Law or administrative practice of any Governmental
Authority after the Closing Date or any change in any generally accepted accounting principles after
the Closing Date, including in each case any legislation or change which takes effect retrospectively,
(ii) such loss has arisen as a result of any act or omission by the party seeking indemnification on or
after the Closing Date (including without limitation resulting from any change in accounting principles,
practices or methodologies) and to the extent of any loss arising from any breach by the party seeking
indemnification of its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents (in each
case provided such party’s breach is a principal cause or principal contributing factor to such party’s
Losses related thereto), and (iii) such loss is offset by a corresponding gain accruing after the Closing
Date, directly or indirectly, to the benefit of the party seeking indemnification, as a direct result of the
act, matter, omission or circumstance giving rise to such loss.
 
12.7 Right to Set Off. In the event that Purchaser shall have a Claim against a Seller for which
Purchaser has not been fully indemnified as contemplated above, Purchaser shall have the right to set
off the amount of such Claim against such Seller, against any amounts due such Seller hereunder or
any other agreement or understanding by and between Purchaser and such Seller. In the event that
any Seller shall have a Claim against Purchaser for which such Seller has not been fully indemnified as
contemplated above, such Seller shall have the right to set off the amount of such Claim against
Purchaser, against any amounts due Purchaser hereunder or any other agreement or understanding
by and between Purchaser and such Seller.

under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in ARTICLE XII as to Indemnified
Parties.
 
13.3 Schedules and Exhibits. The schedules and exhibits are hereby incorporated into this Agreement
and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full herein.
 
13.4 Entire Agreement; Modification. This Agreement, including the schedules, exhibits and
amendments hereto constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings and negotiations, both written and
oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement. No representation, inducement, promise, understanding, condition or
warranty not set forth herein has been made or relied upon by any Party hereto. No provision of this
Agreement may be amended other than by an instrument in writing signed by the Purchaser and the
Required Sellers, and any amendment to this Agreement made in conformity with the provisions of
this Section 13.4 shall be binding on all Sellers, unless such proposed amendment would (i) reduce
the Cash Consideration, Common Shares or Preferred Shares due to any Sellers; (ii) change the terms
of the Debt Assumption; or (iii) materially change any representations or confirmations of Sellers as
set forth in ARTICLE V; or (iv) otherwise increase any Liability on the Sellers, which amendment shall
require the consent of the Purchaser and all Sellers in order to become effective.
 
13.5 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement and in the schedules and exhibits hereto
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.
 
13.6 Assignments and Successors. The Purchaser may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of
its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Required Sellers. No
Seller may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement or of any such
rights or delegation of obligations without such applicable consent shall be void and of no effect. This
Agreement will be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.
60
13.7 Filings, Notices and Certain Governmental Approvals. Promptly after Closing, Purchaser shall
record the Assignments and all state assignments in all applicable real property records and/or, if
applicable, all state agencies and send file stamped and recorded copies of the same to Sellers.
 
13.8 No Presumption from Drafting. This Agreement has been negotiated at arm’s-length between
Persons knowledgeable in the matters set forth within this Agreement. Accordingly, given that all
Parties have had the opportunity to draft, review and/or edit the language of this Agreement, no
presumption for or against any Party arising out of drafting all or any part of this Agreement will be
applied in any action relating to, connected with or involving this Agreement. In particular, any rule of
law, legal decisions, or common law principles of similar effect that would require interpretation of any
ambiguities in this Agreement against the Party that has drafted it, is of no application and is hereby
expressly waived. The provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a reasonable manner to
affect the intentions of the Parties.
 
13.9 Review and Construction of Documents. Each Party herein expressly represents and warrants to
all other Parties hereto that (a) before executing this Agreement, said Party has fully informed itself of
the terms, contents, conditions and effects of this Agreement; (b) said Party has relied solely and
completely upon its own judgment in executing this Agreement; (c) said Party has had the opportunity
to seek and has obtained the advice of its own legal, Tax and business advisors before executing this
Agreement; (d) said Party has acted voluntarily and of its own free will in executing this Agreement;
and (e) this Agreement is the result of arm’s length negotiations conducted by and among the Parties
and their respective counsel.
 
13.10 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Texas without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict provision or rule
(whether of Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the laws of any other jurisdiction to be
applied and Applicable Laws of the United States of America. The obligations of the Parties hereto are
to be performed in Texas. All disputes, Claims, demands, actions, causes of action, suits or
Proceedings by and among the parties to this Agreement shall be adjudicated, litigated, heard or tried,
if at all, exclusively in the state or federal courts of Texas. Texas shall be the mandatory, exclusive
place for the adjudication, litigation, hearing or trial of any matter by and among the parties to this
Agreement. Each party to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waives any right to have any such
dispute, Claim, demand, action, cause of action, suit or Proceeding adjudicated, litigated, heard or tried
in any place other than Texas.
 
13.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Parties irrevocably waives any and all rights to trial by jury in
any action or Proceeding between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.
 
13.12 Specific Performance. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of Texas or any Texas state court,
without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the security or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Applicable Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any
such breach.
 
 
61
13.13 Non-Waiver. The failure in any one or more instances of a Party hereto to insist upon
performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, to exercise any right or
privilege in this Agreement conferred, or the waiver by said Party of any breach of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of any such
terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges, but the same shall continue and remain in full force
and effect as if no such forbearance or waiver had occurred.
 
13.14 Independent Nature of Sellers’ Obligations and Rights. The obligations of each Seller under this
Agreement and each Transaction Document to which they are a party, are several and not joint with
the obligations of any other Seller, and no Seller shall be responsible in any way for the performance
or non-performance of the obligations of any other Seller under this Agreement or any Transaction
Document. Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, and no action taken by
any Seller pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Sellers as a partnership, an
association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Sellers are in
any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, and each Seller has conducted its
own diligence review. Each Seller shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights
including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction
Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Seller to be joined as an additional party in any
proceeding for such purpose, subject in each case to the terms and conditions hereof and the rights
of the Seller Representative. Each Seller has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in its
review and negotiation of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. For reasons of
administrative convenience only, each Seller and its respective counsel have chosen to communicate
with the Purchaser through Knobles, Raetzsch, Moore & Eveld, LLP (“KRME”). KRME does not
represent any of the Sellers other than RAD2 Minerals, Ltd.; the General Partner of Azar-Dreeben A&D
Fund, LP; Ben Azar; Coyle Manna Management, LLC; DBS Investments, Ltd.; the General Partners of
MPII-Range-Azar Fund, LP;  Saxum Energy, LLC, and Segundo Resources, LLC.
 
13.15 Non-Compensatory Damages. Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall be entitled to recover from the
other, or their respective Affiliates, any indirect, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary
damages, or damages for lost profits of any kind or loss of business opportunity, arising under or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent any
such Party suffers such damages (including costs of defense and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred
in connection with defending of such damages) to a third party, which damages (including costs of
defense and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with defending against such damages)
shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence,
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates, and each Seller, on behalf of itself and each of
its Affiliates, waive any right to recover any indirect, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary
damages, or damages for lost profits of any kind or loss of business opportunity, arising in connection
with or with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
 
62
13.16 Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this
Agreement, time is of the essence.
13.17 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to affect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
 
13.18 Counterparts, Effect of Facsimile, Emailed and Photocopied Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which
shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto,
may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf,
.tif, .gif, .peg or similar attachment to electronic mail (including email) or as an electronic download (any
such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”) shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
executed counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party, each other Party shall
re execute the original form of this Agreement and deliver such form to all other Parties. No Party shall
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to
the formation of a contract, and each such Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent
such defense relates to lack of authenticity.
 
13.19 Transaction Expenses. Until Closing, in the event this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing
and/or in the event the Acquisition does not close, each Party shall be responsible for the payment of
any and all of its own expenses, including without limitation the fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants and other advisers, arising out of or relating directly or indirectly to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (“Transaction Expenses”). Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall
satisfy or reimburse all reasonable Transaction Expenses paid for, or incurred on behalf of, the Sellers
(the “Sellers Transaction Expenses”) in connection with the Acquisition.
 
13.20 Post-Closing Matters. Each Party shall execute such documents, and perform such other
actions, as any other Party may reasonably request after the applicable Closing to further
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement

not convert such stock into Series B Preferred Stock, additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock are
issued to Sellers at Closing in an amount to ensure that Sellers will own in aggregate, more than 80%
of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding.”
(l)          ARTICLE V of the Purchase Agreement is amended and modified by adding the following new
Section 5.29 immediately after Section 5.28 of the Purchase Agreement:
“5.29      Securities Act Representations of Sellers.
(a)          Investment Purpose; Accredited Investor Status. Each Seller acquiring Common Shares
and/or Preferred Shares as applicable (as used in this Section 5.29, a “Share Recipient Seller”), is
acquiring such Common Shares, Preferred Shares and Conversion Shares (collectively, the
“Purchaser Securities”) for its own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to, or for
sale in connection with, a distribution, as that term is used in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, in a
manner which would require registration under the Securities Act or any state securities Laws. The
Share Recipient Seller can bear the economic risk of its investment in the Purchaser Securities, has
knowledge and experience in financial business matters, is capable of bearing and managing the risk
of investment in the Purchaser Securities and is an “accredited investor” as defined in Regulation D
under the Securities Act and has completed and delivered the Certification of Accredited Investor
Status attached hereto as Exhibit H. The Share Recipient Seller recognizes that the Purchaser
Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act, nor under the securities laws of any state
and, therefore, cannot be resold unless the resale of the Purchaser Securities are registered under the
Securities Act or unless an exemption from registration is available. The Share Recipient Seller has
carefully considered and has, to the extent it believes such discussion necessary, discussed with its
professional, legal, Tax and financial advisors, the suitability of an investment in the Purchaser
Securities for its particular Tax and financial situation and its advisers, if such advisors were deemed
necessary, have determined that the Purchaser Securities are a suitable investment for the Share
Recipient Seller. The Share Recipient Seller has not been offered the Purchaser Securities by any form
of general solicitation or advertising, including, but not limited to, advertisements, articles, notices or
other communications published in any newspaper, magazine, or other similar media or television or
radio broadcast or any seminar or meeting where, to the Share Recipient Seller’s Knowledge, those
individuals that have attended have been invited by any such or similar means of general solicitation
or advertising. The Share Recipient Seller has had an opportunity to ask questions of and receive
satisfactory answers from Purchaser, or any Person or Persons acting on behalf of Purchaser,
concerning the terms and conditions of the Agreement, and Purchaser Securities and concerning the
Purchaser, and all such questions have been answered to the full satisfaction of the Share Recipient
Seller. Purchaser has not supplied the Share Recipient Seller any information regarding the Purchaser
Securities or an investment in the Purchaser Securities other than as contained in this Agreement, and
the Share Recipient Seller is relying on its own investigation and evaluation of Purchaser and the
Purchaser Securities and not on any other information. The Share Recipient Seller is aware that the
anti-manipulation rules of Regulation M under the Exchange Act may apply to sales of Purchaser
Securities and other activities with respect to the Purchaser Securities by the Share Recipient Seller.
Page 5 of 21
First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement
(b)          Assignment. The Share Recipient Seller acknowledges that the Purchaser Securities issuable
hereunder to the Share Recipient Seller have been issued in a transaction exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation D thereof. As such,
the Purchaser Securities to be received by Share Recipient Seller hereunder may not be transferred,
sold or assigned except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws. If the Share Recipient Seller
can provide Purchaser and its legal counsel with reasonably satisfactory evidence and
documentation, that an exemption from registration (under the Securities Act or otherwise) has been
satisfied, the Share Recipient Seller may assign the Purchaser Securities issuable to the Share
Recipient Seller hereunder, in whole or in part, subject to Applicable Law.
(c)          Legend. The Share Recipient Seller acknowledges and agrees that the stock certificates
representing the Purchaser Securities issued hereunder shall contain legends substantially in the
form of the following, as well as any additional legends that may be required by applicable Law or as
Purchaser may reasonably deem necessary or advisable (and a stop transfer order may be placed
against the transfer of such shares):
THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
“SECURITIES ACT”), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT
TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO
AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE TRANSFEROR TO
SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE
COMPANY. THIS SECURITY AND THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF THIS
SECURITY MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER
LOAN SECURED BY SUCH SECURITIES.”
(m)         Section 6.3(a) of the Purchase Agreement shall be amended and revised by removing “the
Registration Statement being declared effective by the SEC” from the first sentence of Section 6.3(a).
(n)          Section 6.3(d) of the Purchase Agreement shall be amended and revised by removing “and the
Registration Statement” from the first sentence of Section 6.3(d).

First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement
(o)          Section 7.3(b) of the Purchase Agreement shall be amended, restated and superseded in its
entirety by the following Section 7.3(b):
“(b)        On the later of (i) 10 days after the Closing Date and (ii) the date of the Company’s 2016 Annual
Meeting, the Purchaser’s Board of Directors shall take action to increase the number of members of
the Purchaser’s Board of Directors to six (6) members and to appoint three (3) Persons nominated to
the Board of Directors of the Purchaser by the Seller Representative with the approval of the Required
Sellers, so that on such applicable date, the Board of Directors of Purchaser will consist of six (6)
members, including three (3) members nominated by the Seller Representative with the approval of the
Required Sellers (the “Seller Nominees”). The Board of Directors of Purchaser shall have the right to
make a determination as to the ability of each Seller Nominee to serve as a member of the Board of
Directors of the Purchaser, and whether the appointment of such nominee is in the best interests of
the stockholders of the Purchaser, and shall not be required to appoint any Person as a member of the
Board of Directors, if the Board of Directors, in their reasonable discretion and consistent with their
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Purchaser, believe such appointment would not be in the
best interests of the stockholders of the Purchaser. However, in each instance where the Board of
Directors determines as set forth above that the appointment of a Seller Nominee is not in the best
interest of the stockholders of Purchaser, Seller Representative with the approval of the Required
Sellers, shall nominate a replacement Seller Nominee (each a “Seller Replacement Nominee”) for
consideration by the Board of Directors of Purchaser. Seller Representative, with the approval of the
Required Sellers, may nominate such additional Seller Replacement Nominees from time to time until
such time as three (3) Seller Nominees or Seller Replacement Nominees have been appointed to the
Board of Directors of Purchaser. Additionally, the Seller Nominees shall include such number of
‘independent’ directors (as determined both prior to and subsequent to Closing) as may be required
pursuant to applicable NYSE MKT rules and regulations in order that the Purchaser, after the
appointment of such Seller Nominees, continues to remain in compliance with applicable rules and
regulations of the NYSE MKT, including those rules and regulations requiring certain minimum
numbers of ‘independent’ directors. If necessary and deemed required, the Purchaser shall file a
Schedule 14f-1 with the SEC in connection with the change in the composition of its Board of
Directors. On or prior to the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing, one of Purchaser’s pre-Closing
Directors will resign from the Board of Directors of the Purchaser.”
(p)          Section 7.3 of the Purchase Agreement is amended and modified by adding a new Section
7.3(e) immediately after Section 7.3(d) of the Purchase Agreement:
“(e)       The Sellers shall promptly update the Selling Stockholder Questionnaires provided to the
Company in connection with any material changes to the information presented therein prior to the
filing of the Registration Statement and prior to the Registration Effective Date.”
Page 7 of 21
First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement
(q)          Section 8.2 of the Purchase Agreement shall be amended, restated and superseded in its
entirety by the following Section 8.2:
“8.2       Conduct of Sellers Prior to Closing.
(a)          From the date hereof through Closing, the Sellers shall operate the Assets in the Ordinary
Course of Business, and without limiting the preceding, shall, except in the Ordinary Course of
Business, not materially modify or amend, or terminate any material Contract associated with the
Assets, or waive, relinquish, release or terminate any material right or material Claim associated with
the Assets, or enter into any material Contract associated with the Assets except for agreements
commonly entered into by oil and gas companies in connection with the conduct of oil and gas
exploration, development and production, including, but not limited to, joint operating agreements,
farm-in agreements, farm-out agreements, joint venture agreements, production sharing Contracts,
lease extensions, lease renewals, lease acquisitions, leasehold exchange agreements, non-operated
well elections, participations and related AFEs, and the like, which do not exceed an aggregate of
$200,000 in total value or expense, unless the Sellers have received the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and
(b)          In the event the Sellers’ shale properties located in Glasscock County, Texas, which form part
of the Assets, are proposed to be sold by the Sellers prior to Closing (a “Glasscock Property Sale”),
Purchaser must pre-approve such Glasscock Property Sale and the terms thereof in writing. In the
event the Glasscock Property Sale occurs prior to Closing (subject in all cases to the Purchaser’s right
to approve such sale as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence), the sales proceeds thereof
shall be placed in escrow, which an escrow agent reasonably acceptable to the Seller Representative
and the Purchaser until Closing, where they shall be released to the Purchaser, or until such time as
the Seller Representative and the Purchaser mutually agree to the release of such funds.”
(r)          Section 8.7 of the Purchase Agreement shall be amended, restated and superseded in its
entirety by the following Section 8.7:
“8.7Proxy Statement; Registration Statement; Listing.
(a)           As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall prepare
and Purchaser shall cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement. Purchaser shall use
reasonable and diligent efforts (“Best Efforts”) to cause the Proxy Statement to comply with the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE MKT, to respond promptly to
any comments of the SEC or the NYSE MKT or their respective staff and to clear comments, if any, on
the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after it is filed with the SEC. Purchaser shall use Best
Efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of Purchaser as promptly as
practicable after the Clearance Date. If at any time prior to the Closing Date any event shall occur that
should be set forth in an amendment of or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Purchaser shall
prepare and shall file with the SEC such amendment or supplement as soon thereafter as is
reasonably practicable. Purchaser shall use Best Efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to clear
comments with the SEC.
Page 8 of 21
First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement
(b)          Each of the Sellers, individually, shall reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser and promptly
provide, and require its representatives, advisors, accountants and attorneys to promptly provide, the
Purchaser and its representatives, advisors, accountants and attorneys, with all such information
regarding such Party as is required by Law to be included in the Proxy Statement or reasonably
requested from Purchaser to be included in the Proxy Statement. The Seller Representative will be
given a reasonable opportunity to be involved in the drafting of the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto and any such correspondence prior to its filing with the SEC.
Following the Clearance Date, Purchaser shall use its Best Efforts to file any amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement required by Applicable Law.
(c)          The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following Closing, but in no event later than 30 days following Closing (provided that if in the
reasonable determination of the Company’s legal counsel, the Company’s financial statements would
be ‘stale’ at the time of such filing, the Company may delay such filing date until such time as the
Company’s financial statements would no longer be ‘stale’), the Registration Statement and as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter, but in no event later than 90 days following Closing (135 days
following Closing in the event the SEC has advised the Company that it will be undertaking a “full
review” or “partial review” of the Registration Statement and/or in the event the SEC has any
comments or questions on such Registration Statement filing or the Company’s other filings with the
SEC) obtain effectiveness of such Registration Statement with the SEC. The term “Registrable
Securities” shall mean (i) the Common Shares and (ii) any Common Stock of the Company issued as
(or issuable upon the conversion or exercise of any warrant, right or other security which is issued as)
a dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in exchange for or in replacement of, any Common
Shares, subject to reductions in the Registrable Securities pursuant to the limitations described below
in connection with a Reduction in Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding the obligations set forth
above, if (i) any SEC guidance; or (ii) any comments received from the SEC, sets forth a limitation on
the number of securities permitted to be registered on behalf of the Sellers in the Registration
Statement, the number of Registrable Securities to be included on such Registration Statement for the
benefit of all of the Sellers will be reduced pro rata (or in such manner as Sellers holding a majority of
the Common Shares issued to the Sellers may otherwise agree in writing) between the Sellers whose
securities are included in such Registration Statement (a “Limitation in Registrable Securities”). In the
case of a Limitation in Registrable Securities, the Company shall take action to file additional
registration statements (each an “Additional Registration Statement”) at the written request of: (1) the
holders of a majority in interest of the Common Shares, or (2) any holder of Common Stock that was
converted from Series B Preferred Stock, or (3) the Board of Directors, after the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, subject to SEC rules and guidance and the requirements set forth above,
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to file more than one Additional
Registration Statement in any rolling six month period. For the sake of clarity, the Registrable
Securities required to be included in the Registration Statement shall be the total Registrable
Securities reduced by any Limitation in Registrable Securities. The Seller Representative will be given
a reasonable opportunity to be involved in the drafting of the Registration Statement, and any
Additional Registration Statements, and any amendment or supplement thereto and any such
correspondence prior to its filing with the SEC.

(d)          The Company shall use its Best Efforts to:
(i)             prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the Registration
Statement and the prospectus forming part thereof (the “Prospectus”) used in connection therewith as
may be necessary or advisable to keep the Registration Statement current and effective for the
Registrable Securities held by a Seller for a period ending on the earliest of (i) the later of the second
anniversary of the (x) Closing Date, (y) the date the Registration Statement is declared effective by the
SEC, or (z) the date the last Additional Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC; (ii) the
date on which all Registrable Securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or
any successor rule (“Rule 144”) during any three-month period without the requirement for the
Company to be in compliance with the current public information required under Rule 144(c)(1) or (iii)
such time as all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to a registration statement or Rule
144;
(ii)            furnish to each Seller with respect to the Registrable Securities registered under the
Registration Statement such number of copies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
(including supplemental prospectuses) filed with the SEC in conformance with the requirements of the
Securities Act and other such documents as such Seller may reasonably request, in order to facilitate
the public sale or other disposition of all or any of the Registrable Securities by any Seller;
(iii)           pay the expenses incurred by the Company and the Sellers in complying with Section 8.7(c),
including, all registration and filing fees, exchange listing fees, printing expenses, fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company and the expense of any special audits incident to or
required by any such registration (but excluding attorneys’ fees of any Seller and any and all
underwriting discounts and selling commissions applicable to the sale of Registrable Securities by the
Sellers);
(iv)          advise the Sellers, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge of the issuance of
any stop order by the SEC delaying or suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or
of the initiation of any proceeding for that purpose; and promptly use its Best Efforts to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal at the earliest possible moment if such stop
order should be issued; and
Page 10 of 21

(v)           with a view to making available to any Seller the benefits of Rule 144 and any other rule or
regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit any Seller to sell Registrable Securities to the public
without registration, the Company covenants and agrees to use its Best Efforts to: (i) make and keep
public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144, until the earlier of
(A) such date as all of the Registrable Securities qualify to be sold immediately pursuant to Rule 144 or
any other rule of similar effect during any three-month period without the requirement for the Company
to be in compliance with the current public information required under Rule 144(c)(1) or (B) such date
as all of the Registrable Securities shall have been sold pursuant to Rule 144 (and may be further sold
without restriction); (ii) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of
the Company under the Securities Act and under the Exchange Act; and (iii) furnish to each Seller,
upon request, as long as such Seller owns any Registrable Securities, (A) a written statement by the
Company as to whether it has complied with the reporting requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, (B) a copy of the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, and (C) such other information as may be reasonably requested in order to avail
any Seller of any rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of any such Registrable
Securities without registration.
(e)           The Company shall: (i) if deemed necessary or advisable by the Company, prepare and file
from time to time with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a
supplement to the related Prospectus or a supplement or amendment to any document incorporated
therein by reference or file any other required document so that such Registration Statement will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and so that, as thereafter
delivered to purchasers of the Registrable Securities being sold thereunder, such Prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; (ii) provide the Sellers upon request, copies of any documents filed
pursuant to Section 8.7(c) and (e); and (iii) inform each Seller that the Company has complied with its
obligations in Section 8.7(c) and (e) (or that, if the Company has filed a post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement which has not yet been declared effective, the Company will notify the Sellers
to that effect, will use its Best Efforts to secure the effectiveness of such post-effective amendment as
promptly as possible and will promptly notify the Sellers when the amendment has become effective).

First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement
(f)          In the event: (i) of any request by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority
during the period of effectiveness of the Registration Statement for amendments or supplements to
the Registration Statement or related Prospectus or for additional information; (ii) of the issuance by
the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; (iii) of
the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or
exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the
initiation of any proceeding for such purpose; or (iv) of any event or circumstance which necessitates
the making of any changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any document
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, so that, in the case of the
Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
and that in the case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; then the Company shall
promptly deliver a certificate in writing to the Sellers (the “Suspension Notice”) to the effect of the
foregoing and, upon receipt of such Suspension Notice, the Sellers will refrain from selling any
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement (a “Suspension”) until the Sellers are
advised in writing by the Company that the current Prospectus may be used, and have received
copies from the Company of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed
incorporated by reference in any such Prospectus. Such Suspension Notice shall not contain any
material non-public information. In the event of any Suspension, the Company will use its Best Efforts
to cause the use of the Prospectus so suspended to be resumed as soon as reasonably practicable
after delivery of a Suspension Notice to the Sellers.
(g)         If a Suspension is not then in effect, the Sellers may sell Registrable Securities under the
Registration Statement, provided that they sell such Registrable Securities during such time that the
Registration Statement is effective and not withdrawn or suspended and only as permitted by such
Registration Statement, and provided that they comply with any applicable prospectus delivery
requirements. Upon receipt of a request therefor, the Company will provide an adequate number of
current Prospectuses to a Seller and to any other parties reasonably requiring such Prospectuses.
(h)         The Company shall not be required to include the Registrable Securities of a Seller in a
Registration Statement who fails to furnish to the Company a fully completed Selling Stockholder
Questionnaire.

arises out of, or is based upon, an untrue statement made in such Registration Statement in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Seller
specifically for use in preparation of the Registration Statement or the failure of any Seller to comply
with its covenants and agreements contained herein or any statement or omission in any Prospectus

2.            Dividends.
2.1         Dividends in General. Dividends shall accrue on the Series B Preferred beginning on the
Original Issue Date, based on the Original Issue Price, at the Dividend Rate, until such Series B
Preferred is no longer outstanding either due to conversion, redemption or otherwise as provided
herein (“Dividends” and such Dividends which have accrued as of any applicable date and remain
unpaid as of such date, the “Accrued Dividends”).
2.2         Payment of Dividends. The Corporation shall, in accordance with the terms set forth herein,
pay the Holder of the Series B Preferred the Accrued Dividends in cash (as discussed in Section 2.3),
in shares of Common Stock (as discussed in Section 2.7) or in shares of Series B Preferred (as
discussed in Section 2.7), within five (5) Business Days of the end of each fiscal quarter of the
Corporation (currently March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, each, as applicable a
“Dividend Payable Date”), beginning at the end of the first full fiscal quarter following the Original Issue
Date, for so long as the Series B Preferred remains outstanding.
2.3         Cash Dividend Payments. All Dividends payable in cash hereunder shall be made in lawful
money of the United States of America to each Holder in whose name the Series B Preferred is
registered as set forth on the books and records of the Corporation. Such payments shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account such Holder may from time to time
designate by written notice to the Corporation or by Corporation cashier’s check, without any
deduction, withholding or offset for any reason whatsoever except to the extent required by law.
2.4         Participation. Subject to the rights of the Series C Preferred Stock and the rights of other
holders, if any, of any securities senior to or pari passu with, the Series B Preferred, the Holders shall,
as holders of Series B Preferred, be entitled to such dividends paid and Distributions made to the
holders of Common Stock to the same extent as if such Holders had converted the Series B Preferred
into Common Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion herein or elsewhere) and had
held such shares of Common Stock on the record date for such dividends and Distributions.
Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend or Distribution
to the holders of Common Stock. Following the occurrence of a Liquidation Event (as hereinafter
defined) and the payment in full to a Holder of its applicable Liquidation Preference, such Holder shall
cease to have any rights hereunder to participate in any future dividends or distributions made to the
holders of Common Stock. No Distributions shall be made with respect to the Common Stock until all
past due, if any, and/or declared Dividends on the Series B Preferred have been paid or set aside for
payment to the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holders shall have no right of participation
in connection with dividends or Distributions made to the Common Stock shareholders consisting
solely of shares of Common Stock.
Page 6 of 26
Lucas Energy, Inc.
Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
2.5         Non-Cash Distributions. Whenever a Distribution provided for in this Section 2 shall be
payable in property other than cash, the value of such Distribution shall be deemed to be the fair
market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.
2.6         Other Distributions. Subject to the terms of this Certificate of Designation, and to the fullest
extent permitted by the NRS, the Corporation shall be expressly permitted to redeem, repurchase or
make distributions on the shares of its capital stock in all circumstances other than where doing so
would cause the Corporation to be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of
business (unless consent to such redemption, repurchase or distribution is provided by the lenders
thereunder).
2.7         Stock Dividend Payments. In lieu of paying the Accrued Dividends in cash, at the option of the
Corporation, the Corporation may pay Accrued Dividends in shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation (“Dividend Shares”). The total Dividend Shares issuable in connection with the payment
by the Corporation of the Accrued Dividends in shares of Common Stock shall be equal to the total
amount of Accrued Dividends which the Corporation has decided to pay in shares of Common Stock
divided by the Conversion Price, rounded up to the nearest whole Common Stock share.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.7. In lieu of paying the Accrued Dividends in
cash or shares of Common Stock, the Accrued Dividends can be paid by the Corporation in shares of
Series B Preferred (“PIK Shares”) equal to the total amount of Accrued Dividends which the
Corporation is paying in shares of Series B Preferred divided by the Original Issue Price, rounded up
to the nearest whole Series B Preferred share. At the time any payment of Accrued Dividends is
desired to be made by the Corporation in the form of additional shares of Series B Preferred, if the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Series B Preferred shall not be sufficient to effect such
payment in additional shares of Series B Preferred, in addition to such other remedies as shall be
available to the Holders of Series B Preferred, the Corporation shall be authorized to take such
corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Series B Preferred to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purpose including, without limitation, engaging in commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain the
requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or this
Certificate of Designation.
2.8         Dividend Default. In the event a Dividend Default should occur in respect to the Dividends due
to Holder, any unpaid Dividends shall accrue interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum
until such Dividend Default is cured by the Corporation.
3.            Liquidation Rights.
3.1         Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary (each a “Liquidation Event”), the Holders of Series B
Preferred shall be entitled to receive prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the assets of
the Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock or the Junior Securities by reason of their
ownership of such stock, but para passu with the Series C Preferred Stock, an amount per share for
each share of Series B Preferred held by them equal to the sum of (i) the applicable Liquidation
Preference, and (ii) all Accrued Dividends and all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares of
Series B Preferred. If upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of
the Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of the Series B Preferred and Series C
Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full amounts specified in
this Section 3.1 (and specified in the Series C Preferred Stock Designation), then the entire assets of
the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata
among the holders of the Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the full
amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 3.1 and specified in the
Series C Preferred Stock Designation, as applicable.

Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
3.2         Remaining Assets. After the payment to the Holders of Series B Preferred of the full
preferential amounts specified above and the Series C Preferred Stock, of the amounts required by the
Series C Preferred Stock Designation, the entire remaining assets of the Corporation legally available
for distribution by the Corporation shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the
holders of the Junior Securities in proportion to the number of shares of Junior Securities held by
them and the holders of Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held
by them.
3.3         Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed to
stockholders in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation are
other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be their fair market value as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors. In the event of a merger or other acquisition of the Corporation by
another entity, the Distribution date shall be deemed to be the date such transaction closes.
4.           Conversion. The Series B Preferred shall convert into Common Stock of the Corporation as
follows:
4.1         Holder Conversion.
(a)          Each share of Series B Preferred shall be convertible, at the option of the Holder thereof (a
“Holder Conversion” and the “Holder Conversion Rights”), at any time following the Original Issuance
Date, at the office of the Corporation or any Transfer Agent for the Series B Preferred, into that number
of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price
for the Series B Preferred by the Conversion Price (such shares of Common Stock issuable upon a
Holder Conversion, the “Holder Conversion Shares”). In order to effectuate the Holder Conversion
under this Section 4.1, the Holder must provide the Corporation a written notice of conversion in the
form of Exhibit A hereto (the “Notice of Conversion”). The Notice of Conversion must be dated no
earlier than two (2) Business Days from the date the Notice of Conversion is actually received by the
Corporation.

Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
(b)          Mechanics of Holder Conversion. In order to effect a Holder Conversion, a Holder shall fax or
email a copy of the fully executed Notice of Conversion to the Corporation (or in the discretion of the
Corporation, the Transfer Agent): Attention: Anthony C. Schnur, 450 Gears Road, Suite 780, Houston,
Texas, 77067, Fax: (713) 337-1510, Email: tschnur@lucasenergy.com, with a copy to (which shall not
constitute notice) The Loev Law Firm, PC, Attn: David M. Loev, 6300 West Loop South, Suite 280,
Bellaire, Texas 77401, Fax: (713) 524-4122, Email: dloev@loevlaw.com. Upon receipt by the
Corporation of a facsimile or emailed copy of a Notice of Conversion from a Holder, the Corporation
(or the Transfer Agent) shall promptly send, via facsimile or email, a confirmation to such Holder
stating that the Notice of Conversion has been received, the date upon which the Corporation (or the
Transfer Agent) expects to deliver the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion and the name
and telephone number of a contact person at the Corporation (or the Transfer Agent) regarding the
Holder Conversion. The Holder shall surrender, or cause to be surrendered, the Preferred Stock
Certificates being converted, duly endorsed, to the Corporation (or the Transfer Agent) at the address
listed above (or the address of the Transfer Agent for the Series B Preferred, if the Corporation is not
serving as its own Transfer Agent for such Series B Preferred) within five Business Days of delivering
the fully executed Notice of Conversion. The Corporation shall not be obligated to issue shares of
Common Stock upon a Holder Conversion unless either (x) the Preferred Stock Certificates; or (y) the
Lost Certificate Materials described in Section 12, below have been previously received by the
Corporation or its Transfer Agent. In the event the Holder has lost or misplaced the certificates
evidencing the Preferred Stock, the Holder shall be required to provide the Corporation or the
Corporation’s Transfer Agent (as applicable) with whatever documentation and fees each may require
to re-issue the Preferred Stock Certificates and shall be required to provide such re-issued Preferred
Stock Certificates to the Corporation within five Business Days of delivering the Notice of Conversion.
Unless the Holder Conversion Shares are covered by a valid and effective registration under the
Securities Act or the Notice of Conversion provided by the Holder includes a valid opinion from an
attorney stating that such shares of Common Stock issuable in connection with the Notice of
Conversion can be issued free of restrictive legend, which shall be determined by the Corporation in
its sole discretion, such shares shall be issued as Restricted Shares.
(c)           Delivery of Common Stock upon Holder Conversion. Upon the receipt of a Notice of
Conversion, the Corporation (itself, or through its Transfer Agent) shall, no later than the fifth Business
Day following the date of such receipt (subject to the surrender of the Preferred Stock Certificates by
the holder within the period described in Section 4.1(b) or, in the case of lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates, after provision of the Lost Certificate Materials) (the “Delivery Period”), issue and deliver
(i.e., deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier service postage prepaid) to the Holder or
its nominee (x) a certificate representing the Holder Conversion Shares and (y) a certificate
representing the number of shares of Series B Preferred not being converted, if any. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Corporation’s Transfer Agent is participating in the Depository Trust Corporation
(“DTC”) Fast Automated Securities Transfer program, and so long as the certificates therefor do not
bear a legend and the holder thereof is not then required to return such certificate for the placement of
a legend thereon, the Corporation shall cause its Transfer Agent to promptly electronically transmit the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder or its
nominee with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system (“DTC Transfer”). If the
aforementioned conditions to a DTC Transfer are not satisfied, the Corporation shall deliver as
provided above to the Holder physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon
Holder Conversion. Further, a Holder may instruct the Corporation to deliver to the Holder physical
certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion in lieu of delivering such
shares by way of DTC Transfer.

(d)          Failure to Provide Preferred Stock Certificates. In the event the Holder provides the
Corporation with a Notice of Conversion, but fails to provide the Corporation with the Preferred Stock
Certificates or the Lost Certificate Materials (as defined in Section 12 below), by the end of the Delivery
Period, the Notice of Conversion shall be considered void and the Corporation shall not be required to
comply with such Notice of Conversion. Provided that if the Notice of Conversion only relates to the
conversion of Accrued Dividends, the Holder shall not be required to provide the Corporation any
Preferred Stock Certificates.
4.2          Automatic Conversion Terms and Conditions.
(a)          The Series B Preferred shall automatically convert into Common Stock of the Corporation as
provided below (an “Automatic Conversion”):
(i)            a total of the lesser of (A) the sum of 25% of the total number of Series B Preferred shares (1)
originally issued to the Holder (if the Holder is an Original Holder); and (2) received by a Holder who
was transferred Series B Preferred from an Original Holder (each as adjusted for any Recapitalization);
and (B) the total number of Series B Preferred shares then held by the Holder; shall automatically and
without any required action by any Holder, be converted into that number of fully-paid, non-assessable
shares of Common Stock as determined by dividing the aggregate Original Issue Price of such
applicable shares of Series B Preferred by the Conversion Price in the event Automatic Conversion
Condition #1 is met;
(ii)           a total of the lesser of (A) the sum of 75% of the total number of Series B Preferred shares (1)
originally issued to the Holder (if the Holder is an Original Holder); and (2) received by a Holder who
was transferred Series B Preferred from an Original Holder, in each case (1) or (2), less any shares of
Series B Preferred held by Holder which were subject to automatic conversion pursuant to Section
4.2(a)(i) above (each as adjusted for any Recapitalization); and (B) the total number of Series B
Preferred shares then held by the Holder; shall automatically and without any required action by any
Holder, be converted into that number of fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock as
determined by dividing the aggregate Original Issue Price of such applicable shares of Series B
Preferred by the Conversion Price in the event Automatic Conversion Condition #2 is met;
(iii)          all shares of Series B Preferred shall automatically and without any required action by any
Holder, be converted into that number of fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock as
determined by dividing the aggregate Original Issue Price of such Series B Preferred shares held by
each Holder by the Conversion Price in the event Automatic Conversion Condition #3 is met; provided
that
Page 10 of 26
Lucas Energy, Inc.
Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
(iv)          if Automatic Conversion Condition #3 is met on the Original Issuance Date, then all shares of
Series B Preferred shall automatically and without any required action by any Holder, be converted
into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.2(a)(i) above, on such
Original Issuance Date.
(b)          Following an Automatic Conversion, the Corporation shall within two (2) Business Days,
deliver notice to each Holder that an Automatic Conversion has occurred, at the address of each
Holder which the Corporation then has on record (an “Automatic Conversion Notice”); provided, that
the Corporation is not required to receive any confirmation that such Automatic Conversion Notice
was received by a Holder, but instead assuming such Automatic Conversion Notice was sent to the
address which the Corporation then has on record for such Holder, the Automatic Conversion Notice
shall be treated as received by the Holder for all purposes on the third (3rd) Business Day following the
date such notice was sent by the Corporation (the “Automatic Conversion Notice Receipt Date”).
Within three (3) Business Days following the Automatic Conversion Notice Receipt Date, the
Corporation shall pay each Holder the total amount of Accrued Dividends owed on such Series B
Preferred, if any (the “Automatic Conversion Dividends”) in cash or at the option of the Corporation, in
shares of Common Stock equal to the total Accrued Dividends divided by the Conversion Price
(rounded up to the nearest whole share of Common Stock), and issue to each Holder all shares of
Common Stock which such Holder is due in connection with the Automatic Conversion (the
“Automatic Conversion Shares”, and together with the Holder Conversion Shares, the “Shares”) and
promptly deliver such Automatic Conversion Shares (and if applicable, cash in an amount equal to the
Accrued Dividends) to the address of Holder which the Corporation then has on record (a “Delivery”).
The Automatic Conversion Shares issuable in connection with an Automatic Conversion shall be fully-
paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock. Unless the Automatic Conversion Shares are covered
by a valid and effective registration under the Securities Act or the Holder provides a valid opinion
from an attorney stating that such Automatic Conversion Shares can be issued free of restrictive
legend, which shall be determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion, prior to the issuance date
of such Automatic Conversion Shares, such Automatic Conversion Shares shall be issued as
Restricted Shares.
(c)          The issuance and Delivery by the Corporation of the Automatic Conversion Shares (and if
applicable, the cash Accrued Dividends) shall fully discharge the Corporation from any and all further
obligations under or in connection with the Series B Preferred and shall automatically, and without any
required action by the Corporation or the Holder, result in the cancellation, termination and
invalidation of any outstanding Series B Preferred and Preferred Stock Certificates held by Holder or
his, her or its assigns and shall upon the payment of the Automatic Conversion Dividends, fully
discharge any and all requirement for the Corporation to pay Dividends on such Series B Preferred
shares converted, which Series B Preferred converted shall cease accruing Dividends upon an
Automatic Conversion.
(d)          Without limiting the obligation of each Holder set forth herein (including in the subsequent
clause (e)), the Corporation and/or the Corporation’s Transfer Agent shall be authorized to take
whatever action necessary, if any, following the issuance and Delivery of the Automatic Conversion
Shares to reflect the cancellation of the Series B Preferred subject to the Automatic Conversion, which
shall not require the approval and/or consent of any Holder (a “Cancellation”).
Page 11 of 26
Lucas Energy, Inc.
Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
(e)          Notwithstanding the above, each Holder, by accepting such Preferred Stock Certificates
hereby covenants that it will, whenever and as reasonably requested by the Corporation and the
Transfer Agent, at the Corporation’s sole cost and expense, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver any
and all such other and further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances, confirmations,
powers of attorney and any instruments of further assurance, approvals and consents as the
Corporation or the Transfer Agent may reasonably require in order to complete, insure and perfect the
Cancellation, if such may be reasonably required by the Corporation and/or the Corporation’s Transfer
Agent.
(f)          In the event that the Delivery of any Automatic Conversion Shares (or any cash Accrued
Dividends) is unsuccessful and/or any Holder fails to accept such Automatic Conversion Shares (or
applicable cash Accrued Dividends), such Automatic Conversion Shares (and if applicable, cash
Accrued Dividends) shall be held by the Corporation and/or the Transfer Agent in trust (without
accruing interest) and shall be released to such Holder upon reasonable evidence to the Corporation
or the Transfer Agent that such Holder is the legal owner of such Automatic Conversion Shares,
provided that the Holder’s failure to accept such Automatic Conversion Shares, cash Accrued
Dividends and/or the Corporation’s inability to Deliver such shares or dividends shall in no event
effect the validity of the Cancellation.
(g)          The Automatic Conversion Right shall supersede and take priority over the Holder Conversion
right described in Section 4.1 in the event that there are any conflicts between such rights.
4.3         Fractional Shares. If any Conversion of Series B Preferred would result in the issuance of a
fractional share of Common Stock (aggregating all shares of Series B Preferred being converted
pursuant to a given Notice of Conversion), such fractional share shall be payable in cash based upon
the market value of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of conversion
(as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) and the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred shall be the next lower whole number of shares. If
the Corporation elects not to, or is unable to, make such a cash payment, the Holder shall be entitled
to receive, in lieu of the final fraction of a share, one whole share of Common Stock.
4.4         Taxes. The Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect
to any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon a Holder
Conversion in a name other than that in which the shares of the Series B Preferred so converted were
registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such
issue or delivery has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax, or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid. The Corporation shall withhold from any
payment due whatsoever in connection with the Series B Preferred any and all required withholdings
and/or taxes the Corporation, in its sole discretion deems reasonable or necessary, absent an opinion
from Holder’s accountant or legal counsel, acceptable to the Corporation in its sole determination, that
such withholdings and/or taxes are not required to be withheld by the Corporation.

Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
4.5         Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and
keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose of
effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series B Preferred, such number of its shares of Common
Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of
the Series B Preferred; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series B
Preferred, the Corporation will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such corporate action as
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.
5.           Voting.
5.1         Class Voting. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by law, the Holders
of Series B Preferred and the holders of Common Stock shall vote together and not as separate

5.2         No Series Voting. Other than as provided herein or required by law, there shall be no series
voting.
5.3         Series B Preferred. Each outstanding share of Series B Preferred shall be entitled to one (1)

6.1         Equitable Adjustments For Recapitalizations. The (a) Liquidation Preference, the Original Issue
Price and the Voting Rights (the “Preferred Stock Adjustable Provisions”); (b) the Conversion Price,
Minimum Trading Volume, Automatic Conversion Prices and the Conversion Rate (the “Common
Stock Adjustable Provisions”), and (c) any and all other terms, conditions, amounts and provisions of
this Designation which (i) pursuant to the terms of this Designation provide for equitable adjustment in
the event of a Recapitalization; or (ii) the Board of Directors of the Corporation determine in their
reasonable good faith judgment is required to be equitably adjusted in connection with any
Recapitalizations (collectively Sections (c)(i) and (ii), the “Other Equitable Adjustable Provisions”),
shall each be subject to equitable adjustment as provided in Sections 6.2 through 6.4, below, as
determined by the Board of Directors in their sole and reasonable discretion.

6.2          Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock
dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, without a corresponding
subdivision of the Series B Preferred, the applicable Common Stock Adjustable Provisions and the
Other Equitable Adjustable Provisions (if any) in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately and equitably adjusted. In
the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or
otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, without a corresponding combination of
the Series B Preferred, the Common Stock Adjustable Provisions and the Other Equitable Adjustable
Provisions (if any) in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately and equitably adjusted.
6.3          Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Series B Preferred. In the event the
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock
dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Series B Preferred, the applicable Preferred
Stock Adjustable Provisions and the Other Equitable Adjustable Provisions (if any) in effect
immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision,
be proportionately and equitably adjusted. In the event the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Series B
Preferred, the applicable Preferred Stock Adjustable Provisions and the Other Equitable Adjustable
Provisions (if any) in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately and equitably adjusted, provided however that
the result of any concurrent adjustment in the Common Stock (as provided under Section 6.2) and
Preferred Stock (as provided under Section 6.3) shall only be to affect the equitable adjustable
provisions hereof once.
6.4          Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to Section 3 above
(“Liquidation Rights”), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred shall
be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock,
whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or
combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the number of shares of
Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, each holder of such
Series B Preferred shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Series B Preferred into a
number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such Series B Preferred immediately before that
change would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all subject to
further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.
6.5          Other Adjustments. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall also adjust equitably, and
shall have the right to adjust equitably, any or all of the Preferred Stock Adjustable Provisions,
Common Stock Adjustable Provisions or Other Equitable Adjustable Provisions from time to time, if
the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines in their reasonable good faith judgment that
such values and/or provisions are required to be equitably adjusted in connection with any
Corporation action.

6.6          Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment
pursuant to this Section 6, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or
readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Series B Preferred a
certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which
such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time
of any holder of Series B Preferred, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect and
(iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time
would be received upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred.
7.           Redemption Rights.
7.1          Subject to the terms of any credit or debt agreements in place which prevent the Corporation
redeeming the Series B Preferred shares for cash, the Corporation shall have the option, exercisable
from time to time after the Original Issue Date, to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred (a “Corporation Redemption”) which have not been previously Converted into
Common Stock (as provided above in Section 4) (the “Corporation Redemption Rights”), by paying
each applicable Holder, an amount equal to (a) the Original Issue Price multiplied by the number of
Series B Preferred shares held by each applicable Holder, subject to the Corporation Redemption;
plus (b) the Accrued Dividends (the “Corporation Redemption Amount”).
(a)          In the event the Corporation exercises its Corporation Redemption Rights, it shall redeem and
repurchase Series B Preferred pro rata between all Holders based on the Pro Rata Amount.
(b)          To exercise the Corporation Redemption Right, the Corporation shall deliver to each Holder an
irrevocable written notice (a “Corporation Redemption Notice”), indicating the date the Corporation
intends to pay the Corporation Redemption Amount (as applicable, the “Corporation Redemption
Date”), which date may not be less than ten days nor more than 20 days from the date the Corporation
Redemption Notice is delivered to a Holder. In the event the applicable aggregate Corporation
Redemption Amount is not paid to the Holders on the applicable Corporation Redemption Date, the
Corporation Redemption Notice shall be considered void and of no force or effect.
7.2          Effect of Redemption. The payment by the Corporation to each Holder (at each such Holder’s
address of record) (or if the Holder fails to deliver the Preferred Stock Certificates and/or Lost
Certificate Materials required to be delivered as discussed below in connection with such Redemption,
upon the Corporation setting aside such Redemption Amount in trust for the benefit of the Holder) of
the Corporation Redemption Amount (as applicable, a “Redemption Delivery”) in connection with a
Corporation Redemption, and effective as of the Corporation Redemption Date, shall fully discharge
the Corporation from any and all further obligations under the Series B Preferred shares redeemed
and shall automatically, and without any required action by the Corporation or the Holder or his, her or
its assigns (including the requirement that the Holder provide the Corporation or the Corporation’s
Transfer Agent the Preferred Stock Certificates relating to such Corporation Redemption), result in the
cancellation, termination and invalidation of any outstanding Series B Preferred and related Preferred
Stock Certificates held by a Holder which are subject to a Corporation Redemption and shall upon the
payment of the Corporation Redemption Amount, fully discharge any and all requirement for the
Corporation to pay further Dividends, and which Series B Preferred shall cease accruing Dividends
upon a Redemption.

Lucas Energy, Inc.
Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
7.3         Further Actions Following Redemption. Without limiting the obligation of each Holder set forth
herein (including in Section 7.4), the Corporation and/or the Corporation’s Transfer Agent shall be
authorized to take whatever action necessary, if any, following the payment of the Corporation
Redemption Amount, to reflect the cancellation of the Series B Preferred subject to the applicable
Corporation Redemption, which shall not require the approval and/or consent of any Holder, and
provided that by agreeing to the terms and conditions of this Designation and the acceptance of the
Series B Preferred, each Holder hereby agrees to release the Corporation and the Corporation’s
Transfer Agent from any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the cancellation of the Series B
Preferred subject to and following a Corporation Redemption, regardless of the return to the
Corporation or the Transfer Agent of any Preferred Stock Certificates evidencing such Series B
Preferred subject to the Corporation Redemption, which as stated above, shall be automatically
cancelled upon the payment of the Corporation Redemption Amount, as applicable to the Holder, or if
the provisions of Section 7.5 apply and the Holder fails to deliver the Preferred Stock Certificates
and/or Lost Certificate Materials, upon the Corporation setting aside such Redemption Amount in trust
for the benefit of the Holder (a “Redemption Cancellation”).
7.4         Further Redemption Assurances. Notwithstanding the above, each Holder, by accepting such
Preferred Stock Certificates hereby covenants that it will (a) deliver to the Corporation or the
Corporation’s Transfer Agent, promptly upon the receipt of any Corporation Redemption Notice, but in
any case prior to the applicable Corporation Redemption Date, the applicable Preferred Stock
Certificates relating to the Corporation Redemption (or Lost Certificate Materials associated therewith);
and (b) whenever and as reasonably requested by the Corporation and the Corporation’s Transfer
Agent, at the Corporation’s sole cost and expense, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all
such other and further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances, confirmations, powers of
attorney and any instruments of further assurance, approvals and consents as the Corporation or the
Transfer Agent may reasonably require in order to complete, insure and perfect a Redemption
Cancellation, if such may be reasonably required by the Corporation and/or the Corporation’s Transfer
Agent.
7.5        Additional Redemption Procedures. In the event that (a) Redemption Delivery is unsuccessful
notwithstanding the fact that the Corporation has mailed such applicable Corporation Redemption
Amount to the correct address of the Holder as set forth in the records of the Corporation; or (b) any
Holder fails to timely deliver to the Corporation for cancellation the Preferred Stock Certificates
evidencing the Series B Preferred subject to such Corporation Redemption, or Lost Certificate
Materials associated therewith, and the Corporation therefore refrains from completing a Redemption
Delivery, such Corporation Redemption Amount shall be held by the Corporation in trust and such
Corporation Redemption Amount shall be released to such Holder upon reasonable evidence to the
Corporation or the Transfer Agent that such Holder is (y) the legal owner of such Corporation
Redemption Amount and/or (z) the delivery to the Corporation or its Transfer Agent of the applicable
Preferred Stock Certificates, as applicable, or Lost Certificate Materials, provided that the Holder’s
failure to accept such Corporation Redemption Amount, the Corporation’s inability to pay any Holder
its applicable Redemption Amount, and/or the Holder’s failure to deliver the Preferred Stock
Certificates or Lost Certificate Materials, under either of such circumstances shall in no event effect the
validity of the Corporation Redemption Cancellation, Redemption Cancellation, or the consequences
of a Corporation Redemption Delivery as described in Section 7.1 hereof. Furthermore, the Holder
shall be due no interest on the Corporation Redemption Amount while being held by the Corporation
in trust and any and all interest, if any, which shall accrue on such amount shall be the sole property of
the Corporation.

Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
7.6         Further Holder Redemption Assurances. Notwithstanding the above, each Holder, by
accepting such Preferred Stock Certificates will whenever and as reasonably requested by the
Corporation and the Corporation’s Transfer Agent, at its sole cost and expense, do, execute,
acknowledge and deliver any and all such other and further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers,
conveyances, confirmations, powers of attorney and any instruments of further assurance, approvals
and consents as the Corporation or the Transfer Agent may reasonably require in order to complete,
insure and perfect the cancellation of such Holder’s shares in the event of a Corporation Redemption,
if such may be reasonably required by the Corporation and/or the Corporation’s Transfer Agent.
7.7         Effect of All Redemptions. The Series B Preferred subject to a Corporation Redemption shall
cease accruing any Dividends and shall have all Conversion rights immediately terminate effective as
of the Corporation Redemption Date, unless otherwise agreed in the sole discretion of the
Corporation.

(a)          to declare any Distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in cash, property, stock or other
securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of earnings or earned
surplus;
(b)          to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock outstanding involving a

9.           Protective Provisions.
9.1          Subject to the rights of series of preferred stock which may from time to time come into
existence, so long as any shares of Series B Preferred are outstanding, the Corporation shall not,
without first obtaining the approval (by written consent or at a meeting duly called, each as provided
by law) of the holders of a Majority In Interest of Series B Preferred, voting together as a single class:
(a)          Increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized
shares of Series B Preferred (except to the extent required to issue PIK Shares if required by the terms
set forth herein, which for the sake of clarity, and without otherwise limiting this provision, shall not
require approval of the Holders);
(b)          Re-issue any shares of Series B Preferred converted pursuant to the terms of this
Designation;
(c)          Create, or authorize the creation of, or issue or obligate itself to issue shares of, any class or
series of capital stock unless the same ranks junior to (and not pari passu with) the Series B Preferred
with respect to the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, the payment of dividends and rights of redemption, or increase the authorized number of
shares of any additional class or series of capital stock unless the same ranks junior to (and not pari
passu with) the Series B Preferred with respect to the distribution of assets on the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the payment of dividends and rights of redemption, in
each such case, other than issuances of (or in connection with issuances of) shares of Series B
Preferred pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, PIK Shares and the Series C Preferred Stock;
(d)          Effect an exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of all or a part of the Series B Preferred
(except pursuant to the terms hereof);
(e)           Effect an exchange, or create a right of exchange, of all or part of the shares of another class
of shares into shares of Series B Preferred;
(f)           Alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the shares of Series B Preferred so as
to affect adversely the shares of such series;
(g)          Authorize or issue, or obligate itself to issue, any other equity security, including any other
security convertible into or exercisable for any equity security having a preference over (or on parity
with) the Series B Preferred with respect to liquidation; or
(h)          Amend or waive any provision of the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, each
as amended, relative to the Series B Preferred so as to affect adversely the shares of Series B
Preferred.
Page 19 of 26
Lucas Energy, Inc.
Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
For clarification, the creation or issuance of shares of other series of preferred stock, provided the
rights and preferences of such series of preferred stock with respect to the distribution of assets on
the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the payment of dividends are not senior
to the Series B Preferred Liquidation Preference, shall not require the authorization or approval of the
holders of the Series B Preferred.
9.2         The Corporation will not through any reorganization, transfer of assets, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or
performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation but will at
all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Designation and in the
taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect (a) the Holder
Conversion Rights of the Holders of Series B Preferred; and (b) the other rights of the Holders as set
forth herein, against impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing shall prohibit the Corporation
from amending its Articles of Incorporation with the requisite consent of its stockholders and the
Board of Directors.
10.         Preemptive Rights. No stockholder of the Corporation (including, but not limited to any Holder)
shall have the right to repurchase shares of capital stock of the Corporation sold or issued by the
Corporation except to the extent that such right may from time to time be set forth in a written
agreement between the Corporation and such stockholder.
11.         Reports. The Corporation shall mail to all holders of Series B Preferred those reports, proxy
statements and other materials that it mails to all of its holders of Common Stock.
12.         Replacement Preferred Stock Certificates. In the event that any Holder notifies the Corporation
that a Preferred Stock Certificate evidencing shares of Series B Preferred has been lost, stolen,
destroyed or mutilated, the Corporation shall issue a replacement stock certificate evidencing the
Series B Preferred identical in tenor and date (or if such certificate is being issued for shares not
covered in a redemption or conversion, in the applicable tenor and date) to the original Preferred Stock
Certificate evidencing the Series B Preferred, provided that the Holder executes and delivers to the
Corporation and/or its Transfer Agent, as applicable, an affidavit of lost stock certificate and an
agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation and its Transfer Agent to indemnify the
Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such Series B Preferred certificate, and
provides the Corporation and/or its Transfer Agent such other information, documents and if
applicable, bonds and indemnities as the Corporation or its Transfer Agent customarily requires for
reissuances of stock certificates (collectively the “Lost Certificate Materials”); provided, however, the
Corporation shall not be obligated to re-issue replacement stock certificates if the Holder
contemporaneously requests the Corporation to convert or redeem the full number of shares
evidenced by such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate.

of Series B Preferred, that he, she or it will, whenever and as reasonably requested by the Corporation,

14.3       Technical, Corrective, Administrative or Similar Changes. The Corporation may, by any means

in the aggregate, adversely affect the rights or preferences of the Holders of shares of the Series B
Preferred.
14.4       Waiver. Notwithstanding any provision in this Designation to the contrary, any provision

14.5       Interpretation. Whenever possible, each provision of this Designation shall be interpreted in a
manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law and public policy. If any provision set forth

public policy, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity,
without invalidating or otherwise adversely affecting the remaining provisions of this Designation. No
provision herein set forth shall be deemed dependent upon any other provision unless so expressed

change as shall be necessary to render the provision in question effective and valid under applicable
law.

Preferred shall not have any powers, designations, preferences or other special rights, other than
those specifically set forth in this Designation.
14.7       Specific Performance. The Corporation and each Holder by accepting Preferred Stock Shares,
agree that the covenants and obligations contained in this Designation relate to special, unique and
extraordinary matters and that a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof would cause irreparable
injury in an amount which would be impossible to estimate or determine and for which any remedy at
law would be inadequate. As such, the Corporation and each Holder agree that if either the
Corporation or any Holder fails or refuses to fulfill any of its obligations under this Designation or to
make any payment or deliver any instrument required hereunder or thereunder, then (a) the
Corporation in the event the non-performing party is any Holder; or (b) a Majority In Interest of the
Holders, in the event the non-performing party is the Corporation, shall have the remedy of specific
performance, which remedy shall be cumulative and nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any other
rights and remedies otherwise available under any other contract or at law or in equity and to which
such party might be entitled.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Designation is hereby approved, affirmed, confirmed,
and ratified; and it is further
RESOLVED, that each officer of the Corporation be and hereby is authorized, empowered and directed
to execute and deliver, in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation, any and all documents, and to
perform any and all acts necessary to reflect the Board of Directors approval and ratification of the
resolutions set forth above; and it is further

APPENDIX B
To Exhibit I
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
We are registering for resale by the selling stockholders and certain transferees a total of _________
shares of common stock. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale by the selling
stockholders of the shares of common stock. We will bear all fees and expenses incident to our
obligation to register the shares of common stock. If the shares of common stock are sold through
broker-dealers or agents, the selling stockholder will be responsible for any compensation to such
broker-dealers or agents.
The selling stockholders may pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares of
common stock owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the
pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the shares of common stock from time to time pursuant
to this prospectus.
The selling stockholders also may transfer and donate the shares of common stock in other
circumstances in which case the transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be
the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus.
The selling stockholders will sell their shares of common stock subject to the following:
●
all or a portion of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by the selling stockholders or their
perspective pledgees, donees, transferees or successors in interest, may be sold on the over-the-counter
market, any national securities exchange or quotation service on which the shares of our common stock may
be listed or quoted at the time of sale, in the over-the counter market, in privately negotiated transactions,
through the writing of options, whether such options are listed on an options exchange or otherwise, short
sales or in a combination of such transactions;
●each sale may be made at market price prevailing at the time of such sale, at negotiated prices, at fixed
prices or at carrying prices determined at the time of sale;
some or all of the shares of common stock may be sold through one or more broker-dealers or agents and
●
may involve crosses, block transactions or hedging transactions. The selling stockholders may enter into
hedging transactions with broker-dealers or agents, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common
stock in the course of hedging in positions they assume. The selling stockholders may also sell shares of
common stock short and deliver shares of common stock to close out short positions or loan or pledge
shares of common stock to broker-dealers or agents that in turn may sell such shares; and
in connection with such sales through one or more broker-dealers or agents, such broker-dealers or agents
may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling
stockholders and may receive commissions from the purchasers of the shares of common stock for whom
they act as broker-dealer or agent or to whom they sell as principal (which discounts, concessions or
commissions as to particular broker-dealers or agents may be in excess of those customary in the types of
transaction involved). Any broker-dealer or agent participating in any such sale may be deemed to be an
“underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act and will be required to deliver a copy of this
prospectus to any person who purchases any share of common stock from or through such broker-dealer or
agent. We have been advised that, as of the date hereof, none of the selling stockholders have made any
arrangements with any broker-dealer or agent for the sale of their shares of common stock.
●
Selling Stockholder Questionnaire
Page 6 of 7
The selling stockholder and any broker-dealer participating in the distribution of the shares of
common stock may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any
profits realized by the selling stockholders and any commissions paid, or any discounts or
concessions allowed to any such broker-dealer may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or
discounts under the Securities Act. In addition, any shares of common stock covered by this
prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 may be sold under Rule 144 rather than
pursuant to this prospectus. A selling stockholder may also transfer, devise or gift the shares of
common stock by other means not covered in this prospectus in which case the transferee, devisee or
giftee will be the selling stockholder under this prospectus.
If required at the time a particular offering of the shares of common stock is made, a prospectus
supplement or, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment to the shelf registration statements of which
this prospectus is a part, will be distributed which will set forth the aggregate amount of shares of
common stock being offered and the terms of the offering, including the name or names of any broker-
dealers or agents, any discounts, commissions or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to broker-
dealers.
Under the securities laws of some states, the shares of common stock may be sold in such states only
through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in some states the shares of common
stock may not be sold unless such shares have been registered or qualified for sale in such state or
an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied with. There can be no
assurance that any selling stockholder will sell any or all of the shares of common stock registered
pursuant to the shelf registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part.
The selling stockholders and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including,
without limitation, Regulation M of the Exchange Act, which may limit the timing of purchases and
sales of any of the shares of common stock by the selling stockholders and any other participating
person. Regulation M may also restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the
shares of common stock to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of common
stock. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the shares of common stock and the ability of
any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of common
stock.
We will bear all expenses of the registration of the shares of common stock including, without
limitation, Securities and Exchange Commission filing fees and expenses of compliance with the state
securities of “blue sky” laws. The selling stockholders will pay all underwriting discounts and selling
commissions and expenses, brokerage fees and transfer taxes, as well as the fees and disbursements
of counsel to and experts for the selling stockholders, if any. We will indemnify the selling
stockholders against certain liabilities, including some liabilities under the Securities Act or the selling
stockholder will be entitled to contribution. We will be indemnified by the selling stockholders against
civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act that may arise from any written information
furnished to us by the selling stockholders for use in this prospectus, in accordance with the related
securities purchase agreement or will be entitled to contribution. Once sold under this registration
statement, of which this prospectus forms a part, the shares of common stock will be freely tradable in
the hands of persons other than our affiliates.

Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion (the “Fairness Opinion”) as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to Lucas Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Lucas” or the “Company”) of the Consideration
(as defined below) to be paid by Lucas to acquire certain assets (the “Transaction”) pursuant to that
certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) to be entered into by the Company, as
purchaser, and twenty-one separate sellers named therein (the “Sellers”), and Segundo Resources,
LLC, as a Seller and as representative of the Sellers (“Segundo”). The Agreement provides that Lucas
will acquire assets (the “Assets”) consisting of certain producing properties and undeveloped acreage
in Texas and Oklahoma as set forth specifically in the Agreement, for total consideration of
$80,697,710, prior to any purchase price adjustments, consisting of $4,975,000 in cash (the “Cash

shares of redeemable convertible Preferred Stock of Lucas, with a face value of $13,800,000 (the
“Preferred Consideration”), and the assumption of $31,350,000 of seller debt (the “Debt
Consideration”, and, collectively with the Cash Consideration, the Stock Consideration and the Debt

Canaccord Genuity Inc. (“Canaccord Genuity”), as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of
business, we and our affiliates may acquire, hold or sell, for our and our affiliates own accounts and
the accounts of customers, equity, debt and other securities and financial instruments (including bank
loans and other obligations) of Lucas, any Seller, certain of their respective affiliates and any other
company that may be involved in the Transaction, as well as provide investment banking and other
financial services to such companies. We have been engaged to serve as financial advisor to Lucas
solely in connection with the delivery of this Fairness Opinion, and will receive a fee for our services,
upon delivery of this Fairness Opinion. This fee is not contingent upon the successful completion of
the Transaction.
In developing our Fairness Opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company;
(ii)
analyzed certain internal financial statements and other business and financial information, including
certain projected financial and operating data concerning the Company provided to us by Company
management;
(iii)
analyzed certain internal financial statements and other business and financial information, including
certain projected financial and operating data concerning the Assets provided to us by senior management

(vii)
compared the financial terms of the Transaction with the financial terms of certain other acquisitions we
deemed to be relevant and comparable to the Transaction;
(viii)
reviewed estimated synergies provided to us by the Company and considered the potential pro forma
financial impact of the transaction on the consolidated entity;
(ix)
reviewed the terms of the Agreement in substantially final form provided to us on December 30, 2015, the
exhibits thereto and certain related agreements furnished to us by the Company which, for purposes of this
Fairness Opinion, we have assumed, with your permission to be identical in all material respects to the
agreements to be executed; and
(x)
reviewed such other financial studies and analyses, performed such other investigations, and took into
account such other matters as we deemed necessary, including an assessment of general economic,
market and monetary conditions.
In connection with our review and arriving at our Fairness Opinion, we have not independently verified
any of the foregoing information, have relied on such information, have assumed that all such
information is complete and accurate in all material respects, and have relied on assurances of
management that they are not aware of any facts that would make such information misleading. With
respect to the internal financial forecasts and other forward-looking financial information reviewed, we
have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of each Segundo management and Company management. We
have also assumed that the Transaction will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the
Agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement
therein. We have also assumed that, in the course of obtaining necessary regulatory and third party
approvals and consents for the Transaction, no modification, delay, limitation, restriction or conditions
will be imposed that will have an adverse effect on the Company, Segundo, any Seller, the Assets or
the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.
This Fairness Opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Canaccord Genuity in
accordance with FINRA Rule 5150. Our Fairness Opinion is rendered on the basis of securities,
economic and market conditions prevailing as of the date hereof and on the prospects, financial and
otherwise, of the Company, and the Assets, known to us as of the date hereof. It should be understood
that (i) subsequent developments may affect the conclusions expressed in this Fairness Opinion if this
Fairness Opinion were rendered as of a later date, and (ii) Canaccord Genuity disclaims any obligation
to advise any person of any change in any manner affecting this Fairness Opinion that may come to
our attention after the date of this Fairness Opinion. We have not undertaken to reaffirm or revise this
Fairness Opinion or otherwise comment upon any events occurring after the date hereof and do not
have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this Fairness Opinion. We have not been requested to
conduct and we have not conducted, nor have we relied upon, any independent valuation or appraisal
of any of the assets of the Company or the Assets. We also have not evaluated the solvency of any
party to the Agreement under any state or federal laws, rules or regulations relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar matters. In addition, we have assumed, with your consent, that any material
liabilities (contingent or otherwise, known or unknown) of the Company or Segundo are as set forth in
the financial statements of the Company and Segundo provided to us.
This Fairness Opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Company of the
Consideration to be paid by the Company in the Transaction, and we express no opinion as to the
fairness of the Transaction to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies
of the Company. Our Fairness Opinion does not address the relative merits of the Transaction as
compared to other business strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company, nor
does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to proceed with the Transaction. We
also note that we are not legal, accounting, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the
assessments made by the Company and its advisors with respect to such matters. We have not
considered, and we express no opinion as to, the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or class of such persons,
relative to the consideration to be received by the Company in the Transaction.
It is agreed between the Board of Directors and Canaccord Genuity that this Fairness Opinion, as set
forth in this letter form, is directed to and for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company
only (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the Transaction and does not
constitute advice or a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote
their shares of Lucas Common Stock with respect to any matter related to the Transaction or how
such stockholder should otherwise act on any matter relating to the proposed Transaction.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the
Consideration to be paid by the Company in the Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the Company.
Sincerely,
CANACCORD GENUITY INC.

A.          Representations Regarding Transaction. Except as set forth under the corresponding section
of the Disclosure Schedules, if any, Company hereby represents and warrants to, and as applicable
covenants with, Investor as of the Closing:
1.          Organization and Qualification. Company and each Subsidiary is an entity duly incorporated or
otherwise organized, validly existing and in good standing (where such concept is applicable) under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as applicable, with the requisite power
and authority to own and use its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently
conducted, except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation or default of any of the provisions
of its respective certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational or charter
documents, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Company and each Subsidiary is duly qualified to conduct business and is in good standing (where
such concept is applicable) as a foreign corporation or other entity in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted or property owned by it makes such qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, as the case may be, would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and there is no completed, pending or, to Company’s
knowledge, threatened or contemplated proceeding in any such jurisdiction revoking, limiting or
curtailing or seeking to revoke, limit or curtail such power and authority or qualification.
2.          Authorization; Enforcement. Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into and to consummate the transactions contemplated by each of the Transaction Documents and
otherwise to carry out its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The execution and delivery of each of
the Transaction Documents by Company and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
Company and no further consent or action is required by Company. Each of the Transaction
Documents has been, or upon delivery will be, duly executed by Company and, when delivered in
accordance with the terms hereof, will constitute the valid and binding obligation of Company,
enforceable against Company in accordance with its terms, except (a) as limited by general equitable
principles and applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of
general application affecting enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, (b) as limited by laws relating
to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and (c) insofar
as indemnification and contribution provisions may be limited by applicable law.
3
3.          No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents by
Company, the issuance and sale of the Securities and the consummation by Company of the other
transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not (a) conflict with or violate any provision of
Company’s or any Subsidiary’s certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
or charter documents, (b) conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Company or any Subsidiary, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) of, any material
agreement, credit facility, debt or other instrument (evidencing Company or Subsidiary debt or
otherwise) or other understanding to which Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which any
property or asset of Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, (c) conflict with or result in a
violation of any material law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, injunction, decree or other restriction of
any court or governmental authority to which Company or a Subsidiary is subject (including U.S.
federal and state securities laws and regulations), or by which any material property or asset of
Company or a Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (d) conflict with or violate the terms of any material
agreement by which Company or any Subsidiary is bound or to which any property or asset of
Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected; except in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d),
such as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
4.          Litigation. There is no action, suit, inquiry, notice of violation, proceeding or investigation
completed, pending or, to Company’s knowledge, threatened or contemplated against or affecting
Company, any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties before or by any court, arbitrator,
governmental or administrative agency or regulatory authority (federal, state, county, local or foreign)
(collectively, an “Action”), which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or challenge the
legality, validity or enforceability of any of the Transaction Documents or the sale, issuance, listing,
trading or resale of the Conversion Shares on the Trading Market hereunder. The Commission has not
issued any stop order or other order suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement filed
by Company or any Subsidiary under the Exchange Act or the Act.
5.          Filings, Consents and Approvals. Neither Company nor any Subsidiary is required to obtain
any consent, waiver, authorization or order of, give any notice to, or make any filing or registration
with, any court or other federal, state, local or other governmental authority or other Person in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Company of the Transaction Documents,
other than required federal and state securities filings and such filings and approvals as are required
to be made or obtained under the applicable Trading Market rules in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of which has been, or if not yet required to be filed will be, timely filed.
6.          Issuance of Securities. The Securities are duly authorized and, when issued and paid for in
accordance with the applicable Transaction Documents, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, free and clear of all Liens. Company has reserved and will continue to reserve from its
duly authorized capital stock sufficient shares of its Common Stock for issuance pursuant to the
Transaction Documents.

7.          Disclosure; Non-Public Information. Company will timely file a current report on Form 8-K
(“Current Report”) by 8:30 am Eastern time on the Trading Day after the Effective Date describing the
material terms and conditions of this Agreement, a copy of which has been provided to Investor prior
to the Effective Date. All information that Company has provided to Investor that constitutes or might
constitute material, non-public information will be included in the Current Report. Notwithstanding any
other provision, except for information that will be included in the Current Report, (a) neither Company
nor any other Person acting on its behalf has provided Investor or its representatives, agents or
attorneys with any information that constitutes or might constitute material, non-public information,
including without limitation this Agreement and the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules hereto, (b) no
information contained in the Disclosure Schedules constitutes material non-public information and (c)
there is no adverse material information regarding Company that has not been publicly disclosed prior
to the Effective Date. Company understands and confirms that Investor will rely on the foregoing
representations and covenants in effecting transactions in securities of Company. All disclosure
provided to Investor regarding Company, its business and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including without limitation the Disclosure Schedules, furnished by or on behalf of Company with
respect to the representations and warranties made herein are true and correct in all material respects
and do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.
8.          No Integrated Offering. Neither Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any Person acting on its
or their behalf has, directly or indirectly, made any offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers
to buy any security, under circumstances that would cause this offering to be integrated with prior
offerings by Company that cause a violation of the Act or any applicable stockholder approval
provisions other than Approval, including, without limitation, under the rules and regulations of the
Trading Market.
9.          Financial Condition. The Public Reports set forth as of the dates thereof all outstanding
secured and unsecured Indebtedness of Company or any Subsidiary, or for which Company or any
Subsidiary has commitments, and any material default with respect to any Indebtedness. Company
does not intend to incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature, taking into account
the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its debt.
10.        Section 5 Compliance. No representation or warranty or other statement made by Company in
the Transaction Documents contains any untrue statement or omits to state a material fact necessary
to make any of them, in light of the circumstances in which it was made, not misleading. Company is
not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, when consummated, to violate Section 5 of the Act or other federal or state
securities laws or regulations.
11.        Investment Company. Company is not, and is not an Affiliate of, and immediately after receipt of
payment for the Securities, will not be or be an Affiliate of, an “investment company” within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Company will conduct its business in a
manner so that it will not become subject to the Investment Company Act.
12.        Acknowledgments Regarding Investor. Company’s decision to enter into this Agreement has
been based solely on the independent evaluation by Company and its representatives, and Company
acknowledges and agrees that:
5
a.          Investor is not, has never been, and as a result of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents will not become an officer, director, insider, control person, to Company’s
knowledge, 10% or greater shareholder or otherwise an affiliate of Company as defined under Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act;
b.          Investor does not make or has not made any representations, warranties or agreements
with respect to the Securities, this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby other than
those specifically set forth in Section III.C below;
c.          The conversion of the Debenture, exercise of the Warrant, and resale of Conversion Shares will
result in dilution, which may be substantial; the number of Conversion Shares will increase in certain
circumstances; and Company’s obligation to issue and deliver Conversion Shares in accordance with
this Agreement, the Debenture and Warrant is absolute and unconditional regardless of the dilutive
effect that such issuances may have; and
d.          Investor is acting solely in the capacity of arm’s length purchaser with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; neither Investor nor any of its Affiliates, agents
or representatives has or is acting as a legal, financial, investment, accounting, tax or other advisor to
Company, or fiduciary of Company, or in any similar capacity; neither Investor nor any of its Affiliates,
agents or representatives has provided any legal, financial, investment, accounting, tax or other
advice to Company; any statement made in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby is not advice or a recommendation, and is merely incidental to Investor’s
purchase of the Securities.
13.          No Bad Actor Disqualification. Neither Company, any predecessor of Company, any affiliate of
Company, any director, executive officer, other officer of Company participating in the offering, or any
beneficial owner of 20% or more of Company’s outstanding voting equity securities is subject to any
bad actor disqualification as provided in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D, and Company is not aware of
any facts or circumstances that, with the passage of time, would reasonably be expected to cause
such disqualification.
14.          Offshore Transaction. Company has not, and will not, engage in any directed selling efforts in
the United States in respect of the Securities. Company is offering and selling the Securities only to
Investor, in compliance with the offering restriction requirements of Regulation S.
B.          Representations Regarding Company. Except as set forth in any Public Reports or attached
exhibits as of the Effective Date, or under the corresponding section of the Disclosure Schedules, if
any, Company hereby represents and warrants to, and as applicable covenants with, Investor as of the
Closing:
6
1.          Capitalization. The capitalization of the Company as of the Effective Date is as described in the
Public Reports. No Person has any right of first refusal, preemptive right, right of participation, or any
similar right to participate in the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents which has
not been waived or satisfied. Except as a result of the purchase and sale of the Debenture, the Warrant
and the issuance of Conversion Shares, there are no outstanding options, warrants, script rights to
subscribe to, calls or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities, rights or
obligations convertible into or exchangeable for, or giving any Person any right to subscribe for or
acquire, any shares of Common Stock, or contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements
by which Company or any Subsidiary is or may become bound to issue additional shares of Common
Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock. The issuance and sale
of the Securities will not obligate Company to issue shares of Common Stock or other securities to
any Person, other than Investor, and will not result in a right of any holder of Company securities to
adjust the exercise, conversion, exchange, or reset price under such securities. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Company are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, have been issued
in material compliance with all federal and state securities laws, and none of such outstanding shares
was issued in violation of any preemptive rights or similar rights to subscribe for or purchase
securities. No further approval or authorization of any stockholder, the Board of Directors of Company
or others is required for the issuance and sale of the Securities, other than Approval. There are no
stockholders agreements, voting agreements or other similar agreements with respect to Company’s
capital stock to which Company is a party or, to the knowledge of Company, between or among any of
Company’s stockholders.
2.          Subsidiaries. All of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Company are set forth in the Public
Reports or the corresponding section of the Disclosure Schedules. Company owns, directly or
indirectly, all of the capital stock or other equity interests of each Subsidiary, and all of such directly or
indirectly owned capital stock or other equity interests are owned free and clear of any Liens. All the

fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive and similar rights to subscribe for or purchase
securities.
3.          Public Reports; Financial Statements. Company has filed all required Public Reports for the one
year preceding the Effective Date. As of their respective dates or as subsequently amended, the Public
Reports complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder, as applicable, and none of the
Public Reports, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of
Company included in the Public Reports, as amended, comply in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the rules and regulations of the Commission with respect thereto as in
effect at the time of filing. Such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP,
except as may be otherwise specified in such financial statements or the notes thereto and except that
unaudited financial statements may not contain all footnotes required by GAAP, and fairly present in
all material respects the financial position of Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for
the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal, immaterial, year-end audit adjustments.

10-K has been filed with the Commission, (a) there has been no event, occurrence or development that

not incurred any liabilities (contingent or otherwise) other than (i) trade payables and accrued

7
5.          Litigation. There is no Action completed, pending or, to Company’s knowledge, threatened or
contemplated, which would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
Company nor any Subsidiary, nor any director or officer thereof, nor to the knowledge of Company
any greater than 5% shareholder or any director or officer thereof, is or has been the subject of any
Action involving a claim of violation of or liability under federal or state securities laws or a claim of
breach of fiduciary duty. There has not been, is not pending, and to Company’s knowledge, there is
not threatened or contemplated, any investigation by the Commission involving Company or any
current or former director or officer of Company, or to the knowledge of Company greater than 5%
shareholder of Company.
6.          No Bankruptcy. There has not been any petition or application filed, or any judicial or
administrative proceeding commenced which has not been discharged, by or against the Company or
any Subsidiary or with respect to any of the properties or assets of Company or any Subsidiary under
any applicable law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, compromise,
arrangement of debt, creditors’ rights and no assignment has been made by the Company or any
Subsidiary for the benefit of creditors.
7.          Labor Relations. No material labor dispute exists or, to the knowledge of Company, is imminent
with respect to any of the employees of Company, which would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.
8.          Compliance. Neither Company nor any Subsidiary (a) is in material default under or in material
violation of (and no event has occurred that has not been waived that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would result in a default by Company or any Subsidiary under), nor has Company or any
Subsidiary received notice of a claim that it is in material default under or that it is in material violation
of, any indenture, loan or credit agreement or any other similar agreement or instrument to which it is a
party or by which it or any of its properties is bound (whether or not such default or violation has been
waived), (b) is in violation of any order of any court, arbitrator or governmental body, or (c) is or has
been in violation of any statute, rule or regulation of any governmental authority, including without
limitation all foreign, federal, state and local laws applicable to its business, except in each case as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
9.          Regulatory Permits. Company and each Subsidiary possess all certificates, authorizations and
permits issued by the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory authorities necessary to
conduct their respective businesses as described in the Public Reports, except where the failure to
possess such permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect (“Material Permits”), and neither Company nor any Subsidiary has received
any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any Material Permit.
8
10.         Title to Assets. Company and each Subsidiary have good and marketable title in fee simple to
all real property owned by them that is material to the business of Company and each Subsidiary and
good and marketable title in all personal property owned by them that is material to the business of
Company and each Subsidiary, in each case free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens that do not
materially affect the value of such property and do not materially interfere with the use made and
proposed to be made of such property by Company and each Subsidiary and Liens for the payment of
federal, state or other taxes, the payment of which is neither delinquent nor subject to penalties. Any
real property and facilities held under lease by Company and each Subsidiary are held by them under
valid, subsisting and enforceable leases of which Company and each Subsidiary are in compliance.
11.         Patents and Trademarks. Company and each Subsidiary have, or have rights to use, all
patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications, service marks, trade names,
copyrights, licenses and other similar rights that are necessary or material for use in connection with
their respective businesses as described in the Public Reports and which the failure to so have would
have a Material Adverse Effect (collectively, “Intellectual Property Rights”). Neither Company nor any
Subsidiary has received a written notice that the Intellectual Property Rights used by Company or any
Subsidiary violates or infringes upon the rights of any Person. To the knowledge of Company, all such
Intellectual Property Rights are enforceable and there is no existing infringement by another Person of
any of the Intellectual Property Rights of Company or each Subsidiary.
12.         Insurance. Company and each Subsidiary are insured by insurers of recognized financial
responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary in the
businesses in which Company and each Subsidiary are engaged, including but not limited to directors
and officers insurance coverage at least equal to the Purchase Amount. To Company’s knowledge,
such insurance contracts and policies are accurate and complete in all material respects. Neither
Company nor any Subsidiary has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing
insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar
insurers as may be necessary to continue its business without an increase in cost that would
constitute a Material Adverse Effect.
13.         Transactions with Affiliates and Employees. None of the officers or directors of Company and,
to the knowledge of Company, none of the employees of Company is presently a party to any
transaction with Company or any Subsidiary (other than for services as employees, officers and
directors), including any contract, agreement or other arrangement providing for the furnishing of
services to or by, providing for rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise requiring
payments to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to the knowledge of Company, any
entity in which any officer, director, or any such employee has a substantial interest or is an officer,
director, trustee or partner, in each case in excess of $120,000 other than (i) for payment of salary or
consulting fees for services rendered, (ii) reimbursement for expenses incurred on behalf of Company
and (iii) for other employee benefits, including stock option agreements under any equity incentive
plan of Company.

provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which are applicable to it as of the date of the Closing.
Company presented in its most recently filed periodic report under the Exchange Act the conclusions
of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
based on their evaluations as of the evaluation date. Since the date of the most recently filed Public
Report, there have been no significant changes in Company’s internal accounting controls or its
disclosure controls and procedures or, to Company’s knowledge, in other factors that could materially
affect Company’s internal accounting controls or its disclosure controls and procedures.
15.         Certain Fees. No brokerage or finder’s fees or commissions are or will be payable to any
broker, financial advisor or consultant, finder, placement agent, investment banker, bank or other
Person with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other
provision, Investor will have no obligation with respect to any fees or with respect to any claims made
by or on behalf of other Persons for fees of a type contemplated in this section that may be due in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.
16.         Registration Rights. No Person has any right to cause Company to effect the registration
under the Act of any securities of Company.
17.         Listing and Maintenance Requirements. The Common Stock is registered pursuant to Section
12 of the Exchange Act, and Company has taken no action designed to, or which to its knowledge is
likely to have the effect of, terminating the registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act
nor has Company received any notification that the Commission is contemplating terminating such
registration. Company has not, in the 12 months preceding the Effective Date, received notice from
any Trading Market on which the Common Stock is or has been listed or quoted to the effect that
Company is not in compliance with the listing or maintenance requirements of such Trading Market.
Company is, and has no reason to believe that it will not in the foreseeable future continue to be, in
compliance with all such listing and maintenance requirements.
17.          Application of Takeover Protections. Company and its Board of Directors have taken all
necessary action, if any, in order to render inapplicable any control share acquisition, business
combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-
takeover provision under Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (or similar charter documents) or the
laws of its state of incorporation that is or could become applicable to Investor as a result of Investor
and Company fulfilling their obligations or exercising their rights under the Transaction Documents,
including without limitation Company’s issuance of the Conversion Shares and Investor’s ownership
of the Conversion Shares.
18.          Tax Status. Company and each of its Subsidiaries has made or filed all federal, state and
foreign income and all other tax returns, reports and declarations required by any jurisdiction to which
it is subject (unless and only to the extent that Company and each of its Subsidiaries has set aside on
its books provisions reasonably adequate for the payment of all unpaid and unreported taxes).
Company has not executed a waiver with respect to the statute of limitations relating to the
assessment or collection of any foreign, federal, statute or local tax. None of Company’s tax returns is
presently being audited by any taxing authority. Company would not be classified as a PFIC for its
most recently completed taxable year, and does not expect to be classified as a PFIC for its current
taxable year.

other person acting on behalf of Company, has (a) directly or indirectly, used any corrupt funds for

political activity, (b) made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic government officials or
employees or to any foreign or domestic political parties or campaigns from corporate funds, (c) failed
to disclose fully any contribution made by Company, or made by any person acting on its behalf of
which Company is aware, which is in violation of law, or (d) violated in any material respect any
provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended.
20.          Accountants. Company’s accountants are set forth in the Public Reports and such

accountants or lawyers formerly or presently employed by Company.
22.          Powers of Attorney. There are no outstanding powers of attorney executed on behalf of the
Company or any Subsidiary, except such as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.
23.          Computer and Technology Security. Company has taken all reasonable steps to safeguard
the information technology systems utilized in the operation of the business of Company, including
the implementation of procedures to minimize the risk that such information technology systems have
any disabling codes or instructions, timer, copy protection device, clock, counter or other limiting
design or routing and any back door, virus, malicious code or other software routines or hardware
components that in each case permit unauthorized access or the unauthorized disablement or
unauthorized erasure of data or other software by a third party, and, to Company’s knowledge, to date
there have been no successful unauthorized intrusions or breaches of the security of the information
technology systems.

Company as of the Closing as follows:
1.          Organization; Authority. Investor is an entity validly existing and in good standing under the

to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and otherwise to carry

transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary company or
similar action on the part of Investor. Each Transaction Document to which it is a party has been, or
will be, duly executed by Investor, and when delivered by Investor in accordance with the terms hereof,

with its terms, except (a) as limited by general equitable principles and applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally, (b) as limited by laws relating to the availability of specific performance,
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, and (c) insofar as indemnification and contribution
provisions may be limited by applicable law.
2.          Investor Status. At the time Investor was offered the Securities, it was, and at the Effective Date
it is: (a) an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Act; (b) not a registered broker-
dealer, member of FINRA, or an affiliate thereof; and (c) not a U.S. Person and not acquiring the
Securities for the account or beneficial ownership of any U.S. Person.
3.          Experience of Investor. Investor, either alone or together with its representatives, has such
knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the Shares, and has so evaluated the
merits and risks of such investment. Investor is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the
Shares and, at the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such investment.
4.          Ownership. Investor is acquiring the Debenture and Warrant as principal for its own account.
Investor will not engage in hedging transactions with regard to the Securities unless in compliance
with the Act. Investor will not resell, transfer or assign the Debenture or Warrant, and will resell the
Conversion Shares only pursuant to registration under the Act or an available exemption therefrom.
5.          No Short Sales. Neither Investor nor any Affiliate (a) currently holds any short position in the
Common Stock, (b) has ever engaged in any Short Sales of the Common Stock, (c) has engaged in
any hedging transactions with regard to the Common Stock prior to the Effective Date, or (d) has
traded any securities of Company within 30 days prior to the Effective Date.
12
IV.          Securities and Other Provisions.
A.          Investor Due Diligence. Investor will have the right and opportunity to conduct customary due
diligence with respect to any Registration Statement or Prospectus in which the name of Investor or
any Affiliate of Investor appears.
B.          Furnishing of Information. As long as Investor owns any Securities, Company will timely file all
reports required to be filed by Company after the Effective Date pursuant to the Exchange Act. As long
as Investor owns any Securities, Company will prepare and make publicly available such information
as is required for Investor to sell its Conversion Shares under Rule 144. Company further covenants
that, as long as Investor owns any Securities, Company will take such further action as Investor may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable Investor to sell its Conversion
Shares without registration under the Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144.
C.          Integration. Company will not sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in
respect of any security, as defined in Section 2 of the Act, that would be integrated with the offer or
sale of the Securities to Investor for purposes of the rules and regulations of any Trading Market such
that it would require stockholder approval prior to the closing of such other transaction, unless
stockholder approval is obtained before the closing of such subsequent transaction.
D.          Disclosure and Publicity. Company will provide to Investor for review and approval prior to
issuing any current report, press release, public statement or communication with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.
E.          Shareholders Rights Plan. No claim will be made or enforced by Company or, to the knowledge
of Company, any other Person that Investor is an “Acquiring Person” under any shareholders rights
plan or similar plan or arrangement in effect or hereafter adopted by Company, or that Investor could
be deemed to trigger the provisions of any such plan or arrangement, in either such case, by virtue of
receiving the Securities under the Transaction Documents or under any other agreement between
Company and Investor. Company will conduct its business in a manner so that it will not become
subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
F.          No Non-Public Information. Company covenants and agrees that neither it nor any other
Person acting on its behalf will, provide Investor or its agents or counsel with any information that
Company believes or reasonably should believe will constitute material non-public information after
Closing. On and after Closing, neither Investor nor any Affiliate of Investor will have any duty of trust or
confidence that is owed directly, indirectly, or derivatively, to Company or the stockholders of
Company, or to any other Person who is the source of material non-public information regarding
Company. Company understands and confirms that Investor will be relying on the foregoing in
effecting transactions in securities of Company, including without limitation sales of the Conversion
Shares.
13
G.          Indemnification of Investor.
1.          Obligation to Indemnify. Subject to the provisions of this Section IV.G, Company will indemnify
and hold Investor, its Affiliates, managers and advisors, and each of their officers, directors,
shareholders, partners, employees, representatives, agents and attorneys, and any person who
controls Investor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act
(collectively, “Investor Parties” and each a “Investor Party”), harmless from any and all losses,
liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, reasonable costs and expenses, including all
judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of
investigation (collectively, “Losses”) that any Investor Party may suffer or incur as a result of or
relating to (a) any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by
Company in this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents, (b) any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus,
Prospectus Supplement, or any information incorporated by reference therein, or arising out of or
based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) any action by a creditor or stockholder of Company who is not an Affiliate of an Investor Party,
challenging the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents; provided, however, that
Company will not be obligated to indemnify any Investor Party for any Losses finally adjudicated to be
caused solely by (i) a false statement of material fact contained within written information provided by
such Investor Party expressly for the purpose of including it in the applicable Registration Statement,
Prospectus, Prospectus Supplement, or (ii) such Investor Party’s unexcused material breach of an
express provision of this Agreement or another Transaction Document.
2.          Procedure for Indemnification. If any action will be brought against an Investor Party in respect
of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Investor Party will promptly notify
Company in writing, and Company will have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its
own choosing. Investor Parties will have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and
participate in the defense thereof, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the
expense of Investor Parties except to the extent that (a) the employment thereof has been specifically
authorized by Company in writing, (b) Company has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume
such defense and to employ counsel or (c) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of such
separate counsel, a material conflict with respect to the dispute in question on any material issue
between the position of Company and the position of Investor Parties such that it would be
inappropriate for one counsel to represent Company and Investor Parties. Company will not be liable
to Investor Parties under this Agreement (i) for any settlement by an Investor Party effected without
Company’s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (ii) to the
extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is either attributable to Investor’s
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by Investor in this
Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents. In no event will the Company be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses for more than one separate firm of attorneys (plus local counsel as
applicable) to represent all Investor Parties.
3.          Other than the liability of Investor to Company for uncured material breach of the express
provisions of this Agreement, no Investor Party will have any liability to Company or any Person
asserting claims on behalf of or in right of Company as a result of acquiring the Securities under this
Agreement.
14
H.          Reservation of Shares. Company will at all times maintain a reserve from its duly authorized
Common Stock for issuance pursuant to the Transaction Documents authorized shares of Common
Stock in an amount equal to thrice the number of shares sufficient to immediately issue all Conversion
Shares potentially issuable at such time.
I.          Activity Restrictions. For so long as Investor or any of its Affiliates holds any Securities, neither
Investor nor any Affiliate will: (1) vote any shares of Common Stock owned or controlled by it, sign or
solicit any proxies, attend or be present at a shareholder meeting for purposes of determining a
quorum, or seek to advise or influence any Person with respect to any voting securities of Company;
(2) engage or participate in any actions, plans or proposals which relate to or would result in (a)
acquiring additional securities of Company, alone or together with any other Person, which would
result in beneficially owning or controlling more than 9.99% of the total outstanding Common Stock or
other voting securities of Company, (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger,
reorganization or liquidation, involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) a sale or transfer of a
material amount of assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (d) any change in the present board
of directors or management of Company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or
term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board, (e) any material change in the present
capitalization or dividend policy of Company, (f) any other material change in Company’s business or
corporate structure, including but not limited to, if Company is a registered closed-end investment
company, any plans or proposals to make any changes in its investment policy for which a vote is
required by Section 13 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, (g) changes in Company’s charter,
bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of
control of Company by any Person, (h) a class of securities of Company being delisted from a national
securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a
registered national securities association, (i) a class of equity securities of Company becoming eligible
for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Act, or (j) any action, intention, plan or
arrangement similar to any of those enumerated above; or (3) request Company or its directors,
officers, employees, agents or representatives to amend or waive any provision of this section.
J.          No Shorting. Provided no Trigger Event under Sections I.H.(1), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) or (14) of the
Debenture has occurred, for so long as Investor holds any securities of Company, neither Investor nor
any of its Affiliates will engage in or effect, directly or indirectly, any Short Sale of Common Stock. For
the avoidance of doubt, selling against delivery of Conversion Shares after delivery of a Conversion
Notice is not a Short Sale. There will be no restriction or limitation of any kind on Investor’s right or
ability to sell or transfer any or all of the Conversion Shares at any time, in its sole and absolute
discretion.
K.          Stock Splits. If Company at any time on or after the Effective Date subdivides (by any stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) or combines (by combination, reverse stock split or
otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser
number of shares, the share numbers, prices and other amounts set forth in this Agreement, as in
effect immediately prior to such subdivision or combination, will be proportionately reduced or
increased, as applicable, effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination
becomes effective.
15
L.          Subsequent Financings. Until at least 60 days after the Registration Statement is declared
effective, Company will not issue or enter into an agreement to issue any shares of Common Stock,
except as provided in subsections (a), (b), (c)(i), (c)(iii), (c)(v) or (c)(vi) below. Until at least 6 months
after the entire Debenture and Warrant have been converted, redeemed or exercised, Company will not
(1) enter into any agreement that in any way restricts its ability to enter into any agreement, amendment
or waiver with Investor, including without limitation any agreement to offer, sell or issue to Investor any
preferred stock, common stock or other securities of Company, (2) enter into any equity or convertible
financing pursuant to which shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents may effectively
be issued (i) at a discount, (ii) at a variable price, or (iii) where the price or number of shares are subject
to any type of variability or reset feature. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Company may enter
into any financing: (a) with Investor; (b) for non-convertible debt with no equity component; or (c)
issuing Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents at a fixed price (i) upon the exercise or
exchange or conversion of any securities issued and outstanding on, and not amended or modified
after, the Effective Date, (ii) in an underwritten public offering that does not include warrants and
generates gross proceeds of at least $10 million, (iii) up to $250,000 per month in private placements of
securities that are restricted for at least 6 months after issuance; (iv) in exchange for services pursuant
to existing qualified incentive stock option plans, or pursuant to new plans duly adopted by the Board
of Directors of the Company if the securities are restricted for at least 6 months after issuance,
including options or other awards, to Company employees, officers, directors, or individual
independent contractors specifically engaged in the operations or management of oil and gas field
related activity and specifically excluding corporate contractors and general and administrative
service providers, (v) as consideration for acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or strategic
transactions, including licensing and partnering agreements, or purchase of all or substantially all of
the securities or assets of another entity, or (vi) as consideration for an equipment loan or leasing
arrangement, real property leasing arrangement, or debt financing, from a licensed commercial bank;
provided however, with regard to any of the foregoing set forth in clauses (iv) through (vi), that (1) the
primary purpose of such issuance is not to raise capital, (2) the purchasers or acquirers of the
securities in such issuance do not include Company or any of its Subsidiaries and solely consists of
either (w) the individuals actually providing the services, (x) the actual participants in such strategic
alliance or strategic partnership, (y) the actual owners of such assets or securities acquired in such
acquisition or merger or (z) the stockholders, partners or members of the foregoing Persons, (3) the
number or amount of securities issued to such Person by the Company shall not be disproportionate
to such Person’s actual participation in such strategic alliance or strategic partnership or ownership of
such assets or securities to be acquired by the Company, or the value of services provided to the
Company, as applicable, and (4) none of such Persons are an entity whose primary business is
investing in securities, unless such entity has more than $1 billion in assets under management.
M.          Approval. Company will file a preliminary proxy statement within 30 days of the Effective Date,
and use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain stockholder approval of this Agreement, the
Debenture, the Warrant, and the issuance of the Conversion Shares, in accordance with the
requirements of NYSE MKT rules or a waiver from NYSE MKT (“Approval”) as soon as practicable after
the Effective Date. Company, its board of directors, and each of its directors will vote all proxies given
to them in favor of Approval.
16
N.          Principal Market. Company has submitted any necessary notification and supporting
documentation required for the listing of all possible Conversion Shares with NYSE MKT and will use
its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain approval to list the Conversion Shares as soon as
practicable.
O.          Restrictive Legend. The Securities have not been registered under the Act and may not be
resold in the United States unless registered or an exemption from registration is available. Company
is required to refuse to register any transfer of the Conversion Shares not made pursuant to
registration under the Act or an available exemption from registration. Upon the issuance thereof, and
only until such time as the same is no longer required under the applicable securities laws and
regulations, the certificates representing any of the Securities will bear a legend in substantially the
following form:
THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT, OR ANY U.S. STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND, UNLESS SO REGISTERED, MAY
NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE UNITED STATES OR TO U.S.
PERSONS EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT
OR AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT. IN ADDITION, HEDGING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING
THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE CONDUCTED unless in compliance with the ACT.
Certificates representing Conversion Shares will be issued without such legend or at Investor’s option
issue electronic delivery at the applicable balance account at DTC, if either (i) the Conversion Shares
are registered for resale under the Act, or (ii) Investor provides an opinion of its counsel to the effect
that the Conversion Shares may be issued without restrictive legend.
P.          Warrant Exercise. Upon automatic exercise pursuant to Section I.B. of the Warrant, Investor will
pay Company the Purchase Price for the Warrant by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
V.          Registration Statement.
A.          Filing.
1.          Company will at its sole cost and expense prepare and file with the Commission as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Date, and in any event within 30 days, a Registration Statement
(“Registration Statement”) on Form S-3 or, if Form S-3 is unavailable, Form S-1, registering the delayed
and continuous resale of all Conversion Shares pursuant to Rule 415 under the Act, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Act as
promptly as practicable, and to remain continuously effective until all Conversion Shares may be
resold by Investor pursuant to Rule 144 without volume restrictions, manner-of-sale restrictions, or
Company being in compliance with any current public information requirement (the “Registration
Period”).
17
2.          If Company breaches its obligations under the preceding paragraph, it will file a Registration
Statement as soon as practicable, but such obligation and filing will not operate to cure or excuse
such breach. If at any time after the initial registration Statement is filed on Form S-3 or Form S-1, the
Registration Statement does not remain effective, Company will use reasonable best efforts to amend
the Registration Statement to continue effectiveness uninterrupted.
3.          Notwithstanding the foregoing registration obligations, if the Commission informs the
Company that all of the Conversion Shares cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be
registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration statement, the Company agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to file amendments to the Registration Statement as
required by the Commission, covering the maximum number of Conversion Shares permitted to be
registered by the Commission, to register for resale the Conversion Shares as a secondary offering;
provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment, the Company will use reasonably diligent
efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all of the Conversion Shares in
accordance with Commission guidance.
B.          Procedures. In connection with the Registration Statement, Company will, as soon as
reasonably practicable:
1.          Prepare and file with the Commission such pre-effective and post-effective amendments and
supplements to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection with the
Registration Statement, and file such reports under the Exchange Act, as may be necessary to cause
the Registration Statement to become effective, to keep the Registration Statement continuously
effective during the Registration Period and not misleading in any material respect, and as may
otherwise be required or applicable under, and to comply with the provisions of, the Act with respect to
the disposition of all Conversion Shares covered by the Registration Statement during the
Registration Period.
2.          Furnish to Investor such number of copies of the Prospectus, and each amendment or
supplement thereto, in conformity with the requirements of the Act, and such other documents as
Investor may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of Conversion Shares owned by
it.
3.          Notify Investor: (a) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment is proposed to be filed and, with respect to any post-effective amendment, when the same
has become effective, except for any filing to be made solely to incorporate by reference a Current
Report on Form 8-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed with the
Commission; (b) of any request by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental
authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or a Prospectus or for
additional information; (c) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; (d) of
the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or
exemption from qualification of any of the Conversion Shares for sale in any jurisdiction, or the
initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, and (e) of the occurrence of any event or
circumstance that makes any statement made in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any
document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material
respect or that requires the making of any changes in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or
documents so that, in the case of a Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, it
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; provided, however, in no event will any such notice contain any
information which would constitute material, non-public information regarding the Company.
18
4.          Use reasonable best efforts to avoid the issuance of, or, if issued, obtain the withdrawal of, any
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or the lifting of any suspension of
the qualification, or exemption from qualification, of any of the Conversion Shares for sale in any
jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment.
5.          Incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as
Investor reasonably requests be included therein regarding Investor or the plan of distribution of the
Conversion Shares; and make all required filings of the Prospectus supplement or such post-effective
amendment as soon as practicable after the Company has received notification of such matters to be
incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; provided, however, that
the Company will not be required to take any action pursuant to this paragraph that would violate
applicable law.
6.          Whenever necessary, prepare and deliver to Investor any required supplement or amendment,
including a post-effective amendment, to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the
Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and file
any other required document, including such reports as may be required to be filed under the
Exchange Act, so that, as thereafter delivered, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
7.          Use reasonable best efforts to cause all Conversion Shares to be listed on the Trading Market
or such other securities exchange or automated quotation system, if any, as is then the principal
securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Common Stock is then listed.
8.          Fully cooperate with the Transfer Agent, Investor and its brokers to facilitate the timely clearing
and delivery of Conversion Shares to be sold pursuant to the Registration Statement free of any
restrictive legends and in such denominations and registered in such names as Investor may
reasonably request, including timely completion and delivery of all forms, documents and instruments
requested by the Transfer Agent or any broker.
VI.          General Provisions.
A.          Notice. Unless a different time of day or method of delivery is specifically provided in the
Transaction Documents, any and all notices or other communications or deliveries required or
permitted to be provided hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed given and effective on the
earliest of: (a) the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile or
electronic mail prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on a Trading Day and an electronic confirmation of
delivery is received by the sender, (b) the next Trading Day after the date of transmission, if such
notice or communication is delivered later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern time or on a day that is not a Trading
Day, (c) the next Trading Day following the date of mailing, if sent by U.S. nationally recognized
overnight courier service, or (d) upon actual receipt by the party to whom such notice is required to be
given. The addresses for such notices and communications are such other address as may be
designated in writing, in the same manner, by such Person.
19
B.          Amendments; Waivers. No provision of this Agreement may be waived or amended except in a
written instrument signed, in the case of an amendment, by Company and Investor or, in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom enforcement of any such waiver is sought. No waiver of any default
with respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement will be deemed to be a
continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other
provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor will any delay or omission of either party to exercise
any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right.
C.          No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise set forth in Section IV.G, this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents will inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto, and is not for the
benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person. Other than the Investor
Parties described in Section IV.G,, a person who is not a party to this Agreement will not have any
rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Law, 2014 of the Cayman Islands to enforce any
term of this Agreement or any Transaction Document.
D.          Fees and Expenses. Company has paid a flat rate documentation fee of $10,000 to Investor’s
counsel incurred in connection with drafting this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party will pay the fees and expenses of its own
advisers, counsel, accountants and other experts, if any, and all other expenses incurred by such
party incident to the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction
Documents. Company acknowledges and agrees that Investor’s counsel solely represents Investor,
and does not represent Company or its interests in connection with the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated thereby. Company will pay all stamp and other taxes and duties, if any,
levied in connection with the sale, issuance and delivery of the Securities to Investor.
E.          Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable in any
respect, the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement will not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the parties will attempt to agree upon a valid and
enforceable provision that is a reasonable substitute therefor, and upon so agreeing, will incorporate
such substitute provision in this Agreement.
F.          Replacement of Certificates. If any certificate or instrument evidencing any Securities is
mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, Company will issue or cause to be issued in exchange and
substitution for and upon cancellation thereof, or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new certificate
or instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Company of such loss,
theft or destruction and customary and reasonable indemnity, if requested. The applicants for a new
certificate or instrument under such circumstances will also pay any reasonable third-party costs
associated with the issuance of such replacement certificates.
20
G.          Governing Law. All matters between the parties, including without limitation questions
concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of the Transaction Documents
will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands,
without regard to the principles of conflicts of law that would require or permit the application of the
laws of any other jurisdiction, except for corporation law matters applicable to Company which will be
governed by the corporate law of its jurisdiction of formation. The parties hereby waive all rights to a
trial by jury. In any action, arbitration or proceeding, including appeal, arising out of or relating to any
of the Transaction Documents or otherwise involving the parties, the prevailing party will be awarded
its reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
the investigation, preparation, prosecution or defense of such action or proceeding.
H.          Arbitration. Any dispute, controversy, claim or action of any kind arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with this Agreement, or in any way involving Company and Investor or their respective
Affiliates, including any issues of arbitrability, will be resolved solely by final and binding arbitration in
English before a retired judge at JAMS International, or its successor, in the Territory of the Virgin
Islands, pursuant to the most expedited and Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available.
Any interim or final award may be entered and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The
final award will include the prevailing party’s reasonable arbitration, expert witness and attorney fees,
costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Investor may in its sole discretion bring an action
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada or the Middle District of Florida in addition to, in lieu
of, or in aid of arbitration.
I.          Remedies. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law,
including recovery of damages, each of Investor and Company will be entitled to specific performance
under the Transaction Documents, and equitable and injunctive relief to prevent any actual or
threatened breach under the Transaction Documents, to the full extent permitted under applicable
laws. Without limitation of the foregoing, Company acknowledges that the rights and benefits of
Investor pursuant to Section I.G.1. of the Debenture are unique and that no adequate remedy exists at
law if Company breaches or fails timely perform any of its obligations thereunder, that it would be
difficult to determine the amount of damages resulting therefrom, that it would cause irreparable injury
to Investor, and that any potential harm to Company would be adequately and fully compensable with
monetary damages. Accordingly, Investor will be entitled to a compulsory remedy of immediate
specific performance, temporary, interim, preliminary and final injunctive relief to enforce the
provisions thereof, including without limitation requiring Company and its transfer agent, attorneys,
officers and directors to immediately take all actions necessary to issue and deliver the number of
Conversion Shares stated by Investor, which requirements will not be stayed for any reason, without
the necessity of posting any bond. Company hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
waives all objections and rights to oppose any motion, application or request by Investor to issue any
number of Conversion Shares, and all rights to stay or appeal any resulting order, and any appeal by
Company or on its behalf will be immediately and automatically dismissed. Nothing provided for in this
provision will limit either party’s ability to recover monetary damages.
21
J.          Payment Set Aside. To the extent that Company makes a payment or payments to Investor
pursuant to any Transaction Document or Investor enforces or exercises its rights thereunder, and
such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from,
disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to Company, a trustee,
receiver or any other person under any law, including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or
federal law, common law or equitable cause of action, then to the extent of any such restoration the
obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied will be revived and continued in full force
and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.
K.          Headings. The headings herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this
Agreement and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof
L.          Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to all provisions of this Agreement.
M.         Survival. The representations and warranties contained herein will survive the Closing and the
delivery of the Securities until the entire Debenture and Warrant issued to Investor have been
converted, redeemed or exercised. Neither party will be under any obligation to update or supplement

2
3.          The Company will not have the power to close or effect a voluntary Deemed Liquidation Event
unless the agreement or plan of merger or consolidation for such transaction provides that no
consideration will be payable to the stockholders of the Company until after payment to Investor in

Company available for distribution an amount with respect to this Debenture equal to the outstanding
Face Value balance, plus an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid Interest thereon (collectively with
the outstanding Face Value balance, the “Liquidation Value”).
F.          Redemption.
1.          Company’s Redemption Option. On the Interest Maturity Date, the Company may redeem all or
any part of this Debenture by paying Investor in cash an amount per share equal to 100% of the
Liquidation Value for the portion redeemed.
2.          Early Redemption. Prior to the Interest Maturity Date, provided that no Trigger Event has
occurred, the Company will have the right at any time upon 30 Trading Days’ prior written notice, in its
sole and absolute discretion, to redeem all or any portion of this Debenture then outstanding by
paying Investor in cash an amount per portion of Debenture (the “Early Redemption Price”) equal to
the sum of the following: (a) 100% of the Face Value of the portion redeemed, plus (b) the Conversion
Premium for the portion redeemed, minus (c) any Interest that has been paid, for the portion of the
Debenture redeemed.

4.          Mandatory Redemption. If the Company determines to liquidate, dissolve or wind-up its
business and affairs, or upon closing or occurrence of any Deemed Liquidation Event, the Company
will prior to or concurrently with the closing, effectuation or occurrence any such action, redeem this
entire Debenture for cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Investor, at the Early Redemption Price set forth in Section I.F.2 if the event is prior to the Interest
Maturity Date, or at the Liquidation Value if the event is on or after the Interest Maturity Date.

outstanding, the Company must deliver written notice (each, a “Redemption Notice”) to Investor
setting forth (a) the portion of this Debenture that the Company is redeeming, (b) the applicable
Interest Rate, Liquidation Value and Early Redemption Price, and (c) the calculation of the amount
paid. In connection with a mandatory redemption, the notice will be delivered as soon as the number of
shares can be determined, and in all other instances at least 30 Trading Days prior to payment. For the
avoidance of doubt, the delivery of a Redemption Notice will not affect Investor’s rights under Section
I.G until after receipt of cash payment by Investor at the required time.
G.          Conversion.
1.          Mechanics of Conversion.
a.          All or any portion of this Debenture may be converted into shares of Common Stock, at any
time or times after the Issuance Date, in the sole and absolute discretion of Investor or, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, the Company; (i) if at the option of Investor, by delivery of one or more
written notices to the Company or its transfer agent (each, a “Investor Conversion Notice”), of the
Investor’s election to convert any or all of this Debenture; or (ii) if at the option of the Company, if the
Equity Conditions are met, delivery of written notice to Investor (each, a “Company Conversion
Notice,” with the Investor Conversion Notice, each a “Conversion Notice,” and with the Redemption
Notice, each an “Initial Notice”), of the Company’s election to convert any or all of this Debenture.
b.          Each Delivery Notice will set forth the amount of Debenture being converted, the minimum
number of Conversion Shares and the amount of Interest and any applicable Conversion Premium
due as of the time the Delivery Notice is given (the “Notice Time”), and the calculation thereof.
b.          If the Company notifies Investor by 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the Trading Day after the Notice
Time that it is paying all or any portion of Interest or Conversion Premium, and actually pays in cash by
the next Trading Day, time being of the essence, the full amount of Interest and Conversion Premium
stated in the Delivery Notice, no further amount will be due with respect thereto.
4
c.          As soon as practicable, and in any event within 1 Trading Day of the Notice Time, time being of
the essence, the Company will do all of the following: (i) transmit the Delivery Notice by facsimile or
electronic mail to the Investor, and to the Company’s transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) with
instructions to comply with the Delivery Notice; (ii) either (A) if the Company is approved through The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), authorize and instruct the credit by the Transfer Agent the
aggregate number of Conversion Shares set forth in the Delivery Notice, to Investor’s or its designee’s
balance account with the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) Program, through its
Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (DWAC) system, or (B) only if the Company is not approved through
DTC, issue and surrender to a common carrier for overnight delivery to the address as specified in the
Delivery Notice a certificate registered in the name of Investor or its designee, for the number of
Conversion Shares set forth in the Delivery Notice, bearing no restrictive legend unless a registration
statement covering the Conversion Shares is not effective and neither Company nor Investor provides
an opinion of counsel to the effect that Conversion Shares may be issued without restrictive legend;
and (iii) if it contends that the Delivery Notice is in any way incorrect, a through explanation of why and
its own calculation, or the Delivery Notice will conclusively be deemed correct for all purposes. The
Company will at all times diligently take or cause to be taken all actions reasonably necessary to cause
the Conversion Shares to be issued as soon as practicable.
d.          If during the Measurement Period the Investor is entitled to receive additional Conversion
Shares with regard to an Initial Notice, Investor may at any time deliver one or more additional written
notices to the Company or its transfer agent (each, an “Additional Notice” and with the Initial Notice,
each a “Delivery Notice”) setting forth the additional number of Conversion Shares to be delivered,
and the calculation thereof.
e.          If the Company for any reason does not issue or cause to be issued to the Investor within 3
Trading Days after the date of a Delivery Notice, the number of Conversion Shares stated in the
Delivery Notice, then, in addition to all other remedies available to the Investor, as liquidated damages
and not as a penalty, the Company will pay in cash to the Investor on each day after such 3rd Trading
Day that the issuance of such Conversion Shares is not timely effected an amount equal to 2% of the
product of (i) the aggregate number of Conversion Shares not issued to the Investor on a timely basis
and to which the Investor is entitled and (ii) the highest Closing Price of the Common Stock between
the date on which the Company should have issued such shares to the Investor and the actual date of
receipt of Conversion Shares by Investor. It is intended that the foregoing will serve to reasonably
compensate Investor for any delay in delivery of Conversion Shares, and not as punishment for any
breach by the Company. The Company acknowledges that the actual damages likely to result from
delay in delivery are difficult to estimate and would be difficult for Investor to prove.
f.          Notwithstanding any other provision: all of the requirements of Section I.F and this Section I.G
are each independent covenants; the Company’s obligations to issue and deliver Conversion Shares
upon any Delivery Notice are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable; any breach or alleged breach of
any representation or agreement, or any violation or alleged violation of any law or regulation, by any
party or any other person will not excuse full and timely performance of any of the Company’s
obligations under these sections; and under no circumstances may the Company seek or obtain any
temporary, interim or preliminary injunctive or equitable relief to prevent or interfere with any issuance
of Conversion Shares to Investor.
5
g.          If for any reason whatsoever Investor does not timely receive the number of Conversion Shares
stated in any Delivery Notice, Investor will be entitled to a compulsory remedy of immediate specific
performance, temporary, interim and, preliminary and final injunctive relief requiring Company and its
transfer agent, attorneys, officers and directors to immediately issue and deliver the number of
Conversion Shares stated by Investor, which requirement will not be stayed for any reason, without
the necessity of posting any bond, and which Company may not seek to stay or appeal.
h.          No fractional shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon conversion of this Debenture, but
rather the Company will issue to Investor scrip or warrants registered on the books of the Company
(certificated or uncertificated) which will entitle Investor to receive a full share upon the surrender of
such scrip or warrants aggregating a full share. The Investor will not be required to deliver the original
Debenture in order to effect a conversion hereunder. The Company will pay any and all taxes which
may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of any Conversion Shares.

Investor Conversion Notice, the Company will (a) satisfy the payment of Interest and Conversion
Premium with respect to the portion converted as provided in Section I.C.2, and (b) issue to Investor a
number of Conversion Shares equal to (i) the Face Value of the portion converted divided by (ii) the

procedures set forth in Section I.G.1.
3.          Company Conversion. Company will have the right to send Investor a Company Conversion

Section I.C.2, and (b) issue to Investor a number of Conversion Shares equal to (i) the Face Value of
the portion converted divided by (ii) the applicable Conversion Price with respect to such portion of
the Debenture; all in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section I.G.1.
4.          Stock Splits. If the Company at any time on or after the filing of this Debenture subdivides (by
any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the applicable Conversion Price,
Adjustment Factor, Maximum Triggering Level, Minimum Triggering Level, and other share based
metrics in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced and the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable will be proportionately increased. If the Company at any time on
or after such Issuance Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more
classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the applicable
Conversion Price, Adjustment Factor, Maximum Triggering Level, Minimum Triggering Level, and other
share based metrics in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased
and the number of Conversion Shares will be proportionately decreased. Any adjustment under this
Section will become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination
becomes effective.

7.          Issuance Limitations.
a.          Beneficial Ownership. Notwithstanding any other provision, at no time may the Company
issue shares of Common Stock to Investor which, when aggregated with all other shares of Common
Stock then deemed beneficially owned by Investor, would result in Investor owning more than 4.99% of
all Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such issuance, as determined in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder; provided, however, that Investor may increase such amount to 9.99% upon not less than
61 days’ prior notice to the Company. To the extent that any conversion would otherwise result in
exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation set forth in the preceding sentence, the Delivery Notice
will specify the number of shares that may be delivered without exceeding the limitation, and any
issuance beyond such extent will be held in abeyance until such time as it would not result in Investor
exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation. No provision of this paragraph may be waived by
Investor or the Company.
b.          Principal Market Regulation. Company will not issue any Conversion Shares under this
Debenture, the Warrant issued to Holder on the Issuance Date, the Stock Purchase Agreement with
Investor dated the Issuance Date, the Series B Preferred Stock or the Common Stock Purchase
Warrant issued to Investor pursuant thereto, if the issuance would exceed the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock the Company may issue without breaching Company’s obligations under
NYSE MKT rules, except that such limitation will not apply following stockholder approval in
accordance with the requirements of NYSE MKT rules or a waiver from NYSE MKT (“Approval”).
8.       Automatic Conversion. On the earlier of (a) the Interest Maturity Date, or (b) the last to occur of (i)
the Acquisition and (ii) the date on which all Equity Conditions (without regard to any Measurement
Period) are met, the entire remaining outstanding Debenture will automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock.
H.          Trigger Event.
1.          Any occurrence of any one or more of the following will constitute a “Trigger Event”:
(a)          Investor does not timely receive the number of Conversion Shares stated in any
Conversion Notice under this Warrant or any other agreement with Investor for any reason
whatsoever, time being of the essence, including without limitation the issuance of restricted shares if
counsel for Company or Investor provides a legal opinion that shares may be issued without
restrictive legend;
(b)          Any violation of or failure to timely perform any covenant or provision of this
Debenture, the Securities Purchase Agreement, any Transaction Document or any other agreement
with Investor, related to payment of cash, registration or delivery of Conversion Shares, time being of
the essence;
(c)          Any violation of or failure to perform any covenant or provision of this Debenture, the
Securities Purchase Agreement, any Transaction Document or any other agreement with Investor,
which in the case of a default that is curable, is not related to payment of cash, registration or delivery
of Conversion Shares, and has not occurred before, is not cured within 5 Trading Days of written
notice thereof;
9
(d)          Any representation or warranty made in the Securities Purchase Agreement, any
Transaction Document or any other agreement with Investor will be untrue, incorrect, or misleading in
any material respect as of the date when made or deemed made;
(e)          The occurrence of any default or event of default under any material agreement, lease,
document or instrument to which the Company or any subsidiary other than CATI Operating LLC, a
Texas limited liability company (“CATI”) is obligated, including without limitation of an aggregate of at
least $500,000 of indebtedness;
(f)          While any Registration Statement is required to be maintained effective, the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement lapses for any reason, including, without limitation, the
issuance of a stop order, or the Registration Statement, or the prospectus contained therein, is
unavailable to Investor sale of all Conversion Shares for any 5 or more Trading Days, which may be
non-consecutive;
(g)          The suspension from trading or the failure of the Common Stock to be trading or listed
on the Trading Market;
(h)           The Company notifies Investor, including without limitation, by way of public
announcement or through any of its attorneys, agents or representatives, of its intention not to
comply, as required, with a Conversion Notice under this Warrant or any other agreement with
Investor, at any time, including without limitation any objection or instruction to its transfer agent not to
comply with any notice from Investor;
(i)          Bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings
for the relief of debtors will be instituted by or against the Company or any subsidiary other than CATI
and, if instituted against the Company or any subsidiary other than CATI by a third party, an order for
relief is entered or the proceedings are not dismissed within 30 days of their initiation;
(j)          The appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee,
trustee, or other similar official of the Company or any subsidiary other than CATI or of any substantial
part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the execution of
a composition of debts, or the occurrence of any other similar federal, state or foreign proceeding, or
the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, the taking of
corporate action by the Company or any subsidiary other than CATI in furtherance of any such action
or the taking of any action by any person to commence a foreclosure sale or any other similar action
under any applicable law;
(k)          A final judgment or judgments for the payment of money aggregating in excess of
$500,000 are rendered against the Company or any of its subsidiaries other than CATI and are not
stayed or satisfied within 30 days of entry;
(l)          The Company does not for any reason timely comply with the reporting requirements of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
including without limitation timely filing when first due all periodic reports;
10
(m)          Any regulatory, administrative or enforcement proceeding is initiated against
Company or any subsidiary (except to the extent an adverse determination would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of
operations or prevent the performance by the Company of any material obligation under the
Transaction Documents); or
(n)          Any material provision of this Debenture will at any time for any reason, other than
pursuant to the express terms thereof, cease to be valid and binding on or enforceable against the
parties thereto, or the validity or enforceability thereof will be contested by any party thereto, or a
proceeding will be commenced by the Company or any subsidiary or any governmental authority
having jurisdiction over any of them, seeking to establish the invalidity or unenforceability thereof, or
the Company or any subsidiary denies that it has any liability or obligation purported to be created
under this Debenture.
2.          It is intended that all adjustments made following a Trigger Event will serve to reasonably
compensate Investor for the consequences and increased risk following a Trigger Event, and not as a
penalty or punishment for any breach by the Company. The Company acknowledges that the actual
damages likely to result from a Trigger Event are difficult to estimate and would be difficult for Investor
to prove.
II.          General.
A.          Notices. Any and all notices to the Company will be addressed to the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer at the Company’s principal place of business on file with the Secretary of State of the

ClearTrust, LLC
16540 Pointe Village Drive #206
Lutz, FL 33558
Re:        Lucas Energy, Inc.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
In accordance with the Securities Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”), dated April 6, 2016, by and
between Lucas Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Company”), and ____________________
(“Investor”), pursuant to which Company is required to reserve, issue and deliver shares (“Shares”) of
Company’s Common Stock (“Common Stock”) upon conversion of the Debenture and exercise of the
Warrant purchased by Investor, this will serve as our irrevocable, absolute and unconditional
instruction, authorization and direction to you to (a) immediately reserve 500,000 Shares for issuance
to Investor, (b) upon receipt of written notice, from either Company or from Investor with a copy to
Company, reserve any additional Shares requested to be reserved by either Company or Investor, and
(c) whenever either Company or Investor delivers written instructions to you with a copy of a Delivery
Notice, immediately issue the Shares requested by either Company or Investor. Capitalized terms used
herein without definition will have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.
The Shares will remain in the created reserve until the earlier of their issuance or such date as both
Investor and Company provide written instructions that the Shares or any part of them may be taken
out of the reserve and will no longer be subject to the terms of these instructions.
Upon your receipt of an instruction from either Company or Investor, you are to process the
instruction without delay in accordance with your Routine or Rush procedures, as specified, and use
your commercially reasonable best efforts to issue and make available for delivery to Investor the
number of Shares set forth in the Delivery Notice as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event
within 3 trading days after receipt of the conversion notice, either: (a) only if you receive written notice
that the Registration Statement is not effective and neither Company nor Investor provides an opinion
of counsel to the effect that the Shares may be issued without restrictive legend, by delivering by
overnight carrier to the address specified in the notice a physical certificate bearing a restrictive
legend; (b) only if Company is not approved through DTC, and either Company or Investor provides
an opinion of counsel to the effect that the Shares may be issued without restrictive legend, by
delivering by overnight carrier to the address specified in the notice a physical certificate bearing no
restrictive legend, by delivering by overnight carrier to the address specified in the notice a physical
certificate bearing no restrictive legend; or (c) if Company is DTC eligible and either Company or
Investor provides an opinion of counsel to the effect that the Shares may be issued without restrictive
legend, by issuing pursuant to the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) Program, crediting
to Investor’s or its designee’s balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal At Custodian
(DWAC) system, and notifying Investor to cause its bank or broker to initiate the transaction through
the DWAC system.
Company and Investor understand that in order to issue unrestricted stock ClearTrust LLC will need to
be able to verify on www.sec.gov that a valid registration of the shares is available. If a registration is
not effective the following items will be required to issue unrestricted shares pursuant an exemption to
registration: (a) an opinion of counsel of Company or Investor, in form, substance and scope
customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions (and reasonably satisfactory to the
transfer agent in accordance with standard industry custom and practice), (b) a seller’s representation
letter, (c) a copy of the Debenture or Warrant, and (d) proof of payment of payment for the security.
Company hereby confirms that the Shares should not be subject to any stop-transfer restrictions and
will otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of Company, and if the Shares are
certificated, the certificates will not bear any legend restricting transfer of the Shares represented
thereby, if a legal opinion is provided as set forth in the preceding paragraph.
Company hereby confirms that no instructions other than as contemplated herein will or may be given
to you by Company with respect to the Shares. Company may not instruct you to disregard any
reserve or Delivery Notice and you may not do so. You are to comply promptly with any Delivery
Notice or share reservation notice received from Investor, notwithstanding any contrary instructions
from Company.
Company will not replace you as Company’s transfer agent, until a reputable registered transfer agent
has agreed in writing to serve as Company’s transfer agent and to be bound by all terms and
conditions of this letter agreement. In the event that you resign as Company’s transfer agent,
Company will engage a suitable replacement reputable registered transfer agent that will agree to
serve as transfer agent for Company and be bound by the terms and conditions of these irrevocable
instructions as soon as practicable and in any event within 3 Trading Days. You may not disclose any
information, deliver any documents, or transfer any files to any successor transfer agent until after
Investor acknowledges in writing that a suitable successor transfer agent has agreed in writing to be
bound by the terms and conditions of these instructions.
Company and Investor understand that ClearTrust, LLC will need payment of transfer agent fees prior
to completing conversion(s). ClearTrust, LLC will not be responsible for processing conversions prior
to payment of transfer fees not to exceed $150.00 plus shipping fees per conversion request for
Routine processing (within 3 business days) or $250.00 plus shipping fees for Rush processing
(within 24 hours).
Investor and Company understand that ClearTrust, LLC will not be required to perform any issuances
or transfers of shares if (a) the request violates, or would be in violation of, any terms of the Transfer
Agent Agreement, (b) such an issuance or transfer of shares be in violation of any state or federal
securities laws or regulation or (c) the issuance or transfer of shares be prohibited or stopped as
required or directed by a court order. If the Company informs you that there is a court order stopping
issuances and provides you with a certified copy of the order, once received, you will not be obligated
to perform any issuances related to the Note and this agreement that are prohibited by the court order.

instructions does not and will not prohibit you from satisfying any and all fiduciary responsibilities and
duties you may owe to Company.

liability, damage, claim or expense (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys)
incurred by or asserted against you or any of them arising out of or in connection with complying with
any Delivery Notice or any other instruction from Investor, except that Company will not be liable
hereunder for any failure by you to comply with a Delivery Notice or any other instructions from
Investor, or as to amounts in respect of which it is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be due solely to your fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. You are entitled to
indemnity and will have no liability to Company in respect of any action taken in compliance with any
Delivery Notice or instruction from Investor, notwithstanding any contrary instructions from Company.
Accordingly, you will have no duty or obligation to confirm the accuracy of any calculations or
information set forth in any Delivery Notice submitted by the Investor.

the instructions set forth herein may be made without the prior written consent of Investor. The above

transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Investor.
iii.        The Premium Rate will adjust downward by an amount equal to the Spread
Adjustment for each amount, if any, equal to the Adjustment Factor that the Measuring Metric rises
above the Maximum Triggering Level, down to a minimum of 0.0%.
iv.        The Premium Rate will adjust upward by an amount equal to the Spread
Adjustment for each amount, if any, equal to the Adjustment Factor that the Measuring Metric falls
below the Minimum Triggering Level, up to a maximum of 24.95%. In addition, the Premium Rate will
adjust upward by 10.0% following the occurrence of any Trigger Event.
v.         The adjusted Premium Rate used for calculation of the Liquidation Value,
Conversion Premium, Early Redemption Price and Premium, as applicable, and the amount of
Premium owed will be calculated and determined based upon the Measuring Metric at close of the
Trading Market immediately prior to the Notice Time.
4.          Mandatory Redemption. If the Company determines to liquidate, dissolve or wind-up its
business and affairs, the Company will prior to or concurrently with the closing, effectuation or
occurrence any such action, redeem the entire unexercised portion of this Warrant for cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Investor, at the Early Redemption
Price set forth in Section I.F.2 if the event is prior to the Warrant Maturity Date, or at the Liquidation
Value if the event is on or after the Warrant Maturity Date.
3
5.          Mechanics of Redemption. In order to redeem all or any portion of the Warrant then
outstanding, the Company must deliver written notice (each, a “Redemption Notice”) to Investor
setting forth (a) the portion of this Warrant that the Company is redeeming, (b) the applicable Premium
Rate, Liquidation Value and Early Redemption Price, and (c) the calculation of the amount paid. In
connection with a mandatory redemption, the notice will be delivered as soon as the number of shares
can be determined, and in all other instances at least 30 Trading Days prior to payment. For the
avoidance of doubt, the delivery of a Redemption Notice will not affect Investor’s rights under Section
I.G until after receipt of cash payment by Investor at the required time.
G.            Exercise.
1.         Mechanics of Exercise.
a.          Promptly upon the occurrence of the automatic exercise provided for in Section I.B., Investor
will deliver a written notice to the Company and its transfer agent (“Conversion Notice” and with the
Redemption Notice, each an “Initial Notice”) of the automatic conversion of this Warrant.
b.          Each Delivery Notice will set forth the amount of Warrant being converted, the minimum
number of Conversion Shares and the amount of Premium and any applicable Conversion Premium
due as of the time the Delivery Notice is given (the “Notice Time”), and the calculation thereof.
b.          If the Company notifies Investor by 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the Trading Day after the Notice
Time that it is paying all or any portion of Premium or Conversion Premium, and actually pays in cash
by the next Trading Day, time being of the essence, the full amount of Premium and Conversion
Premium stated in the Delivery Notice, no further amount will be due with respect thereto.
c.          As soon as practicable, and in any event within 1 Trading Day of the Notice Time, time being of
the essence, the Company will do all of the following: (i) transmit the Delivery Notice by facsimile or
electronic mail to the Investor, and to the Company’s transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) with
instructions to comply with the Delivery Notice; (ii) either (A) if the Company is approved through The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), authorize and instruct the credit by the Transfer Agent the
aggregate number of Conversion Shares set forth in the Delivery Notice, to Investor’s or its designee’s
balance account with the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) Program, through its
Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (DWAC) system, or (B) only if the Company is not approved through
DTC, issue and surrender to a common carrier for overnight delivery to the address as specified in the
Delivery Notice a certificate registered in the name of Investor or its designee, for the number of
Conversion Shares set forth in the Delivery Notice, bearing no restrictive legend unless a registration
statement covering the Conversion Shares is not effective and neither Company nor Investor provides
an opinion of counsel to the effect that Conversion Shares may be issued without restrictive legend;
and (iii) if it contends that the Delivery Notice is in any way incorrect, a through explanation of why and
its own calculation, or the Delivery Notice will conclusively be deemed correct for all purposes. The
Company will at all times diligently take or cause to be taken all actions reasonably necessary to cause
the Conversion Shares to be issued as soon as practicable.
4
d.          If during the Measurement Period the Investor is entitled to receive additional Conversion
Shares with regard to an Initial Notice, Investor may at any time deliver one or more additional written
notices to the Company or its transfer agent (each, an “Additional Notice” and with the Initial Notice,
each a “Delivery Notice”) setting forth the additional number of Conversion Shares to be delivered,
and the calculation thereof.
e.          If the Company for any reason does not issue or cause to be issued to the Investor within 3
Trading Days after the date of a Delivery Notice, the number of Conversion Shares stated in the
Delivery Notice, then, in addition to all other remedies available to the Investor, as liquidated damages
and not as a penalty, the Company will pay in cash to the Investor on each day after such 3rd Trading
Day that the issuance of such Conversion Shares is not timely effected an amount equal to 2% of the
product of (i) the aggregate number of Conversion Shares not issued to the Investor on a timely basis
and to which the Investor is entitled and (ii) the highest Closing Price of the Common Stock between
the date on which the Company should have issued such shares to the Investor and the actual date of
receipt of Conversion Shares by Investor. It is intended that the foregoing will serve to reasonably
compensate Investor for any delay in delivery of Conversion Shares, and not as punishment for any
breach by the Company. The Company acknowledges that the actual damages likely to result from
delay in delivery are difficult to estimate and would be difficult for Investor to prove.
f.          Notwithstanding any other provision: all of the requirements of Section I.F and this Section I.G
are each independent covenants; the Company’s obligations to issue and deliver Conversion Shares
upon any Delivery Notice are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable; any breach or alleged breach of
any representation or agreement, or any violation or alleged violation of any law or regulation, by any
party or any other person will not excuse full and timely performance of any of the Company’s
obligations under these sections; and under no circumstances may the Company seek or obtain any
temporary, interim or preliminary injunctive or equitable relief to prevent or interfere with any issuance
of Conversion Shares to Investor.
g.          If for any reason whatsoever Investor does not timely receive the number of Conversion
Shares stated in any Delivery Notice, Investor will be entitled to a compulsory remedy of immediate
specific performance, temporary, interim and, preliminary and final injunctive relief requiring Company
and its transfer agent, attorneys, officers and directors to immediately issue and deliver the number of
Conversion Shares stated by Investor, which requirement will not be stayed for any reason, without
the necessity of posting any bond, and which Company may not seek to stay or appeal.
h.          No fractional shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon conversion of this Warrant, but
rather the Company will issue to Investor scrip or warrants registered on the books of the Company
(certificated or uncertificated) which will entitle Investor to receive a full share upon the surrender of
such scrip or warrants aggregating a full share. The Investor will not be required to deliver the original
Warrant in order to effect a conversion hereunder. The Company will pay any and all taxes which may
be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of any Conversion Shares.
2.           Exercise. Upon receipt of the Conversion Notice, the Company will (a) satisfy the payment of
Premium and Conversion Premium as provided in Section I.F.3.a.ii, and (b) issue to Investor a number
of Conversion Shares equal to (i) the Purchase Price of the portion converted divided by (ii) the
applicable Conversion Price with respect to such portion of the Warrant; all in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section I.G.1.
5
3.         Stock Splits. If the Company at any time on or after the filing of this Warrant subdivides (by any
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares
of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the applicable Conversion Price, Adjustment
Factor, Maximum Triggering Level, Minimum Triggering Level, and other share based metrics in effect
immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced and the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable will be proportionately increased. If the Company at any time on or after such
Issuance Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the applicable Conversion
Price, Adjustment Factor, Maximum Triggering Level, Minimum Triggering Level, and other share
based metrics in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased and
the number of Conversion Shares will be proportionately decreased. Any adjustment under this
Section will become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination
becomes effective.

Common Stock with respect to rights to receive notices, reports and audited accounts from the
Company and with respect to attending stockholder meetings.

restrictive legend;
8
(b)          Any violation of or failure to timely perform any covenant or provision of

comply, as required, with a Conversion Notice under this Debenture or any other agreement with
Investor, at any time, including without limitation any objection or instruction to its transfer agent not to
comply with any notice from Investor;
(i)           Bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or liquidation proceedings or
other proceedings for the relief of debtors will be instituted by or against the Company or any
subsidiary other than CATI and, if instituted against the Company or any subsidiary other than CATI

Transaction Documents); or
(n)          Any material provision of this Warrant will at any time for any reason,
other than pursuant to the express terms thereof, cease to be valid and binding on or enforceable
against the parties thereto, or the validity or enforceability thereof will be contested by any party
thereto, or a proceeding will be commenced by the Company or any subsidiary or any governmental
authority having jurisdiction over any of them, seeking to establish the invalidity or unenforceability
thereof, or the Company or any subsidiary denies that it has any liability or obligation purported to be
created under this Warrant.
2.          It is intended that all adjustments made following a Trigger Event will serve to
reasonably compensate Investor for the consequences and increased risk following a Trigger Event,
and not as a penalty or punishment for any breach by the Company. The Company acknowledges that

for Investor to prove.

1.          Organization and Qualification. Company and each Subsidiary is an entity duly incorporated or
otherwise organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, as applicable, with the requisite power and authority to own and use its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted, except where the failure to
do so would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Company nor
any Subsidiary is in violation or default of any of the provisions of its respective certificate or articles
of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational or charter documents, except as would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each of Company and each Subsidiary is duly
qualified to conduct business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other entity in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted or property owned by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, as the case
may be, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and there is no
completed, pending or, to Company’s knowledge, threatened or contemplated proceeding in any such
jurisdiction revoking, limiting or curtailing or seeking to revoke, limit or curtail such power and
authority or qualification.

2.          Authorization; Enforcement. Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into and to consummate the transactions contemplated by each of the Transaction Documents and
otherwise to carry out its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The execution and delivery of each of
the Transaction Documents by Company and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
Company and no further consent or action is required by Company. Each of the Transaction
Documents has been, or upon delivery will be, duly executed by Company and, when delivered in
accordance with the terms hereof, will constitute the valid and binding obligation of Company,
enforceable against Company in accordance with its terms, except (a) as limited by general equitable
principles and applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of
general application affecting enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, (b) as limited by laws relating
to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and (c) insofar
as indemnification and contribution provisions may be limited by applicable law.
3.          No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents by
Company, the issuance and sale of the Securities and the consummation by Company of the other
transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not (a) conflict with or violate any provision of
Company’s or any Subsidiary’s certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
or charter documents, (b) conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Company or any Subsidiary, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) of, any material
agreement, credit facility, debt or other instrument (evidencing Company or Subsidiary debt or
otherwise) or other understanding to which Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which any
property or asset of Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, (c) conflict with or result in a
violation of any material law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, injunction, decree or other restriction of

federal and state securities laws and regulations), or by which any material property or asset of
Company or a Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (d) conflict with or violate the terms of any material
agreement by which Company or any Subsidiary is bound or to which any property or asset of
Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected; except in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d),
such as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
4.          Litigation. There is no action, suit, inquiry, notice of violation, proceeding or investigation
completed, pending or, to Company’s knowledge, threatened or contemplated against or affecting
Company, any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties before or by any court, arbitrator,
governmental or administrative agency or regulatory authority (federal, state, county, local or foreign)
(collectively, an “Action”), which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or challenge the
legality, validity or enforceability of any of the Transaction Documents or the sale, issuance, listing,
trading or resale of the Conversion Shares on the Trading Market hereunder. The Commission has not
issued any stop order or other order suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement filed
by Company or any Subsidiary under the Exchange Act or the Act.

to be made or obtained under the applicable Trading Market rules in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of which has been, or if not yet required to be filed will be, timely filed.

attorneys with any information that constitutes or might constitute material, non-public information,
including without limitation this Agreement and the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules hereto, (b) no
information contained in the Disclosure Schedules constitutes material non-public information and (c)
there is no adverse material information regarding Company that has not been publicly disclosed prior
to the Effective Date. Company understands and confirms that Investor will rely on the foregoing
representations and covenants in effecting transactions in securities of Company. All disclosure

or their behalf has, directly or indirectly, made any offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers

provisions other than Approval, including, without limitation, under the rules and regulations of the
Trading Market.

10.       Section 5 Compliance. No representation or warranty or other statement made by Company in
the Transaction Documents contains any untrue statement or omits to state a material fact necessary
to make any of them, in light of the circumstances in which it was made, not misleading. Company is
not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, when consummated, to violate Section 5 of the Act or other federal or state
securities laws or regulations.
11.       Investment Company. Company is not, and is not an Affiliate of, and immediately after receipt of
payment for the Securities, will not be or be an Affiliate of, an “investment company” within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Company will conduct its business in a
manner so that it will not become subject to the Investment Company Act.
12.       Acknowledgments Regarding Investor. Company’s decision to enter into this Agreement has
been based solely on the independent evaluation by Company and its representatives, and Company
acknowledges and agrees that:

knowledge, 10% or greater shareholder or otherwise an affiliate of Company as defined under Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act;
b.          Investor does not make or has not made any representations, warranties or agreements with
respect to the Securities, this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby other than those
specifically set forth in Section III.C below;
c.          The conversion of Preferred Shares, exercise of the Warrant, and resale of Conversion Shares
will result in dilution, which may be substantial; the number of Conversion Shares will increase in
certain circumstances; and Company’s obligation to issue and deliver Conversion Shares in
accordance with this Agreement, the Certificate of Designations and the Warrant is absolute and
unconditional regardless of the dilutive effect that such issuances may have; and
d.          Investor is acting solely in the capacity of arm’s length purchaser with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; neither Investor nor any of its Affiliates, agents
or representatives has or is acting as a legal, financial, investment, accounting, tax or other advisor to
Company, or fiduciary of Company, or in any similar capacity; neither Investor nor any of its Affiliates,
agents or representatives has provided any legal, financial, investment, accounting, tax or other
advice to Company; any statement made in connection with this Agreement or the transactions

Company, any director, executive officer, other officer of Company participating in the offering, or any
beneficial owner of 20% or more of Company’s outstanding voting equity securities is subject to any
bad actor disqualification as provided in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D, and Company is not aware of
any facts or circumstances that, with the passage of time, would reasonably be expected to cause
such disqualification.

B.          Representations Regarding Company. Except as set forth in any Public Reports or attached
exhibits as of the Effective Date, or under the corresponding section of the Disclosure Schedules, if
any, Company hereby represents and warrants to, and as applicable covenants with, Investor as of the
Closing:
1.          Capitalization. The capitalization of the Company as of the Effective Date is as described in the
Public Reports. No Person has any right of first refusal, preemptive right, right of participation, or any
similar right to participate in the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents which has

Warrant and the issuance of Conversion Shares, there are no outstanding options, warrants, script
rights to subscribe to, calls or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities,

for or acquire, any shares of Common Stock, or contracts, commitments, understandings or
arrangements by which Company or any Subsidiary is or may become bound to issue additional
shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock.
The issuance and sale of the Securities will not obligate Company to issue shares of Common Stock
or other securities to any Person, other than Investor, and will not result in a right of any holder of
Company securities to adjust the exercise, conversion, exchange, or reset price under such securities.
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Company are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, have been issued in material compliance with all federal and state securities laws, and
none of such outstanding shares was issued in violation of any preemptive rights or similar rights to
subscribe for or purchase securities. No further approval or authorization of any stockholder, the
Board of Directors of Company or others is required for the issuance and sale of the Securities, other
than Approval. There are no stockholders agreements, voting agreements or other similar agreements
with respect to Company’s capital stock to which Company is a party or, to the knowledge of
Company, between or among any of Company’s stockholders.
2.          Subsidiaries. All of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Company are set forth in the Public
Reports or the corresponding section of the Disclosure Schedules. Company owns, directly or
indirectly, all of the capital stock or other equity interests of each Subsidiary, and all of such directly or
indirectly owned capital stock or other equity interests are owned free and clear of any Liens. All the

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of
Company included in the Public Reports, as amended, comply in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the rules and regulations of the Commission with respect thereto as in

except as may be otherwise specified in such financial statements or the notes thereto and except that
unaudited financial statements may not contain all footnotes required by GAAP, and fairly present in
all material respects the financial position of Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for
the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal, immaterial, year-end audit adjustments.
4.          Material Changes. Since the end of the most recent year for which an Annual Report on Form
10-K has been filed with the Commission, (a) there has been no event, occurrence or development that

not incurred any liabilities (contingent or otherwise) other than (i) trade payables and accrued

contemplated, which would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
Company nor any Subsidiary, nor any director or officer thereof, nor to the knowledge of Company
any greater than 5% shareholder or any director or officer thereof, is or has been the subject of any
Action involving a claim of violation of or liability under federal or state securities laws or a claim of
breach of fiduciary duty. There has not been, is not pending, and to Company’s knowledge, there is
not threatened or contemplated, any investigation by the Commission involving Company or any
current or former director or officer of Company, or to the knowledge of Company greater than 5%
shareholder of Company.
6.          No Bankruptcy. There has not been any petition or application filed, or any judicial or
administrative proceeding commenced which has not been discharged, by or against the Company or
any Subsidiary or with respect to any of the properties or assets of Company or any Subsidiary under
any applicable law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, compromise,
arrangement of debt, creditors’ rights and no assignment has been made by the Company or any
Subsidiary for the benefit of creditors.
8
7.          Labor Relations. No material labor dispute exists or, to the knowledge of Company, is imminent
with respect to any of the employees of Company, which would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.
8.          Compliance. Neither Company nor any Subsidiary (a) is in material default under or in material
violation of (and no event has occurred that has not been waived that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would result in a default by Company or any Subsidiary under), nor has Company or any
Subsidiary received notice of a claim that it is in material default under or that it is in material violation
of, any indenture, loan or credit agreement or any other similar agreement or instrument to which it is a

waived), (b) is in violation of any order of any court, arbitrator or governmental body, or (c) is or has
been in violation of any statute, rule or regulation of any governmental authority, including without
limitation all foreign, federal, state and local laws applicable to its business, except in each case as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
9.          Regulatory Permits. Company and each Subsidiary possess all certificates, authorizations and
permits issued by the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory authorities necessary to
conduct their respective businesses as described in the Public Reports, except where the failure to
possess such permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect (“Material Permits”), and neither Company nor any Subsidiary has received
any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any Material Permit.
10.       Title to Assets. Company and each Subsidiary have good and marketable title in fee simple to all
real property owned by them that is material to the business of Company and each Subsidiary and
good and marketable title in all personal property owned by them that is material to the business of
Company and each Subsidiary, in each case free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens that do not
materially affect the value of such property and do not materially interfere with the use made and
proposed to be made of such property by Company and each Subsidiary and Liens for the payment of
federal, state or other taxes, the payment of which is neither delinquent nor subject to penalties. Any
real property and facilities held under lease by Company and each Subsidiary are held by them under
valid, subsisting and enforceable leases of which Company and each Subsidiary are in compliance.
11.       Patents and Trademarks. Company and each Subsidiary have, or have rights to use, all patents,
patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications, service marks, trade names, copyrights,
licenses and other similar rights that are necessary or material for use in connection with their
respective businesses as described in the Public Reports and which the failure to so have would have
a Material Adverse Effect (collectively, “Intellectual Property Rights”). Neither Company nor any
Subsidiary has received a written notice that the Intellectual Property Rights used by Company or any
Subsidiary violates or infringes upon the rights of any Person. To the knowledge of Company, all such
Intellectual Property Rights are enforceable and there is no existing infringement by another Person of
any of the Intellectual Property Rights of Company or each Subsidiary.

responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary in the
businesses in which Company and each Subsidiary are engaged, including but not limited to directors
and officers insurance coverage at least equal to the Purchase Amount. To Company’s knowledge,
such insurance contracts and policies are accurate and complete in all material respects. Neither
Company nor any Subsidiary has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing
insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar
insurers as may be necessary to continue its business without an increase in cost that would
constitute a Material Adverse Effect.
13.       Transactions with Affiliates and Employees. None of the officers or directors of Company and,
to the knowledge of Company, none of the employees of Company is presently a party to any
transaction with Company or any Subsidiary (other than for services as employees, officers and
directors), including any contract, agreement or other arrangement providing for the furnishing of
services to or by, providing for rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise requiring
payments to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to the knowledge of Company, any
entity in which any officer, director, or any such employee has a substantial interest or is an officer,
director, trustee or partner, in each case in excess of $120,000 other than (i) for payment of salary or
consulting fees for services rendered, (ii) reimbursement for expenses incurred on behalf of Company
and (iii) for other employee benefits, including stock option agreements under any equity incentive
plan of Company.

Company presented in its most recently filed periodic report under the Exchange Act the conclusions
of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
based on their evaluations as of the evaluation date. Since the date of the most recently filed Public
Report, there have been no significant changes in Company’s internal accounting controls or its
disclosure controls and procedures or, to Company’s knowledge, in other factors that could materially
affect Company’s internal accounting controls or its disclosure controls and procedures.
15.       Certain Fees. No brokerage or finder’s fees or commissions are or will be payable to any broker,
financial advisor or consultant, finder, placement agent, investment banker, bank or other Person with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision,
Investor will have no obligation with respect to any fees or with respect to any claims made by or on
behalf of other Persons for fees of a type contemplated in this section that may be due in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.
16.       Registration Rights. No Person has any right to cause Company to effect the registration under
the Act of any securities of Company.
17.       Listing and Maintenance Requirements. The Common Stock is registered pursuant to Section
12 of the Exchange Act, and Company has taken no action designed to, or which to its knowledge is
likely to have the effect of, terminating the registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act
nor has Company received any notification that the Commission is contemplating terminating such
registration. Company has not, in the 12 months preceding the Effective Date, received notice from
any Trading Market on which the Common Stock is or has been listed or quoted to the effect that
Company is not in compliance with the listing or maintenance requirements of such Trading Market.
Company is, and has no reason to believe that it will not in the foreseeable future continue to be, in
compliance with all such listing and maintenance requirements.
10
18.       Application of Takeover Protections. Company and its Board of Directors have taken all
necessary action, if any, in order to render inapplicable any control share acquisition, business
combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-
takeover provision under Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (or similar charter documents) or the
laws of its state of incorporation that is or could become applicable to Investor as a result of Investor
and Company fulfilling their obligations or exercising their rights under the Transaction Documents,
including without limitation Company’s issuance of the Conversion Shares and Investor’s ownership
of the Conversion Shares.
19.       Tax Status. Company and each of its Subsidiaries has made or filed all federal, state and foreign
income and all other tax returns, reports and declarations required by any jurisdiction to which it is
subject (unless and only to the extent that Company and each of its Subsidiaries has set aside on its
books provisions reasonably adequate for the payment of all unpaid and unreported taxes). Company
has not executed a waiver with respect to the statute of limitations relating to the assessment or
collection of any foreign, federal, statute or local tax. None of Company’s tax returns is presently being
audited by any taxing authority. Company would not be classified as a PFIC for its most recently
completed taxable year, and does not expect to be classified as a PFIC for its current taxable year.

employees or to any foreign or domestic political parties or campaigns from corporate funds, (c) failed
to disclose fully any contribution made by Company, or made by any person acting on its behalf of
which Company is aware, which is in violation of law, or (d) violated in any material respect any
provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended.
21.       Accountants. Company’s accountants are set forth in the Public Reports and such accountants
are an independent registered public accounting firm.

Company or any Subsidiary, except such as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.
11
24.          Computer and Technology Security. Company has taken all reasonable steps to safeguard
the information technology systems utilized in the operation of the business of Company, including
the implementation of procedures to minimize the risk that such information technology systems have
any disabling codes or instructions, timer, copy protection device, clock, counter or other limiting
design or routing and any back door, virus, malicious code or other software routines or hardware
components that in each case permit unauthorized access or the unauthorized disablement or
unauthorized erasure of data or other software by a third party, and, to Company’s knowledge, to date
there have been no successful unauthorized intrusions or breaches of the security of the information
technology systems.

Company as of the Closing as follows:
1.          Organization; Authority. Investor is an entity validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization with full right, company power and authority to enter into and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and otherwise to carry
out its obligations thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance by Investor of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary company or
similar action on the part of Investor. Each Transaction Document to which it is a party has been, or
will be, duly executed by Investor, and when delivered by Investor in accordance with the terms hereof,
will constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of Investor, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, except (a) as limited by general equitable principles and applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally, (b) as limited by laws relating to the availability of specific performance,
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, and (c) insofar as indemnification and contribution
provisions may be limited by applicable law.

it is: (a) an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Act; (b) not a registered broker-
dealer, member of FINRA, or an affiliate thereof; and (c) not a U.S. Person and not acquiring the
Securities for the account or beneficial ownership of any U.S. Person.
3.          Experience of Investor. Investor, either alone or together with its representatives, has such
knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the Shares, and has so evaluated the
merits and risks of such investment. Investor is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the
Shares and, at the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such investment.
12
4.          Ownership. Investor is acquiring the Preferred Shares and Warrant as principal for its own
account. Investor will not engage in hedging transactions with regard to the Securities unless in
compliance with the Act. Investor will not resell, transfer or assign the Preferred Shares or Warrant,

Common Stock, (b) has ever engaged in any Short Sales of the Common Stock, (c) has engaged in
any hedging transactions with regard to the Common Stock prior to the Effective Date, or (d) has
traded any securities of Company within 30 days prior to the Effective Date.

diligence with respect to any Registration Statement or Prospectus in which the name of Investor or
any Affiliate of Investor appears.
B.          Furnishing of Information. As long as Investor owns any Securities, Company will timely file all
reports required to be filed by Company after the Effective Date pursuant to the Exchange Act. As long
as Investor owns any Securities, Company will prepare and make publicly available such information
as is required for Investor to sell its Conversion Shares under Rule 144. Company further covenants
that, as long as Investor owns any Securities, Company will take such further action as Investor may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable Investor to sell its Conversion
Shares without registration under the Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144.
C.          Integration. Company will not sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in
respect of any security, as defined in Section 2 of the Act, that would be integrated with the offer or
sale of the Securities to Investor for purposes of the rules and regulations of any Trading Market such
that it would require stockholder approval prior to the closing of such other transaction, unless
stockholder approval is obtained before the closing of such subsequent transaction.
D.          Disclosure and Publicity. Company will provide to Investor for review and approval prior to
issuing any current report, press release, public statement or communication with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.
E.          Shareholders Rights Plan. No claim will be made or enforced by Company or, to the knowledge
of Company, any other Person that Investor is an “Acquiring Person” under any shareholders rights
plan or similar plan or arrangement in effect or hereafter adopted by Company, or that Investor could
be deemed to trigger the provisions of any such plan or arrangement, in either such case, by virtue of
receiving the Securities under the Transaction Documents or under any other agreement between
Company and Investor. Company will conduct its business in a manner so that it will not become
subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
13
F.          No Non-Public Information. Company covenants and agrees that neither it nor any other
Person acting on its behalf will, provide Investor or its agents or counsel with any information that
Company believes or reasonably should believe will constitute material non-public information after
Closing. On and after Closing, neither Investor nor any Affiliate of Investor will have any duty of trust or
confidence that is owed directly, indirectly, or derivatively, to Company or the stockholders of
Company, or to any other Person who is the source of material non-public information regarding
Company. Company understands and confirms that Investor will be relying on the foregoing in
effecting transactions in securities of Company, including without limitation sales of the Conversion
Shares.
G.          Indemnification of Investor.
1.          Obligation to Indemnify. Subject to the provisions of this Section IV.G, Company will indemnify
and hold Investor, its Affiliates, managers and advisors, and each of their officers, directors,
shareholders, partners, employees, representatives, agents and attorneys, and any person who
controls Investor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act
(collectively, “Investor Parties” and each a “Investor Party”), harmless from any and all losses,
liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, reasonable costs and expenses, including all
judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of
investigation (collectively, “Losses”) that any Investor Party may suffer or incur as a result of or
relating to (a) any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by
Company in this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents, (b) any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus,
Prospectus Supplement, or any information incorporated by reference therein, or arising out of or
based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) any action by a creditor or stockholder of Company who is not an Affiliate of an Investor Party,
challenging the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents; provided, however, that
Company will not be obligated to indemnify any Investor Party for any Losses finally adjudicated to be
caused solely by (i) a false statement of material fact contained within written information provided by
such Investor Party expressly for the purpose of including it in the applicable Registration Statement,
Prospectus, Prospectus Supplement, or (ii) such Investor Party’s unexcused material breach of an
express provision of this Agreement or another Transaction Document.
2.          Procedure for Indemnification. If any action will be brought against an Investor Party in respect
of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Investor Party will promptly notify
Company in writing, and Company will have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its
own choosing. Investor Parties will have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and
participate in the defense thereof, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the
expense of Investor Parties except to the extent that (a) the employment thereof has been specifically
authorized by Company in writing, (b) Company has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume
such defense and to employ counsel or (c) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of such
separate counsel, a material conflict with respect to the dispute in question on any material issue
between the position of Company and the position of Investor Parties such that it would be
inappropriate for one counsel to represent Company and Investor Parties. Company will not be liable
to Investor Parties under this Agreement (i) for any settlement by an Investor Party effected without
Company’s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (ii) to the
extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is either attributable to Investor’s
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by Investor in this
Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents. In no event will the Company be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses for more than one separate firm of attorneys (plus local counsel as
applicable) to represent all Investor Parties.
14
3.          Other than the liability of Investor to Company for uncured material breach of the express
provisions of this Agreement, no Investor Party will have any liability to Company or any Person
asserting claims on behalf of or in right of Company as a result of acquiring the Securities under this
Agreement.
H.          Reservation of Shares. Company will at all times maintain a reserve from its duly authorized
Common Stock for issuance pursuant to the Transaction Documents authorized shares of Common
Stock in an amount equal to thrice the number of shares sufficient to immediately issue all Conversion
Shares potentially issuable at such time.
I.          Activity Restrictions. For so long as Investor or any of its Affiliates holds any Securities, neither
Investor nor any Affiliate will: (1) vote any shares of Common Stock owned or controlled by it, sign or
solicit any proxies, attend or be present at a shareholder meeting for purposes of determining a
quorum, or seek to advise or influence any Person with respect to any voting securities of Company;
(2) engage or participate in any actions, plans or proposals which relate to or would result in (a)
acquiring additional securities of Company, alone or together with any other Person, which would
result in beneficially owning or controlling more than 9.99% of the total outstanding Common Stock or
other voting securities of Company, (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger,
reorganization or liquidation, involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) a sale or transfer of a
material amount of assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (d) any change in the present board
of directors or management of Company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or
term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board, (e) any material change in the present
capitalization or dividend policy of Company, (f) any other material change in Company’s business or
corporate structure, including but not limited to, if Company is a registered closed-end investment
company, any plans or proposals to make any changes in its investment policy for which a vote is
required by Section 13 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, (g) changes in Company’s charter,
bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of
control of Company by any Person, (h) a class of securities of Company being delisted from a national
securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a
registered national securities association, (i) a class of equity securities of Company becoming eligible
for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Act, or (j) any action, intention, plan or
arrangement similar to any of those enumerated above; or (3) request Company or its directors,
officers, employees, agents or representatives to amend or waive any provision of this section.
15
J.          No Shorting. Provided no Trigger Event under Sections I.H.(1), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) or (14) of the
Certificate of Designations has occurred, for so long as Investor holds any securities of Company,
neither Investor nor any of its Affiliates will engage in or effect, directly or indirectly, any Short Sale of
Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, selling against delivery of Conversion Shares after
delivery of a Conversion Notice is not a Short Sale. There will be no restriction or limitation of any kind
on Investor’s right or ability to sell or transfer any or all of the Conversion Shares at any time, in its sole
and absolute discretion.
K.          Stock Splits. If Company at any time on or after the Effective Date subdivides (by any stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) or combines (by combination, reverse stock split or
otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser
number of shares, the share numbers, prices and other amounts set forth in this Agreement, as in
effect immediately prior to such subdivision or combination, will be proportionately reduced or
increased, as applicable, effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination
becomes effective.
L.          Subsequent Financings. Until at least 60 days after the Registration Statement is declared
effective, Company will not issue or enter into an agreement to issue any shares of Common Stock,
except as provided in subsections (a), (b), (c)(i), (c)(iii), (c)(iv), (c)(v) or (c)(vi) below. Until at least 6
months after the Preferred Shares and Warrant have been converted, redeemed or exercised,
Company will not (1) enter into any agreement that in any way restricts its ability to enter into any
agreement, amendment or waiver with Investor, including without limitation any agreement to offer, sell
or issue to Investor any preferred stock, common stock or other securities of Company, (2) enter into
any equity or convertible financing pursuant to which shares of Common Stock or Common Stock
equivalents may effectively be issued (i) at a discount, (ii) at a variable price, or (iii) where the price or
number of shares are subject to any type of variability or reset feature. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, Company may enter into any financing: (a) with Investor; (b) for non-convertible debt with no
equity component; or (c) issuing Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents at a fixed price (i)
upon the exercise or exchange or conversion of any securities issued and outstanding on, and not
amended or modified after, the Effective Date, (ii) in an underwritten public offering that does not
include warrants and generates gross proceeds of at least $10 million, (iii) up to $250,000 per month in
private placements of securities that are restricted for at least 6 months after issuance; (iv) in exchange
for services pursuant to existing qualified incentive stock option plans, or pursuant to new plans duly
adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company if the securities are restricted for at least 6 months
after issuance, including options or other awards, to Company employees, officers, directors, or
individual independent contractors specifically engaged in the operations or management of oil and
gas field related activity and specifically excluding corporate contractors and general and
administrative service providers, (v) as consideration for acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or
strategic transactions, including licensing and partnering agreements, or purchase of all or
substantially all of the securities or assets of another entity, or (vi) as consideration for an equipment
loan or leasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement, or debt financing, from a licensed
commercial bank; provided however, with regard to any of the foregoing set forth in clauses (iv)
through (vi), that (1) the primary purpose of such issuance is not to raise capital, (2) the purchasers or
acquirers of the securities in such issuance do not include Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
solely consists of either (w) the individuals actually providing the services, (x) the actual participants in
such strategic alliance or strategic partnership, (y) the actual owners of such assets or securities
acquired in such acquisition or merger or (z) the stockholders, partners or members of the foregoing
Persons, (3) the number or amount of securities issued to such Person by the Company shall not be
disproportionate to such Person’s actual participation in such strategic alliance or strategic
partnership or ownership of such assets or securities to be acquired by the Company, or the value of
services provided to the Company, as applicable, and (4) none of such Persons are an entity whose
primary business is investing in securities, unless such entity has more than $1 billion in assets under
management.
16
M.          Approval. Company will file a preliminary proxy statement within 30 days of the Effective Date,
and use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain stockholder approval of this Agreement, the
Preferred Shares, the Warrant, and the issuance of the Conversion Shares, in accordance with the
requirements of NYSE MKT rules or a waiver from NYSE MKT (“Approval”) as soon as practicable after
the Effective Date. Company, its board of directors, and each of its directors will vote all proxies given
to them in favor of Approval.
N.          Principal Market. Company has submitted any necessary notification and supporting
documentation required for the listing of all possible Conversion Shares with NYSE MKT and will use
its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain approval to list the Conversion Shares as soon as
practicable.
O.          Restrictive Legend. The Securities have not been registered under the Act and may not be
resold in the United States unless registered or an exemption from registration is available. Company
is required to refuse to register any transfer of the Conversion Shares not made pursuant to
registration under the Act or an available exemption from registration. Upon the issuance thereof, and
only until such time as the same is no longer required under the applicable securities laws and
regulations, the certificates representing any of the Securities will bear a legend in substantially the
following form:
THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT, OR ANY U.S. STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND, UNLESS SO REGISTERED, MAY
NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE UNITED STATES OR TO U.S.
PERSONS EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT
OR AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT. IN ADDITION, HEDGING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING
THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE CONDUCTED unless in compliance with the ACT.
Certificates representing Conversion Shares will be issued without such legend or at Investor’s option
issue electronic delivery at the applicable balance account at DTC, if either (i) the Conversion Shares
are registered for resale under the Act, or (ii) Investor provides an opinion of its counsel to the effect
that the Conversion Shares may be issued without restrictive legend.
P.          Warrant Exercise. Upon exercise pursuant to Section I.B. of the Warrant, Investor will pay
Company the Purchase Price for the Warrant by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
17
V.          Registration Statement.
A.           Filing.
1.          Company will at its sole cost and expense prepare and file with the Commission as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Date, and in any event within 30 days, a Registration Statement
(“Registration Statement”) on Form S-3 or, if Form S-3 is unavailable, Form S-1, registering the delayed
and continuous resale of all Conversion Shares pursuant to Rule 415 under the Act, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Act as
promptly as practicable, and to remain continuously effective until all Conversion Shares may be
resold by Investor pursuant to Rule 144 without volume restrictions, manner-of-sale restrictions, or
Company being in compliance with any current public information requirement (the “Registration
Period”).
2.          If Company breaches its obligations under the preceding paragraph, it will file a Registration
Statement as soon as practicable, but such obligation and filing will not operate to cure or excuse
such breach. If at any time after the initial registration Statement is filed on Form S-3 or Form S-1, the
Registration Statement does not remain effective, Company will use reasonable best efforts to amend
the Registration Statement to continue effectiveness uninterrupted.
3.          Notwithstanding the foregoing registration obligations, if the Commission informs the
Company that all of the Conversion Shares cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be
registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration statement, the Company agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to file amendments to the Registration Statement as
required by the Commission, covering the maximum number of Conversion Shares permitted to be
registered by the Commission, to register for resale the Conversion Shares as a secondary offering;
provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment, the Company will use reasonably diligent
efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all of the Conversion Shares in
accordance with Commission guidance.
B.           Procedures. In connection with the Registration Statement, Company will, as soon as
reasonably practicable:
1.          Prepare and file with the Commission such pre-effective and post-effective amendments and
supplements to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection with the
Registration Statement, and file such reports under the Exchange Act, as may be necessary to cause
the Registration Statement to become effective, to keep the Registration Statement continuously
effective during the Registration Period and not misleading in any material respect, and as may
otherwise be required or applicable under, and to comply with the provisions of, the Act with respect to
the disposition of all Conversion Shares covered by the Registration Statement during the
Registration Period.
2.          Furnish to Investor such number of copies of the Prospectus, and each amendment or
supplement thereto, in conformity with the requirements of the Act, and such other documents as
Investor may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of Conversion Shares owned by
it.
18
3.          Notify Investor: (a) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment is proposed to be filed and, with respect to any post-effective amendment, when the same
has become effective, except for any filing to be made solely to incorporate by reference a Current
Report on Form 8-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed with the
Commission; (b) of any request by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental
authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or a Prospectus or for
additional information; (c) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; (d) of
the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or
exemption from qualification of any of the Conversion Shares for sale in any jurisdiction, or the
initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, and (e) of the occurrence of any event or
circumstance that makes any statement made in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any
document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material
respect or that requires the making of any changes in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or
documents so that, in the case of a Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, it
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; provided, however, in no event will any such notice contain any
information which would constitute material, non-public information regarding the Company.
4.          Use reasonable best efforts to avoid the issuance of, or, if issued, obtain the withdrawal of, any
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or the lifting of any suspension of
the qualification, or exemption from qualification, of any of the Conversion Shares for sale in any
jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment.
5.          Incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as
Investor reasonably requests be included therein regarding Investor or the plan of distribution of the
Conversion Shares; and make all required filings of the Prospectus supplement or such post-effective
amendment as soon as practicable after the Company has received notification of such matters to be
incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; provided, however, that
the Company will not be required to take any action pursuant to this paragraph that would violate
applicable law.
6.          Whenever necessary, prepare and deliver to Investor any required supplement or amendment,
including a post-effective amendment, to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the
Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and file
any other required document, including such reports as may be required to be filed under the
Exchange Act, so that, as thereafter delivered, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
7.          Use reasonable best efforts to cause all Conversion Shares to be listed on the Trading Market
or such other securities exchange or automated quotation system, if any, as is then the principal
securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Common Stock is then listed.
19
8.            Fully cooperate with the Transfer Agent, Investor and its brokers to facilitate the timely
clearing and delivery of Conversion Shares to be sold pursuant to the Registration Statement free of
any restrictive legends and in such denominations and registered in such names as Investor may
reasonably request, including timely completion and delivery of all forms, documents and instruments
requested by the Transfer Agent or any broker.
VI.          General Provisions.
A.          Notice. Unless a different time of day or method of delivery is specifically provided in the
Transaction Documents, any and all notices or other communications or deliveries required or
permitted to be provided hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed given and effective on the
earliest of: (a) the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile or
electronic mail prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on a Trading Day and an electronic confirmation of
delivery is received by the sender, (b) the next Trading Day after the date of transmission, if such
notice or communication is delivered later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern time or on a day that is not a Trading
Day, (c) the next Trading Day following the date of mailing, if sent by U.S. nationally recognized
overnight courier service, or (d) upon actual receipt by the party to whom such notice is required to be
given. The addresses for such notices and communications are such other address as may be
designated in writing, in the same manner, by such Person.
B.          Amendments; Waivers. No provision of this Agreement may be waived or amended except in a
written instrument signed, in the case of an amendment, by Company and Investor or, in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom enforcement of any such waiver is sought. No waiver of any default
with respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement will be deemed to be a
continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other
provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor will any delay or omission of either party to exercise
any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right.
C.          No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise set forth in Section IV.G, this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents will inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto, and is not for the
benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person. Other than the Investor
Parties described in Section IV.G,, a person who is not a party to this Agreement will not have any
rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Law, 2014 of the Cayman Islands to enforce any
term of this Agreement or any Transaction Document.
D.          Fees and Expenses. Company has paid a flat rate documentation fee of $10,000 to Investor’s
counsel incurred in connection with drafting this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party will pay the fees and expenses of its own
advisers, counsel, accountants and other experts, if any, and all other expenses incurred by such
party incident to the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction
Documents. Company acknowledges and agrees that Investor’s counsel solely represents Investor,
and does not represent Company or its interests in connection with the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated thereby. Company will pay all stamp and other taxes and duties, if any,
levied in connection with the sale, issuance and delivery of the Securities to Investor.
20
E.          Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable in any
respect, the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement will not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the parties will attempt to agree upon a valid and
enforceable provision that is a reasonable substitute therefor, and upon so agreeing, will incorporate
such substitute provision in this Agreement.
F.          Replacement of Certificates. If any certificate or instrument evidencing any Securities is
mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, Company will issue or cause to be issued in exchange and
substitution for and upon cancellation thereof, or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new certificate
or instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Company of such loss,
theft or destruction and customary and reasonable indemnity, if requested. The applicants for a new
certificate or instrument under such circumstances will also pay any reasonable third-party costs
associated with the issuance of such replacement certificates.
G.          Governing Law. All matters between the parties, including without limitation questions
concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of the Transaction Documents
will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands,
without regard to the principles of conflicts of law that would require or permit the application of the
laws of any other jurisdiction, except for corporation law matters applicable to Company which will be
governed by the corporate law of its jurisdiction of formation. The parties hereby waive all rights to a
trial by jury. In any action, arbitration or proceeding, including appeal, arising out of or relating to any
of the Transaction Documents or otherwise involving the parties, the prevailing party will be awarded
its reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
the investigation, preparation, prosecution or defense of such action or proceeding.
H.          Arbitration. Any dispute, controversy, claim or action of any kind arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with this Agreement, or in any way involving Company and Investor or their respective
Affiliates, including any issues of arbitrability, will be resolved solely by final and binding arbitration in
English before a retired judge at JAMS International, or its successor, in the Territory of the Virgin
Islands, pursuant to the most expedited and Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available.
Any interim or final award may be entered and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The
final award will include the prevailing party’s reasonable arbitration, expert witness and attorney fees,
costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Investor may in its sole discretion bring an action
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada or the Middle District of Florida in addition to, in lieu
of, or in aid of arbitration.
21
I.          Remedies. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law,
including recovery of damages, each of Investor and Company will be entitled to specific performance
under the Transaction Documents, and equitable and injunctive relief to prevent any actual or
threatened breach under the Transaction Documents, to the full extent permitted under applicable
laws. Without limitation of the foregoing, Company acknowledges that the rights and benefits of
Investor pursuant to Section I.G.1. of the Certificate of Designations are unique and that no adequate
remedy exists at law if Company breaches or fails timely perform any of its obligations thereunder, that
it would be difficult to determine the amount of damages resulting therefrom, that it would cause
irreparable injury to Investor, and that any potential harm to Company would be adequately and fully
compensable with monetary damages. Accordingly, Investor will be entitled to a compulsory remedy
of immediate specific performance, temporary, interim, preliminary and final injunctive relief to enforce
the provisions thereof, including without limitation requiring Company and its transfer agent,
attorneys, officers and directors to immediately take all actions necessary to issue and deliver the
number of Conversion Shares stated by Investor, which requirements will not be stayed for any
reason, without the necessity of posting any bond. Company hereby absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably waives all objections and rights to oppose any motion, application or request by Investor
to issue any number of Conversion Shares, and all rights to stay or appeal any resulting order, and
any appeal by Company or on its behalf will be immediately and automatically dismissed. Nothing
provided for in this provision will limit either party’s ability to recover monetary damages.
J.          Payment Set Aside. To the extent that Company makes a payment or payments to Investor
pursuant to any Transaction Document or Investor enforces or exercises its rights thereunder, and
such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from,
disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to Company, a trustee,
receiver or any other person under any law, including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or
federal law, common law or equitable cause of action, then to the extent of any such restoration the
obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied will be revived and continued in full force
and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.
K.          Headings. The headings herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this
Agreement and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof
L.          Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to all provisions of this Agreement.
M.          Survival. The representations and warranties contained herein will survive the Closing and the
delivery of the Securities until all Preferred Shares and the entire Warrant issued to Investor have been
converted, redeemed or exercised. Neither party will be under any obligation to update or supplement
any of its representations or warranties following the Closing due to a change that occurred after the
Closing.
N.          Construction. The parties agree that each of them and/or their respective counsel has reviewed
and had an opportunity to revise the Transaction Documents and, therefore, the normal rule of
construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party will not be
employed in the interpretation of the Transaction Documents or any amendments hereto. The
language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express
their mutual intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any party. All currency
references in any Transaction Document are to U.S. dollars.
22
O.          Further Assurances. Each party will take all further actions and execute all further documents
as may be reasonably necessary to implement the provisions and carry out the intent of this
Agreement fully and effectively.
P.          Execution. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which when
taken together will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party, it being understood that
both parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by
portable document format, facsimile or electronic transmission, such signature will create a valid and
binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the
same force and effect as if such signature page were an original thereof.
Q.          Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Exhibits hereto, which are hereby
incorporated herein by reference, contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties, and
supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, term sheets, letters, discussions,
communications and understandings, both oral and written, which the parties acknowledge have been
merged into this Agreement. No party, representative, advisor, attorney or agent has relied upon any
collateral contract, agreement, assurance, promise, understanding, statement or representation not
expressly set forth herein. The parties hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably waive all
rights and remedies, at law and in equity, directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to, or which may
arise as a result of, any Person’s reliance on any such statement or assurance.

property and does hereby fix and determine the powers, rights, preferences, restrictions and other
matters relating to such series of Preferred Stock as follows:
1
I.          Terms of Preferred Stock.
A.            Designation and Amount. A series of Preferred Stock is hereby designated as the
Corporation’s Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, par value of $0.001 per share (the
“Series C Preferred Stock”), the number of shares of which so designated are 5,000 shares of Series C
Preferred Stock; which Series C Preferred Stock will not be subject to increase without any consent of
the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock (each a “Holder” and collectively, the “Holders”) that may

B.            Ranking and Voting.
1.            Ranking. The Series C Preferred Stock will, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon

(voting separately as a single class), the Corporation may not issue any additional shares of Series C
Preferred Stock or, other than shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued in the Acquisition, any other
Preferred Stock (other than the Series B Preferred Stock) that is pari passu or senior to the Series C

C.            Dividends.
1.            Commencing on the date of the issuance of any such shares of Series C Preferred Stock
(each respectively an “Issuance Date”), each outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock will accrue
cumulative dividends (“Dividends”), at a rate equal to 6.0% per annum, subject to adjustment as
provided in this Certificate of Designations (“Dividend Rate”), of the Face Value. Dividends will be
payable with respect to any shares of Series C Preferred Stock upon any of the following: (a) upon
redemption of such shares in accordance with Section I.F; (b) upon conversion of such shares in
accordance with Section I.G; and (c) when, as and if otherwise declared by the board of directors of the

in the Corporation’s sole and absolute discretion, immediately in cash; or (b) if Corporation notifies
Holder it will not pay all or any portion in cash, or to the extent cash is not paid and received as soon
as practicable, and in any event within 1 Trading Day after the Notice Time, for any reason whatsoever,
in shares of Common Stock valued at (i) if there has never been a Trigger Event, (A) 95.0% of the
average of the 5 lowest individual daily volume weighted average prices of the Common Stock on the
Trading Market during the applicable Measurement Period, which may be non-consecutive, less $0.05
per share of Common Stock, not to exceed (B) 100% of the lowest sales price on the last day of such
Measurement Period less $0.05 per share of Common Stock (ii) following any Trigger Event, (A) 85.0%
of the lowest daily volume weighted average price during any Measurement Period for any conversion
by Holder, less $0.10 per share of Common Stock, not to exceed (B) 85.0% of the lowest sales price on
the last day of any Measurement Period, less $0.10 per share of Common Stock. In no event will the
value of Common Stock pursuant to the foregoing be below the par value per share. All amounts that
are required or permitted to be paid in cash pursuant to this Certificate of Designations will be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Holder.
3.            So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company will not
repurchase shares of Common Stock other than as payment of the exercise or conversion price of a
convertible security or payment of withholding tax, and no dividends or other distributions will be paid,
declared or set apart with respect to any Common Stock, except for Purchase Rights.
D.            Protective Provision.
1.            So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation will not,

otherwise) of one or more subsidiaries of the Corporation if substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole are held by such subsidiary or subsidiaries, except
where such sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition is to a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Corporation.
3
3.            The Corporation will not have the power to close or effect a voluntary Deemed Liquidation
Event unless the agreement or plan of merger or consolidation for such transaction provides that the
consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation will be allocated among the holders of
capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Section I.E, and the required amount is paid to
Holder prior to or upon closing, effectuation or occurrence of the Deemed Liquidation Event.
E.             Liquidation.
1.            Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or
involuntary, after payment or provision for payment of debts and other liabilities of the Corporation,
prior to any distribution or payment made to the holders of Preferred Stock or Common Stock by
reason of their ownership thereof, the Holders of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to be paid
out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders an amount with
respect to each share of Series C Preferred Stock equal to $10,000.00 (“Face Value”), plus an amount
equal to any accrued but unpaid Dividends thereon (collectively with the Face Value, the “Liquidation
Value”).
2.            If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or
involuntary, the amounts payable with respect to the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not paid in
full, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock will share equally and ratably with the holders of
shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any distribution of assets of the Corporation in
proportion to the liquidation preference and an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid
Dividends, if any, to which each such holder is entitled.
3.            If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the
Corporation will be insufficient to make payment in full to all Holders, then the assets distributable to
the Holders will be distributed among the Holders at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the
full amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.
F.             Redemption.
1.            Corporation’s Redemption Option. On the Dividend Maturity Date, the Corporation may
redeem any or all shares of Series C Preferred Stock by paying Holder in cash an amount per share
equal to 100% of the Liquidation Value for the shares redeemed.
4
2.            Early Redemption. Prior to the Dividend Maturity Date, provided that no Trigger Event has
occurred, the Corporation will have the right at any time upon 30 Trading Days’ prior written notice, in
its sole and absolute discretion, to redeem all or any portion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock
then outstanding by paying Holder in cash an amount per share of Series C Preferred Stock (the
“Early Redemption Price”) equal to the sum of the following: (a) 100% of the Face Value, plus (b) the
Conversion Premium, minus (c) any Dividends that have been paid, for each share of Series C
Preferred Stock redeemed.
3.            Credit Risk Adjustment.
a.          The Dividend Rate will adjust downward by an amount equal to the Spread Adjustment
for each amount, if any, equal to the Adjustment Factor that the Measuring Metric rises above the
Maximum Triggering Level, down to a minimum of 0.0%.
b.          The Dividend Rate will adjust upward by an amount equal to the Spread Adjustment for
each amount, if any, equal to the Adjustment Factor that the Measuring Metric falls below the Minimum
Triggering Level, up to a maximum of 24.95%. In addition, the Dividend Rate will adjust upward by
10.0% following the occurrence of any Trigger Event.
c.          The adjusted Dividend Rate used for calculation of the Liquidation Value, Conversion
Premium, Early Redemption Price and Dividend, as applicable, and the amount of Dividends owed will
be calculated and determined based upon the Measuring Metric at close of the Trading Market
immediately prior to the Notice Time.
4.            Mandatory Redemption. If the Corporation determines to liquidate, dissolve or wind-up its
business and affairs, or upon closing or occurrence of any Deemed Liquidation Event, the
Corporation will prior to or concurrently with the closing, effectuation or occurrence any such action,
redeem the Series C Preferred Stock for cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Holder, at the Early Redemption Price set forth in Section I.F.2 if the event is
prior to the Dividend Maturity Date, or at the Liquidation Value if the event is on or after the Dividend
Maturity Date.
5.            Mechanics of Redemption. In order to redeem any of the Holders’ Series C Preferred Stock
then outstanding, the Corporation must deliver written notice (each, a “Redemption Notice”) to each
Holder setting forth (a) the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock that the Corporation is
redeeming, (b) the applicable Dividend Rate, Liquidation Value and Early Redemption Price, and (c) the
calculation of the amount paid. Upon receipt of full payment in cash for a complete redemption, each
Holder will promptly submit to the Corporation such Holder’s Series C Preferred Stock certificates. In
connection with a mandatory redemption, the notice will be delivered as soon as the number of shares
can be determined, and in all other instances at least 30 Trading Days prior to payment. For the
avoidance of doubt, the delivery of a Redemption Notice will not affect Holder’s rights under Section
I.G until after receipt of cash payment by Holder at the required time.
5
G.           Conversion.
1.            Mechanics of Conversion.
a.          One or more shares of the Series C Preferred Stock may be converted, in part or in whole, into
shares of Common Stock, at any time or times after the Issuance Date, in the sole and absolute
discretion of Holder or, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Corporation; (i) if at the option
of Holder, by delivery of one or more written notices to the Corporation or its transfer agent (each, a
“Holder Conversion Notice”), of the Holder’s election to convert any or all of its Series C Preferred
Stock; or (ii) if at the option of the Corporation, if the Equity Conditions are met, delivery of written
notice to Holder (each, a “Corporation Conversion Notice,” with the Holder Conversion Notice, each a
“Conversion Notice,” and with the Redemption Notice, each an “Initial Notice”), of the Corporation’s
election to convert the Series C Preferred Stock.
b.          Each Delivery Notice will set forth the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock being
converted, the minimum number of Conversion Shares and the amount of Dividends and any
applicable Conversion Premium due as of the time the Delivery Notice is given (the “Notice Time”), and
the calculation thereof.
b.          If the Corporation notifies Holder by 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the Trading Day after the Notice
Time that it is paying all or any portion of Dividends or Conversion Premium, and actually pays in cash
by the next Trading Day, time being of the essence, the full amount of Dividends and Conversion
Premium stated in the Delivery Notice, no further amount will be due with respect thereto.
c.          As soon as practicable, and in any event within 1 Trading Day of the Notice Time, time being of
the essence, the Corporation will do all of the following: (i) transmit the Delivery Notice by facsimile or
electronic mail to the Holder, and to the Corporation’s transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) with
instructions to comply with the Delivery Notice; (ii) either (A) if the Corporation is approved through
The Depository Trust Corporation (“DTC”), authorize and instruct the credit by the Transfer Agent the
aggregate number of Conversion Shares set forth in the Delivery Notice, to Holder’s or its designee’s
balance account with the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) Program, through its
Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (DWAC) system, or (B) only if the Corporation is not approved
through DTC, issue and surrender to a common carrier for overnight delivery to the address as
specified in the Delivery Notice a certificate registered in the name of Holder or its designee, for the
number of Conversion Shares set forth in the Delivery Notice, bearing no restrictive legend unless a
registration statement covering the Conversion Shares is not effective and neither Company nor
Investor provides an opinion of counsel to the effect that Conversion Shares may be issued without
restrictive legend; and (iii) if it contends that the Delivery Notice is in any way incorrect, a through
explanation of why and its own calculation, or the Delivery Notice will conclusively be deemed correct
for all purposes. The Corporation will at all times diligently take or cause to be taken all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the Conversion Shares to be issued as soon as practicable.
6
d.          If during the Measurement Period the Holder is entitled to receive additional Conversion Shares
with regard to an Initial Notice, Holder may at any time deliver one or more additional written notices to
the Corporation or its transfer agent (each, an “Additional Notice” and with the Initial Notice, each a
“Delivery Notice”) setting forth the additional number of Conversion Shares to be delivered, and the
calculation thereof.
e.          If the Corporation for any reason does not issue or cause to be issued to the Holder within 3
Trading Days after the date of a Delivery Notice, the number of Conversion Shares stated in the
Delivery Notice, then, in addition to all other remedies available to the Holder, as liquidated damages
and not as a penalty, the Corporation will pay in cash to the Holder on each day after such 3rd Trading
Day that the issuance of such Conversion Shares is not timely effected an amount equal to 2% of the
product of (i) the aggregate number of Conversion Shares not issued to the Holder on a timely basis
and to which the Holder is entitled and (ii) the highest Closing Price of the Common Stock between the
date on which the Corporation should have issued such shares to the Holder and the actual date of
receipt of Conversion Shares by Holder. It is intended that the foregoing will serve to reasonably
compensate Holder for any delay in delivery of Conversion Shares, and not as punishment for any
breach by the Corporation. The Corporation acknowledges that the actual damages likely to result
from delay in delivery are difficult to estimate and would be difficult for Holder to prove.
f.          Notwithstanding any other provision: all of the requirements of Section I.F and this Section I.G
are each independent covenants; the Corporation’s obligations to issue and deliver Conversion
Shares upon any Delivery Notice are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable; any breach or alleged
breach of any representation or agreement, or any violation or alleged violation of any law or
regulation, by any party or any other person will not excuse full and timely performance of any of the
Corporation’s obligations under these sections; and under no circumstances may the Corporation
seek or obtain any temporary, interim or preliminary injunctive or equitable relief to prevent or interfere
with any issuance of Conversion Shares to Holder.
g.          If for any reason whatsoever Holder does not timely receive the number of Conversion Shares
stated in any Delivery Notice, Holder will be entitled to a compulsory remedy of immediate specific
performance, temporary, interim and, preliminary and final injunctive relief requiring Corporation and
its transfer agent, attorneys, officers and directors to immediately issue and deliver the number of
Conversion Shares stated by Holder, which requirement will not be stayed for any reason, without the
necessity of posting any bond, and which Corporation may not seek to stay or appeal.
h.          No fractional shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon conversion of Series C Preferred
Stock, but rather the Corporation will issue to Holder scrip or warrants registered on the books of the
Corporation (certificated or uncertificated) which will entitle Holder to receive a full share upon the
surrender of such scrip or warrants aggregating a full share. The Holder will not be required to deliver
the original certificates for the Series C Preferred Stock in order to effect a conversion hereunder. The
Corporation will pay any and all taxes which may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery
of any Conversion Shares.
7
2.            Holder Conversion. In the event of a conversion of any Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to a
Holder Conversion Notice, the Corporation will (a) satisfy the payment of Dividends and Conversion
Premium with respect to the shares of Series C Preferred Stock converted as provided in Section I.C.2,
and (b) issue to the Holder of such Series C Preferred Stock a number of Conversion Shares equal to
(i) the Face Value multiplied by (ii) the number of such Series C Preferred Stock subject to the Holder
Conversion Notice divided by (iii) the applicable Conversion Price with respect to such Series C
Preferred Stock; all in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section I.G.1.
3.            Corporation Conversion. The Corporation will have the right to send the Holder a Corporation
Conversion Notice at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, if the Equity Conditions are met as of
the time such Corporation Conversion Notice is given. Upon any conversion of any Series C Preferred
Stock pursuant to a Corporation Conversion Notice, the Corporation will on the date of such notice (a)
satisfy the payment of Dividends and Conversion Premium with respect to the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock converted as provided in Section I.C.2, and (b) issue to the Holder of such Series C
Preferred Stock a number of Conversion Shares equal to (i) the Face Value multiplied by (ii) the
number of such Series C Preferred Stock subject to the Holder Conversion Notice divided by (iii) the
applicable Conversion Price with respect to such Series C Preferred Stock; all in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section I.G.1.
4.            Stock Splits. If the Corporation at any time on or after the filing of this Certificate of
Designations subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more
classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the applicable
Conversion Price, Adjustment Factor, Maximum Triggering Level, Minimum Triggering Level, and other
share based metrics in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced
and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable will be proportionately increased. If the
Corporation at any time on or after such Issuance Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split
or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number
of shares, the applicable Conversion Price, Adjustment Factor, Maximum Triggering Level, Minimum
Triggering Level, and other share based metrics in effect immediately prior to such combination will be
proportionately increased and the number of Conversion Shares will be proportionately decreased.
Any adjustment under this Section will become effective at the close of business on the date the
subdivision or combination becomes effective.
5.            Rights. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section I.G.4, if at any time the Corporation
grants, issues or sells any options, convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants,
securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock
(the “Purchase Rights”), then Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such
Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which Holder could have acquired if Holder had held
the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon conversion of all Preferred Stock held by
Holder immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such
Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of
Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.
8
6.            Notices. The holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to the same rights as
the holders of Common Stock with respect to rights to receive notices, reports and audited accounts
from the Company and with respect to attending stockholder meetings.
7.            Definitions. The following terms will have the following meanings:

b.          “Acquisition” means the closing of the acquisition of assets contemplated by that certain Asset
Purchase Agreement dated December 30, 2015 between Company and the sellers named therein, as

a.          Beneficial Ownership. Notwithstanding any other provision, at no time may the
Corporation issue shares of Common Stock to Holder which, when aggregated with all other shares of

4.99% of all Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such issuance, as
determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder; provided, however, that Holder may increase such amount to 9.99% upon
not less than 61 days’ prior notice to the Corporation.. To the extent that any conversion would
otherwise result in exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation set forth in the preceding sentence,
the Delivery Notice will specify the number of shares that may be delivered without exceeding the
limitation, and any issuance beyond such extent will be held in abeyance until such time as it would
not result in Holder exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation. No provision of this paragraph may
be waived by Holder or the Corporation.

Certificate of Designations, the Warrant issued to Holder on the Issuance Date, the Securities
Purchase Agreement with Investor dated the Issuance Date, the Debenture or the Common Stock

approval in accordance with the requirements of NYSE MKT rules or a waiver from NYSE MKT
(“Approval”).

Preferred Stock will automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock.
H.            Trigger Event.
1.            Any occurrence of any one or more of the following will constitute a “Trigger Event”:
(a)          Holder does not timely receive the number of Conversion Shares stated in any
Conversion Notice pursuant to this Certificate of Designations or any other agreement with Holder for
any reason whatsoever, time being of the essence, including without limitation the issuance of
restricted shares if counsel for Corporation or Holder provides a legal opinion that shares may be
issued without restrictive legend;
(b)          Any violation of or failure to timely perform any covenant or provision of this
Certificate of Designations, the Stock Purchase Agreement, any Transaction Document or any other
agreement with Holder, related to payment of cash, registration or delivery of Conversion Shares, time
being of the essence;
(c)          Any violation of or failure to perform any covenant or provision of this
Certificate of Designations, the Stock Purchase Agreement, any Transaction Document or any other
agreement with Holder, which in the case of a default that is curable, is not related to payment of cash,
registration or delivery of Conversion Shares, and has not occurred before, is not cured within 5
Trading Days of written notice thereof;
11
(d)          Any representation or warranty made in the Securities Purchase Agreement,
any Transaction Document or any other agreement with Holder will be untrue, incorrect, or misleading
in any material respect as of the date when made or deemed made;

agreement, lease, document or instrument to which the Corporation or any subsidiary other than CATI
Operating LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“CATI”) is obligated, including without limitation of
an aggregate of at least $500,000 of indebtedness;
(f)          While any Registration Statement is required to be maintained effective, the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement lapses for any reason, including, without limitation, the
issuance of a stop order, or the Registration Statement, or the prospectus contained therein, is
unavailable to Holder sale of all Conversion Shares for any 5 or more Trading Days, which may be
non-consecutive;
(g)          The suspension from trading or the failure of the Common Stock to be trading
or listed on the Trading Market;
(h)         The Corporation notifies Holder, including without limitation, by way of public
announcement or through any of its attorneys, agents or representatives, of its intention not to
comply, as required, with a Conversion Notice pursuant to this Certificate of Designations or any other
agreement with Holder, at any time, including without limitation any objection or instruction to its
transfer agent not to comply with any notice from Holder;
(i)          Bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or liquidation proceedings or other
proceedings for the relief of debtors will be instituted by or against the Corporation or any subsidiary
other than CATI and, if instituted against the Corporation or any subsidiary other than CATI by a third
party, an order for relief is entered or the proceedings are not dismissed within 30 days of their
initiation;
(j)          The appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator,
assignee, trustee, or other similar official of the Corporation or any subsidiary other than CATI or of
any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or
the execution of a composition of debts, or the occurrence of any other similar federal, state or foreign
proceeding, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become
due, the taking of corporate action by the Corporation or any subsidiary other than CATI in
furtherance of any such action or the taking of any action by any person to commence a foreclosure
sale or any other similar action under any applicable law;
(k)          A final judgment or judgments for the payment of money aggregating in
excess of $500,000 are rendered against the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries other than CATI and
are not stayed or satisfied within 30 days of entry;
(l)          The Corporation does not for any reason timely comply with the reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, including without limitation timely filing when first due all periodic reports;
12
(m)          Any regulatory, administrative or enforcement proceeding is initiated against
Corporation or any subsidiary (except to the extent an adverse determination would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of
operations or prevent the performance by the Company of any material obligation under the
Transaction Documents); or
(n)          Any material provision of this Certificate of Designations shall at any time for
any reason, other than pursuant to the express terms thereof, cease to be valid and binding on or
enforceable against the parties thereto, or the validity or enforceability thereof will be contested by any
party thereto, or a proceeding will be commenced by the Corporation or any subsidiary or any
governmental authority having jurisdiction over any of them, seeking to establish the invalidity or
unenforceability thereof, or the Corporation or any subsidiary denies that it has any liability or
obligation purported to be created under this Certificate of Designations.
2.               It is intended that all adjustments made following a Trigger Event will serve to
reasonably compensate Holder for the consequences and increased risk following a Trigger Event,
and not as a penalty or punishment for any breach by the Corporation. The Corporation acknowledges
that the actual damages likely to result from a Trigger Event are difficult to estimate and would be
difficult for Holder to prove.
II.          General.
A.         Notices. Any and all notices to the Corporation will be addressed to the Corporation’s Chief
Executive Officer at the Corporation’s principal place of business on file with the Secretary of State of

Re:          Lucas Energy, Inc.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
In accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”), dated April 6, 2016, by and between
Lucas Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Company”), and ____________________ (“Investor”),
pursuant to which Company is required to issue and deliver shares of Series C Preferred Stock
(“Preferred Shares”) and reserve, issue and deliver shares (“Shares”) of Company’s Common Stock
(“Common Stock”) upon conversion of the Preferred Shares and exercise of the Warrant purchased
by Investor, this will serve as our irrevocable, absolute and unconditional instruction, authorization
and direction to you to (a) immediately issue the Preferred Shares and reserve _____ million Shares for
issuance to Investor, (b) upon receipt of written notice, from either Company or from Investor with a
copy to Company, reserve any additional Shares requested to be reserved by either Company or
Investor, and (c) whenever either Company or Investor delivers written instructions to you with a copy
of a Delivery Notice, immediately issue the Shares requested by either Company or Investor.
Capitalized terms used herein without definition will have the respective meanings ascribed to them in
the Agreement.
The Shares will remain in the created reserve until the earlier of their issuance or such date as both
Investor and Company provide written instructions that the Shares or any part of them may be taken
out of the reserve and will no longer be subject to the terms of these instructions.
Upon your receipt of an instruction from either Company or Investor, you are to process the
instruction without delay in accordance with your Routine or Rush procedures, as specified, and use
your commercially reasonable best efforts to issue and make available for delivery to Investor the
number of Shares set forth in the Delivery Notice as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event
within 3 trading days after receipt of the conversion notice, either: (a) only if you receive written notice
that the Registration Statement is not effective and neither Company nor Investor provides an opinion
of counsel to the effect that the Shares may be issued without restrictive legend, by delivering by
overnight carrier to the address specified in the notice a physical certificate bearing a restrictive
legend; (b) only if Company is not approved through DTC, and either Company or Investor provides
an opinion of counsel to the effect that the Shares may be issued without restrictive legend, by
delivering by overnight carrier to the address specified in the notice a physical certificate bearing no
restrictive legend, by delivering by overnight carrier to the address specified in the notice a physical
certificate bearing no restrictive legend; or (c) if Company is DTC eligible and either Company or
Investor provides an opinion of counsel to the effect that the Shares may be issued without restrictive
legend, by issuing pursuant to the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) Program, crediting
to Investor’s or its designee’s balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal At Custodian
(DWAC) system, and notifying Investor to cause its bank or broker to initiate the transaction through
the DWAC system.
Company and Investor understand that in order to issue unrestricted stock ClearTrust LLC will need to
be able to verify on www.sec.gov that a valid registration of the shares is available. If a registration is
not effective the following items will be required to issue unrestricted shares pursuant an exemption to
registration: (a) an opinion of counsel of Company or Investor, in form, substance and scope
customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions (and reasonably satisfactory to the
transfer agent in accordance with standard industry custom and practice), (b) a seller’s representation
letter, and (c) with respect to the Warrant, a copy thereof and proof of payment of payment for the
issued security.
Company hereby confirms that the Shares should not be subject to any stop-transfer restrictions and
will otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of Company, and if the Shares are
certificated, the certificates will not bear any legend restricting transfer of the Shares represented
thereby, if a legal opinion is provided as set forth in the preceding paragraph.
Company hereby confirms that no instructions other than as contemplated herein will or may be given
to you by Company with respect to the Shares. Company may not instruct you to disregard any
reserve or Delivery Notice and you may not do so. You are to comply promptly with any Delivery
Notice or share reservation notice received from Investor, notwithstanding any contrary instructions
from Company.
Company will not replace you as Company’s transfer agent, until a reputable registered transfer agent
has agreed in writing to serve as Company’s transfer agent and to be bound by all terms and
conditions of this letter agreement. In the event that you resign as Company’s transfer agent,
Company will engage a suitable replacement reputable registered transfer agent that will agree to
serve as transfer agent for Company and be bound by the terms and conditions of these irrevocable
instructions as soon as practicable and in any event within 3 Trading Days. You may not disclose any
information, deliver any documents, or transfer any files to any successor transfer agent until after
Investor acknowledges in writing that a suitable successor transfer agent has agreed in writing to be
bound by the terms and conditions of these instructions.
Company and Investor understand that ClearTrust, LLC will need payment of transfer agent fees prior
to completing conversion(s). ClearTrust, LLC will not be responsible for processing conversions prior
to payment of transfer fees not to exceed $150.00 plus shipping fees per conversion request for
Routine processing (within 3 business days) or $250.00 plus shipping fees for Rush processing
(within 24 hours).
2
Investor and Company understand that ClearTrust, LLC will not be required to perform any issuances
or transfers of shares if (a) the request violates, or would be in violation of, any terms of the Transfer
Agent Agreement, (b) such an issuance or transfer of shares be in violation of any state or federal
securities laws or regulation or (c) the issuance or transfer of shares be prohibited or stopped as
required or directed by a court order. If the Company informs you that there is a court order stopping
issuances and provides you with a certified copy of the order, once received, you will not be obligated
to perform any issuances related to the Note and this agreement that are prohibited by the court order.
Company and you hereby acknowledge and confirm that complying with the terms of these
instructions does not and will not prohibit you from satisfying any and all fiduciary responsibilities and
duties you may owe to Company.
Company will indemnify you and your officers, directors, principals, partners, advisors, attorneys,
agents and representatives, and hold each of them harmless from and against any and all loss, cost,
liability, damage, claim or expense (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys)
incurred by or asserted against you or any of them arising out of or in connection with complying with
any Delivery Notice or any other instruction from Investor, except that Company will not be liable
hereunder for any failure by you to comply with a Delivery Notice or any other instructions from
Investor, or as to amounts in respect of which it is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be due solely to your fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. You are entitled to
indemnity and will have no liability to Company in respect of any action taken in compliance with any
Delivery Notice or instruction from Investor, notwithstanding any contrary instructions from Company.
Accordingly, you will have no duty or obligation to confirm the accuracy of any calculations or
information set forth in any Delivery Notice submitted by the Investor.
Investor is intended to be and is a third party beneficiary hereof, and no amendment or modification to
the instructions set forth herein may be made without the prior written consent of Investor. The above
instructions cannot be revoked, cancelled or modified without prior written approval of Investor.
The Board of Directors of Company has approved the foregoing irrevocable instructions and does
hereby extend Company’s irrevocable agreement to indemnify your firm for all loss, liability or expense
in carrying out the authority and direction herein contained on the terms herein set forth. You have not
previously received contrary instructions from Company or its agents, nor are you aware of any facts
or circumstances that would make the transaction improper or illegal under applicable laws or
regulations.

conflicts of laws principles thereof, and any action arising out of or relating to these instructions by be
filed in Hillsborough County District Court or the U.S. District Court for the Florida Middle District.

Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, Investor will be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the
Company available for distribution an amount with respect to any unexercised portion of this Warrant
equal to the Purchase Price for such unexercised portion of this Warrant, plus an amount equal to any
accrued but unpaid Premium thereon (collectively with the Purchase Price, the “Liquidation Value”).
The Liquidation Value, and upon any redemption of this Warrant pursuant to Section I.F, the Maturity
Redemption Price, Early Redemption Price, or Liquidation Value, as applicable, will be reduced by the
amount of any unpaid Purchase Price, and any Premium or Conversion Premium with respect thereto,
whether or not required to be paid. By way of example, if Investor has paid none of the Purchase Price,
the Maturity Redemption Price, Early Redemption Price and Liquidation Value will be zero.
F.           Redemption.
1.          Company’s Redemption Option. On the Warrant Maturity Date, the Company may redeem the
entire unexercised portion of this Warrant by paying Investor in cash an amount per share equal to
100% of the Purchase Price for such unexercised portion of this Warrant (the “Maturity Redemption
Price”).
2.          Early Redemption. Prior to the Warrant Maturity Date, provided that no Trigger Event has
occurred, the Company will have the right at any time upon 30 Trading Days’ prior written notice, in its
sole and absolute discretion, to redeem all or any portion of this Warrant then outstanding by paying
Investor in cash an amount (the “Early Redemption Price”) equal to the sum of the following: (a) 100%
of the Purchase Price for such unexercised portion of this Warrant, plus (b) the Conversion Premium
thereon, minus (c) any Premium thereon that has been paid.
3.          Credit Risk Adjustment.
a.          Premium.
i.          Commencing on the date of the issuance of this Warrant (“Issuance
Date”), this Warrant will accrue a premium (“Premium”), at a rate equal to 6.0% per annum, subject to
adjustment as provided in this Warrant (“Premium Rate”), of the Purchase Price. The Premium will be
payable with respect to any part of this Warrant upon any of the following: (a) upon redemption of such
part in accordance with Section I.F; and (b) upon conversion of such part in accordance with Section
I.G.
2
ii.           Premium, as well as any applicable Conversion Premium payable hereunder, will be paid: (a) in
the Company’s sole and absolute discretion, immediately in cash; or (b) if Company notifies Investor it
will not pay all or any portion in cash, or to the extent cash is not paid and received as soon as
practicable, and in any event within 1 Trading Day after the Notice Time, for any reason whatsoever, in
shares of Common Stock valued at (i) if there has never been a Trigger Event, (A) 95.0% of the average
of the 5 lowest individual daily volume weighted average prices of the Common Stock on the Trading
Market during the applicable Measurement Period, which may be non-consecutive, less $0.05 per
share of Common Stock, not to exceed (B) 100% of the lowest sales price on the last day of such
Measurement Period less $0.05 per share of Common Stock (ii) following any Trigger Event, (A) 85.0%
of the lowest daily volume weighted average price during any Measurement Period for any conversion
by Investor, less $0.10 per share of Common Stock, not to exceed (B) 85.0% of the lowest sales price
on the last day of any Measurement Period, less $0.10 per share of Common Stock. In no event will the
value of Common Stock pursuant to the foregoing be below the par value per share. All amounts that
are required or permitted to be paid in cash pursuant to this Warrant will be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Investor.
iii.          The Premium Rate will adjust downward by an amount equal to the Spread Adjustment for each
amount, if any, equal to the Adjustment Factor that the Measuring Metric rises above the Maximum
Triggering Level, down to a minimum of 0.0%.
iv.           The Premium Rate will adjust upward by an amount equal to the Spread Adjustment for each
amount, if any, equal to the Adjustment Factor that the Measuring Metric falls below the Minimum
Triggering Level, up to a maximum of 24.95%. In addition, the Premium Rate will adjust upward by
10.0% following the occurrence of any Trigger Event.
v.            The adjusted Premium Rate used for calculation of the Liquidation Value, Conversion
Premium, Early Redemption Price and Premium, as applicable, and the amount of Premium owed will
be calculated and determined based upon the Measuring Metric at close of the Trading Market
immediately prior to the Notice Time.
4.          Mandatory Redemption. If the Company determines to liquidate, dissolve or wind-up its
business and affairs, the Company will prior to or concurrently with the closing, effectuation or
occurrence any such action, redeem the entire unexercised portion of this Warrant for cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Investor, at the Early Redemption
Price set forth in Section I.F.2 if the event is prior to the Warrant Maturity Date, or at the Liquidation
Value if the event is on or after the Warrant Maturity Date.
5.          Mechanics of Redemption. In order to redeem all or any portion of the Warrant then
outstanding, the Company must deliver written notice (each, a “Redemption Notice”) to Investor
setting forth (a) the portion of this Warrant that the Company is redeeming, (b) the applicable Premium
Rate, Liquidation Value and Early Redemption Price, and (c) the calculation of the amount paid. Upon
receipt of full payment in cash for a complete redemption, Investor will promptly submit to the
Company the original Warrant. In connection with a mandatory redemption, the notice will be delivered
as soon as the number of shares can be determined, and in all other instances at least 30 Trading
Days prior to payment. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of a Redemption Notice will not affect
Investor’s rights under Section I.G until after receipt of cash payment by Investor at the required time.
3
G.          Exercise.
1.           Mechanics of Exercise.
a.          Promptly upon the occurrence of any exercise provided for in Section I.B., Investor will deliver a
written notice to the Company and its transfer agent (“Conversion Notice” and with the Redemption
Notice, each an “Initial Notice”) of the exercise of this Warrant.
b.          Each Delivery Notice will set forth the amount of Warrant being converted, the minimum
number of Conversion Shares and the amount of Premium and any applicable Conversion Premium
due as of the time the Delivery Notice is given (the “Notice Time”), and the calculation thereof.
b.          If the Company notifies Investor by 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the Trading Day after the Notice
Time that it is paying all or any portion of Premium or Conversion Premium, and actually pays in cash
by the next Trading Day, time being of the essence, the full amount of Premium and Conversion
Premium stated in the Delivery Notice, no further amount will be due with respect thereto.
c.          As soon as practicable, and in any event within 1 Trading Day of the Notice Time, time being of
the essence, the Company will do all of the following: (i) transmit the Delivery Notice by facsimile or
electronic mail to the Investor, and to the Company’s transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) with
instructions to comply with the Delivery Notice; (ii) either (A) if the Company is approved through The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), authorize and instruct the credit by the Transfer Agent the
aggregate number of Conversion Shares set forth in the Delivery Notice, to Investor’s or its designee’s
balance account with the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) Program, through its
Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (DWAC) system, or (B) only if the Company is not approved through
DTC, issue and surrender to a common carrier for overnight delivery to the address as specified in the
Delivery Notice a certificate registered in the name of Investor or its designee, for the number of
Conversion Shares set forth in the Delivery Notice, bearing no restrictive legend unless a registration
statement covering the Conversion Shares is not effective and neither Company nor Investor provides
an opinion of counsel to the effect that Conversion Shares may be issued without restrictive legend;
and (iii) if it contends that the Delivery Notice is in any way incorrect, a through explanation of why and
its own calculation, or the Delivery Notice will conclusively be deemed correct for all purposes. The
Company will at all times diligently take or cause to be taken all actions reasonably necessary to cause
the Conversion Shares to be issued as soon as practicable.
4
d.          If during the Measurement Period the Investor is entitled to receive additional Conversion
Shares with regard to an Initial Notice, Investor may at any time deliver one or more additional written
notices to the Company or its transfer agent (each, an “Additional Notice” and with the Initial Notice,
each a “Delivery Notice”) setting forth the additional number of Conversion Shares to be delivered,
and the calculation thereof.
e.          If the Company for any reason does not issue or cause to be issued to the Investor within 3
Trading Days after the date of a Delivery Notice, the number of Conversion Shares stated in the
Delivery Notice, then, in addition to all other remedies available to the Investor, as liquidated damages
and not as a penalty, the Company will pay in cash to the Investor on each day after such 3rd Trading
Day that the issuance of such Conversion Shares is not timely effected an amount equal to 2% of the
product of (i) the aggregate number of Conversion Shares not issued to the Investor on a timely basis
and to which the Investor is entitled and (ii) the highest Closing Price of the Common Stock between
the date on which the Company should have issued such shares to the Investor and the actual date of
receipt of Conversion Shares by Investor. It is intended that the foregoing will serve to reasonably
compensate Investor for any delay in delivery of Conversion Shares, and not as punishment for any
breach by the Company. The Company acknowledges that the actual damages likely to result from
delay in delivery are difficult to estimate and would be difficult for Investor to prove.
f.          Notwithstanding any other provision: all of the requirements of Section I.F and this Section I.G
are each independent covenants; the Company’s obligations to issue and deliver Conversion Shares
upon any Delivery Notice are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable; any breach or alleged breach of
any representation or agreement, or any violation or alleged violation of any law or regulation, by any
party or any other person will not excuse full and timely performance of any of the Company’s
obligations under these sections; and under no circumstances may the Company seek or obtain any
temporary, interim or preliminary injunctive or equitable relief to prevent or interfere with any issuance
of Conversion Shares to Investor.
g.          If for any reason whatsoever Investor does not timely receive the number of Conversion Shares
stated in any Delivery Notice, Investor will be entitled to a compulsory remedy of immediate specific
performance, temporary, interim and, preliminary and final injunctive relief requiring Company and its
transfer agent, attorneys, officers and directors to immediately issue and deliver the number of
Conversion Shares stated by Investor, which requirement will not be stayed for any reason, without
the necessity of posting any bond, and which Company may not seek to stay or appeal.
h.          No fractional shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon conversion of this Warrant, but
rather the Company will issue to Investor scrip or warrants registered on the books of the Company
(certificated or uncertificated) which will entitle Investor to receive a full share upon the surrender of
such scrip or warrants aggregating a full share. The Investor will not be required to deliver the original
Warrant in order to effect a conversion hereunder. The Company will pay any and all taxes which may
be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of any Conversion Shares.
2.            Exercise. Upon receipt of the Conversion Notice, the Company will (a) satisfy the payment of
Premium and Conversion Premium as provided in Section I.F.3.a.ii, and (b) issue to Investor a number
of Conversion Shares equal to (i) the Purchase Price of the portion converted divided by (ii) the
applicable Conversion Price with respect to such portion of the Warrant; all in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section I.G.1.
5
3.          Stock Splits. If the Company at any time on or after the filing of this Warrant subdivides (by any
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares
of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the applicable Conversion Price, Adjustment
Factor, Maximum Triggering Level, Minimum Triggering Level, and other share based metrics in effect
immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced and the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable will be proportionately increased. If the Company at any time on or after such
Issuance Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the applicable Conversion
Price, Adjustment Factor, Maximum Triggering Level, Minimum Triggering Level, and other share
based metrics in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased and
the number of Conversion Shares will be proportionately decreased. Any adjustment under this
Section will become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination
becomes effective.

Common Stock with respect to rights to receive notices, reports and audited accounts from the
Company and with respect to attending stockholder meetings.

exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation set forth in the preceding sentence, the Delivery Notice
will specify the number of shares that may be delivered without exceeding the limitation, and any

being of the essence, including without limitation the issuance of restricted shares if counsel for
Company or Investor provides a legal opinion that shares may be issued without restrictive legend;
8
(b)          Any violation of or failure to timely perform any covenant or provision of this Warrant, the

Document or any other agreement with Investor will be untrue, incorrect, or misleading in any material
respect as of the date when made or deemed made;

order, or the Registration Statement, or the prospectus contained therein, is unavailable to Investor

(g)          The suspension from trading or the failure of the Common Stock to be trading or listed on the
Trading Market;
(h)           The Company notifies Investor, including without limitation, by way of public announcement
or through any of its attorneys, agents or representatives, of its intention not to comply, as required,
with a Conversion Notice under this Warrant or any other agreement with Investor at any time,
including without limitation any objection or instruction to its transfer agent not to comply with any
notice from Investor;
(i)          Bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings for the
relief of debtors will be instituted by or against the Company or any subsidiary other than CATI and, if
instituted against the Company or any subsidiary other than CATI by a third party, an order for relief is
entered or the proceedings are not dismissed within 30 days of their initiation;

without limitation timely filing when first due all periodic reports;
(m)       Any regulatory, administrative or enforcement proceeding is initiated against Company or any
subsidiary (except to the extent an adverse determination would not have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of operations or prevent the
performance by the Company of any material obligation under the Transaction Documents); or
(n)         Any material provision of this Warrant will at any time for any reason, other than pursuant to the
express terms thereof, cease to be valid and binding on or enforceable against the parties thereto, or
the validity or enforceability thereof will be contested by any party thereto, or a proceeding will be
commenced by the Company or any subsidiary or any governmental authority having jurisdiction over
any of them, seeking to establish the invalidity or unenforceability thereof, or the Company or any
subsidiary denies that it has any liability or obligation purported to be created under this Warrant.
2.           It is intended that all adjustments made following a Trigger Event will serve to reasonably
compensate Investor for the consequences and increased risk following a Trigger Event, and not as a
penalty or punishment for any breach by the Company. The Company acknowledges that the actual
damages likely to result from a Trigger Event are difficult to estimate and would be difficult for Investor
to prove.

Investor hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company that the following are true
and as of the date hereof and as of each Advance Date (collectively, the “Representations”):
 
Section 3.1            Organization and Authorization. The Investor is duly incorporated or organized and
validly existing in the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all requisite power and
authority to purchase and hold the securities issuable hereunder. The decision to invest and the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Investor, the performance by such Investor of its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by such Investor of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized and requires no other proceedings on the part of the Investor. The
Investor has the right, power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all related
instruments. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Investor and, assuming the
execution and delivery hereof and acceptance thereof by the Company, will constitute the legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Investor, enforceable against the Investor in accordance with its terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and except as enforceability may be
subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).
 
Section 3.2            Accredited Investor. The Investor is an “accredited investor” within the meaning of
Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act.
 
Section 3.3            Investment Experience; Access; Investigation.
 
(a)           Access to Information. The Investor, in making its investment decision hereunder, represents
that: (a) it has read, reviewed and relied solely on the publicly available information concerning the
Company and any independent investigation made by it and its representatives, if any; (b) it has been
afforded an opportunity to request from the Company to review, and has received, all additional
information requested from the Company, (c) it acknowledges that no person has been authorized to
give any information or to make any representation concerning the Company, the Convertible Notes or
the Conversion Shares, other than as contained in this Agreement, and if given or made, any such
other information or representation has not been relied upon as having been authorized by the
Company.
 
(b)           Reliance on Own Advisors. The Investor has relied on the advice of, or has consulted with, its
own tax, investment, legal or other advisors and has not relied on the Company, or any of its officers,
directors, attorneys, accountants, representatives, agents, or advisors for any advice, except to the
extent of information made publicly available by the Company including the Company’s SEC filings.
 
 
 
Non-Revolving Secured Line of Credit Agreement
 
Page 7 of 20
(c)           Capability to Evaluate. The Investor has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters, either directly or through its representatives or advisors, that it is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment, which risks are substantial.
 
(d)           Ability to Bear Economic Risk. The Investor understands and acknowledges that an
investment in the Convertible Notes and Conversion Shares involves a high degree of risk. The
Investor acknowledges that it has the ability to bear the economic risk of its investment pursuant to
this Agreement.
 
(e)           Investment; No Distribution. The Investor is acquiring the Convertible Notes and will acquire
the Conversion Shares solely for the Investor’s own account for investment purposes as a principal
and not with a view to the resale or distribution of all or any part thereof. The Investor is aware that
there may be legal and practical limits on the Investor’s ability to sell or dispose of the Convertible
Notes or any of the Conversion Shares and, therefore, that the Investor must bear the economic risk of
its investment for an indefinite period of time. The Investor acknowledges that it is possible that the
Investor may incur a total loss of its investment. The Investor has adequate means of providing for the
Investor’s current needs and possible contingencies and does not have a need for liquidity of this
investment. The Investor’s commitment to illiquid investments, including the investments provided for
herein, is reasonable in relation to the Investor’s net worth.
 
(f)           No General Solicitation. None of the Convertible Notes or the Conversion Shares were offered
to the Investor through, and the Investor is not aware of, any form of general solicitation or general
advertising with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including,
without limitation: (i) any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any
newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over television, radio or via the Internet, and (ii)
any seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any general solicitation or general
advertising. The Investor further understands that the Company is relying in part on this
representation to ensure compliance with the Securities Act.

Shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes have not been registered under the
Securities Act or registered or qualified under any securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction, are

the manner of the proposed transfer and, if requested by the Company, accompanied by (i) investment
representations by the transferee similar to those made by Investor in this Article III and (ii) an opinion
of counsel satisfactory to the Company to the effect that the proposed transfer may be effected
without registration under the Securities Act and without registration or qualification under applicable
state or other securities laws. Each Convertible Note and each certificate issued to evidence any
Conversion Shares shall bear a legend as follows (unless or until the Investor has provided the
Company a reasonably acceptable form of opinion that such Conversion Shares are not required to
bear such legend, and/or can be sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act):

THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR ANY STATE SECURITIES ACT. THE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN
ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR
HYPOTHECATED UNLESS (I) THEY SHALL HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933 AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES ACT, OR (II) THE CORPORATION SHALL
HAVE BEEN FURNISHED WITH AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, SATISFACTORY TO COUNSEL FOR THE
CORPORATION, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER ANY SUCH ACTS.

EXHIBIT A
 
THIS NOTE, AND THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF THIS NOTE
(THE “SECURITIES”) HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY AND MAY NOT
BE TRANSFERRED UNTIL (i) A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT” OR THE “SECURITIES ACT”) SHALL HAVE BECOME EFFECTIVE
WITH RESPECT THERETO OR (ii) RECEIPT BY THE COMPANY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY TO THE EFFECT THAT REGISTRATION UNDER
THE ACT IS NOT REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH PROPOSED TRANSFER NOR IS IN
VIOLATION OF ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THIS LEGEND SHALL BE ENDORSED
UPON ANY NOTE ISSUED IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS NOTE AND ANY SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON
CONVERSION OF THIS NOTE (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BELOW).
 
FORM OF CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE
 
[$__________][__________] to be Effective [__________] 
[Note #___]
 
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Lucas Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), hereby promises
to pay to the order of [_______________], and/or permitted assigns (the “Holder”), the aggregate
principal amount of [_______________] ([$___________________])(“Principal”), together with interest
on the unpaid principal amount hereof, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.
1.
Note Amount. This Convertible Promissory Note (this “Note”, “Promissory Note” or “Agreement”) evidences
amounts payable by the Company to the Holder in connection with an Advance made pursuant to that
certain Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement dated on or around August 30, 2015, but effective August
28, 2015, by and between the Company and the Holder (the “Line of Credit”). Certain capitalized terms used
herein, but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Line of Credit and this
Note shall be subject in all cases to the terms and conditions of the Line of Credit.
2.
Payment Terms. The Company promises to pay to Holder the balance of Principal, together with accrued
and unpaid interest (which shall accrue until the Maturity Date) on October 1, 2016 (the “Maturity Date”),
unless this Note is earlier prepaid as herein provided or earlier converted into Common Stock (as hereinafter
defined) of the Company pursuant to Sections 4 hereof. All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful
money of the United States of America. Payment shall be credited first to the accrued interest then due and
payable and the remainder to Principal.
Secured Convertible Promissory Note
[Note #____]
 
Page 1 of 10
3.
Interest. Interest on the outstanding portion of Principal of this Note shall accrue at a rate of six percent (6%)
per annum. All past-due principal and interest (which failure to pay such amounts shall be defined herein as
an “Event of Default”) shall bear interest at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum until paid in full (the
“Default Rate”). All computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year for actual days
elapsed.
a.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Note, the total liability for payments of interest and payments in the
nature of interest, including all charges, fees, exactions, or other sums which may at any time be deemed to
be interest, shall not exceed the limit imposed by the usury laws of the State of Texas or the applicable laws
of the United States of America, whichever shall be higher (the “Maximum Rate”).
In the event the total liability for payments of interest and payments in the nature of interest, including,
without limitation, all charges, fees, exactions or other sums which may at any time be deemed to be
interest, which for any month or other interest payment period exceeds the Maximum Rate, all sums in
b.
excess of those lawfully collectible as interest for the period in question (and without further agreement or
notice by, among or to the Holder the undersigned) shall be applied to the reduction of the principal
balance, with the same force and effect as though the undersigned had specifically designated such excess
sums to be so applied to the reduction of the principal balance and the Holder had agreed to accept such
sums as a premium-free prepayment of principal; provided, however, that the Holder may, at any time and
from time to time, elect, by notice in writing to the undersigned, to waive, reduce or limit the collection of any
sums in excess of those lawfully collectible as interest rather than accept such sums as a prepayment of the
principal balance. The undersigned does not intend or expect to pay nor does the Holder intend or expect to
charge, accept or collect any interest under this Note greater than the Maximum Rate.
c.
If any payment of principal or interest on this Note shall become due on a Saturday, Sunday or any other
day on which national banks are not open for business, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day. “Business Day” means a day other than (i) a Saturday, (ii) a Sunday or (iii) a day
on which commercial banks in Houston, Texas, are authorized or required to be closed for business.
4.Holder’s Option to Convert this Note.
a.
At any time prior to the payment in full by the Company of this Note, the Holder shall have the option to
convert the unpaid balance (Principal and accrued and unpaid interest, in each case subject to Section 4(l)
and 4(m)) on this Note (or any portion thereof) into shares of Common Stock (the “Shares” and the
“Common Stock”) of the Company (the “Conversion Option”) at the Conversion Price (each a “Conversion”).
The “Conversion Price” shall equal $1.50 per Share;
b.
In order to exercise this Conversion Option, the Holder shall surrender this Promissory Note to the
Company, accompanied by written notice of its intentions to exercise this Conversion Option, which notice
shall set forth the amount of this Promissory Note to be converted, and the Shares due, which shall be in the
form of Exhibit A, attached hereto (“Notice of Conversion”). The date that the Company receives the Notice
of Conversion shall be defined as the “Conversion Date.” Within ten (10) Business Days of the Company’s
receipt of the Notice of Conversion and this Note, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Holder, written confirmation that the Shares have been issued in the name of the Holder (the “Share
Delivery Deadline”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4, following
conversion of any portion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required
to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless (A) the full amount of the Note is being converted
(in which event this Note shall be delivered to the Company following conversion thereof) or (B) the Holder
has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Notice of
Conversion) requesting reissuance of this Note upon physical surrender of this Note. The Holder and the
Company shall maintain records showing the principal and interest converted and/or paid and/or adjusted
(as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments and/or adjustments (as the case
may be) or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not
to require physical surrender of this Note upon conversion;
Secured Convertible Promissory Note
[Note #____]
 
Page 2 of 10
If for any reason (including the operation of the adjustment provisions set forth in this Note), the Conversion
Price on any date of Conversion of this Note shall not be lawful and adequate consideration for the
issuance of the relevant Shares, then the Company shall take such steps as are necessary (including the
c.
amendment of its certificate of incorporation so as to reduce the par value of the Common Stock) to cause
such Conversion Price to be adequate and lawful consideration on the date the payment thereof is due, but
if the Company shall fail to take such steps, then the Company acknowledges that the Holder shall have
been damaged by the Company in an amount equal to an amount, which, when added to the total
Conversion Price for the relevant Shares, would equal lawful and adequate consideration for the issuance
of such Shares, and the Company irrevocably agrees that if the Holder shall then forgive the right to recover
such damages from the Company, such forgiveness shall constitute, and Company shall accept such
forgiveness as, additional lawful consideration for the issuance of the relevant Shares;
d.
The Company shall at all times take any and all additional actions as are necessary to maintain the
required authority to issue the Shares to the Holder, in the event the Holder exercises its rights under the
Conversion Option;
e.
Payment to Company prior to Holder’s delivery of a Notice of Conversion shall terminate Holder’s option to
convert;
f.
Conversion calculations pursuant to this Section 4, shall be rounded to the nearest whole share of Common
Stock, and no fractional shares shall be issuable by the Company upon conversion of this Note. Conversion
of this Note in full shall be deemed payment in full of this Note and this Note shall thereupon be cancelled;
g.
If the Company at any time or from time to time on or after the effective date of the issuance of this Note (the
“Original Issuance Date”) effects a subdivision of its outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price then
in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased, and conversely, if the
Company at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issuance Date combines its outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately
before the combination shall be proportionately increased;
h.
All Shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon Conversion of this Note will, upon issuance by the
Company in accordance with the terms of this Note, be validly issued, free from all taxes and liens with
respect to the issuance thereof (other than those created by the holders), free from all pre-emptive or similar
rights and be fully paid and non-assessable;
i.
On the date of any Conversion, all rights of any Holder with respect to the amount of this Note converted,
will terminate, except only for the rights of any such Holder to receive certificates (if applicable) for the
number of Shares of Common Stock which this Note has been Converted;
j.
Unless the Shares are eligible to be issued as free trading shares pursuant to the requirements of Rule 144
or otherwise, which shall be determined by the Company in its reasonable discretion, prior to the issuance
date of such Shares, such Shares shall be issued as restricted shares of Common Stock; and
The Company shall not be required to pay any tax allocated or attributed to Holder which may be payable in
respect to any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon Conversion in a
name other than that in which the shares of the Note so converted were registered, and no such issue or
delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the
Company the amount of any such tax, or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax
has been paid. The Company shall withhold from any payment due whatsoever in connection with the Note
any and all required withholdings and/or taxes the Company, in its sole discretion deems reasonable or
necessary, absent an opinion from Holder’s accountant or legal counsel, acceptable to the Company in its
sole determination, that such withholdings and/or taxes are not required to be withheld by the Company.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock to be

outstanding under this Note in cash to Holder.

provide the Holder a minimum of thirty (30) days prior written notice before the date of the Company’s
planned prepayment.
b.
Any partial prepayment shall be applied first to any accrued interest and then to any principal Loan amount
outstanding.

AMENDED AND RESTATED NON-REVOLVING
LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT
This FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED NON-REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT (this
“Amendment”) to the Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made and entered
into as of February 1, 2016 (the “Execution Date”) and is made effective for all purposes as of August
28, 2015 (the “Effective Date”) by and between Silver Star Oil Company, a Texas corporation (the
“Investor”) and Lucas Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”).
WHEREAS, the Company and the Investor desires to amend and restate the Agreement as set forth
below:
NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree to agree as follows:
1.
A new Section 8.17 shall be added as to the Agreement as follows:
Section 8.17.    Blocker. The Company agrees that it shall not effect any conversion of the Notes, and
the Investor shall not have the right to convert any portion of the Notes, pursuant to Section 4(a) or
otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, Investor (together with the
Investor’s affiliates), as set forth on the applicable Notice of Conversion, would beneficially own in
excess of 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving
effect to such conversion.  For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common
Stock beneficially owned by the Investor and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes with respect to which the determination of
such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would
be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of the Notes beneficially
owned by the Investor or any of its affiliates and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or
nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other
Notes) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein
beneficially owned by the Investor or any of its affiliates.  Except as set forth in the preceding
sentence, for purposes of this Section 8.17, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance
with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.  To the extent that the limitation contained in this section
applies, the determination of whether the Notes are convertible (in relation to other securities owned
by the Investor) and of which a portion of the Notes is convertible shall be in the sole discretion of
such Investor. To ensure compliance with this restriction, the Investor will be deemed to represent to
the Company each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not
violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the Company shall have no obligation to verify
or confirm the accuracy of such determination.  For purposes of this Section 8.17, in determining the
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Investor may rely on the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x) the Company’s most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K (or
such related form), as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z)
any other notice by the Company or the Company’s transfer agent setting forth the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding.  Upon the written or oral request of the Investor, the Company shall
within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Assignee the number of shares of
Common Stock then outstanding.  In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company,
including the Notes, by the Investor or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported.  The provisions of this Section 8.17 may be
waived by the Investor upon, at the election of the Investor, not less than 61 days’ prior notice to the
Company, and the provisions of this Section 4(d) shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such
later date, as determined by the Investor, as may be specified in such notice of waiver). The forgoing
provision shall be treated as if a provision of the Notes.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to be executed and delivered
as of the date set forth on the first page hereof.

Re:LUCAS ENERGY, INC. (“Lucas”); NON-REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT,
Entered into on August 30, 2015, and the associated Convertible Notes
Dear Mr. Chambers:
I am writing to provide Silver Star Energy Company (“Silver Star”) the required thirty days’ written
notice of Lucas’ intent to prepay those certain four (4) outstanding Convertible Promissory Notes each
in the amount of $200,000, dated September 28, 2015, October 23, 2015 to be effective October 21,
2015, November 25, 2015 to be effective on November 23, 2015, and January 4, 2016 to be effective on
December 31, 2015 (collectively, the “Notes”), pursuant to Section 5(a) of such Notes.
Additionally, Silver Star has not yet paid Lucas the $200,000 owed for January 2016, which is required
to be paid by Silver Star by February 1, 2016, pursuant to the terms of that certain Non-Revolving Line
of Credit Agreement dated August 30, 2016. Lucas formally makes written demand for the immediate
payment of such $200,000 tranche.
Lucas is inclined to take no further action at this time, while reserving our right to do so, in exchange
for your agreement to amend our agreement(s) as follows:
1.
Silver Star waives its right to consent(s) under the following sections in the Line of Credit: Section 1.1h,
Section 7.9, Section 7.10, and Section 7.11,
2.
Silver Star agrees to issue to Lucas the balance ($1.4 to $1.6 million) of the Line of Credit by February 19,
2016, or if said payment not made, forego the thirty notice period in each outstanding note, by replacing the
existing language of Section 5(a) of each note and replace it with the following language: “a. This Note may
be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty.”

Phone: (713) 528-1881
Fax: (713) 337-1510
Finally, we have been advised that a company seeking to raise capital may suffer significant adverse
consequences from engaging an unlicensed intermediary. Therefore, we advise you to refrain from
contacting third parties regarding making direct investments in Lucas. Obviously, Silver Star is free to
seek whatever business and financial arrangements it may choose. This is a serious issue and
“finders” and unregistered broker-dealers have been subject to permanent injunctions and penalties
for failing to register and then selling securities.
John, I would hope you are agreeable to the above as we advance the company for the benefit of all
parties.
Kind Regards,
LUCAS ENERGY,INC.

pursuant to the terms of the April 11, 2015, Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit

Segundo Resources, LLC, as a seller and as a representative of the sellers named therein (the

(g)          Effective as of the Effective Date, a new Section 8.17 shall be added to the Line of Credit as
follows:
“Section 8.17. Blocker. The Investor shall not have the right to convert any portion of the Notes,
pursuant to Section 4(a) thereof or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion,
Investor (together with the Investor’s affiliates), as set forth on the applicable Notice of Conversion,
would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding
immediately after giving effect to such conversion (the “Blocker”). For purposes of the foregoing
sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Investor and its affiliates
shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes with
respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of
shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining,
nonconverted portion of the Notes beneficially owned by the Investor or any of its affiliates which
include a similar Blocker and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion
of any other securities of Lucas (including, without limitation, any other Notes) subject to a limitation
on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the
Investor or any of its affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this
Section 8.17, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act. To the extent that the limitation contained in this section applies, the determination of
whether the Notes are convertible (in relation to other securities owned by the Investor) and of which a
portion of the Notes is convertible shall be in the sole discretion of such Investor. To ensure
compliance with this restriction, the Investor will be deemed to represent to Lucas each time it delivers
a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this
paragraph and Lucas shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.
For purposes of this Section 8.17, in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock,
the Investor may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x)
Lucas’s most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K (or such related form), as the case may be, (y) a more
recent public announcement by Lucas or (z) any other notice by Lucas or Lucas’s transfer agent
setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of
the Investor, Lucas shall within two Business Days confirm orally and in writing to the Investor the
number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares
of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of
Lucas, including the Notes, by the Investor or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The provisions of this Section 8.17 may be
waived by the Investor upon, at the election of the Investor, not less than 61 days’ prior written notice
to Lucas, and the provisions of this Section 8.17 shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such
later date, as determined by the Investor, as may be specified in such notice of waiver). The foregoing
provision shall be treated as if a provision of the Notes.”

Section 6.1(d), Section 6.2(a), Section 7.9, Section 7.10, Section 7.11 and Section 7.12.

April [11], 2017. For the sake of clarity, the Outstanding Notes shall be due on April [11], 2017.
(j)           Effective as of Effective Date, a new Section 4(m) shall be added to each of the Outstanding
Notes and the Form of Convertible Promissory Note (which shall govern all Future Notes as defined

Blocker. The Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note, pursuant to Section 4(a)
hereof or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, Holder (together with the
Holder’s affiliates), as set forth on the applicable Notice of Conversion, would beneficially own in excess of
9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such
conversion (the “Blocker”). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common
Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Note with respect to which the determination of such sentence is
being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A)

this Section 4(m), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act. To the extent that the limitation contained in this section applies, the determination of
whether the Note is convertible (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder) and of which a portion

The provisions of this Section 4(m) may be waived by the Holder upon, at the election of the Holder, not
less than 61 days’ prior written notice to Lucas, and the provisions of this Section 4(m) shall continue to
apply until such 61st day (or such later date, as determined by the Holder, as may be specified in such
notice of waiver). The foregoing provision shall be treated as if a provision of the Notes.”

3.            Grant of Warrants. As additional consideration for TALL agreeing to the Assignment and the
amendments to the Line of Credit and Outstanding Notes described in Section 2, above, Lucas agrees
to grant Silver Star warrants to purchase 51,562 shares of Lucas’s common stock for each $250,000
borrowed by Lucas under the Line of Credit after the date of this Agreement (i.e., warrants to purchase
0.20625 shares of Common Stock for each dollar borrowed)(the “Warrants”), which Warrants shall
have an exercise price of $3.25 per share and the terms and conditions set forth in the form of Warrant
attached hereto as Exhibit A.
4.            Sales of Future Notes and Grant of Warrants Subject to the Terms of the April 6, 2016
Securities Purchase Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement Entered Into Between Lucas and an
Accredited Investor. The sales of any Future Notes (as defined below) under the Line of Credit and the
grant of Warrants hereunder shall be subject in all cases to the restrictions set forth in Section IV.L of
that certain April 6, 2016 (a) Securities Purchase Agreement and (b) Stock Purchase Agreement
entered into between Lucas and an accredited investor, as described by Lucas in its Current Report
on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 7, 2016, including a
restriction on Lucas selling not more than $250,000 per month in private placements of securities,
subject to all such securities being restricted for a period of six months from their issuance date
(collectively, the “Restrictions”). In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement, the
Line of Credit, Warrants, Outstanding Notes or Future Notes (as defined below)(collectively the
“Securities Agreements”) and the Restrictions, the Restrictions shall control and the Securities
Agreements shall be modified automatically to comply with such Restrictions.
5.            Representations of TALL. TALL hereby represents and warrants to Lucas in connection with
the grant of the Warrants and the Assignment of the Line of Credit and the Outstanding Notes, which
representations set forth in this Section 5 shall be deemed re-confirmed and re-represented each time
that (i) Warrants are granted to TALL pursuant to Section 3 hereof; (ii) Outstanding Notes are
converted into common stock of Lucas pursuant to the terms thereof by TALL; or (iii) Convertible
Promissory Notes are sold to TALL pursuant to the terms of the Line of Credit after the date hereof
(“Future Notes”) (provided that TALL shall also be deemed to make the representations set forth in the
Line of Credit upon each future sale of Convertible Promissory Notes thereunder and shall further be
deemed to make the representations in the Outstanding Notes upon each conversion of such notes in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof), that:
(a)          TALL is an “accredited investor,” as such term is defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), and is acquiring the Outstanding Notes, will acquire any Future
Notes, will acquire the shares of Lucas common stock issuable upon conversion of the Outstanding
Notes and any Future Notes and will acquire the Warrants and the shares of Lucas common stock
issuable upon exercise of such Warrants (collectively, the “Securities”) for its own account and not
with a view to a sale or distribution thereof as that term is used in Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in a
manner which would require registration under the 1933 Act or any state securities laws. TALL has
such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that TALL is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of the Securities. TALL can bear the economic risk of the Securities, has
knowledge and experience in financial business matters and is capable of bearing and managing the
risk of investment in the Securities. TALL recognizes that the Securities have not been registered
under the 1933 Act, nor under the securities laws of any state and, therefore, cannot be resold unless
the resale of the Securities is registered under the 1933 Act or unless an exemption from registration is
available. TALL has carefully considered and has, to the extent TALL believes such discussion
necessary, discussed with its professional, legal, tax and financial advisors, the suitability of an
investment in the Securities for its particular tax and financial situation and its advisers, if such
advisors were deemed necessary, and has determined that the Securities are a suitable investment for
it. TALL has not been offered the Securities by any form of general solicitation or advertising,
including, but not limited to, advertisements, articles, notices or other communications published in
any newspaper, magazine, or other similar media or television or radio broadcast or any seminar or
meeting where, to TALL’s knowledge, those individuals that have attended have been invited by any
such or similar means of general solicitation or advertising. TALL has had an opportunity to ask
questions of and receive satisfactory answers from Lucas, or any person or persons acting on behalf
of Lucas, concerning the terms and conditions of the Securities and Lucas, and all such questions
have been answered to the full satisfaction of TALL. Lucas has not supplied TALL any information
regarding the Securities or an investment in the Securities other than as contained in this Agreement,
and TALL is relying on its own investigation and evaluation of Lucas and the Securities and not on
any other information.

(b)          TALL is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
conducted. TALL is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the failure to so qualify would have a material adverse effect on its business or properties.
(c)          All corporate action has been taken on the part of TALL, its officers, directors and
stockholders necessary for the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement. TALL has
taken all corporate action required to make all of the obligations of TALL reflected in the provisions of
this Agreement, valid and enforceable obligations.
(d)          TALL is aware that the conversion of the Outstanding Notes and Future Notes, and if the NYSE
MKT requires aggregation of all such securities, the exercise of the Warrants, will be, and are, limited
by the requirement to obtain NYSE Approval and Stockholder Approval, and until such time as Lucas
receives Stockholder Approval for the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion and
exercise thereof, as applicable, none of such securities will be convertible or exercisable.
(e)          Each certificate or instrument representing Securities will be endorsed with the following
legend (or a substantially similar legend), unless or until registered under the 1933 Act:

14.          Severability. Every provision of this Agreement is intended to be severable. If, in any
jurisdiction, any term or provision hereof is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) the
remaining terms and provisions hereof shall be unimpaired, (b) any such invalidity or unenforceability
in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other

ARTICLE VII.
REGISTRATION RIGHTS
7.1.        Registration Statement. At such time as the Company has raised a minimum of $1,000,000 in
equity and/or convertible debt funding, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days prepare and file with
the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-1 (or if available, on Form S-3)
(together with the prospectus and any amendments, including post-effective amendments, or
supplements thereto, and all exhibits and all material incorporated by reference therein as applicable,
the “Registration Statement”) providing for the registration for resale by the Purchaser, under the
Securities Act of all of the Registrable Securities. The Registration Statement shall comply in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable SEC form and shall
include all information, financial statements, financial statement schedules, and exhibits required by
the SEC to be included therein. Purchaser shall provide the Company with such information to be
included in the Registration Statement as the Company may reasonably request. The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement in a
reasonable timeframe, subject to any delay resulting from a review by the SEC or SEC comments
received by the Company. The Company shall furnish, without charge, and on a timely basis, to each
holder of Registrable Securities such number of copies of the Registration Statement (including the
prospectus), each amendment and supplement thereto, and such other documents as such holder
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities included
therein owned by such holder. In the event that the SEC does not permit the Company to register all of
the Registrable Securities, the Company shall promptly notify Purchaser and thereafter register in the
initial registration statement the maximum number of Registrable Securities as permitted by the SEC.
Thereafter, the Company shall prepare and file subsequent registration statements to register the
Registrable Securities that were not registered in the initial registration statement as promptly as
practicable and in a manner permitted by the SEC (each registration statement filed after the initial
registration statement to register the Registrable Securities, if any, shall be included in the definition of
“Registration Statement” used herein).

Purchase Agreement
7.2.        Registration Indemnification Rights. The Company agrees to indemnify and reimburse and
hold harmless, to the extent permitted by law, each holder of shares of the Common Stock named as a
selling shareholder in the Registration Statement against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expense (including reasonable legal expenses and any expenses incurred in investigating any claims)
caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration
Statement or prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or any other violation or
breach of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any state securities or blue sky laws (“Blue Sky
Laws”) by the Company or any other Person acting on its behalf, except, as to the holder of
Registrable Securities, insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished by
Written Notice to the Company by such holder of Registrable Securities specifically for use in the
preparation of the Registration Statement, by such holder’s failure to deliver a copy of the Registration
Statement or prospectus after the Company has furnished a sufficient number of copies of the same
or by such holder’s failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, or any Blue Sky Laws applicable to it.
7.3.        Amendments to Registration Statement. In connection with the Registration Statement, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) promptly prepare and file with the SEC any such
amendments to the Registration Statement and supplements to the prospectus contained therein as
may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective for a reasonable period of time after the
filing date thereof, provided that the Registration Statement shall not be required to be filed, updated or
supplemented after the earlier of such time as all of such Registrable Securities have been disposed of
in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such
Registration Statement or until such Registrable Securities have been sold or may be sold without the
requirement to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1) and otherwise without volume or other restriction
pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act; and (ii) prepare and promptly file with the SEC and promptly
notify the selling shareholders named in the Registration Statement of the filing of such amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement or prospectus that is part of the Registration Statement as
may be necessary to correct any statements or omissions if, at the time when a prospectus relating to
such securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event shall have occurred as
the result of which any such prospectus or any other prospectus as then in effect would include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

7.4.       Costs of Registration. The Company shall pay all of their own expenses incident to their
performance of or compliance with this ARTICLE VII, including all registration and filing fees, printing,
messenger, telephone and delivery expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel for them and fees
and disbursements of all independent auditors of the Company. Each holder of shares of the
Company Common Stock named as a selling shareholder in the Registration Statement shall pay all of
its own expenses, including, but not limited to, fees and disbursements of its counsel and any broker
fees and commissions.
7.5.       Notice to Purchaser. the Company shall advise Purchaser, promptly after it shall receive notice
or obtain knowledge of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC delaying or suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of the initiation of any proceeding for that purpose; and
it will promptly use its commercially reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order
or to obtain its withdrawal at the earliest possible moment if such stop order should be issued.
7.6.       Cease Trading. Purchaser agrees that if it is notified by the Company by Written Notice at any
time that any Registration Statement registering the resale of the Registrable Securities is not effective,
contains any misstatements or omissions, that the prospectus included in such Registration
Statement no longer complies with the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act, or that the
prospectus or Registration Statement can no longer be relied upon for any reason, Purchaser will
refrain from selling such Registrable Securities covered thereby until such time as Purchaser is
notified by the Company that such Registration Statement is effective or such prospectus is compliant
with Section 10 of the Securities Act, unless Purchaser is able to, and does, sell the Company
Common Stock pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 of
the Securities Act.
ARTICLE VIII.

8.2.        Entire Agreement. This Agreement, and the documents referred to herein constitute the entire
agreement between the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and any and all other
written or oral agreements relating to the subject matter hereof existing between the parties hereto are
expressly canceled.
8.3.        Amendments. This Agreement and any terms hereof may not be amended, supplemented or
modified except pursuant to a writing signed by both the Purchaser and the Company.
8.4.        Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the respective parties hereto shall be

to insist upon strict performance or to enforce such provision or any other provision on any
subsequent occasion. Any waiver must be by Written Notice.
8.8.        Successors and Assigns. Neither the Company nor the Purchaser may assign its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of the other party. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Purchaser and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

8.9.        Further Assurances. Each party hereto, at the reasonable request of the other party hereto,

other jurisdiction.
8.12.      Governing Law. This Agreement and any note and the rights and obligations of the parties

demand, action, or cause of action arising out of or based upon this Agreement, the subject matter
hereof, any note or the subject matter thereof, in each case whether now existing or hereafter arising
and whether in contract or tort or otherwise. Each of the Company and the Purchaser acknowledge
that it has been informed by the other parties hereto that the provisions of this section constitute a
material inducement upon which such other parties have relied, are relying and will rely in entering into
this Agreement. Any party may file an original counterpart or a copy of this section with any court as
written evidence of the consent of the Company and the Purchaser to the waiver of its rights to trial by
jury.
8.14.     No Presumption from Drafting. This Agreement has been negotiated at arm’s-length between

parties have had the opportunity to draft, review and/or edit the language of this Agreement, no
presumption for or against any party arising out of drafting all or any part of this Agreement will be
applied in any action relating to, connected with or involving this Agreement. In particular, any rule of
law, legal decisions, or common law principles of similar effect that would require interpretation of any
ambiguities in this Agreement against the party that has drafted it, is of no application and is hereby
expressly waived. The provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a reasonable manner to
affect the intentions of the parties.

hereof shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach hereof.
8.17.      Counterparts, Effect of Facsimile, Emailed and Photocopied Signatures. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any
Addendums hereto or thereto, may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .peg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an
“Electronic Delivery”) shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart
and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party shall raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or
the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the
use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party forever
waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

EXHIBIT A
THIS NOTE, AND THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF THIS NOTE
(THE “SECURITIES”) HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY AND MAY NOT
BE TRANSFERRED UNTIL (i) A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT” OR THE “SECURITIES ACT”) SHALL HAVE BECOME EFFECTIVE
WITH RESPECT THERETO OR (ii) RECEIPT BY THE COMPANY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY TO THE EFFECT THAT REGISTRATION UNDER
THE ACT IS NOT REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH PROPOSED TRANSFER NOR IS IN
VIOLATION OF ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THIS LEGEND SHALL BE ENDORSED
UPON ANY NOTE ISSUED IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS NOTE AND ANY SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON
CONVERSION OF THIS NOTE (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BELOW).
FORM OF CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE
[$__________]
[Initial/Second/Third] Tranche Note
[__________] to be Effective [__________]
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Lucas Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), hereby promises
to pay to the order of HFT Enterprises, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, and/or permitted
assigns (the “Holder”), the aggregate principal amount of [_______________] dollars
([$___________________])(“Principal”), together with interest on the unpaid principal amount hereof,
upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.
1.
Note Amount. This Convertible Promissory Note (this “Note”, “Promissory Note” or “Agreement”)
evidences amounts payable by the Company to the Holder in connection with that certain Convertible
Promissory Note Purchase Agreement dated on or around March 29, 2016, to be effective March 11, 2016,
by and between the Company and the Holder, and specifically [Initial/Second/Third] Tranche Note
thereunder (the “Note Purchase Agreement”). Certain capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise
defined shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement and this Note shall
be subject in all cases to the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement.
2.
Payment Terms. The Company promises to pay to Holder the balance of Principal, together with accrued
and unpaid interest (which shall accrue until the Maturity Date) on the date twelve months from the effective
date set forth above (the “Maturity Date”), unless this Note is earlier prepaid as herein provided or earlier
converted into Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) of the Company pursuant to Section 4 hereof. All
payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America. Payment shall be
credited first to the accrued interest then due and payable and the remainder to Principal.
Convertible Promissory Note
[Initial/Second/Third] Tranche Note
Page 1 of 12
3.
Interest. Interest on the outstanding portion of Principal of this Note shall accrue at a rate of six percent (6%)
per annum. All past-due principal and interest (which failure to pay such amounts shall be defined herein as
an “Event of Default”) shall bear interest at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum until paid in full (the
“Default Rate”). All computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year for actual days
elapsed.
a.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Note, the total liability for payments of interest and payments in the
nature of interest, including all charges, fees, exactions, or other sums which may at any time be deemed to
be interest, shall not exceed the limit imposed by the usury laws of the State of Texas or the applicable laws
of the United States of America, whichever shall be higher (the “Maximum Rate”).
b.
In the event the total liability for payments of interest and payments in the nature of interest, including,
without limitation, all charges, fees, exactions or other sums which may at any time be deemed to be
interest, which for any month or other interest payment period exceeds the Maximum Rate, all sums in
excess of those lawfully collectible as interest for the period in question (and without further agreement or
notice by, among or to the Holder the undersigned) shall be applied to the reduction of the principal
balance, with the same force and effect as though the undersigned had specifically designated such excess
sums to be so applied to the reduction of the principal balance and the Holder had agreed to accept such
sums as a premium-free prepayment of principal; provided, however, that the Holder may, at any time and
from time to time, elect, by notice in writing to the undersigned, to waive, reduce or limit the collection of any
sums in excess of those lawfully collectible as interest rather than accept such sums as a prepayment of the
principal balance. The undersigned does not intend or expect to pay nor does the Holder intend or expect to
charge, accept or collect any interest under this Note greater than the Maximum Rate.
c.
If any payment of principal or interest on this Note shall become due on a Saturday, Sunday or any other
day on which national banks are not open for business, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day.
4.Holder’s Option to Convert this Note.
a.
At any time prior to the payment in full by the Company of this Note, and after the approval of the additional
listing of the applicable Shares by the NYSE MKT and subject to Section 4(l) and Section 4(m) below, the
Holder shall have the option to convert the unpaid balance (Principal and accrued and unpaid interest) on
this Note (or any portion thereof) into shares of Common Stock (the “Shares” and the “Common Stock”) of
the Company (the “Conversion Option”) at the Conversion Price (each a “Conversion”). The “Conversion
Price” shall equal $1.50 per Share;
Convertible Promissory Note
[Initial/Second/Third] Tranche Note
Page 2 of 12
b.
In order to exercise this Conversion Option, the Holder shall surrender this Promissory Note to the
Company, accompanied by written notice of its intentions to exercise this Conversion Option, which notice
shall set forth the amount of this Promissory Note to be converted, and the Shares due, which shall be in the
form of Exhibit A, attached hereto (“Notice of Conversion”). The date that the Company receives the Notice
of Conversion shall be defined as the “Conversion Date.” Within ten (10) Business Days of the Company’s
receipt of the Notice of Conversion and this Note, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Holder, written confirmation that the Shares have been issued in the name of the Holder (the “Share
Delivery Deadline”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4, following
conversion of any portion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required
to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless (A) the full amount of the Note is being converted
(in which event this Note shall be delivered to the Company following conversion thereof) or (B) the Holder
has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Notice of
Conversion) requesting reissuance of this Note upon physical surrender of this Note. The Holder and the
Company shall maintain records showing the principal and interest converted and/or paid and/or adjusted
(as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments and/or adjustments (as the case
may be) or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not
to require physical surrender of this Note upon conversion;
If for any reason (including the operation of the adjustment provisions set forth in this Note), the Conversion
Price on any date of Conversion of this Note shall not be lawful and adequate consideration for the
issuance of the relevant Shares, then the Company shall take such steps as are necessary (including the
amendment of its certificate of incorporation so as to reduce the par value of the Common Stock) to cause
such Conversion Price to be adequate and lawful consideration on the date the payment thereof is due, but
if the Company shall fail to take such steps, then the Company acknowledges that the Holder shall have
been damaged by the Company in an amount equal to an amount, which, when added to the total
Conversion Price for the relevant Shares, would equal lawful and adequate consideration for the issuance
of such Shares, and the Company irrevocably agrees that if the Holder shall then forgive the right to recover
such damages from the Company, such forgiveness shall constitute, and Company shall accept such
forgiveness as, additional lawful consideration for the issuance of the relevant Shares;
c.
Convertible Promissory Note
[Initial/Second/Third] Tranche Note
Page 3 of 12
d.
The Company shall at all times take any and all additional actions as are necessary to maintain the
required authority to issue the Shares to the Holder, in the event the Holder exercises its rights under the
Conversion Option;
e.
Payment of the Note in full by the Company prior to Holder’s delivery of a Notice of Conversion shall
terminate Holder’s option to convert;
f.
Conversion calculations pursuant to this Section 4, shall be rounded to the nearest whole share of Common
Stock, and no fractional shares shall be issuable by the Company upon conversion of this Note. Conversion
of this Note in full shall be deemed payment in full of this Note and this Note shall thereupon be cancelled;
g.
If the Company at any time or from time to time on or after the effective date of the issuance of this Note (the
“Original Issuance Date”) effects a subdivision of its outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price
then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased, and conversely, if the
Company at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issuance Date combines its outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately
before the combination shall be proportionately increased;
h.
All Shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon Conversion of this Note will, upon issuance by the
Company in accordance with the terms of this Note, be validly issued, free from all taxes and liens with
respect to the issuance thereof (other than those created by the holders), free from all pre-emptive or similar
rights and be fully paid and non-assessable;
i.
On the date of any Conversion, all rights of any Holder with respect to the amount of this Note converted,
will terminate, except only for the rights of any such Holder to receive certificates (if applicable) for the
number of Shares of Common Stock which this Note has been Converted;
j.
Unless the Shares are eligible to be issued as free trading shares pursuant to the requirements of Rule 144
or otherwise, which shall be determined by the Company in its reasonable discretion, prior to the issuance
date of such Shares, such Shares shall be issued as restricted shares of Common Stock; and
Convertible Promissory Note
[Initial/Second/Third] Tranche Note
Page 4 of 12
k.
The Company shall not be required to pay any tax allocated or attributed to Holder which may be payable
in respect to any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon Conversion in
a name other than that in which the shares of the Note so converted were registered, and no such issue or
delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the
Company the amount of any such tax, or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax
has been paid. The Company shall withhold from any payment due whatsoever in connection with the Note
any and all required withholdings and/or taxes the Company, in its sole discretion, deems reasonable or
necessary, absent an opinion from Holder’s accountant or legal counsel, acceptable to the Company in its
sole determination, that such withholdings and/or taxes are not required to be withheld by the Company.
 
The applicable portion of this Note shall not be convertible during any time that, and only to the extent that,
the number of Shares to be issued to Holder upon such Conversion, when added to the number of shares
of Common Stock, if any, that the Holder otherwise beneficially owns (outside of this Note, and not
l.
m.
including any other securities of the Company held by Holder having a provision substantially similar to this
paragraph) at the time of such Conversion, would exceed 9.99% (the “Maximum Percentage”) of the
number of shares of Common Stock of the Company outstanding immediately after giving effect to the
issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon Conversion of this Note held by the Holder, as
determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Beneficial Ownership Limitation”). The Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 4(l)
may be waived by Holder, at the election of such Holder, upon not less than sixty-one (61) days prior
written notice to the Company, to change the Beneficial Ownership Limitation to any other percentage of
the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of
shares of Common Stock upon Conversion of the Note held by the Holder.  The provisions of this
paragraph shall not be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the
terms of this Section 4(l) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or
inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or
supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued in connection with (a) the Conversion of this Note, and any other Notes issued in connection with
the Note Purchase Agreement (“Other Notes”); and (b) the exercise of the Warrants granted pursuant to the
Note Purchase Agreement, shall not (i) exceed 19.9% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
immediately prior to the date of the Note Purchase Agreement, (ii) exceed 19.9% of the combined voting
power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to the date of the Note
Purchase Agreement, in each of subsections (i) and (ii) before the issuance of the Common Stock upon
conversion of this Note or the Other Notes or exercise of the Warrants, or (iii) otherwise exceed such
number of shares of Common Stock that would violate applicable listing rules of the NYSE MKT in the
event the Company’s shareholders do not approve the issuance of the Common Stock upon the conversion
of this Note or the Other Notes and exercise of the Warrants, in each of (i) through (iii), only to the extent
required by applicable NYSE MKT rules and guidance (the “Share Cap”). In the event the number of
shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of this Note or the Other Notes and/or exercise of
the Warrants exceeds the Share Cap, then this Note and the Other Notes, or applicable portions thereof
shall cease being convertible, the Warrants or applicable portions thereof shall cease being exercisable,
and the Company shall instead repay such Note and Other Notes (or portions thereof) in cash, and such
Warrants shall have no further rights, or if required, the Company shall first obtain the Stockholder Approval
(as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement).

the Company shall have breached in any respect any term, condition, warrant, representation or covenant

performance of any agreement contained herein or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms
hereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise. In case of a
default in the payment of any principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this Note, the Company will pay to
 
Holder such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable cost and expenses of collection,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses and disbursements. No course of dealing

If Warrant Shares are issued in such a cashless exercise, the parties acknowledge and agree that in
accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, the Warrant Shares shall take on the registered

exercised may be tacked on to the holding period of the Warrant Shares. The Company agrees not to
take any position contrary to this Section 2.3.
“VWAP” means, for any date, the price determined by the first of the following clauses that applies: (a)
if the Common Stock is then listed or quoted on a Principal Market, the daily volume weighted average

which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted as reported by Bloomberg (based on a Trading Day
from 9:30 a.m. (New York City time) to 4:02 p.m. (New York City time)), (b) if OTCQB or OTCQX is not a
Principal Market, the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for such date (or the
nearest preceding date) on OTCQB or OTCQX as applicable, (c) if the Common Stock is not then listed

its functions of reporting prices), the most recent bid price per share of the Common Stock so

designee’s balance account with The Depository Trust Company through its Deposit or Withdrawal at
Custodian system (“DWAC”) if the Company is then a participant in such system and either (A) there is
an effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the Warrant Shares to or resale of the
Warrant Shares by the Holder or (B) the Warrant Shares are eligible for resale by the Holder pursuant
to Rule 144, and otherwise by physical delivery of a certificate, registered in the Company’s share
register in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Warrant Shares to which the
Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of
Exercise by the date that is three (3) Trading Days after the delivery to the Company of the Notice of
Exercise (such date, the “Warrant Share Delivery Date”). The Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have
been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to
have become a holder of record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been
exercised, with payment to the Company of the Exercise Price (or by cashless exercise, if permitted)
and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, pursuant to Section 2.4.6 prior to the issuance of
such shares, having been paid.
2.4.2       Delivery of New Warrants Upon Exercise. If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the
Company shall, at the request of a Holder and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of
delivery of the Warrant Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder
to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all
other respects be identical with this Warrant.
2.4.3       Rescission Rights. If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder
the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 2.4.1 by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will
have the right to rescind such exercise.
2.4.4       Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Warrant Shares Upon Exercise. In
addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to
transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4.1 above
pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date (a “Delivery Failure”), and if after
such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise)
or the Holder’s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction
of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such
exercise (a “Buy-In”), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by
which (x) the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of
Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of
Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise
at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was
executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent
number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise
shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would
have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations
hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of
$11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with an
aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the
immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder
shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of
the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein
shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity
including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to
the Company’s failure to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as
required pursuant to the terms hereof.

2.4.5        No Fractional Shares or Scrip. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares
shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would
otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall, at its election, either pay a
cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share.
2.4.6        Charges, Taxes and Expenses. Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to
the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of
Warrant Shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such Warrant
Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the
Holder; provided, however, that in the event that Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than
the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the
Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder and the Company may require, as a
condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto.
The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of
Exercise and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation
performing similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery of the Warrant Shares.
2.4.7        Closing of Books. The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any
manner which prevents the timely exercise of this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.
2.4.8        Disputes. In the case of a dispute as to the determination of the Exercise Price or the
arithmetic calculation of the number of Warrant Shares to be issued pursuant to the terms hereof, the
Company shall promptly issue to the Holder the number of Warrant Shares that are not disputed and
resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 5.16.

2.5.          Holder’s Exercise Limitations. The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and
a Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or
otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise as set forth on the
applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder’s Affiliates, and any other Persons
acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder’s Affiliates), would beneficially own in
excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing
sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates
shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with
respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of
Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of
this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of
the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without
limitation, any other Common Stock equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise
analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates.
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2.5, beneficial ownership
shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not representing to
the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the
Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the
extent that the limitation contained in this Section 2.5 applies, the determination of whether this
Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates)
and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the
submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder’s determination of whether this
Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates)
and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such
determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be
determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2.5, in determining the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
as reflected in (A) the Company’s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as
the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written
notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days
confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In
any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect
to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its
Affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was
reported. The “Beneficial Ownership Limitation” shall be 9.99% of the number of shares of the
Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and
implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2.5 to
correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended
Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or
desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall
apply to a successor holder of this Warrant. The Holder shall have been deemed to confirm that any
conversion set forth in a notice of conversion complies with the Beneficial Ownership Limitation and
the Company shall not be required to independently verify such compliance.

2.6.          Issuance Restrictions. The Company shall not issue any shares of Common Stock upon
exercise of this Warrant if the issuance of such shares of Common Stock (taken together with the
issuance of all other shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes) would exceed the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue upon exercise or
conversion (as the case may be) of the Warrants, the Notes or otherwise pursuant to the respective
terms thereof without breaching the Company’s obligations under the rules or regulations of the
Principal Market (the number of shares which may be issued without violating such rules and
regulations, the “Exchange Cap”), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the
Company (A) obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the
Principal Market for issuances of shares of Common Stock in excess of such amount or (B) obtains a
written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which
opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holder. Until such approval or such written opinion is
obtained, no initial purchaser of Notes on the Initial Issuance Date (each, a “Buyer”) shall be issued in
the aggregate, upon conversion or exercise (as the case may be) of any Notes, or any of the Warrants
or otherwise pursuant to the terms of the Warrants or the Notes, shares of Common Stock in an
amount greater than the product of (i) the Exchange Cap as of the Issuance Date multiplied by (ii) the
quotient of (1) the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued to such Buyer pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement on the date such Purchase Agreement was agreed to divided by (2) the
aggregate amount of Notes sold to all of the Buyers pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (with respect
to each Buyer, the “Exchange Cap Allocation”). In the event that any Buyer shall sell or otherwise
transfer any of such Buyer’s Notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Buyer’s
Exchange Cap Allocation with respect to such portion of such Notes so transferred, and the
restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the
Exchange Cap Allocation so allocated to such transferee. Upon conversion and exercise in full of a
holder’s Notes and Warrants, the difference (if any) between such holder’s Exchange Cap Allocation
and the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such holder upon such holder’s
conversion in full of such Notes and such holder’s exercise in full of such Warrants shall be allocated,
to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining holders of Notes and related Warrants on
a pro rata basis in proportion to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Notes and related
Warrants then held by each such holder of Notes and related Warrants.
ARTICLE III.
Certain Adjustments.
3.1.          Stock Dividends and Splits. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i)
pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common
Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of Common Stock (which,
for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon
exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of
shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues by reclassification of shares of the Common Stock any
shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a
fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury
shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of
shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the
aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to
this Section 3.1 shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately
after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.

3.2.         Subsequent Equity Sales. If and whenever on or after the date hereof and prior to the 12-
month anniversary of the Initial Issuance date, the Company issues or sells, or in accordance with this
Section 3 is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the issuance or
sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company, but excluding
any Excluded Securities issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold) for a consideration per
share (the “Base Share Price”) less than a price equal to the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior
to such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale (such Exercise Price then in effect is referred to
herein as the “Applicable Price”) (the foregoing a “Dilutive Issuance”), then immediately after such
Dilutive Issuance, the Exercise Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the Base
Share Price. No such adjustment shall cause the number of Warrant Shares to increase
proportionately. For all purposes of the foregoing (including, without limitation, determining the
adjusted Exercise Price and the Base Share Price under this Section 3.2), the following shall be
applicable:
3.2.1        Issuance of Options. If the Company in any manner grants or sells any Options and the lowest
price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any
such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon
exercise of any such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable
Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued
and sold by the Company at the time of the granting or sale of such Option for such price per share.
For purposes of this Section 3.2.1, the “lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock
is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any such Options or upon conversion, exercise or
exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof” shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts of
consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of
Common Stock upon the granting or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon
conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option
or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest exercise price set forth in such Option for
which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Options or upon
conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such
Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to
the holder of such Option (or any other Person) upon the granting or sale of such Option, upon
exercise of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security
issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof plus the value of any
other consideration received or receivable by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Option (or
any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be
made upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities
upon the exercise of such Options or otherwise pursuant to the terms of or upon the actual issuance
of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.
Common Stock Purchase Warrant # N-1

3.2.2        Issuance of Convertible Securities. If the Company in any manner issues or sells any
Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any
time issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms
thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be
outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale of
such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes of this Section 3.2.2, the
“lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the
conversion, exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof” shall be equal to
(1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the
Company with respect to one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible
Security and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest conversion price set forth in such Convertible Security
for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange thereof or
otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder
of such Convertible Security (or any other Person) upon the issuance or sale of such Convertible
Security plus the value of any other consideration received or receivable by, or benefit conferred on,
the holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no
further adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of
Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof, and if any such issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities is made
upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of this Warrant has been or is to be made pursuant
to other provisions of this Section 3.2, except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the
Exercise Price shall be made by reason of such issuance or sale.
3.2.3       Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion. If the purchase or exercise price provided for in
any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or
exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock increases or decreases at any time
(other than proportional changes in conversion or exercise prices, as applicable, in connection with an
event referred to in Section 3.1), the Exercise Price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease
shall be adjusted to the Exercise Price which would have been in effect at such time had such Options
or Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional
consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially
granted, issued or sold. For purposes of this Section 3.2.3, if the terms of any Option or Convertible
Security that was outstanding as of the date hereof are increased or decreased in the manner
described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the
shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be
deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. No adjustment pursuant to
this Section 3.2 shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Exercise Price then
in effect.

3.2.4       Calculation of Consideration Received. If any Option and/or Convertible Security and/or
Adjustment Right is issued in connection with the issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of any
other securities of the Company (as determined by the Holder, the “Primary Security”, and such
Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right, the “Secondary Securities”), together
comprising one integrated transaction, (or one or more transactions if such issuances or sales or
deemed issuances or sales of securities of the Company either (A) have at least one investor or
purchaser in common, (B) are consummated in reasonable proximity to each other and/or (C) are
consummated under the same plan of financing) the aggregate consideration per share of Common
Stock with respect to such Primary Security shall be deemed to be equal to the difference of (x) the
lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock was issued (or was deemed to be issued
pursuant to Section 3.2.1 or 2.2.2 above, as applicable) in such integrated transaction solely with
respect to such Primary Security, minus (y) with respect to such Secondary Securities, the sum of (I)
the Black Scholes Consideration Value of each such Option, if any, (II) the fair market value (as
determined by the Holder in good faith) or the Black Scholes Consideration Value, as applicable, of
such Adjustment Right, if any, and (III) the fair market value (as determined by the Holder) of such
Convertible Security, if any, in each case, as determined on a per share basis in accordance with this
Section 3.2.4. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or
deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor (for the purpose of
determining the consideration paid for such Common Stock, Option or Convertible Security, but not
for the purpose of the calculation of the Black Scholes Consideration Value) will be deemed to be the
net amount of consideration received by the Company therefor. If any shares of Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of
such consideration received by the Company (for the purpose of determining the consideration paid
for such Common Stock, Option or Convertible Security, but not for the purpose of the calculation of
the Black Scholes Consideration Value) will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such
consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration
received by the Company for such securities will be the arithmetic average of the VWAPs of such
security for each of the five (5) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of receipt. If any shares of
Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity
in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of
consideration therefor (for the purpose of determining the consideration paid for such Common Stock,
Option or Convertible Security, but not for the purpose of the calculation of the Black Scholes
Consideration Value) will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business
of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities (as the case may be). The fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly traded
securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the Holder. If such parties are unable to reach
agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the “Valuation
Event”), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Trading Days after the
tenth (10th) day following such Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly
selected by the Company and the Holder. The determination of such appraiser shall be final and
binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be
borne by the Company.
Common Stock Purchase Warrant # N-1

3.2.5        Record Date. If the Company takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the
purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common
Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common
Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the
issuance or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the
declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of
such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be).
3.3.         Number of Warrant Shares. Simultaneously with any adjustment to the Exercise Price
pursuant to Section 3.1, the number of Warrant Shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this
Warrant shall be increased or decreased proportionately, so that after such adjustment the aggregate
Exercise Price payable hereunder for the adjusted number of Warrant Shares shall be the same as the
aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment (without regard to any
limitations on exercise contained herein).
3.4.         Other Events. In the event that the Company (or any Subsidiary) shall take any action to which
the provisions hereof are not strictly applicable, or, if applicable, would not operate to protect the
Holder from dilution or if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 3
but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock
appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Company’s
board of directors shall in good faith determine and implement an appropriate adjustment in the
Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares (if applicable) so as to protect the rights of the
Holder, provided that no such adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.4 will increase the Exercise Price
or decrease the number of Warrant Shares as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 3,
provided further that if the Holder does not accept such adjustments as appropriately protecting its
interests hereunder against such dilution, then the Company’s board of directors and the Holder shall
agree, in good faith, upon an independent investment bank of nationally recognized standing to make
such appropriate adjustments, whose determination shall be final and binding absent manifest error
and whose fees and expenses shall be borne by the Company.
Common Stock Purchase Warrant # N-1

3.5.         Voluntary Adjustment By Company. The Company may at any time during the term of this
Warrant, with the prior written consent of the Holder, reduce the then current Exercise Price to any
amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the board of directors of the Company,
subject to the rules and regulations of the Principal Market.
3.6.         Notice. The Company shall notify the Holder, in writing, no later than the Trading Day following
the issuance or deemed issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents subject to
Section 3.2, indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price,
conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the “Dilutive Issuance Notice”). For purposes
of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to Section
3.2, upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Warrant
Shares based upon the Base Share Price regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the
Base Share Price in the Notice of Exercise.
3.7.          Subsequent Rights Offerings. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3.1 above, if
at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Common Stock equivalents or rights to purchase
stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of
Common Stock (the “Purchase Rights”), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms
applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have
acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete
exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without
limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken
for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of
which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale
of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any
such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then
the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial
ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and
such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as
its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation).
3.8.          Pro Rata Distributions. During such time as this Warrant is outstanding, if the Company shall
declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to
holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without
limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend,
spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar
transaction) (a “Distribution”), at any time after the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case,
the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would
have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable
upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including
without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is
taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of
shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution (provided,
however, to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any such Distribution would result in the
Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to
participate in such Distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of
Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent) and the portion of such Distribution
shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would
not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation).

3.9.          Fundamental Transaction. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, except as
contemplated by the Segundo Transaction, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more
related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person,
whereby such other Person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock of the Company, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a
series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer
(whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common
Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and
has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the
Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification,
reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant
to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or
property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a
stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a
reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of
Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other
Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such
stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a “Fundamental
Transaction”), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to
receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior
to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder (without regard to any
limitation in Section 2.5 or Section 2.6 on the exercise of this Warrant), the number of shares of
Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving
corporation, and any additional consideration (the “Alternate Consideration”) receivable as a result of
such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this
Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any
limitation in Section 2.5 or Section 2.6 on the exercise of this Warrant). For purposes of any such
exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such
Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one
share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the
Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value
of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any
choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the
Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise
of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall cause any successor
entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the “Successor Entity”)
to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 3.9 pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such
Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for
this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar
in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of
capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock
acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the
exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which
applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the
relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the
value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price
being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the
consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor
Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental
Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant referring to the “Company” shall refer instead to the
Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the
obligations of the Company under this Warrant with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had
been named as the Company herein.

3.10.      Holder’s Right of Alternative Exercise Price Following Issuance of Certain Options or
Convertible Securities. In addition to and not in limitation of the other provisions of this Section 3,
excluding any Excluded Securities if after the date hereof and prior to the 12-month anniversary of the
Initial Issuance Date, the Company in any manner issues or sells or enters into any agreement to issue
or sell, any Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities (any such securities, “Variable Price
Securities”) that are issuable pursuant to such agreement or convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of Common Stock at a price which varies or may vary with the market price of
the Common Shares, including by way of one or more reset(s) to a fixed price, but exclusive of such
formulations reflecting customary anti-dilution provisions (such as share splits, share combinations,
share dividends and similar transactions) (each of the formulations for such variable price being
herein referred to as, the “Variable Price”), the Company shall provide written notice thereof via
facsimile and overnight courier to the Holder on the date of such agreement and the issuance of such
Convertible Securities or Options. From and after the date the Company enters into such agreement or
issues any such Variable Price Securities, the Holder shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its
sole discretion to substitute the Variable Price for the Exercise Price upon exercise of this Warrant by
designating in the Exercise Notice delivered upon any exercise of this Warrant that solely for purposes
of such exercise the Holder is relying on the Variable Price rather than the Exercise Price then in effect.
The Holder’s election to rely on a Variable Price for a particular exercise of this Warrant shall not
obligate the Holder to rely on a Variable Price for any future exercises of this Warrant.
3.11.       Calculations. All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the
nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of
Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the
number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding.
3.12.        Notice to Holder.
3.12.1     Adjustment to Exercise Price. Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any
provision of this Section 3, the Company shall promptly provide the Holder a notice setting forth the
Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the number of Warrant Shares
and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.

3.12.2     Notice to Allow Exercise by Holder. If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other
distribution in whatever form) on the Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special
nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the Company shall
authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or
purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any
stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the Common
Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the
Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property, except for the Segundo
Transaction, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be provided
to the Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least
20 calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating
(x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption,
rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common
Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be
determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share
exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders
of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for
securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to provide such notice or any defect therein shall
not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that
any notice provided in this Warrant constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the
Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled to exercise
this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event
triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.
ARTICLE IV.
Transfer of Warrant.
4.1.           Transferability. Subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws and the conditions
set forth in Section 4.1 hereof and to the provisions of Section 4.1 of the Purchase Agreement, this
Warrant and all rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any registration rights) are transferable,
in whole or in part, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its
designated agent, together with a written assignment of this Warrant substantially in the form attached
hereto duly executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any transfer
taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender and, if required, such payment,
the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or
assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination or denominations specified in such instrument of
assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not
so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company unless
the Holder has assigned this Warrant in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to
the Company within three (3) Trading Days of the date the Holder delivers an assignment form to the
Company assigning this Warrant full. The Warrant, if properly assigned in accordance herewith, may
be exercised by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant
issued.
4.2.          New Warrants. This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon
presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of the Company, together with a written notice specifying
the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by the Holder or its
agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4.1, as to any transfer which may be involved in
such division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in
exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. All
Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the Initial Exercise Date and shall be
identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant thereto.

4.3.        Warrant Register. The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by
the Company for that purpose (the “Warrant Register”), in the name of the record Holder hereof from
time to time. The Company may deem and treat the registered Holder of this Warrant as the absolute
owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder, and for all other
purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary.
4.4.          Transfer Restrictions. This Warrant may be offered for sale, sold, transferred or assigned
without the consent of the Company, subject to applicable law.
4.5.         Representation by the Holder. The Holder, by the acceptance hereof, represents and warrants
that it is acquiring this Warrant and, upon any exercise hereof, will acquire the Warrant Shares issuable
upon such exercise, for its own account and not with a view to or for distributing or reselling such
Warrant Shares or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities
law, except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act.
ARTICLE V.
Miscellaneous.
5.1.          No Rights as Stockholder Until Exercise. This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any
voting rights, dividends or other rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as
set forth in Section 2.5.1, except as expressly set forth in Section 3.
5.2.         Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant. The Company covenants that upon receipt
by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant Shares, and in case of loss, theft or
destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case of the Warrant,
shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or
stock certificate, if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of
like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate.
5.3.         Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc. If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or
the expiration of any right required or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then, such action
may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding Business Day.
Common Stock Purchase Warrant # N-1

5.4.          Authorized Shares.
5.4.1        The Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve
from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the
issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this Warrant (the
“Required Reserve Amount”). The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall
constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of issuing the necessary Warrant
Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all such
reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued as
provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the
Principal Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all
Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this
Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant and payment for such
Warrant Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by the Company in respect of the
issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such
issue).
5.4.2        If, notwithstanding the foregoing, and not in limitation thereof, at any time while the Warrant
remains outstanding, the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved
shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve the Required Reserve Amount (an
“Authorized Share Failure”), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase
the Company’s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to
reserve the Required Reserve Amount for all the Warrants then outstanding. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an
Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such
Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders for the approval of an
increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the
Company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit its stockholders’ approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock
and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such
proposal.
5.4.3        Except and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by
any action, including, without limitation, amending its certificate of incorporation or through any
reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any
other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of
this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the
taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set
forth in this Warrant against impairment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above the amount payable therefor upon such
exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary
or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable
Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain all
such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction
thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant.
Common Stock Purchase Warrant # N-1
19
5.4.4       Promptly upon taking any action which would result in an adjustment in the number of
Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the Exercise Price, the Company shall
obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from
any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof.
5.5.        Jurisdiction. All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and
interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase
Agreement.
5.6.         Restrictions. The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of
this Warrant, if not registered and the Holder does not utilize cashless exercise (subject to the
applicability of Rule 144), will have restrictions upon resale imposed by state and federal securities
laws.
5.7.         Nonwaiver and Expenses. No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right
hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the
Holder’s rights, powers or remedies, notwithstanding the fact that all rights hereunder terminate on the
Termination Date. If the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this
Warrant, which results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder
such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys’ fees, including those of appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder in
collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or
remedies hereunder..
5.8.          Notices. Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered
to the Holder by the Company shall be delivered in accordance with the notice provisions of the
Purchase Agreement.
5.9.          Limitation of Liability. No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the
Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights
or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder for the purchase price of any
Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the
Company or by creditors of the Company.
5.10.       Remedies. The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law,
including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant.
The Company agrees that monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss
incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and
not to assert the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate.

5.11.       Successors and Assigns. Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights
and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors
and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns of Holder. The
provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this
Warrant and shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares.
5.12.       Amendment. This Warrant (other than Section 2.5 and 2.6) may be modified or amended or the
provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and the Holder. No waiver shall be
effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.
5.13.        Severability. If any provision of this Warrant is prohibited by law or otherwise determined to
be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision that would otherwise be
prohibited, invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed amended to apply to the broadest extent that it
would be valid and enforceable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect
the validity of the remaining provisions of this Warrant so long as this Warrant as so modified
continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject
matter hereof and the prohibited nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question
does not substantially impair the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of the parties or the
practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be conferred upon the parties. The parties will
endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s)
with a valid provision(s), the effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the prohibited,
invalid or unenforceable provision(s).
5.14.         Headings. This Warrant shall be deemed to be jointly drafted by the Company and the Holder
and shall not be construed against any Person as the drafter hereof. The headings of this Warrant are
for convenience of reference and shall not form part of, or affect the interpretation of, this Warrant.
5.15.        Governing Law. This Warrant shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with, and all questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and
performance of this Warrant shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State of Texas, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Texas or
any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdictions other than the
State of Texas. The Company hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to
process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by providing a copy thereof to the
Company at the address set forth in the Purchase Agreement and agrees that such service shall
constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. The Company hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in Harris County, Texas, for
the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction
contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in
any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such
court, that such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of
such suit, action or proceeding is improper. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any
way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law. Nothing contained herein shall be
deemed or operate to preclude the Holder from bringing suit or taking other legal action against the
Company in any other jurisdiction to collect on the Company’s obligations to the Holder, to realize on
any collateral or any other security for such obligations, or to enforce a judgment or other court ruling
in favor of the Holder. THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE
HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS WARRANT OR ANY
TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

5.16.        DISPUTE RESOLUTION
5.16.1      Submission to Dispute Resolution.
(i)     In the case of a dispute relating to the Exercise Price, the Closing Sale Price, Black Scholes
Consideration Value, Black Scholes Value or fair market value or the arithmetic calculation of the
number of Warrant Shares (as the case may be) (including, without limitation, a dispute relating to the
determination of any of the foregoing), the Company or the Holder (as the case may be) shall submit
the dispute to the other party via facsimile (A) if by the Company, within two (2) Business Days after the
occurrence of the circumstances giving rise to such dispute or (B) if by the Holder, at any time after the
Holder learned of the circumstances giving rise to such dispute. If the Holder and the Company are
unable to promptly resolve such dispute relating to such Exercise Price, such Closing Sale Price, such
Black Scholes Consideration Value, Black Scholes Value or such fair market value or such arithmetic
calculation of the number of Warrant Shares (as the case may be), at any time after the second (2nd)
Business Day following such initial notice by the Company or the Holder (as the case may be) of such
dispute to the Company or the Holder (as the case may be), then the Holder may, at its sole option,
select an independent, reputable investment bank to resolve such dispute.
(ii)    The Holder and the Company shall each deliver to such investment bank (A) a copy of the initial
dispute submission so delivered in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 5.16 and (B)
written documentation supporting its position with respect to such dispute, in each case, no later than
5:00 p.m. (Texas time) by the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately following the date on which the
Holder selected such investment bank (the “Dispute Submission Deadline”) (the documents referred
to in the immediately preceding clauses (A) and (B) are collectively referred to herein as the “Required
Dispute Documentation”) (it being understood and agreed that if either the Holder or the Company
fails to so deliver all of the Required Dispute Documentation by the Dispute Submission Deadline, then
the party who fails to so submit all of the Required Dispute Documentation shall no longer be entitled
to (and hereby waives its right to) deliver or submit any written documentation or other support to
such investment bank with respect to such dispute and such investment bank shall resolve such
dispute based solely on the Required Dispute Documentation that was delivered to such investment
bank prior to the Dispute Submission Deadline). Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both the
Company and the Holder or otherwise requested by such investment bank, neither the Company nor
the Holder shall be entitled to deliver or submit any written documentation or other support to such
investment bank in connection with such dispute (other than the Required Dispute Documentation).
(iii)   The Company and the Holder shall cause such investment bank to determine the resolution of
such dispute and notify the Company and the Holder of such resolution no later than ten (10)
Business Days immediately following the Dispute Submission Deadline. The fees and expenses of
such investment bank shall be borne equally by the Company and a Holder, and such investment
bank’s resolution of such dispute shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error.

as to (A) whether an issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of Common Stock occurred under

such investment bank in connection with its resolution of such dispute (including, without limitation,

Common Stock occurred, (C) whether any issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of Common
Stock was an issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of Excluded Securities, (D) whether an
agreement, instrument, security or the like constitutes and Option or Convertible Security and (E)
whether a Dilutive Issuance occurred) and in resolving such dispute such investment bank shall apply
such findings, determinations and the like to the terms of this Warrant, (iv) the Holder (and only the
Holder), in its sole discretion, shall have the right to submit any dispute described in this Section 5.16
to any state or federal court sitting in Harris County, Texas, in lieu of utilizing the procedures set forth
