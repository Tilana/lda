<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102, in 
which the Council decided to request the High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue with 
the fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the 
Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies. The present 
report outlines progress achieved since the previous report on the accreditation of national 
human rights institutions to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/7/70) and should be read in 
conjunction with the report of the Secretary-General on national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (A/HRC/10/54), which includes, inter alia, 
information on ways and means of enhancing the participation of the said institutions in the 
work of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  SUBCOMMITTEE ON ACCREDITATION 
</b></p>
<p>2. The mandate of the Subcommittee on Accreditation of the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights is to 
review and analyse accreditation applications and to make recommendations to the Committee 
Bureau members on the compliance of applicants with the Paris Principles. The Subcommittee is 
composed of one A-status accredited institution for each of the four regional groupings: Africa, 
the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe. Subcommittee members are appointed by the regional 
groupings for a renewable term of three years. The Subcommittee designates by consensus, for a 
renewable term of one year, one of its members to act as the Chairperson of the Subcommittee. 
As at December 2008, the Subcommittee is composed of representatives of the human rights 
institutions of Canada, for the Americas; Rwanda, for Africa; the Republic of Korea, for 
Asia Pacific; and Germany, for Europe (Chairperson). The Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) participates in the work of the Subcommittee 
as a permanent observer and in its capacity as Committee secretariat. The Subcommittee has 
acknowledged the high degree of support and professionalism of the staff of the Committee 
secretariat, namely the National Institutions Unit of OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>3. In 2008, the Subcommittee reviewed the accreditation status (re-accreditation reviews) of 
human rights institutions from Albania, Algeria, Ecuador, Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Ireland, 
Kenya, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mongolia, the Niger, Paraguay, the Republic of 
Korea, Sweden, Thailand, Uganda and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). It considered new 
applications from the institutions of Croatia, Maldives, Qatar, the Russian Federation, 
Switzerland, Timor-Leste, Ukraine and Great Britain, and conducted special reviews of the 
institutions of Afghanistan and Nepal. As at December 2008, 64 institutions had been accredited 
with A status in compliance with the Paris Principles by the Committee.  
</p>
<p>4. The table reflecting the accreditation status of national human rights institutions as at 
December 2008 is attached in annex I. Annexes II and III include, respectively, the April and 
November 2008 reports of the Subcommittee on Accreditation.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. IMPROVEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COORDINATING  
COMMITTEE ACCREDITATION PROCESS 
</b></p>
<p>5. At its seventeenth session, held on 12 April 2006, the International Coordinating 
Committee<b> </b>established a working group to examine the process used to accredit national human 
rights institutions and to develop a discussion paper for the Committee on the matter. The 
working group, whose members were also the members of the Subcommittee on Accreditation at 
the time, developed a discussion paper examining three areas: (a) the composition of the 
Subcommittee and its role and responsibilities; (b) the accreditation process; and (c) the 
substance of criteria or minimum standards set for accreditation. The paper was presented to the 
Committee at its eighteenth and nineteenth sessions. In addition, members were asked to provide 
further comments in writing with a view to developing a final paper, which was presented to and 
adopted by the Committee at its twentieth session in April 2008.  
</p>
<p>6. The paper, as adopted by the Committee in April 2008, includes a number of measures to 
improve its accreditation procedure, including: 
</p>
<p> (a) An appeal process to ensure greater transparency and due process for national human 
rights institutions that are deemed not to comply with the Paris Principles;  
</p>
<p> (b) A more rigorous review of each application for accreditation, including of the full 
documentation and statement of compliance submitted in advance of the session by human rights 
institutions, with a detailed summary prepared by the secretariat; 
</p>
<p> (c) More focused recommendations provided to each institution (A or B status) to ensure 
full compliance with the Paris Principles, even before the prescribed five-year time frame for 
review of accreditations;  
</p>
<p> (d) Wider distribution and greater knowledge of Subcommittee recommendations by 
human rights institutions and other stakeholders, so that they can play a proactive role in the 
context of follow-up action by the United Nations or institution regional coordinating bodies in 
the concerned country. The Subcommittee reports are also posted on the Internet (www.nhri.net). 
</p>
<p>7. In 2008, the International Coordinating Committee<b> </b>developed a new statute for its 
incorporation as an association under Swiss law. The statute, which is based on the Committee&#8217;s 
existing rules of procedure, was adopted at the ninth International Conference of National 
Human Rights Institutions, held in Nairobi from 21 to 24 October 2008. The accreditation 
procedure, as defined in the statute, stipulates in article 12 that, where the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation comes to an accreditation decision, that decision shall be considered an 
accreditation status recommendation, with the final decision being taken by the Committee 
Bureau after the following process has occurred:  
</p>
<p> (a) The recommendation of the Subcommittee shall first be forwarded to the applicant;  
</p>
<p> (b) An applicant can challenge a recommendation by submitting a written challenge to 
the Committee Chairperson, through the Committee secretariat, within 28 days of receipt; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (c) Thereafter, the recommendation will be forwarded to the members of the Committee 
Bureau for a decision. If a challenge has been received from the applicant, the challenge, 
together with all relevant material received in connection with both the application and the 
challenge, will also be forwarded to the members of the Bureau;  
</p>
<p> (d) Any member of the Bureau who disagrees with the recommendation shall, within 
20 days of its receipt, notify the Chairperson of the Subcommittee and the secretariat. The 
secretariat will promptly notify all Bureau members of the objection raised and will provide all 
necessary information to clarify that objection. If within 20 days of receipt of this information a 
majority of members of the Bureau notify the secretariat that they hold a similar objection, the 
recommendation shall be referred to the next Bureau meeting for a decision;  
</p>
<p> (e) If a majority of members do not raise objection to the recommendation within 
20 days of its receipt, the recommendation shall be deemed to be approved by the Bureau;  
</p>
<p> (f) The decision of the Bureau on accreditation is final. 
</p>
<p>8. The rules of procedure for the Subcommittee on Accreditation remain in force and are 
incorporated as an annex of the statute of the International Coordinating Committee (art. 58). 
</p>
<p>9. The Subcommittee continued to develop new procedures during the reporting period. For 
its November 2008 session, the Subcommittee adopted the practice of sharing the summaries 
prepared by the secretariat with each national human rights institution before the consideration of 
its application, giving that each institution has one week to comment on the summary. All 
comments received, together with the summaries, were sent to the members of the 
Subcommittee. The summaries and the comments were posted on the National Human Rights 
Institutions Forum (www.nhri.net) following the adoption of the Subcommittee 
recommendations by the Committee Bureau.  
</p>
<p>10. Also at its November 2008 session, the Subcommittee increased its efforts to engage 
regional coordinating committees in the accreditation process. The Committees of all four 
regions were invited to participate in the session as observers, and the Subcommittee welcomed 
the attendance of a representative from the Asia-Pacific Forum of National Human Rights 
Institutions at the November session. The Subcommittee encourages the participation of all 
regional coordinating committees in future sessions.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>11. Following the practice initiated at its meeting in October 2006, the Subcommittee 
continued to develop general observations in relation to accreditation. These general 
observations have been formulated on common or important interpretative issues and are 
intended to constitute guidelines for members on the application process for accreditation and on 
the implementation of the Paris Principles. As highlighted in the decision paper adopted by the 
Committee at its twentieth session, the general observations, as &#8220;interpretive tools&#8221; of the Paris 
Principles, may be used to: </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (a) Instruct institutions when they are developing their own processes and mechanisms, 
to ensure compliance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p> (b) Persuade domestic Governments to address or remedy issues relating to an 
institution&#8217;s compliance with the standards articulated in the general observations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Guide the Subcommittee on Accreditation in its determination of new accreditation 
applications, re-accreditation applications or special reviews. 
</p>
<p>12. The list of general observations adopted by the Committee is attached in annex II. The list 
of general observations is not exhaustive and will continue to evolve as the Subcommittee 
reviews additional applications. The general observations developed by the Subcommittee at 
its 2008 sessions have yet to be formally adopted by the Committee, and are scheduled for 
consultation and adoption at its twenty-second session in March 2009. </p>

<p><b>INTERNATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL  
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION  
 OF HUMAN RIGHTS  
</b></p>
<p><b>Geneva, 21 to 23 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report and Recommendations of the Sub-Committee on Accreditation 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.1. </b>In accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Protection and Promotion of Human 
Rights (ICC), the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (the Sub-Committee) has the 
mandate to consider and review applications for accreditation, re-accreditation and 
special reviews received by the National Institutions Unit of the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in its capacity as the ICC Secretariat, 
and to make recommendations to the ICC members with regard to the compliance of 
applicant institutions with the Paris Principles. The Sub-Committee mandate is to 
assess compliance with the Paris Principles in law and in practice.  
</p>
<p><b>1.2. </b>In accordance with the Sub-Committee Rules of Procedure, the Sub-Committee is 
composed of representatives of each region: the National Human Rights Institutions 
(NHRIs) of Germany for Europe (chair), Morocco for Africa (replacing Rwanda)<b>a</b>, 
the Republic of Korea for Asia-Pacific and Canada for the Americas. The 
Sub-Committee convened from 21 to 23 April 2008. OHCHR participated as a 
permanent observer and in its capacity as ICC Secretariat.  
</p>
<p><b>1.3. </b>Pursuant to article 3(c) of the Rules of Procedure, the Sub-Committee considered 
applications for re-accreditation from: Algeria, Ecuador, Guatemala, Malaysia, 
Mauritius, Niger, Uganda, and Venezuela.  
</p>
<p><b>1.4. </b>Pursuant to article 3(c) of the Rules of Procedure, the Sub-Committee also 
considered applications for accreditation from Croatia, Great Britain, Maldives, 
Timor-Leste, and Ukraine.  
</p>
<p><b>1.5. </b>The Sub-Committee also discussed the re-accreditation of Luxembourg and Sweden 
and agreed to defer consideration of these applications to the fall 2008 session.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>a
</b>  The Sub-Committee notes that for the consideration of the Commission National Consultative 
</p>
<p>de Promotion et Protection des Droits de l&#8217;Homme of Algeria, Morocco did not participate in the 
discussion or the decision. The decision was made by the Sub-Committee with the participation 
of Rwanda. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.6. </b>In accordance with the Paris Principles and the ICC Sub-Committee Rules of 
Procedure, the different classifications<b>b</b> for accreditation used by the Sub-Committee 
are: 
</p>
<p>A: Compliance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p>B: Observer status - Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or 
insufficient information provided to make a determination; 
</p>
<p>C: Non-compliance with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>1.7. </b>Following the practice commenced at the meeting of the Sub-Committee in October 
2006, the Sub-Committee continued to make General Observations in relation to 
accreditation. These General Observations have been formulated on common or 
important interpretative issues and are intended to be guidelines for NHRIs 
concerning the implementation of the Paris Principles. The list of General 
Observations is not exhaustive and will continue to evolve as the Sub-Committee 
further considers other applications. The compilation of all General Observations 
adopted by the ICC classified according to themes contained in the Paris Principles is 
attached as Annex 1 to this report. The General Observation developed by the 
Sub-Committee at its April 2008 session (attached as Annex 2) has yet to be adopted 
by the ICC. The revised General Observation 1.5 on &#8220;Cooperation with other human 
rights institutions&#8221; (attached as Annex 3) has yet to be adopted by the ICC.  
</p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b>:<b> </b>The Sub-Committee recommends the adoption of the General 
Observation attached as Annex 2. 
</p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b>:<b> </b>The Sub-Committee recommends the adoption of the revised 
General Observation attached as Annex 3.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b>1.8. </b>The General Observations, as interpretive tools of the Paris Principles, may be used 
to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Instruct institutions when they are developing their own processes and 
mechanisms, to ensure Paris Principles compliance; 
</p>
<p>(b) Persuade domestic governments to address or remedy issues relating to an 
institution&#8217;s compliance with the standards articulated in the General 
Observations; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>b
</b>  The Sub-Committee notes that it has discontinued the use of the A(R) classification, pending 
</p>
<p>formal adoption of the amendments to the rules of the ICC. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(c) Guide the Sub-Committee on Accreditation in its determination of new 
accreditation applications, re-accreditation applications or special reviews: 
</p>
<p>(i) If an institution falls substantially short of the standards articulated in the 
General Observations, it would be open for the Sub-Committee to find 
that it was not Paris Principle compliant; 
</p>
<p>(ii) If the Sub-Committee has noted concern about an institution&#8217;s compliance 
with any of the General Observations, it may consider what steps, if any, 
have been taken by an institution to address those concerns in future 
applications. If the Sub-Committee is not provided with proof of efforts to 
address the General Observations previously made, or offered a 
reasonable explanation why no efforts had been made, it would be open to 
the Sub-Committee to interpret such lack of progress as non-compliance 
with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>1.9. </b>The Sub-Committee notes that in all applications considered reference could be made 
to General Observation &#8220;Interaction with the International Human Rights System&#8221; 
and encourages all NHRIs to interact consistently with the international human rights 
system (UN Human Rights Treaty Bodies, Special Procedures mandate holders and 
Human Rights Council, including the UPR), providing information independently of 
the Government and later ensuring follow up action to recommendations resulting 
from that system (and to rely on the services of the ICC Representative in Geneva 
when necessary).  
</p>
<p><b>1.10. </b>The Sub-Committee notes that it received the &#8220;Guidelines for the Sub-Committee on 
Accreditation for the application of General Observations&#8221; (attached as Annex 4) 
approved in principle at the 20th session of the ICC in April 2008.  
</p>
<p><b>1.11. </b>The Sub-Committee notes that when specific issues are raised in its report in relation 
to accreditation, re-accreditation and special review, NHRIs are required to address 
these issues in any subsequent application or special review.  
</p>
<p><b>1.12. </b>In accordance with the ICC Rules of Procedure, the Sub-Committee encourages all 
accredited NHRIs to inform the ICC at the first available opportunity about 
circumstances that would negatively affect their ability to meet the standards and 
obligations of the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>1.13. </b>When the Sub-Committee is to consider particular issues within a specified 
time-frame, the outcome of the review may affect the accreditation status.  
</p>
<p><b>1.14. </b>As provided for in the &#8220;Decision Paper on the Review of ICC Accreditation 
Procedures for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRI) March 2008&#8221; (attached 
as Annex 5) adopted by the ICC at its 20th session in April 2008 (Decision Paper), 
the results of the accreditation review will first be communicated to the affected 
NHRI with a time frame of 30 days to respond to the issues addressed by the 
Sub-Committee members. At the expiration of the 30 days, the report will be sent to 
the ICC voting members.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.15. </b>As provided for in the Decision Paper, the recommendations from the April 2008 
session of the Sub-Committee will be communicated to all ICC voting members, and 
those members will be asked to adopt them by email within 20 days. All approved 
recommendations are final decisions. Unapproved decisions are referred for 
consideration at the next ICC meeting.  
</p>
<p><b>1.16. </b>As provided for in the Decision Paper, in cases where the Sub-Committee considers 
a recommendation that would serve to remove accredited status from an applicant 
institution, the applicant institution is informed of this intention and given the 
opportunity to provide in writing, within one year of such notice, the documentary 
evidence deemed necessary to establish its continued conformity with the Paris 
Principles. The concerned institution retains its &#8220;A&#8221; status during this period.  
</p>
<p><b>1.17. </b>The Sub-Committee continued to consult with relevant NHRIs and regional 
coordinating bodies, whenever necessary. This procedure was applied in several 
cases during the present session. Prior to the session, all concerned NHRIs were 
requested to provide a name and phone number in case the Sub-Committee needed to 
contact the Institution. In addition, OHCHR desk officers and, as appropriate, 
OHCHR field officers were available to provide further information, as needed. 
</p>
<p><b>1.18. </b>The Sub-Committee would like to acknowledge the high degree of support and 
professionalism of the staff of the ICC Secretariat (OHCHR National Institutions 
Unit) which has been essential for the Sub-Committee to conduct its activities.  
</p>
<p><b>2. ADOPTION OF NEW PROCEDURES 
</b></p>
<p><b>2.1. </b>In the ongoing effort to be more transparent, the Sub-Committee continued to 
develop new procedures. 
</p>
<p><b>2.2. </b>The Sub-Committee agreed, commencing with its next session, to share the 
summaries prepared by the Secretariat with each NHRI before the consideration of 
its application and to give that NHRI one week to comment on the summary. All 
comments received, together with the summaries, are to be then sent to the members 
of the Sub-Committee. Once the recommendations of the Sub-Committee are 
adopted by the ICC according to the procedures, the summaries and the comments 
will be posted on the NHRI Forum (www.nhri.net). The summaries are prepared only 
in English, due to current financial constraints. 
</p>
<p><b>2.3. </b>The Sub-Committee also considers information received from civil society. The 
Sub-Committee agreed to share that information with the concerned NHRIs.

<p><b>Annex III 
</b></p>
<p><b>INTERNATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL  
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION  
 OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report and Recommendations of the Session of the  
Sub-Committee on Accreditation 
</b></p>
<p><b>Geneva, 3-6 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.1. </b>In accordance with the Statute of the International Coordinating Committee of 
National Institutions for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights (ICC), the 
Sub-Committee on Accreditation (the Sub-Committee) has the mandate to consider 
and review applications for accreditation, re-accreditation and special or other 
reviews received by the National Institutions Unit of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in its capacity as the ICC 
Secretariat, and to make recommendations to the ICC Bureau members with regard 
to the compliance of applicant institutions with the Paris Principles. The 
Sub-Committee assesses compliance with the Paris Principles in law and in practice.  
</p>
<p><b>1.2. </b>In accordance with the Sub-Committee Rules of Procedure, the Sub-Committee is 
composed of representatives of each region: the National Human Rights Institutions 
(NHRIs) of Germany for Europe (chair), Morocco for Africa (replacing Rwanda), the 
Republic of Korea for Asia-Pacific and Canada for the Americas. The 
Sub-Committee convened from 03 to 06 November 2008. OHCHR participated as a 
permanent observer and in its capacity as ICC Secretariat. In accordance with new 
procedures, regional coordinating bodies of NHRIs were invited to attend as 
observers. The Sub-Committee welcomed the participation of a representative of the 
Asia Pacific Forum of NHRIs.  
</p>
<p><b>1.3. </b>The Sub-Committee notes the new ICC Statute adopted at the 21st session of the ICC 
on 21 October 2008 in Nairobi, Kenya (attached as Annex 1). The Sub-Committee 
applied these new procedures to its work in the current session, as set out below. 
</p>
<p><b>1.4. </b>Pursuant to article 10 of the Statute, the Sub-Committee considered applications for 
accreditation from Great Britain (Equality and Human Rights Commission), Qatar, 
Russia, and Switzerland (Commission f&#233;d&#233;rale pour les qu&#233;stions f&#233;minines).  
</p>
<p><b>1.5. </b>Pursuant to article 15 of the Statute, the Sub-Committee also considered applications 
for re-accreditation from: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Ghana, 
Ireland, Kenya, Luxembourg, Mongolia, Paraguay, Republic of Korea, Sweden and 
Thailand.  
</p>
<p><b>1.6. </b>Pursuant to article 17 of the Statute, the Sub-Committee reviewed certain issues 
regarding the NHRIs of Afghanistan and Nepal. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.7. </b>In accordance with the Paris Principles and the ICC Sub-Committee Rules of 
Procedure, the different classifications for accreditation used by the Sub-Committee 
are: 
</p>
<p>A: Compliance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p>B:  Observer status - Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or 
insufficient information provided to make a determination; 
</p>
<p>C:  Non-compliance with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>1.8. </b>The Sub-Committee formulated General Observations (attached as Annex 3).  
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends the adoption of General 
Observations attached as Annex 3, provided that, should any member of the ICC Bureau 
request that one or more of the General Observations be referred to the ICC22 Bureau 
meeting, that/those General Observation(s) shall be considered by the ICC Bureau at 
ICC22 in March 2009.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.9. </b>The General Observations, as interpretative tools of the Paris Principles, may be 
used to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Instruct institutions when they are developing their own processes and 
mechanisms, to ensure Paris Principles compliance; 
</p>
<p>(b) Persuade domestic governments to address or remedy issues relating to an 
institution&#8217;s compliance with the standards articulated in the General 
Observations; 
</p>
<p>(c) Guide the Sub-Committee on Accreditation in its determination of new 
accreditation applications, re-accreditation applications or other review: 
</p>
<p>(i) If an institution falls substantially short of the standards articulated in the 
General Observations, it will be open for the Sub-Committee to find that it 
was not Paris Principle compliant; 
</p>
<p>(ii) If the Sub-Committee has noted concern about an institution&#8217;s compliance 
with any of the General Observations, it may consider what steps, if any, 
have been taken by an institution to address those concerns in future 
applications. If the Sub-Committee is not provided with proof of efforts to 
address the General Observations previously made, or offered a reasonable 
explanation why no efforts had been made, it would be open to the 
Sub-Committee to interpret such lack of progress as non-compliance with 
the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>1.10. </b>The Sub-Committee notes that in all applications considered reference could be made 
to the General Observation 1.4 &#8220;Interaction with the International Human Rights 
System&#8221; and encourages all NHRIs to interact consistently with the international 
human rights system (UN Human Rights Treaty Bodies, Special Procedures mandate </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>holders and Human Rights Council, including the UPR), providing information 
independently of the Government and later ensuring follow up action to 
recommendations resulting from that system (and to rely on the services of the 
ICC Representative in Geneva when necessary).  
</p>
<p><b>1.11. </b>The Sub-Committee notes that in all applications considered reference could be made 
to the General Observation on 2.6 &#8220;Adequate funding&#8221;. Provision of adequate 
funding by the State should, as a minimum include:  
</p>
<p>(a) The allocation of funds for adequate accommodation, at least its head office;  
</p>
<p>(b) Salaries and benefits awarded to its staff comparable to public service salaries 
and conditions;  
</p>
<p>(c) Remuneration of Commissioners (where appropriate); and 
</p>
<p>(d) The establishment of communications systems including telephone and 
Internet.  
</p>
<p>Adequate funding should, to a reasonable degree, ensure the gradual and progressive 
realisation of the improvement of the institution&#8217;s operations and the fulfilment of 
their mandate.  
</p>
<p>Funding from external sources, such as from development partners, should not 
compose the core funding of the NHRI as it is the responsibility of the State to 
ensure the NHRI&#8217;s minimum activity budget in order to allow it to operate towards 
fulfilling its mandate.  
</p>
<p>Financial systems should be such that the NHRI has complete financial autonomy. 
This should be a separate budget line over which it has management and control.  
</p>
<p><b>1.12. </b>The Sub-Committee notes that when specific issues are raised in its report in relation 
to accreditation, re-accreditation and other review, NHRIs are required to address 
these issues in any subsequent application or other review.  
</p>
<p><b>1.13. </b>The Sub-Committee encourages all accredited NHRIs to inform the ICC Bureau at 
the first available opportunity about circumstances that would negatively affect their 
ability to meet the standards and obligations of the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>1.14. </b>When the Sub-Committee declares its intention to consider particular issues within a 
specified time-frame, the outcome of the review may lead to a recommendation 
which may affect the accreditation status. In the event additional issues arise during 
the course of the review, the Sub-Committee will so notify the NHRI.  
</p>
<p><b>1.15. </b>As per article 12 of the Statute, where the Sub-Committee on Accreditation comes to 
an accreditation decision, that decision shall be considered an accreditation status 
recommendation, with the final decision being taken by the ICC Bureau after the 
following process has occurred: </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The recommendation of the Sub-Committee shall first be forwarded to the 
applicant;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; An applicant can challenge a recommendation by submitting a written challenge 
to the ICC Chairperson, through the ICC Secretariat, within twenty eight (28) 
days of receipt; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Thereafter the recommendation will be forwarded to the members of the ICC 
Bureau for decision. If a challenge has been received from the applicant, the 
challenge together with all relevant material received in connection with both the 
application and the challenge will also be forwarded to the members of the ICC 
Bureau;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Any member of the ICC Bureau who disagrees with the recommendation shall, 
within twenty (20) days of its receipt, notify the Chair of the Sub-Committee and 
the ICC Secretariat. The ICC Secretariat will promptly notify all ICC Bureau 
members of the objection raised and will provide all necessary information to 
clarify that objection. If within twenty (20) days of receipt of this information a 
majority of members of the ICC Bureau notify the ICC Secretariat that they hold a 
similar objection, the recommendation shall be referred to the next ICC Bureau 
meeting for decision;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; If a majority of members do not raise objection to the recommendation within 
twenty (20) days of its receipt, the recommendation shall be deemed to be 
approved by the ICC Bureau;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The decision of the ICC Bureau on accreditation is final.  
</p>
<p><b>1.16. </b>As provided for in the Statute, in cases where the Sub-Committee considers a 
recommendation that would serve to remove accredited status from an applicant 
institution, the applicant institution is informed of this intention and given the 
opportunity to provide in writing, within one year of such notice, the documentary 
evidence deemed necessary to establish its continued conformity with the Paris 
Principles. The concerned institution retains its &#8220;A&#8221; status during this period.  
</p>
<p><b>1.17. </b>The Sub-Committee continued to consult with concerned NHRIs, where necessary, 
during its session. Prior to the session, all concerned NHRIs were requested to 
provide a name and phone number in case the Sub-Committee needed to contact the 
Institution. In addition, OHCHR desk officers and, as appropriate, OHCHR field 
officers were available to provide further information, as needed. 
</p>
<p><b>1.18. </b>The Sub-Committee acknowledges the high degree of support and professionalism of 
the staff of the ICC Secretariat (OHCHR National Institutions Unit).  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. ADOPTION OF NEW PROCEDURES 
</b></p>
<p><b>2.1. </b>The Sub-Committee continued to develop its procedures in the ongoing effort to 
advance the principles of rigour, transparency, and fairness of the accreditation 
process. 
</p>
<p><b>2.2. </b>The November 2008 session of the Sub-Committee was open to NHRI regional 
coordinating committees to attend as observers. All four committees were invited to 
participate. A representative of the Asia Pacific Forum of NHRIs attended the 
session. The Sub-Committee encourages the participation of all regional coordinating 
committees in future sessions.  
</p>
<p><b>2.3. </b>The Sub-Committee shared the summaries prepared by the Secretariat with the 
concerned NHRIs before the consideration of their applications and they were given 
one week to comment on them. All comments received, together with the summaries, 
were then sent to the members of the Sub-Committee. Once the recommendations of 
the Sub-Committee are adopted by the ICC Bureau, according to the procedures, the 
summaries and the comments and the statement of compliance will be posted on the 
NHRI Forum (www.nhri.net). The summaries are currently only prepared in English, 
due to current financial constraints. 
</p>
<p><b>2.4. </b>The Sub-Committee considered information received from civil society. The 
Sub-Committee shared that information with the concerned NHRIs and considered 
their responses.  
</p>
<p><b>2.5. </b>The Sub-Committee agreed, commencing with its next session, to consider only that 
information from civil society that is received by the National Institutions Unit at 
least four (4) months prior to the next session of the Sub-Committee. 
</p>
<p><b>3. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS - NEW ACCREDITATION APPLICATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>3.1. Great Britain: Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the EHRC be accredited with 
<b>status A</b>.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>The Sub-Committee acknowledges the EHRC met all of the mandatory requirements set 
out in General Observation 6.6 &#8220;More than one National Institution in a State&#8221;. It 
emphasizes the importance of further developing cooperation between the EHRC, the 
Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Scottish Human Rights Commission. 
It also refers to General Observation 1.5 &#8220;Cooperation with other human rights 
institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes the following: 
</p>
<p>(1) In the current effort to unify the different anti-discrimination and equality legislation, 
it is important that the views of the EHRC be considered. It recommends that: </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(a) The functions of the EHRC be expanded to give it an explicit mandate to 
protect human rights, including the power to receive and determine complaints 
on human rights violations; 
</p>
<p>(b) The EHRC&#8217;s mandate be expanded to include explicit powers regarding the 
harmonisation of national legislation with international human rights 
instruments and principles, and the encouragement of their ratification and 
implementation. The Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 1.3 
&#8220;Encouraging ratification or accession to international human rights 
instruments&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(c) The Equality Act include a specific reference to pluralism with regard to the 
appointments process. The Sub-Committee refers to General Observations 2.1 
&#8220;Ensuring pluralism&#8221; and 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing 
body&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(d) The grounds for dismissal of a Commissioner be more clearly defined. The 
Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.9 &#8220;Guarantee of tenure for 
members of governing bodies&#8221;.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The Sub-Committee also notes the requirement for the Minister&#8217;s consent in relation to the 
following issues: payment of Commissioners; the numbers, terms and conditions of staff 
appointments; and the appointment of investigating commissioners. The Sub-Committee 
emphasizes that this relationship should not negatively influence the EHRC&#8217;s ability to 
function independently. The Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 1.6 
&#8220;Recommendations by NHRIs&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>3.2. Qatar: National Committee for Human Rights (NCHR) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that consideration of the application 
of the NCHR <b>be deferred</b> to the March 2009 Sub-Committee session <b>while keeping its 
current accreditation B Status</b>.  
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes that insufficient information was provided for it to make a 
determination and encourages the NCHR to seek advice and assistance from OHCHR and 
the Asia Pacific Forum of NHRIs. 
</p>
<p><b>3.3. Russia: Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights (OCHR) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the OCHR be accredited with 
<b>status A</b>.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes the following: 
</p>
<p>(1) It recommends that the OCHR engage systematically with the international human 
rights system as well as the European human rights system. The Sub-Committee 
emphasizes the importance of General Observation 1.4 &#8220;Interaction with the 
international human rights system&#8221;; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(2) It encourages the continued interaction of the OCHR with civil society organizations; 
</p>
<p>(3) It encourages the OCHR to institutionalize the cooperation with the regional human 
rights institutions of the subjects of the Russian Federation and refers to General 
Observation 1.5 &#8220;Cooperation with other human rights institutions&#8221;. The 
Sub-Committee acknowledges the existence of the Coordination Council; 
</p>
<p>(4) It refers to General Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing 
body&#8221; and in particular the need for the appointment process to be transparent; 
</p>
<p>(5) It refers to General Observation 1.6 &#8220;Recommendations by NHRIs&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>3.4. Switzerland: Commission f&#233;d&#233;rale pour les qu&#233;stions f&#233;minines (CFQF) 
Recommendation</b>:<b> </b>After consideration of the application of the CFQF, the 
Sub-Committee is not satisfied that the CFQF is in compliance with the Paris Principles 
and recommends that the application be <b>deferred</b>, to allow the CFQF to take such steps as 
necessary to expand its powers. The Sub-Committee encourages the CFQF to also consider 
consolidating together with other existing human rights commissions in Switzerland into a 
comprehensive NHRI with a broad mandate in line with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p><b>4. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS - RE-ACCREDITATION APPLICATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>4.1. Albania: People&#8217;s Advocate (PA) 
Recommendation</b>:<b> </b>The Sub-Committee recommends that the People&#8217;s Advocate (PA) be 
re-accredited with <b>status A</b>. 
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes the following: 
</p>
<p>(1) It recommends that the mandate of the PA be strengthened to include human rights 
promotion and refers to General Observation 1.2 &#8220;Human rights mandate&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(2) It refers to the importance for the PA to be accessible as requested by the Paris 
Principles and in this regard recommends the establishment of a permanent regional 
presence, for example through regional offices;  
</p>
<p>(3) It refers to the need for the PA to systematically interact with the international human 
rights system and further refers to General Observation 1.4 &#8220;Interaction with the 
International Human Rights System&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(4) It stresses the importance for the PA to have a transparent appointments process, 
based on a broad advertisement of the vacancy and a broad consultation. It further 
refers to General Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing 
body&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes with concern the lack of dialogue and follow up by the 
Parliament to the work of the PA despite the provisions contained in the Law on the 
People&#8217;s Advocate. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4.2. Bosnia and Herzegovina: Human Rights Ombudsman (HRO) 
Recommendation</b>:<b> </b>The Sub-Committee recommends that consideration of the application 
for re-accreditation of the HRO <b>be deferred</b>.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>In support of the ongoing effort to merge the existing human rights institutions in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, the Sub-Committee agreed to defer the consideration of the 
re-accreditation of the national human rights institution of Bosnia and Herzegovina until 
the October/November 2009 session of the Sub-Committee. The Sub-Committee refers to 
General Observation 6.2 &#8220;Deferral of re-accreditation applications&#8221;, in particular to stress 
the timeframe contained in the General Observation and adopted by the ICC.  
</p>
<p><b>4.3. Germany: German Institute for Human Rights (GIHR) 
</b>The Sub-Committee reviewed this application in the absence of the German representative 
on the Sub-Committee. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the GIHR be re-accredited with 
<b>status A</b>.  
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes the following: 
</p>
<p>(1) It refers to the importance for the GIHR to further broaden its mandate to include 
complaint handling functions; 
</p>
<p>(2) It stresses the importance of ensuring pluralism at all levels in the GIHR on a more 
permanent and formal basis and in a manner distinct from the length of the contracts 
of the staff in particular with regard to gender balance and ethnic diversity. It also 
underlines the need to clarify the contradiction between articles 9(1) and 11(3) of the 
GIHR Statutes in order to ensure that the Board of Trustees provides a written 
explanation for rejecting an application for General Membership or for expelling a 
member. In this context the Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.1 
&#8220;Ensuring pluralism&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(3) While article 24(2) of the GIHR&#8217;s Statute provide that the German Government&#8217;s 
representatives on the Board of the Trustees have no voting rights, article 24(1) 
indicates that two of the GIHR&#8217;s Trustees must be members of the German&#8217;s 
Bundestag&#8217;s Committee on Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid. The Statute does 
not exclude these representatives from voting on decisions made by the Board of 
Trustees. The Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.3 &#8220;Government 
representatives on national institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee expresses its concern that the GIHR is founded by a Motion of the 
Bundestag (Motion 14/4801). Notwithstanding the fact that the Motion was unanimously 
adopted and that the GIHR is functioning independently and effectively under this 
arrangement, the Sub-Committee reiterates the need for an NHRI to be established in a 
constitutional or legal text and therefore recommends the adoption of a stronger legal basis 
for the Institute. It refers to General Observation 1.1 &#8220;Establishment of national 
institutions&#8221;.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>It also highlights the need for the GIHR to broaden its mandate to include the protection 
functions as contained in General Observation 1.2 &#8220;Human rights mandate&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>4.4. Ghana: Commission of Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the CHRAJ be re-accredited 
with <b>status A</b>.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes the following: 
</p>
<p>(1) The CHRAJ&#8217;s most recent annual report is for the year 2005. This made it more 
difficult for the Sub-Committee to review the CHRAJ. The Sub-Committee refers to 
General Observation 6.7 &#8220;NHRI Annual Report&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(2) It highlights the desirability of ensuring that the composition of the Council of State 
explicitly includes members of civil society and other social forces and, in this 
regard, refers to General Observation 2.1 &#8220;Ensuring Pluralism&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>4.5. Ireland: Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the IHRC be re-accredited with 
<b>status A</b>.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes the following: 
</p>
<p>(1) The process for appointing Commissioners adopted by the Government in 2006 
ought to be formalized in the IHRC&#8217;s enabling legislation to guarantee ongoing 
transparency. It refers to General Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the 
governing body&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(2) The grounds for dismissal of a Commissioner ought to be more clearly defined. The 
Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.9 &#8220;Guarantee of tenure for members 
of governing bodies&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(3) The IHRC should be able to independently conduct its affairs without undue 
interference from the Government. This could include having direct accountability to 
Parliament. The Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.10 &#8220;Administrative 
regulation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes that under Section 22 of the IHRC&#8217;s enabling legislation, its 
financial grant is determined by the Minister for Justice with the consent of the Minister 
for Finance. 
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee expresses deep concern about plans to significantly reduce the 
IHRC&#8217;s budget for 2009. This would undermine the IHRC&#8217;s capacity to carry out its 
mandate effectively and threatens its financial autonomy. The Sub-Committee urges that 
this plan be reconsidered. It refers to General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate funding&#8221;.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4.6. Kenya: National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the NCHR be re-accredited with 
<b>status A</b>.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes the following: 
</p>
<p>(1) It highlights the need for the NCHR to have financial autonomy, including by 
submitting its budget directly to Parliament;  
</p>
<p>(2) It stresses the importance for the NCHR to receive adequate funding in order to hire 
the necessary staff and to be able to establish a permanent regional presence, for 
example through regional offices. It refers to General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate 
funding&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(3) It underlines the need to entrench in the mandate of the NCHR the encouragement of 
ratification or accession to international human rights instruments and refers to 
General Observation 1.3 &#8220;Encouraging ratification or accession to international 
human rights instruments&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>4.7. Luxembourg: Commission Consultative des Droits de l&#8217;Homme (CCDH) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee informs the CCDH of its <b>intention to 
recommend to the ICC Bureau status B</b>, and gives the CCDH the opportunity to 
provide, in writing, within one year of such notice, the documentary evidence deemed 
necessary to establish its continued conformity with the Paris Principles. The CCDH 
<b>retains its &#8220;A status&#8221; during this period</b>. 
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee acknowledges that the Draft Law of 2008 (<i>Projet de Loi No. 5882</i>) was unanimously adopted by the Chamber of Deputies on 22 October. The Sub-Committee 
further acknowledges the CCDH is developing an internal regulatory document. 
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee considers the following issues need to be addressed: 
</p>
<p>(1) Neither the R&#232;glement de 2000 nor the <i>Projet de Loi </i>imposes any legal requirements 
to ensure the pluralism of the institution&#8217;s membership and staff composition. The 
Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.1 &#8220;Ensuring pluralism&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(2) Article 4 (1) of the <i>Projet de Loi </i>establishes the exclusive authority of the 
Government to nominate members of the CCDH without consultation. The 
Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and Appointment of the 
Governing Body&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(3) The grounds for dismissal of the CCDH&#8217;s members are not specified in the <i>Projet de 
Loi</i>. The Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.9 &#8220;Guarantee of Tenure for 
Members of Governing Bodies&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(4) None of the CCDH&#8217;s members occupies a permanent full-time position. The 
Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.8 &#8220;Full-time Members&#8221;; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(5) The CCDH&#8217;s annual budget for non-post expenditures has been set for the past 3 
years at 12,500 EUR. The Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.6 
&#8220;Adequate funding&#8221;. There is also no indication that the CCDH exercises budgetary 
autonomy; 
</p>
<p>(6) The <i>Projet de Loi</i> does not provide CCDH members with functional immunity. The 
Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.5 &#8220;Immunity&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(7) The CCDH should further develop relationships with civil society. The 
Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 1.5 &#8220;Cooperation with other human 
rights institutions&#8221;. 
</p>

<p><b>4.10. Republic of Korea: National Human Rights Commission (NHRCK) 
</b>The Sub-Committee reviewed this application in the absence of the Korean representative 
on the Sub-Committee. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the NHRCK be re-accredited 
with <b>status A</b>.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes the following: 
</p>
<p>(1) The NHRCK is considered a &#8220;central government institution&#8221; under the National 
Fiscal Act and as such does not enjoy complete functional autonomy from the 
Government. This is in contrast to &#8220;independent institutions&#8221;, which are 
constitutionally entrenched; 
</p>
<p>(2) Under article 5 of the founding Act, the process of appointing Commissioners, on 
nomination from the President, the National Assembly or the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court, does not provide for formal public consultation in the recruitment 
and scrutiny of candidates nor for the participation of civil society. The 
Sub-Committee refers to General Observations 2.1 &#8220;Ensuring pluralism&#8221; and 2.2 
&#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing body&#8221; and encourages the adoption of 
procedures that ensure a broad and transparent appointment process. This should be 
done through public advertisement and a broad consultation procedure; 
</p>
<p>(3) It acknowledges the action taken during the recent Candle Light Vigils and 
encourages the NHRCK to consider issuing public statements and reports through the 
media in a timely manner to address urgent human rights violations; 
</p>
<p>(4) It stresses the need for the NHRCK to have more autonomy to appoint its own staff 
in a manner that does not unnecessarily delay the fulfilment of the NHRCK needs. 
The Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.7 &#8220;Staff of an NHRI&#8221;.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee expresses its concern about the recent proposal to place the 
Commission directly under the Office of the President and subsequent interventions in the 
Commission&#8217;s financial and administrative affairs. It refers to General Observation 2.10 
&#8220;Administrative regulation&#8221;.

<b>status A</b>.<b>

<p>The Sub-Committee notes the following: 
</p>
<p>(1) The NHRC is located at the Anti-Money Laundering Office, which is heavily 
guarded by police forces. The Sub-Committee acknowledges that the NHRC is 
seeking to secure separate premises. It recommends that accessibility be further 
enhanced by establishing permanent regional presence, for example through regional 
offices. It refers to General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate Funding&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(2) The Sub-Committee emphasizes the need for broad consultation in the nomination 
and selection of Commission members, including with civil society and vulnerable 
groups. It refers to General Observations 2.1 &#8220;Ensuring pluralism&#8221; and 2.2 &#8220;The 
selection and appointment of the governing body&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(3) The NHRC&#8217;s permanent staff members are seconded from various government 
ministries. The Sub-Committee refers to General Observations 2.4 &#8220;Staffing by 
secondment&#8221; and 2.7 &#8220;Staff of an NHRI&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(4) The UN Human Rights Committee expressed its concern that many of NHRC&#8217;s 
recommendations to the relevant authorities have not been implemented and given 
serious follow-up. The Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 1.6 
&#8220;Recommendations by NHRIs&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(5) The grounds for dismissal of a Commissioner ought to be more clearly defined. The 
Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 2.9 &#8220;Guarantee of tenure for members

<p><b>5. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS - REVIEWS UNDER ARTICLE 17 
</b></p>
<p><b>5.1. Afghanistan: Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee confirms the <b>status A</b> accreditation of the 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee notes the following: 
</p>
<p>(1) It expresses its appreciation to the AIHRC for carrying out its mandate in a difficult 
and volatile political and security related context and encourages the AIHRC to 
continue its vigilant role in monitoring, promoting and protecting human rights. The 
Sub-Committee refers to General Observation 5.1 &#8220;NHRIs during the situation of a 
coup d&#8217;&#233;tat or a state of emergency&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(2) It recognizes the need for the international community to continue to engage and 
support the AIHRC in order to ensure it receives adequate funding, until such time 
when the State will be able to cover the AIHRC&#8217;s adequate funding. The AIHRC 
should ensure the coordinated, transparent and accountable management of funding.  
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee expresses its concern over any attempt to undermine the effectiveness 
and independence of the AIHRC, in particular through financial or budgetary constraints 
and/or amendments of its legal structure. Any reform, particularly to the appointment 
process, should only aim at enhancing the AIHRC&#8217;s independence, transparency and 
effectiveness. 
</p>
<p><b>5.2. Nepal: National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee confirms the <b>status A</b> accreditation of the NHRC. 
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee acknowledges NHRC's response to the concerns it raised in 
October 2007, particularly with regard to the issue of financial autonomy. Having 
completed its review, it also reiterates the comments it made in its October 2007 report 
regarding adequate funding and selection and appointment of the governing body. 
</p>
<p>In the course of the review, the Sub-Committee noted that the NHRC legislation has not 
yet been adopted by the Parliament and therefore it encourages the NHRC to promote the 
development of legislation in full compliance with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>The Sub-Committee encourages the NHRC to increase its cooperation with statutory 
institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights as well as civil society 
organizations. It refers to General Observation 1.5 &#8220;Cooperation with other human rights 
institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>The Sub-Committee will again consider these issues at its October/November 2009 
session</b>.
