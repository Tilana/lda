<p><b>Human Rights Council</b> 
<b>Seventeenth special session 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the independent international 
commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab 
Republic</b>&#61482;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The deteriorating situation in the Syrian Arab Republic prompted the Human Rights 
Council to establish an independent international commission of inquiry to investigate 
alleged violations of human rights since March 2011. From the end of September until mid-
November 2011, the commission held meetings with Member States from all regional 
groups, regional organizations, including the League of Arab States and the Organization of 
Islamic Cooperation, non-governmental organizations, human rights defenders, journalists 
and experts. It interviewed 223 victims and witnesses of alleged human rights violations, 
including civilians and defectors from the military and the security forces. In the present 
report, the commission documents patterns of summary execution, arbitrary arrest, enforced 
disappearance, torture, including sexual violence, as well as violations of children&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p> The substantial body of evidence gathered by the commission indicates that these 
gross violations of human rights have been committed by Syrian military and security 
forces since the beginning of the protests in March 2011. The commission is gravely 
concerned that crimes against humanity have been committed in different locations in the 
Syrian Arab Republic during the period under review. It calls upon the Government of the 
Syrian Arab Republic to put an immediate end to the ongoing gross human rights 
violations, to initiate independent and impartial investigations of these violations and to 
bring perpetrators to justice. The commission also addresses specific recommendations to 
opposition groups, the Human Rights Council, regional organizations and States Members 
of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p> The commission deeply regrets that, despite many requests, the Government failed 
to engage in dialogue and to grant the commission access to the country. The Government 
informed the commission that it would examine the possibility of cooperating with the 
commission once the work of its own independent special legal commission was 
completed. The commission reiterates its call for immediate and unhindered access to the 
Syrian Arab Republic.

<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Establishment of the commission of inquiry 
</b></p>
<p>1. At its seventeenth special session, the Human Rights Council considered the report 
of the fact-finding mission submitted by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) pursuant to Council resolution S-16/1.1 In the 
light of the mission&#8217;s findings, including that patterns of human rights violations may 
</p>
<p>amount to crimes against humanity, and the deteriorating human rights situation in the 
Syrian Arab Republic, the Council decided to establish an independent international 
commission of inquiry. 
</p>
<p>2. On 12 September 2011, the President of the Human Rights Council appointed three 
high-level experts as members of the commission: Paulo Pinheiro (Chairperson), Yakin 
Ert&#252;rk and Karen Koning AbuZayd. A secretariat of the commission, with a broad range of 
expertise in the field of human rights investigations and international law, was provided by 
OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>3. The Human Rights Council requested the commission to make its report public 
before the end of November 2011. The commission will present a written update to the 
Council at its nineteenth session, in March 2012. The present report is submitted pursuant 
to the request of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate and terms of reference 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution S-17/1, mandated the commission to 
investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011 in the 
Syrian Arab Republic, to establish the facts and circumstances that may amount to such 
violations and of the crimes perpetrated and, where possible, to identify those responsible 
with a view of ensuring that perpetrators of violations, including those that may constitute 
crimes against humanity, are held accountable. The commission adopted its terms of 
reference (annex I) in the light of its mandate. 
</p>
<p>5. The commissioners agreed that the first component of the mandate (&#8220;to establish 
facts and circumstances&#8221;) required the commission to act as a fact-finding body. As such, 
the standard of proof used was one of &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221;. This standard was met when 
the commission obtained a reliable body of evidence, consistent with other information, 
indicating the occurrence of a particular incident or event. This is a lower standard of proof 
than that applied in a criminal proceeding. 
</p>
<p>6. In order to fulfil the second component of the mandate (&#8220;to identify those 
responsible&#8221;), the commission understood that it had to collect a reliable body of material to 
indicate which individuals might be responsible for human rights violations. The 
commission received information on the alleged responsibility of a number of individuals 
for violations committed in the Syrian Arab Republic from March 2011 to the time of 
drafting of the present report. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/18/53. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>5 
</p>
<p><b> C. Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>7. First-hand information was collected through interviews with victims and witnesses 
of events in the Syrian Arab Republic. The interviewing process began in Geneva on 26 
September 2011. Overall, 223 victims and/or witnesses, including personnel who defected 
from the military and the security forces, were interviewed. 
</p>
<p>8. A public call was made to all interested persons and organizations to submit relevant 
information and documentation that would help the commission implement its mandate. It 
held meetings with Member States from all regional groups, regional organizations, 
including the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, non-
governmental organizations, human rights defenders, journalists and experts. Reports, 
scholarly analyses and media accounts, as well as audio and visual material, were also duly 
considered. 
</p>
<p>9. The information collected is stored in a secure database governed by United Nations 
rules on confidentiality. 
</p>
<p>10. The protection of victims and witnesses lies at the heart of the methodology of 
human rights investigations. While the collected information remains confidential, the 
commission is deeply concerned about the possibility of reprisals against individuals who 
cooperated with it, and against their relatives in the Syrian Arab Republic. It is also 
concerned about the protection of those individuals who openly spoke to the media in an 
attempt to counter the news blockade imposed by the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Cooperation of the Government 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Human Rights Council called upon the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic to cooperate fully with the commission. The commission addressed letters on 29 
September (annex II), 19 October (annex IV), 27 October (annex V), and 4 November 2011 
(annex VI) requesting to visit the country. The Chairperson of the commission conveyed in 
person similar requests to representatives of the Syrian Arab Republic in Brazil and in the 
United States of America. The commission solicited meetings with the Permanent 
Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic in Geneva, as well as with the Head of the 
Syrian delegation attending the universal periodic review of the Council. In a letter dated 12 
October 2011, the Government stated that an independent special legal commission had 
been established to investigate all cases pertaining to the events that had taken place since 
March 2011 (annex III). The Government would therefore examine the possibility of 
cooperating with the commission once its own commission had concluded its work. 
</p>
<p>12. In its letter dated 27 October 2011, the commission reiterated its invitation to the 
members of the independent special legal commission and relevant Syrian officials to visit 
Geneva in November. A questionnaire was annexed to the letter with a view of engaging 
the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic in a dialogue (annex V).  
</p>
<p>13. The commission deeply regrets not having had access to the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political background 
</b></p>
<p>14. Syria gained independence in April 1946 as a parliamentary republic. The post-
independence period was marked by several military coups and coup attempts. A state of 
emergency, from 1963 to April 2011, effectively suspended most constitutional protections </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>for citizens. Hafez Al Assad became President in 1971 following a military coup. Bashar Al 
Assad succeeded his father in 2000. Under their rule, the Baath party came to dominate and 
control all aspects of political and social life. 
</p>
<p>15. The Syrian Arab Republic has a population of 22 million, of whom 74 per cent 
Sunni Muslim, 10 per cent Alawite, 3 per cent other Shia Muslim, 10 per cent Christian and 
3 per cent Druze. Major ethnic minorities include Kurdish, Assyrian, Armenian, Turkmen 
and Circassian populations. The Al Assad family belongs to the Alawite religious 
community. While comprising only 10 per cent of the population, Alawites today make up 
the majority in the key positions of the State apparatus, including the officer corps of the 
armed forces, the Republican Guard and the Fourth Division. 
</p>
<p>16.<b> </b>In 1982, severe human rights violations occurred in the context of an uprising by the 
Muslim Brotherhood in the city of Hama. In an attack by Syrian forces, several 
neighbourhoods of the city were shelled and destroyed, and between 10,000 and 25,000 
people are estimated to have been killed, most of them civilians. These documented mass 
killings and numerous violations of human rights remain unpunished. 
</p>
<p>17. During the past four decades, suspected opponents of the Government have suffered 
torture, detention and long prison sentences imposed under vaguely defined crimes relating 
to political activity. Surveillance and suppression has been conducted by an extensive 
apparatus of intelligence, the <i>mukhabarat</i>. Decades of tight control of freedom of 
expression, as well as surveillance and persecution of opponents, have severely limited 
political life and the constitution of an autonomous civil society. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Military and security forces 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Syrian Arab Armed Forces comprise the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. 
They are responsible for defending the national territory and protecting the State from 
internal threats. Numbering around 300,000, the armed forces are organized into three corps 
with a total of 12 divisions: seven armoured, three mechanized, one Republican Guard and 
the Special Forces. Elite units include the 10,000-man Republican Guard, under the 
President&#8217;s control, tasked to counter any threat from dissident military forces, and the 
20,000-man Fourth Division, which is commanded by Maher Al Assad, the President&#8217;s 
brother. 
</p>
<p>19. The State security apparatus is reported to be large and effective, with a multitude of 
security forces and intelligence agencies that have overlapping missions. They play a 
powerful role in Syrian society, monitoring and repressing opposition to the Government. 
The internal security apparatus includes police forces under the Ministry of the Interior, 
Syrian Military Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence<b>, </b>the<b> </b>National Security Bureau, the 
Political Security Directorate and the General Intelligence Directorate. The latter consists of 
25,000 members formally under the Ministry of the Interior but reporting directly to the 
President and his inner circle. It includes Internal Security (also known as the State Security 
Service), External Security and the Palestine Division. 
</p>
<p>20. The militia includes the <i>Shabbiha,</i> which is composed of an estimated 10,000 
civilians, who are armed by the Government and are widely used to crush anti-Government 
demonstrations alongside national security forces; and the People&#8217;s Army<b>, </b>a Baath party 
militia<b> </b>with an estimated 100,000 reservists, designed to provide additional security and 
protection in cities in times of war. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>7 
</p>
<p><b> C. National legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>21. The 1973 Constitution of the Syrian Arab Republic enshrines a number of 
fundamental human rights, such as the equality of citizens before the law, the rights to 
freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and the right not to be subjected to torture or 
humiliating treatment. Article 8 states that the Baath party is the leading political party. The 
President is the supreme commander of the armed forces. He may declare war and general 
mobilization, and conclude peace with the approval of the People&#8217;s Assembly;2 he may also 
declare and terminate a state of emergency pursuant to the law.3 The President issues all 
necessary decisions and orders for the exercise of his authority and can delegate certain 
powers.4 Article 113 provides the President with the power to take necessary measures to 
address grave emergencies. 
</p>
<p>22. Legislative Decrees 14/1969 and 69/2008 give immunity to members of the security 
forces. While the Constitution guarantees the independence of judges, membership in the 
Baath party is a precondition for judicial and prosecutor positions. The President presides 
over the Higher Council of the Judiciary, which administers the judicial system. He also sits 
on the Supreme Constitutional Court and appoints its other four members. 
</p>
<p><b> D. International legal obligations 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Syrian Arab Republic is party to most major international human rights treaties, 
including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Right, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
Optional Protocol thereto on the involvement of children in armed conflict, and the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide<b>. 
</b></p>
<p>24.<b> </b>As a State party to the above treaties, the Syrian Arab Republic is bound to respect, 
protect, promote and fulfil the human rights of all persons within its jurisdiction. This 
includes the responsibility of the State to provide victims with an effective remedy, 
including reparation, and to undertake prompt and impartial investigations.5 
</p>
<p>25. Derogations from human rights provisions are foreseen only in certain human rights 
treaties and are exclusively permitted under specific circumstances. The Syrian Arab 
Republic has never notified the Secretary-General of any state of emergency and 
subsequent derogations made to its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. Non-derogable provisions include, but are not limited to, the right to 
life, the prohibition of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, and freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion. The commission furthermore recalls that article 2(2) of 
the Convention against Torture states that &#8220;no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, 
whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public 
emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.&#8221;

<p>and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of 
International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law (General 
Assembly resolution 60/147, annex). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>26. United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures have raised a number of 
concerns with regard to serious violations of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic in 
recent years. In 2010, the Committee against Torture expressed concern at the lack of 
judicial independence and arbitrary procedures that resulted in the systematic violation of 
the right to fair trials.<b> </b>The Committee<b> </b>also reported widespread, routine and consistent 
torture of prisoners in detention.6 In 2011, concerns were also raised with regard to the 
number of enforced disappearances by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances.7<b> </b>The widespread harassment of human rights defenders, including 
restrictions on their freedom of movement, violations of the freedom of expression and the 
right to assembly were also addressed by various treaty bodies.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Events and human rights violations since March 2011 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Sequence of events 
</b></p>
<p>27. In February 2011, limited protests broke out around issues such as rural poverty, 
corruption, freedom of expression, democratic rights and the release of political prisoners. 
Subsequent protests called for respect for human rights, and demanded far-reaching 
economic, legal and political reforms. By mid-March, peaceful protests erupted in Dar&#8217;a in 
response to the detention and torture of a group of children accused of painting anti-
Government graffiti on public buildings. Following the suppression by State forces of 
peaceful protests, including firing at a funeral procession, civilian marches in support of 
Dar&#8217;a spread to a number of cities, including some suburbs of Al Ladhiqiyah, Baniyas, 
</p>
<p>Damascus, Dayr Az Zawr, Homs, Hama and Idlib. 
</p>
<p>28. On 25 April, Syrian armed forces undertook the first wide-scale military operation in 
Dar&#8217;a. Since then, protests have continued across the country, with an increasingly violent 
</p>
<p>response by State forces. Other major military operations were carried out in different 
locations. On 8 November, OHCHR estimated that at least 3,500 civilians had been killed 
by State forces since March 2011. Thousands are also reported to have been detained, 
tortured and ill-treated. Homs, Hama and Dar&#8217;a reportedly suffered the highest number of 
casualties. 
</p>
<p>29. Numerous defections from military and security forces have occurred since the onset 
of the protests, and have, by many accounts, increased in recent months. An unknown 
number of defectors have organized themselves into the &#8220;Free Syrian Army&#8221;, which has 
claimed responsibility for armed attacks against both military and security forces (although 
there is no reliable information on the size, structure, capability and operations of this 
body). Colonel Riad Al Asaad, who declared his defection in July, is said to be in charge of 
the Free Syrian Army.  
</p>
<p>30. From the start of the protests, the Government has claimed to be the target of attacks 
by armed gangs and terrorists, some of whom it accused of being funded by foreign 
sources. On 30 March 2011, in his national address, President Al Assad asserted that the 
Syrian Arab Republic was &#8220;facing a great conspiracy&#8221; at the hands of &#8220;imperialist forces&#8221;. 
He stated that conspirators had spread false information, incited sectarian tension and used 
violence. He contended that they were supported inside the country by media groups and 
others.

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>9 
</p>
<p>31. In April, the President announced several steps towards political and legal reform. 
These steps included the formation of a new Government,8 the lifting of the state of 
emergency,9 the abolition of the Supreme State Security Court,10 the granting of general 
amnesties11 and new regulations on the right of citizens to participate in peaceful 
demonstrations.12 
</p>
<p>32. On 2 June, the President announced the establishment of the National Dialogue 
Commission, responsible for preparing consultations as part of a transitional process 
towards a multiparty democracy. Several leading opposition figures boycotted the meeting 
because of the continued violence used against protesters. 
</p>
<p>33. On 6 June, the President stated that members of the military and security forces, as 
well as innocent people, had been killed in acts of sabotage and terror. While admitting that 
the State should work tirelessly to meet the demands of its people, he affirmed that among 
those demanding change was a small group of criminals and religious extremists attempting 
to spread chaos. The Government news agency increasingly reported armed attacks against 
State forces in cities, including Homs, Hama, Idlib and Talkalakh. 
</p>
<p>34. The Government has since announced a number of policy initiatives as part of the 
reform process, including Decree No. 100 of 3 August, promulgating a new law on political 
parties, and Decree No. 101 of 3 August, promulgating a general law on elections.13 Local 
elections were announced for 12 December,14 and a new law on the media was introduced 
on 2 September.15 On 16 October, the President established a national committee tasked 
with preparing a draft constitution, which would be subject to a referendum within four 
months.16 
</p>
<p>35. On 3 August, the Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the 
ongoing violence against protesters by Syrian forces and calling on restraint from all sides. 
It also called on the Syrian Arab Republic to implement political reforms and to cooperate 
with OHCHR.17 On 4 October, China and the Russian Federation vetoed a draft resolution 
of the Security Council,18in which the Council recommended possible measures against the 
Syrian Arab Republic under Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>36. A number of States and regional organizations have imposed sanctions on the Syrian 
Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>37. On 7 October, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic reiterated that the 
country was being subjected to a series of criminal attacks by armed terrorist groups and an 
unprecedented media campaign of lies and allegations, supported by certain western States. 
According to the Government, the groups involved had committed offences against the 
Syrian people, including acts of theft, murder and vandalism, and they were exploiting 
peaceful demonstrations to create anarchy. The Government also claimed that 1,100 
members of State forces had been killed by terrorists and armed gangs.19 It pointed out that,

</p>
<p>while many protests had been conducted in full legality, others had been held without 
notification and disrupted public order. 
</p>
<p>38. On 2 November, the Council of the League of Arab States announced that the Syrian 
Arab Republic had agreed on a workplan to end violence and protect citizens. The 
Government also pledged to release all those detained in relation to the recent events, to 
remove armed elements from cities and inhabited areas, and to give the specialized 
organizations of the League and Arab and international media access to the country. The 
Council mandated a ministerial committee of the League to oversee and report on the 
implementation of the workplan. According to the Government, 553 detainees were 
released pursuant to the agreement. Continued violence and the non-implementation of the 
agreement prompted the League, on 12 November, to adopt a resolution suspending Syrian 
activities within the organization. The resolution also imposed economic and political 
sanctions on the country, and reiterated the previous demand that the Syrian Arab Republic 
withdraw its armed forces from cities and residential areas. The League urged its Member 
States to recall their ambassadors from Damascus. The measures came into force on 16 
November. On 15 November, 1,180 prisoners were also released. 
</p>
<p>39. In November, military and security forces carried out operations in Homs, Dar&#8217;a, 
Hama, Dayr Az Zawr and Rif Damascus, targeting public assemblies and funeral 
processions. In Homs, the operations were conducted in the residential areas of Alqaseer, 
Bab Amr, Bab Al Sibaa, Bab Hood and Karm Al Zaitoon. According to eyewitnesses, tanks 
deployed in and around the city frequently fired at residential buildings. It is estimated that, 
in a three-week period until 13 November, 260 civilians were killed. According to 
information received, a small number of defectors claiming to be part of the Free Syrian 
Army engaged in operations against State forces, killing and injuring members of military 
and security forces. 
</p>
<p>40. On 20 November, in an interview published by <i>The Sunday Times</i>, President Al 
Assad explained that his Government did not have a policy to treat the public harshly; its 
aim was to fight militants to restore stability and protect civilians. He added that any 
&#8220;mistakes&#8221; committed by officials would be addressed by the independent special legal 
</p>
<p>commission. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Excessive use of force and extrajudicial executions 
</b></p>
<p>41. According to individual testimonies, including those of defectors who have 
acknowledged their role in policing and quelling the protests, State forces shot 
indiscriminately at unarmed protestors. Most were shot in the upper body, including in the 
head. Defectors from military and security forces told the commission that they had 
received orders to shoot at unarmed protesters without warning. In some instances, 
however, commanders of operations ordered protesters to disperse and issued warnings 
prior to opening fire. In some cases, non-lethal means were used prior to or at the same time 
as live ammunition. 
</p>
<p>42. The commission received several testimonies indicating that military and security 
forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> militias had planned and conducted joint operations with &#8220;shoot to 
kill&#8221; orders to crush demonstrations. Such operations were conducted in the centre of Al 
Ladhiqiyah around Sheikh Daher Square in early April, and also in the Ramel suburb of Al 
Ladhiqiyah on 13 and 14 August. During the latter incident, at least 20 people, including 
children, were reportedly killed. In other incidents, officers ordered their personnel to attack 
protesters without warning, hitting them with batons. 
</p>
<p>43. A defector described to the commission the rationale for deployment and the orders 
that were given to his army battalion on 1 May: </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>11 
</p>
<p>Our commanding officer told us that there were armed conspirators and terrorists 
attacking civilians and burning Government buildings. We went into Telbisa on that 
day. We did not see any armed group. The protestors called for freedom. They 
carried olive branches and marched with their children. We were ordered to either 
disperse the crowd or eliminate everybody, including children. The orders were to 
fire in the air and immediately after to shoot at people. No time was allowed 
between one action and the other. We opened fire; I was there. We used machine 
guns and other weapons. There were many people on the ground, injured or killed. 
</p>
<p>44. The rationale for the use of force and orders to open fire on demonstrators were 
echoed in numerous testimonies of other former soldiers who had been dispatched to 
different locations and at different times. For example, on 29 April, thousands of people 
walked from nearby villages to the town of Dar&#8217;a to bring food, water and medicine to the 
</p>
<p>local population. When they reached the Sayda residence complex, they were ambushed by 
security forces. More than 40 people were reportedly killed, including women and children. 
</p>
<p>45. The commission is aware of acts of violence committed by some demonstrators. 
However, it notes that the majority of civilians were killed in the context of peaceful 
demonstrations. Accounts collected by the commission, including those of defectors, 
indicated that protesters were largely unarmed and determined to claim their rights and 
express their discontent peacefully. 
</p>
<p>46. Snipers were responsible for many casualties. On some occasions, snipers appeared 
to be targeting leaders of the march and those using loudspeakers or carrying cameras and 
mobile phones. The commission heard several accounts of how those who were trying to 
rescue the wounded and collect the bodies of demonstrators also came under sniper fire. 
The commission documented several cases in Dar&#8217;a, Hama and Al Ladhiqiyah. 
</p>
<p>47. Checkpoints and roadblocks were set up to prevent people from moving freely and 
joining demonstrations, especially on Fridays. Defectors who were deployed at checkpoints 
told the commission about &#8220;black lists&#8221; with names of people wanted by the authorities. 
They were given instructions to search for weapons and, in some cases, given orders to 
shoot. A soldier who manned two checkpoints in the Dar&#8217;a governorate, from April to 
August, was given orders &#8220;to search everybody and if any demonstrators try to pass 
through, to fire at them&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>48. Several defectors witnessed the killing of their comrades who refused to execute 
orders to fire at civilians. A number of conscripts were allegedly killed by security forces 
on 25 April in Dar&#8217;a during a large-scale military operation. The soldiers in the first row 
were given orders to aim directly at residential areas, but chose to fire in the air to avoid 
civilian casualties. Security forces posted behind shot them for refusing orders, thus killing 
dozens of conscripts. 
</p>
<p>49. Civilians bore the brunt of the violence as cities were blockaded and curfews 
imposed. The commission heard many testimonies describing how those who ventured 
outside their homes were shot by snipers. Many of the reported cases occurred in Dar&#8217;a, Jisr 
</p>
<p>Al Shughour and Homs. A lawyer told how security forces took positions in old Dar&#8217;a 
</p>
<p>during the operation in April. Snipers were deployed on the hospital rooftop and other 
buildings. &#8220;They targeted anyone who moved&#8221;, he said. Two of his cousins were killed on 
the street by snipers. 
</p>
<p>50. A number of cases was documented of injured people who were taken to military 
hospitals, where they were beaten and tortured during interrogation. Torture and killings 
reportedly took place in the Homs Military Hospital by security forces dressed as doctors 
and allegedly acting with the complicity of medical personnel. As people became afraid of 
going to public hospitals, makeshift clinics were set up in mosques and private houses, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>which also became targets. This was the case of the Omari Mosque in Dar&#8217;a, which was 
</p>
<p>raided on 23 March. Several of the injured and some medical personnel were killed there. 
</p>
<p>51. According to the Government, global media inaccurately reported the use of 
weapons against civilians to discredit the Syrian Arab Republic. Security forces were 
deployed to the demonstrations to keep the peace, but many of them were killed, including 
unarmed police officers. For instance, in the city of Homs, 12 police officers were 
reportedly murdered. The Government claimed that security forces were not usually armed 
when policing demonstrations. It also claimed that the information on the use of tanks was 
false, and that they were used solely for rescuing overwhelmed police officers who had no 
means of defending themselves. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, torture and other forms 
</b></p>
<p><b>of ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Arbitrary detentions  
</b></p>
<p>52. According to many accounts gathered, arbitrary arrests and unlawful detentions were 
widespread and occurred at an alarming rate in places such as Homs, Hama, Jisr Al-
Shughour, Dar&#8217;a and in Rif Dimashq, regarded as supportive of the protest movement. 
</p>
<p>53. Arrests have been conducted mainly in the context of wide-scale military operations 
targeting specific areas or during demonstrations. Various victims consistently stated that 
they had been physically or verbally assaulted during the arrest process before being held 
for various periods of time without due process and routinely subjected to torture. 
</p>
<p>54. One of the reportedly largest-scale arbitrary arrest campaigns took place in the city 
of Baniyas on 7 May. According to various eyewitness accounts, the army swept through 
the villages surrounding the city using tanks, armoured vehicles and soldiers. Security and 
military forces broke into houses and reportedly arrested more than 500 people, including 
women and children. A similar incident was reported in Jisr Al-Shughour in the early hours 
of 14 May. Following a large demonstration on the previous day, members of the security 
forces arrested more than 400 people during night raids. Some 400 people, including 
women and children, were detained in the Ramel suburb of Al Ladhiqiyah on 13 and 14 
August. 
</p>
<p>55. Other arrests targeted activists who participated or helped to organize 
demonstrations and whose names appeared on security forces&#8217; lists. Families and 
acquaintances of wanted individuals were detained by security forces as a measure of 
intimidation and retribution. 
</p>
<p>56. A number of journalists and web activists claimed they had been detained and 
tortured for reporting on demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>57. Many of the defectors interviewed indicated that soldiers suspected of sympathizing 
with or aiding demonstrators were immediately detained. A conscript explained how he 
witnessed the torture of many defectors inside a prison. 
</p>
<p>58. Accounts obtained from victims and defectors described arbitrary arrest and 
conditions of detention in grave terms. Some were detained in the offices of security forces 
or in prisons, while others were transferred to open stadiums, schools and, in some cases, 
hospitals. Most of those arrested were blindfolded and handcuffed, and denied food and 
medical assistance. Several people reported that scores were detained, beaten and tortured 
in the stadium in Al Ladhiqiyah in August. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>13 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>59. Allegations of enforced disappearances were received. Although it is impossible to 
assess the exact scale of the phenomenon, many reports put the number of the missing and 
unaccounted for in the thousands. A witness described the abduction of his brother-in-law 
in September in the Dar&#8217;a governorate. His family has heard nothing about him since. He 
stated that his aunt and uncle had gone to look for him in both Dar&#8217;a and Damascus. &#8220;The 
</p>
<p>authorities refused to give them any information. In the course of a telephone conversation 
with an acquaintance in the security services, my uncle was advised to forget about his 
son.&#8221; </p>
<p>60. Another witness stated that, on 24 July, members of the military security came to 
arrest one of his cousins in their family home in Dar&#8217;a. Five days later his father and 
</p>
<p>brother went to the military security quarters to ask about him. &#8220;We were given the run 
around. There was no further news of my cousin,&#8221; the interviewee concluded. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>61. Numerous victims of torture and other forms of ill-treatment were interviewed. 
Many were subjected to severe beatings with batons and cables. They also endured 
prolonged stress position for hours or even days in a row, electroshocks and deprivation of 
food, water and sleep. Detainees were often put in overcrowded cells and forced to take 
turns to sleep. Many were blindfolded and sometimes handcuffed, then forced<b> </b>to thumb-
sign written confessions of crimes that, at best, were read to them by an officer. Several 
witnesses and victims interviewed emphasized that they were tortured whether they 
confessed or not. 
</p>
<p>62. Children were also tortured, some to death. Two well-known cases are those of 
Thamir Al Sharee, aged 14, and Hamza Al Katheeb, aged 13, from the town of Sayda in the 
Dar&#8217;a governorate. They were seized and allegedly taken to an Air Force Intelligence 
facility in Damascus in April. They did not return home alive. The injuries described in the 
post-mortem report of Thamir Al Sharee are consistent with torture. A witness, himself a 
victim of torture, claimed to have seen Thamir Al Sharee on 3 May. The witness stated that 
&#8220;the boy was lying on the floor and was completely blue. He was bleeding profusely from 
</p>
<p>his ear, eyes and nose. He was shouting and calling for his mother and father for help. He 
fainted after being hit with a rifle butt on the head.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>63. Torture has been described as rampant at detention facilities of the Air Force 
Intelligence Branch in the Mazzeh airport near Damascus. Other facilities where torture 
was reported to have taken place are the facilities of Air Force Intelligence in Bab Tuma, in 
Homs; the Maza Al Jabal prison of the Republican Guard; the Political Security Branch 
detention facility in Al Ladhiqiyah; and the Altala&#8217;a military base, which hosts the central 
command centre for police, military and intelligence operations in Idlib governorate. 
</p>
<p>64. Defectors were tortured because they attempted to spare civilians either 
surreptitiously or by openly refusing to obey orders. A defector showed scars on his arms 
compatible with electroshock marks and about 30 stitches on his scalp. He stated: 
</p>
<p>On Friday 12August, we received orders to go to the Omar al Khattab Mosque, in 
Duma (Damascus governorate), where about 150 people had gathered. We opened 
fire. A number of people were killed. I tried to aim high. Later, I realized that 
security forces had been taking pictures of us. I was pictured firing in the air. I was 
interrogated. I was accused of being a secret agent. Members of the Republican 
Guard beat me every hour for two days, and they tortured me with electroshocks. 
</p>
<p>65. Several methods of torture, including sexual torture, were used by the military and 
the security forces in detention facilities across the country. Torture victims had scars and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>bore other visible marks. Detainees were also subjected to psychological torture, including 
sexual threats against them and their families and by being forced to worship President Al 
Assad instead of their god. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>66. Several testimonies reported the practice of sexual torture used on male detainees. 
Men were routinely made to undress and remain naked. Several former detainees testified 
reported beatings of genitals, forced oral sex, electroshocks and cigarette burns to the anus 
in detention facilities, including those of the Air Force Intelligence in Damascus, the 
Military Intelligence in Jisr Al Shughour, the Military Intelligence and the Political Security 
in Idlib and Al Ladhiqiyah and the intelligence detention facilities in Tartus. Several of the 
detainees were repeatedly threatened that they would be raped in front of their family and 
that their wives and daughters would also be raped. 
</p>
<p>67. Testimonies were received from several men who stated they had been anally raped 
with batons and that they had witnessed the rape of boys. One man stated that he witnessed 
a 15-year-old boy being raped in front of his father. A 40-year-old man saw the rape of an 
11-year-old boy by three security services officers. He stated: &#8220;I have never been so afraid 
in my whole life. And then they turned to me and said; you are next.&#8221; The interviewee was 
unable to continue his testimony. One 20-year-old university student told the commission 
that he was subjected to sexual violence in detention, adding that &#8220;if my father had been 
</p>
<p>present and seen me, I would have had to commit suicide&#8221;.<b> </b>Another man confided while 
crying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like a man any more&#8221;. </p>
<p>68. Several women testified that they were threatened and insulted during house raids by 
the military and security forces. Women felt dishonoured by the removal of their head 
scarves and the handling of their underwear during raids of their homes, which often 
occurred at night. Defectors from the military and the security forces indicated that they had 
been present in places of detention where women were sexually assaulted; the commission, 
however, received limited evidence to that effect. This may be due in part to the stigma that 
victims would endure if they came forward. 
</p>
<p><b> E. </b>Violations of children&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>69. The information collected indicates that children have suffered serious violations 
and that State forces have shown little or no recognition of the rights of children in the 
actions taken to quell dissent. 
</p>
<p>70. Witnesses informed the commission that children (mostly boys) were killed or 
injured by beatings or shooting during demonstrations in several locations across the 
country, including Sayda, Dar&#8217;a, Idlib, Hama, Homs, Sarmeen Al Ladhiqiyah and Dayr Az 
Zawr. Reliable sources indicated that 256 children had been killed by State forces as at 9 
November. The commission spoke with several children who had witnessed the killing of 
adults and of other children, and also met a 2-year-old girl whose mother was killed by the 
Syrian military in August while trying to cross the border. The commission saw several 
children whose mental health was seriously affected by their traumatic experience. 
</p>
<p>71. One military defector stated that he decided to defect after witnessing the shooting 
of a 2-year-old girl in Al Ladhiqiyah on 13 August by an officer who affirmed that he did 
not want her to grow into a demonstrator. A 15-year-old boy interviewed was shot in the 
leg in Homs on 15 August while returning home from the mosque. The neighbours tried to 
take him to hospital, but checkpoints by security forces blocked access to it. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>15 
</p>
<p>72. Numerous accounts from former detainees indicated the presence of children, some 
younger than 10, in detention centres in various locations run by the military and security 
forces. Torture was reportedly applied equally to adults and children. Several former 
detainees informed the commission that young boys were tortured at the Air Force 
Intelligence detention facilities in and around Damascus, in intelligence detention facilities 
in Tartus and in Political Security and Military Intelligence detention facilities in Al 
Ladhiqiyah and Idlib. One defector stated that &#8220;people had their feet and hands bound with 
plastic handcuffs. They were beaten mercilessly, including 10-year-old children. Some 
children urinated out of fear while they were being beaten. It was very cruel.&#8221; </p>
<p>73. Numerous testimonies indicated that boys were subjected to sexual torture in places 
of detention in front of adult men. 
</p>
<p>74. The commission received many reports on the use of schools as detention facilities 
and on the deployment of snipers on the roofs of schools. Several children expressed 
concerns that they were prevented from continuing their education. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Displacement and restriction of movement 
</b></p>
<p>75. The repression of protests has prompted a significant number of Syrians to flee the 
country. Syrian refugees number around 8,000 in Turkey, 3,400 in Lebanon and 1,000 in 
Jordan.20 There are no recorded numbers for internally displaced people, but the 
commission received information on significant internal displacement from areas where 
military operations are prevalent, including in Homs. 
</p>
<p>76. Disturbing accounts were received of Syrian security and military forces using live 
fire against, and sometimes killing, individuals trying to flee the country. In an incident 
near Idlib in August 2011, a family with children travelling in a car towards a crossing at 
the Turkish border came under fire from Syrian armed forces; two family members were 
killed and one wounded. In another incident, in September 2011, Syrian forces killed a man 
as he attempted to cross the border into Turkey. 
</p>
<p>77. Numerous cases documented individuals who felt compelled to cross the border 
because their names appeared on lists of people wanted by the security services because of 
their mere participation in peaceful protests. 
</p>
<p>78. Individuals who had succeeded in crossing the border were targeted by State forces 
when they later approached the border while still on the territory of the neighbouring State. 
</p>
<p>79. In the context of such cases, the commission is furthermore gravely concerned at 
recent reports of Syrian armed forces laying mines near the border with Lebanon, putting 
those compelled to flee at grave risk of severe injury or death. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Violations of economic and social rights 
</b></p>
<p>80. Numerous testimonies were received regarding the obstruction and denial of medical 
assistance to the injured and sick. Many of the injured were prevented from receiving 
treatment in public hospitals in several locations, including Al Ladhiqiyah, Baniyas, Homs 
and Idlib. Consistent testimonies described how members of the security forces tracked 
down wounded protesters in both public and private hospitals. Security forces conducted 
</p>
<p>  
 20 These figures relate to refugees/asylum-seekers who have registered with Governments or the Office 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The number of unregistered persons who 
have fled the country is likely to be significant. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>raids in early June and late July in hospitals in Hama. Injured demonstrators were arrested 
and taken to military hospitals, where they were reportedly interrogated and tortured. 
</p>
<p>81. Individuals suspected by the Government of being involved in setting up and 
operating alternative medical facilities or providing medical supplies or treatments were 
also subjected to arrest and torture by the security forces. According to testimonies, security 
forces warned the staff of private hospitals and ambulance drivers not to treat or provide 
assistance to injured protestors. Instead, they were ordered to transfer all such patients to 
either public or military hospitals. While some private hospitals complied with Government 
orders, others continued to provide wounded protesters with first aid and other medical 
services. 
</p>
<p>82. The rights to food and to water were violated in numerous instances, particularly in 
cities where wide-scale military operations were conducted. For example, witnesses told to 
the commission that, during the attack and blockade of Dar&#8217;a, the military and security 
</p>
<p>forces barred the city&#8217;s residents from obtaining food and other basic necessities. 
</p>
<p>Residential water tanks and water pipes were deliberately damaged by military and security 
forces. 
</p>
<p>83. The commission received credible information regarding the destruction of property, 
including of homes and household possessions. In the context of raids, security and military 
forces received orders from their superiors to systematically loot homes, shops and other 
properties, steal money and other valuables. Motorcycles were confiscated, piled up and 
destroyed to prevent people from joining rallies outside their place of residence. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violations and crimes under applicable international law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International human rights law  
</b></p>
<p>84. On the basis of the information and evidence collected, the commission has reached 
conclusions with regard to a number of serious violations of international human rights law. 
The major conclusions are summarized below. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>85. Accountability constitutes the basic element of justice and the rule of law. The 
commission expresses its grave concern over the prevailing systemic impunity for human 
rights violations and its entrenchment in legislation awarding immunity for State officials, 
in contravention of the State&#8217;s international legal obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Excessive use of force, extrajudicial executions and other violations of the right to life  
</b></p>
<p>86. Governments have an obligation to maintain public order. They bear the ultimate 
responsibility for protecting individuals under their jurisdiction, including those 
participating in public assemblies and exercising their right to freedom of expression. In the 
Syrian Arab Republic, the high toll of dead and injured is the result of the excessive use of 
force by State forces in many regions. Isolated instances of violence on the part of 
demonstrators do not affect their right to protection as enshrined in international human 
rights law. 
</p>
<p>87. The Syrian Arab Republic has violated the right to life, as enshrined in article 6 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, through the use of excessive force 
by military and security forces as well as by militia, such as <i>Shabbiha</i>, acting in complicity 
with, or with the acquiescence of, State officials and forces. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>17 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Violations of the right to peaceful assembly and the right to freedom of expression  
</b></p>
<p>88. Efforts by the Government to control information and the right to freedom of 
assembly and expression lie at the heart of the current violence. Consistent eyewitness and 
victim accounts indicate that military and security forces have reacted excessively to 
peaceful demonstrations, including the use of live ammunition to quell demonstrators and 
extensive cases of arbitrary detention. The presidential decree on freedom of assembly 
issued on 21 April has not ensured respect for human rights. The commission notes with 
great concern the widespread harassment of human rights defenders and journalists. 
</p>
<p>89. The commission concludes that the Syrian Arab Republic has systematically 
violated the rights to freedom of assembly and expression as enshrined in articles 19 and 21 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Arbitrary detention and violations of the right to a fair trial 
</b></p>
<p>90. The commission is seriously concerned about the absence of judicial independence 
and the extensive use of arbitrary and incommunicado detention without criminal charges 
or judicial supervision. Mass arrests have regularly been made by military and security 
forces. Detainees were charged with broadly defined crimes such as &#8220;weakening the 
national sentiment&#8221;, and prosecuted at random in civil or military courts. Despite the 
abolition of the Supreme State Security Court in April 2011, military courts continue to 
operate in clear violation of the right to a fair and public hearing by a competent, 
independent and impartial tribunal. The commission notes with concern reports indicating 
the practice of involuntary and enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>91. The commission concludes that the Syrian Arab Republic has systematically 
violated the right to liberty and security of a person and of fair trial standards as enshrined 
in articles 9, 10 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
articles 37 and 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Torture and sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>92. Information received demonstrates patterns of continuous and widespread use of 
torture across the Syrian Arab Republic where protests have taken place. The pervasive 
nature, recurrence and reported readiness of Syrian authorities to use torture as a tool to 
instil fear indicate that State officials have condoned its practice. Information from military 
and security forces defectors indicates that they received orders to torture. The commission 
is particularly disturbed over the extensive reports of sexual violence, principally against 
men and boys, in places of detention. 
</p>
<p>93. The commission concludes that the extensive practices of torture indicate a State-
sanctioned policy of repression, which manifestly violates the State&#8217;s obligations under 
article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against 
Torture, and article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. </b>Violations of children&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>94. The commission expresses its deepest concern over consistent reports of extensive 
violations of children&#8217;s rights committed since the start of the uprising in March, including 
killings of children during demonstrations and widespread practices of arbitrary detention, 
torture and ill-treatment, in particular of boys. Children were subjected to the same 
conditions and abuses in detention as adults. The commission concludes that the State has 
fundamentally failed its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, article 
24 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention against 
Torture. </p>

<p>95. The right to freedom of movement is provided for under article 12 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This right encompasses both the 
freedom of movement inside the country of residence and the freedom to leave one&#8217;s 
country. The Syrian Arab Republic has taken measures to restrict the right to leave the 
country to seek protection and has deliberately targeted and killed people at or near border 
crossings. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Violations of economic and social rights 
</b></p>
<p>96. Restrictions imposed by the State on the treatment of injured protesters constitute 
serious violations of the right to health and the right to access medical assistance 
guaranteed under article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. Other rights, such as the right to an adequate standard of living and the rights to 
food, to water (art. 11) and to education (art. 13), have been infringed upon in the context of 
wide-scale military operations and blockades in several locations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>97. The commission is concerned that the armed violence in the Syrian Arab Republic 
risks rising to the level of an &#8220;internal armed conflict&#8221; under international law. Should this 
</p>
<p>occur, international humanitarian law would apply. The commission recalls that the 
International Court of Justice has established that human rights law continues to apply in 
armed conflict, with the law of armed conflict applying as <i>lex specialis</i> in relation to the 
conduct of hostilities. 
</p>
<p>98. According to the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia, an armed conflict exists when there is a resort to armed force between 
States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed 
groups, or between such groups within a State. The Trial Chamber in <i>Tadi</i>&#263; and subsequent 
cases interpreted the test for internal armed conflict as consisting of two criteria: the 
intensity of the conflict, and the organization of the parties to the conflict, as a way to 
distinguish armed conflict from banditry, unorganized and short-lived insurrections or 
terrorist activities, which do not fall within the scope of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>99. The commission was unable to verify the level of the intensity of combat between 
Syrian armed forces and other armed groups. Similarly, it has been unable to confirm the 
level of organization of such armed groups as the Free Syrian Army. For the purposes of 
the present report, therefore, the commission will not apply international humanitarian law 
to the events in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011. 
</p>
<p>100. Nevertheless, crimes against humanity may occur irrespective of the existence of an 
armed conflict and the application of international humanitarian law. The commission 
describes below its reasons for concluding that members of the Syrian military and security 
forces have committed crimes against humanity in 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> C. International criminal law 
</b></p>
<p>101. According to article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
&#8220;crimes against humanity&#8221; include acts such as murder, torture and unlawful imprisonment 
when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>19 
</p>
<p>population, with knowledge of the attack. Crimes against humanity have five elements: 
there must have been an attack;21 the attack must have been directed against the civilian 
population;22 the attack must be widespread or systematic;23 the acts of the perpetrator must 
form part of the attack;24 and the perpetrator must know that there is an attack directed 
against the civilian population.25 
</p>
<p>102. The commission received numerous, credible and consistent first-hand reports about 
widespread and systematic violations of the human rights of civilians in the Syrian Arab 
Republic since March 2011. The scale of these attacks against civilians in cities and 
villages across the country, their repetitive nature, the levels of excessive force used 
consistently by units of the armed forces and diverse security forces, the coordinated nature 
of these attacks and the evidence that many attacks were conducted on the orders of high-
ranking military officers all lead the commission to conclude that the attacks were 
apparently conducted pursuant to a policy of the State. 
</p>
<p>103. The above conclusion finds support in diverse sources of information. Multiple 
witnesses indicated that, on different days and in different locations, officers at the level of 
Colonel and Brigadier General issued orders to their subordinate units to open fire on 
protesters, beat demonstrators and fire at civilian homes. The commission received credible 
evidence that it is unlikely that the officers issued these orders independently given that the 
Syrian military forces are professional forces subject to military discipline. The commission 
therefore believes that orders to shoot and otherwise mistreat civilians originated from 
policies and directives issued at the highest levels of the armed forces and the Government. 
</p>
<p>104. Security forces and the military made concerted efforts to control access to 
information about the protests. Prior to operations to stop civilian demonstrations, military 
commanders told their units, falsely, that they were going to fight &#8220;terrorists&#8221;, &#8220;armed 
gangs&#8221; or Israelis. Television sets in barracks and soldiers&#8217; cellular telephones were 
confiscated. Journalists who attempted to report on the protests were arrested, detained, 
tortured and interrogated about the activities of their colleagues. People who filmed 
attempts by security forces to stop demonstrations were targeted for arrest. Different 
pretexts were used to create the impression that the civilian protesters were &#8220;terrorists&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;armed gangs&#8221;: for example, in the Saqba suburb of Damascus, security forces circled 
behind protesters and fired towards the soldiers deployed there to create the impression that 
the soldiers were being fired upon. These efforts to control and distort available information 
about events reflect the existence of a plan or policy to conceal the truth. 
</p>
<p>105. Witness testimonies revealed extensive degrees of coordination among diverse 
security and military forces during operations to stop protests. Members of security forces 
were often stationed behind soldiers or inside tanks to ensure that soldiers followed orders 
to shoot at protesters. On several occasions, soldiers who disobeyed these orders were shot 
themselves by the security forces or by army snipers. In addition, members of the <i>Shabbiha

</p>
<p>paramilitary groups were often present during operations to quash demonstrations and 
assisted in efforts to repress protests. When soldiers detained demonstrators, they would 
turn them over to units of the security forces who transported the protestors to detention 
centres. This degree of coordination between military and security forces could only be 
possible under the direction of the highest levels of the Government and the military. 
</p>
<p>106. Information provided to the commission illustrates the extensive resources that the 
Government and armed forces has devoted to efforts to control protests. In addition to 
regular military units armed with automatic weapons, the military deployed snipers, Special 
Forces units, tanks, armoured personnel carriers and intelligence units during operations to 
end demonstrations. To sustain these operations, the State had to provide sufficient 
weapons, ammunition, tank shells, uniforms, transport vehicles, fuel, communications 
equipment and food. Similar material was required to sustain the different security forces 
deployed. The commission believes that expenditure of such large quantities of State 
resources would only be possible pursuant to the policies and directives of the Government. 
</p>
<p>107. The sheer scale and consistent pattern of attacks by military and security forces on 
civilians and civilian neighbourhoods and the widespread destruction of property could 
only be possible with the approval or complicity of the State. 
</p>
<p>108. According to international law, when certain crimes are committed as part of a 
widespread or systematic attack against civilians and the perpetrators know that their 
conduct is part of this attack, such offences constitute crimes against humanity. The 
commission is thus gravely concerned that crimes against humanity of murder,26 torture<b>,</b>27 
rape28 or other forms of sexual violence of comparable gravity,29<b> </b>imprisonment or other 
severe deprivation of liberty,30 enforced disappearances of persons31 and other inhumane 
acts of a similar character32 have occurred in different locations in the country since March 
2011, including, but not limited to, Damascus, Dar&#8217;a, Duma, Hama, Homs, Idlib and along 
the borders. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Responsibility 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. State responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>109. The Syrian Arab Republic has failed its obligations under international human rights 
law. Every internationally wrongful act of a State incurs the international responsibility of 
that State.33 Similarly, customary international law provides that a State is responsible for 
all acts committed by members of its military and security forces.34 The State is therefore 
responsible for wrongful acts, including crimes against humanity, committed by members 
of its military and security forces as documented in the present report.

<p>110. The prohibition of crimes against humanity is a <i>jus cogens</i> or peremptory rule, and 
the punishment of such crimes is obligatory pursuant to the general principles of 
international law.35 Furthermore, crimes against humanity are the culmination of violations 
of fundamental human rights, such as the right to life and the prohibition of torture or other 
forms of inhuman and degrading treatment.36 According to the principles of State 
responsibility in international law, the Syrian Arab Republic bears responsibility for these 
crimes and violations, as well as the duty to ensure that individual perpetrators are punished 
and that victims receive reparation.37 
</p>
<p><b> B. Individual responsibility for crimes against humanity 
</b></p>
<p>111. The principle of individual criminal responsibility for international crimes is well 
established in customary international law.38 According to article 27 of the Rome Statute of 
the International Criminal Court, which the Syrian Arab Republic has signed but not 
ratified, the Statute applies equally to all persons, without any distinction based on official 
capacity. In this context, Syrian laws afford extensive immunities, in most cases, for crimes 
committed by Government agents at all levels during the exercise of their duties. Although 
the Independent Special Legal Commission was established in recent months to investigate 
events, the State still has not provided the commission with any details of investigations or 
prosecutions under way by this mechanism. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>112.<b> The independent international commission of inquiry recommends that the

<p><b>  Letter dated 27 October 2011 from the independent

<p>Dear Mr. Ambassador, 
</p>
<p> On 14 October 2011, we received your letter informing us that the Syrian Arab 
Republic will examine the possibility of cooperating with the Independent International 
Commission of Inquiry as soon as the Syrian Independent Special Legal Commission 
concludes its work. 
</p>
<p> Resolution A/HRC/S-17/1 requests that the Independent International Commission 
of Inquiry make its report public before the end of November and we are in the process of 
finalising our report. 
</p>
<p> In our note verbale of 19 October 2011, we reiterated our request to visit the Syrian 
Arab Republic as part of fulfilling our mandate and extended an invitation to the members 
of the Independent Special Legal Commission and relevant Syrian officials to visit Geneva 
in the second or third week of November.  
</p>
<p> We regret<b> </b>that, to date, the Syrian Arab Republic<b> </b>has not agreed to receive the 
Independent International Commission of Inquiry. This has prevented us from establishing 
direct contact with the authorities of your Government, as well as civil society 
organisations in order to share their assessment of the events since March 2011. 
</p>
<p> We believe that by doing so, the Syrian Arab Republic misses an important 
opportunity to cooperate with the Human Rights Council and Member States from all 
regional groups that are supporting our endeavour.  
</p>
<p> We hope that Syrian Arab Republic will reconsider its decision and would like to 
assure you that we stand ready to conduct a mission to your country and meet relevant 
authorities.  
</p>
<p> Meanwhile, in view of the preparation of the report due by the end of November 
2011, we would be grateful if you could provide us with responses to the questionnaire 
enclosed herewith by 11 November 2011.

<p><b>  Letter dated 17 November 2011 from the Syrian Arab Republic to the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent commission of inquiry  
</b></p>
<p>The Syrian Government would like to point out that the above-mentioned questionnaire is 
being considered by the Independent Special Legal Commission, which was established on 
31 March 2011, and whose mandate has been expanded on 11 May 2011 to carry out 
immediate investigations into all cases involving the death of citizens, including civilians, 
military or security personnel since the beginning of the events in Syria.  The mandate of 
the commission covers all events and crimes in all Governorates of Syria.  In this regard, 
the commission has established sub-commissions operating under its supervision in order to 
carry out investigations in all the Governorates of Syria.  The commission is still in the 
process of carrying out its mandate.   Therefore, it will not be possible to provide Mr. Paulo 
Pinheiro with the required detailed answers before the commission has concluded and 
presented the full outcome of its investigations. 
</p>
<p>At this moment, it is possible to inform the commission [of inquiry] of the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Political and other forms of pressure have been  on-going to try and coerce Syria to 
reverse its stance towards  policies of occupation and  efforts by America and other 
countries to dominate the region and make it part of the sphere of influence of 
American policies.  These pressures have increased significantly since the beginning 
of March 2011.  At both the regional and international levels, the European Union 
has imposed economic and political sanctions to increase pressure on the 
Government and on the people of Syria in order to accelerate their submission to 
Western policies.  European Union States together with the United States have 
sought resolutions condemning the Government of Syria at the UN Security Council 
and in other international forums. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Questions regarding incidents, time and place of military operations cannot depict 
the  picture of what has been really happening in Syria, in terms of terrorist 
operations carried out by armed outlaws who are terrorizing our citizens and forcing 
them to abandon their homes and properties, and eventually resulting in their 
displacement to areas of certain sectarian demography, or resulting in their death and 
the mutilation of their bodies, in order to divide the country along sectarian lines and 
incite  civil war. The [Syrian security] forces dealing with those terrorists are tasked 
with maintaining public order. They chase wanted terrorists in order to arrest them 
and bring them to justice, in accordance with the law, and to confiscate their  
weapons, which include automatic rifles, small arms,  launchers, bombs, landmines,  
the majority of which is smuggled in from abroad.  Every time the authorities 
attempted to engage those armed individuals, requesting that they hand over their 
guns in return for amnesty, foreign entities stepped in and encouraged them not to 
turn in their arms so that they continue killing civilians.  The latest of such initiatives 
was that expressed by the Spokesperson of the US State Department.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; As already explained above, those involved in security operations, are the [State] 
Public Order and Anti-Terrorism forces.  Regarding the so-called <i>Shabbiha</i>, this is 
an expression which has been used abroad and never  in Syria, unless it is meant to 
refer to all Syrian citizens working towards putting an end to the bloodshed and to 
the crisis, which would account for more than 80% of the population of Syria. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Every death whether it is caused by Public Order forces, civilians or armed terrorist 
outlaws, is recorded in official registries at the Civilian Affairs Directorates in every 
Syrian Governorate, which are supervised by official bureaus of the Government.
