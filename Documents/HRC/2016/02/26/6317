</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council,  
</i></p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the relevant international human rights instruments, in particular the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, proclaimed 
by the General Assembly in its resolution 2106 (XX) of 20 December 1965,  
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> the importance of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted 
by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, in 2001, and emphasizing that this outcome 
constitutes a solid foundation for the elimination of all scourges and manifestations of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> all the previous resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly, the 
Human Rights Council and the Commission on Human Rights on the elimination of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  
</p>
<p><i> Expressing concern</i> at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in many parts 
of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large, as a result 
of resurgent activities of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms 
and charters, and the persistent use of those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist 
ideologies,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the need for maintaining continued political will and momentum at the national, 
regional and international levels, in order to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, taking into account the commitments enshrined in the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, and recalling the importance of enhancing national action 
and international cooperation to this end,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>the urgency, more than ever, to combat and end impunity for acts of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and to enable all relevant human rights 
mechanisms to pay attention to this issue so as to prevent the recurrence of such acts,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations Human 
Rights Council and 5/2 on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the 
Human Rights Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge 
his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and the annexes thereto,   
</p>
<p> 1.  <i>Welcomes</i> the work, recommendations and contributions of the Special Rapporteur

manifestations;   
</p>
<p> 2.  <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of

 <p></p>

ethnic groups of their recognized human rights, as a result of racial discrimination, constitutes 
gross and systematic violations of human rights;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>)  The scourges of anti-Semitism, Christianophobia, Islamophobia and racial and 
violent movements based on racism and discriminatory ideas directed at all religious 
communities, and contempt for religions and religious symbols;

discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and underpinning the inherent inequalities 
faced by racial groups in various societies;

Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination stipulates that the prohibition of the 
dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with the freedom 
of opinion and expression;  
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>)  The sharp increase in the number of political parties and movements which adopt
