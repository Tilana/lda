<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on minority issues submits the present report in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 26/4, in which the Council invited her to prepare a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive study of the human rights situation of Roma worldwide, with a particular 
</p>
<p>focus on the phenomenon of anti-Gypsyism. Adopting a consultative approach, she liaised 
</p>
<p>with numerous international and regional organizations, Roma rights experts and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations (NGOs). The Special Rapporteur thanks all those who shared 
</p>
<p>information with her, including the Member States and national human rights institutions 
</p>
<p>that responded to her questionnaire (see annexes), the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights Regional Office for Europe, and the United Nations 
</p>
<p>network on racial discrimination and protection of minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of the situation of Roma worldwide 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Roma populations around the world 
</b></p>
<p>2. The term &#8220;Roma&#8221; refers to heterogeneous groups, the members of which live in 
</p>
<p>various countries under different social, economic, cultural and other conditions. The term 
</p>
<p>Roma thus does not denote a specific group but rather refers to the multifaceted Roma 
</p>
<p>universe, which is comprised of groups and subgroups that overlap but are united by 
</p>
<p>common historical roots, linguistic communalities and a shared experience of discrimination 
</p>
<p>in relation to majority groups. &#8220;Roma&#8221; is therefore a multidimensional term that 
</p>
<p>corresponds to the multiple and fluid nature of Roma identity. 
</p>
<p>3. According to the principles of international law, including article 27 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Declaration on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities (the 
</p>
<p>Declaration), and general comment No. 23 (1994) of the Human Rights Committee, 
</p>
<p>minority identity does not depend on recognition by a State, but rather on individual self-
</p>
<p>identification. The Special Rapporteur, therefore, uses the term Roma to include all groups 
</p>
<p>that self-identify as such, and also includes those who self-identify as Sinti, Kale, Travellers 
</p>
<p>or Gypsies.  
</p>
<p>4. Although theories as to why the ancestors of today&#8217;s Roma emigrated from India a 
</p>
<p>millennium ago are beyond the scope of the present report, it is important to note that Roma 
</p>
<p>have dispersed worldwide. There are, however, no official or reliable statistics on the global 
</p>
<p>Roma population.  
</p>
<p>5. The largest and most visible Roma minority is European Roma, whose presence in 
</p>
<p>Europe dates back to the fourteenth century. Today, there are approximately 11 million 
</p>
<p>European Roma, with 6 million estimated to be residing within the 27 European Union 
</p>
<p>member States.  
</p>
<p>6. European Roma, as the largest ethnic minority in the region, is the most visible 
</p>
<p>Roma population worldwide; the severe discrimination and marginalization its members 
</p>
<p>continue to experience has been widely reported.1 However, little comprehensive research 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See, inter alia, http://fra.europa.eu/en/theme/roma; www.coe.int/en/web/portal/roma; 
</p>
<p>http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/roma/index_en.htm; www.osce.org/odihr/roma; and 
</p>
<p>www.romadecade.org. See also NGO reports, inter alia, Amnesty International, &#8220;Europe: Human 
</p>
<p>rights here, Roma rights now: A wake-up call to the European Union&#8221;, 4 April 2013, available from 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>has been carried out on the situation of Roma outside Europe. The Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>minority issues has therefore taken the opportunity to report on the severe socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>marginalization that Roma experience worldwide. 
</p>
<p>7. In Turkey, data indicates that the Roma population ranges from 500,000 to 5 
</p>
<p>million.2
 
In Ukraine, 47,600 persons identified themselves as Roma, according to 2001 
</p>
<p>census data, yet the Council of Europe estimates there are between 120,000 and 400,000 
</p>
<p>Ukrainian Roma. In Belarus, the 2009 census indicated a population of 7,316 Roma, but the 
</p>
<p>Government recognizes that that number does not necessarily reflect the true figure, which 
</p>
<p>ranges between 50,000 and 60,000.3 The 2010 census in the Russian Federation estimated 
</p>
<p>that there was a population of 205,007 Russian Roma, although Council of Europe data 
</p>
<p>suggest a larger population of between 450,000 and 1.2 million.  
</p>
<p>8. Roma groups in Latin America have been arriving from Europe since the beginning 
</p>
<p>of European colonization there, as well as during ongoing migration processes. Despite the 
</p>
<p>lack of official census data, a 1991 study by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Organization estimated the Roma population in the region to be approximately 
</p>
<p>1,500,000. Recent government data indicates a population of over half a million Roma in 
</p>
<p>Brazil.4  
</p>
<p>9. It is generally accepted that approximately 1 million Roma live in North America<b> 
</b></p>
<p>today; however that data is incomplete, as the census in the United States of America does 
</p>
<p>not include Roma as a category. Furthermore, although the Canadian census includes 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Other European Origins&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Roma (Gypsy)&#8221;, there is a discrepancy between official 
</p>
<p>census data, which in 2011 indicated a Roma population of 5,255, and unofficial estimates 
</p>
<p>which indicate a Roma population of upwards of 110,000. 
</p>
<p>10. Roma groups are also present in Central Asian countries, where they are known 
</p>
<p>collectively as <i>Lyuli</i>. While those groups are distinct from American and European Roma, 
</p>
<p>they share the experience of exclusion and marginalization from local majority 
</p>
<p>populations.5 Due to a lack of up-to-date data, there are no precise figures on the number of 
</p>
<p>Roma in Central Asia.6  
</p>
<p>11. The Dom is an ethnic minority in the Middle East that shares similarities with 
</p>
<p>Roma; its presence in the region dates back to the eleventh century. There is scant official 
</p>
<p>information on the number of Roma in that region. Unofficial estimates indicate there may 
</p>
<p>be significant populations in Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, 
</p>
<p>Lebanon, the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the Syrian Arab Republic.7

<p><b> B. Anti-Gypsyism and discrimination against Roma: a global phenomenon 
</b></p>
<p>12. While the Special Rapporteur is aware that the reasons for the marginalization of 
</p>
<p>Roma are complex, she insists that an overarching factor is the deeply embedded social and 
</p>
<p>structural discrimination Roma face worldwide, including anti-Gypsyism. Anti-Gypsyism 
</p>
<p>has been defined by the Council of Europe as &#8220;a specific form of racism, an ideology 
</p>
<p>founded on racial superiority, a form of dehumanisation and institutional racism nurtured by 
</p>
<p>historical discrimination, which is expressed, among others, by violence, hate speech, 
</p>
<p>exploitation, stigmatisation and the most blatant kind of discrimination&#8221;.8 Anti-Gypsyism 
</p>
<p>therefore includes strong anti-Roma prejudices and stereotypes, including those that lead to 
</p>
<p>labelling Roma communities as criminal, aggressive, or as &#8220;parasites&#8221; on welfare systems. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur welcomes recent European Union recognition that anti-Gypsyism 
</p>
<p>constitutes a major obstacle to overcoming Roma disadvantage and marginalization. 
</p>
<p>13. Although anti-Gypsyism is originally a European term, the discrimination it 
</p>
<p>embodies manifests itself in a variety of ways across regions. In Latin America, 
</p>
<p>discrimination against Roma was imported with European migration, and negative 
</p>
<p>stereotypes remain present today, with reports that many Roma do not speak Romani in 
</p>
<p>public for fear of discrimination or reprisal. In their concluding observations, the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination have 
</p>
<p>noted their concerns about the widespread occurrence of offences of discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Roma in Brazil, including racist crimes, and the lack of application of relevant domestic 
</p>
<p>legal provisions in cases involving Romani victims (CCPR/C/BRA/CO/2, para. 20; 
</p>
<p>CERD/C/64/CO/2, para. 17). 
</p>
<p>14. The Dom of the Middle East are among the most marginalized people in the Arab 
</p>
<p>world and suffer from widespread negative perceptions and stigma. The Dom are often 
</p>
<p>labelled as <i>nawar</i>, an Arabic insult that evokes selfishness, stinginess, dirtiness and chaos.9  
</p>
<p>15. In its concluding observations on the fifth periodic report of the Russian Federation, 
</p>
<p>the Committee against Torture noted its concern about persistent reports of discrimination, 
</p>
<p>violent attacks and abuses against Roma on the basis of their identity (CAT/C/RUS/CO/5, 
</p>
<p>para. 15). United Nations human rights monitoring mechanisms have repeatedly noted the 
</p>
<p>marginalization of Roma in Belarus.10 In its concluding observations, the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination has noted that Roma suffer from widespread social 
</p>
<p>stigma and discrimination Tajikistan and Uzbekistan (CERD/C/TJK/CO/6-8, para. 13; 
</p>
<p>CERD/C/UZB/CO/8-9, para. 11). 
</p>
<p>16. Many Roma in North America also face stigma and prejudice that originated in and 
</p>
<p>are perpetuated by limited knowledge of Romani culture or history, or of the persecution 
</p>
<p>Roma faced during and after the Nazi regime.11

<p><b> III. Essential elements of a minority rights-based approach 
to protection of Roma worldwide  
</b></p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the present report as an opportunity for her to 
</p>
<p>address the situation of Roma globally through a minority rights lens, using the four pillars 
</p>
<p>of minority rights: (a) the protection of a minority&#8217;s existence, including combating 
</p>
<p>violence against them and preventing genocide; (b) the protection and promotion of the 
</p>
<p>identity of minority groups and their right to enjoy their collective identity and to reject 
</p>
<p>forced assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-discrimination and equality, 
</p>
<p>including the ending of structural or systemic discrimination and the promotion of 
</p>
<p>affirmative action when required; and (d) the right to effective participation in public life 
</p>
<p>and decisions that affect them.  
</p>
<p>18. The present report should be seen as complementary to the work undertaken by 
</p>
<p>many other United Nations mechanisms. That includes the previous work carried out under 
</p>
<p>the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on minority issues, in the form of thematic reports, 
</p>
<p>country reports, communications and press releases.12 It also includes the work of other 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holders, including the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
</p>
<p>forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, who has 
</p>
<p>reported on the causes and consequences of racism against Roma (see, for example, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/17/40, paras. 5&#8211;25, and A/HRC/26/50) and regularly addresses challenges facing 
</p>
<p>Roma in country reports (see, for example, A/HRC/23/56/Add.2, A/HRC/20/33/Add.1, and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.2), the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation, who made important recommendations regarding Roma in her report on stigma 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/21/42) and in relevant country reports (see, for example, A/HRC/18/33/Add.2) and 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
</p>
<p>standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context (see, for example 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/16/42/Add.2, paras. 51&#8211;56, and A/HRC/25/54/Add.2, paras. 69&#8211;71 and 74&#8211;75), 
</p>
<p>among others. She also notes the role the United Nations treaty bodies have played in 
</p>
<p>highlighting discrimination against Roma, particularly the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination in its general comment No. 27 (2000) on discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Roma. Roma have also featured prominently in the universal periodic review of States 
</p>
<p>before the Human Rights Council. The Special Rapporteur refers to her recently published 
</p>
<p>review of minority issues in the first cycle of the universal periodic review, which 
</p>
<p>highlighted that over 25 per cent of all minority rights recommendations in the review 
</p>
<p>referred to the situation of Roma.13 Despite that important work, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>nevertheless believes that the full capacity of the United Nation is not yet being used by 
</p>
<p>Roma rights advocates. The United Nations should be seen as a core Roma rights partner 
</p>
<p>whose work can complement other mechanisms. She hopes that the present report will 
</p>
<p>contribute to such an approach. 
</p>

</p>
<p>minority issues in post-2015 development agendas (A/HRC/25/56). See also the reports of the Special 
</p>

<p><b> A. Pillar 1: protection of existence and prevention of violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>minorities 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that globally there is little awareness that 
</p>
<p>Roma were targeted by the Nazi regime and were subjected to arbitrary internment, forced 
</p>
<p>labour and mass murder. Together with the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the 
</p>
<p>Prevention of Genocide, she has called for stronger measures to keep the memory of the 
</p>
<p>Roma Holocaust &#8212; referred to as <i>Porrajmos</i> or <i>Pharrajimos</i> in the Romani language &#8212; 
</p>
<p>alive, and to enable survivors and others to mark it in a recognized, dignified manner.14
 
The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur also notes that violence against Roma is not only an historical 
</p>
<p>circumstance but remains a current reality for many Roma communities. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>Governments must remain vigilant and take appropriate measures against signs of hatred 
</p>
<p>and stigmatization. 
</p>
<p>20. In 2014, Amnesty International reported that harassment and intimidation of Roma 
</p>
<p>individuals and communities in Europe continued to be widespread.15 One of the most 
</p>
<p>tragic manifestations of hatred against Roma was the serial murder of six randomly selected 
</p>
<p>Roma people, including a five-year-old boy, in Hungary in 2008 and 2009. Roma are 
</p>
<p>reportedly at higher risk of being subjected to violence in other regions too. In Iraq, the 
</p>
<p>Dom are allegedly targeted, their villages reduced to rubble and the residents slaughtered 
</p>
<p>by militants opposed to their religious and cultural traditions. Roma women in Iraq are also 
</p>
<p>reported to be severely exposed to sexual violence and a heightened risk of exploitation.16  
</p>
<p>21. Roma are also vulnerable to violence by State actors, which can be both explicit and 
</p>
<p>implicit. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about police harassment, intimidation and 
</p>
<p>abuse. Empirical studies indicate that Roma are overrepresented in the criminal justice 
</p>
<p>systems across Europe, with research indicating that they are often detained arbitrarily on 
</p>
<p>account of their Roma identity.17 The lack of a visible Roma presence in police forces and 
</p>
<p>judiciaries compounds that problem. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur also remains concerned by the failure of public authorities 
</p>
<p>to protect Roma from violent attacks. That includes the lack of systematic intervention and 
</p>
<p>condemnation by public figures when political and public discourse perpetuates racist and 
</p>
<p>extreme views about Roma, and the failure of law enforcement authorities to protect Roma 
</p>
<p>from the perpetrators of crimes against them.18 For example, a violent police crackdown on 
</p>
<p>a Roma community in Slovakia in 2013 was condemned by a number of special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders,19 the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,20 and the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s Ombudswoman. Nevertheless, the Minister of the Interior of Slovakia publically 
</p>
<p>labelled the Roma victims of that intervention as criminals, and investigation into the police 
</p>
<p>misconduct has been slow, with no charges brought against the police to date.21 Such 
</p>
<p>failures by authorities to protect Roma adequately and to distance themselves from all

<p> 21 Response from the national human rights institution of Slovakia to the questionnaire. </p>


<p>manifestations of anti-Gypsyism not only promote a climate of distrust, dissuading Roma 
</p>
<p>from reporting violent crimes against them to authorities, but also create an atmosphere of 
</p>
<p>impunity and may encourage further acts of violence against Roma. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Pillar 2: protection and promotion of Roma identity 
</b></p>
<p>23. The protection and promotion of Roma identity means that States have the 
</p>
<p>obligation not only to protect Roma from forced assimilation,22 but must adopt positive 
</p>
<p>measures that promote the distinctive characteristics of Roma culture, including language, 
</p>
<p>history and tradition. That should be achieved through financial and technical assistance to 
</p>
<p>preserve the Romani language, art, poetry, dance, music and traditions, including their 
</p>
<p>promotion through the media. Roma history and the cultural contribution of Roma must 
</p>
<p>also be recognized and taught in school curricula. In that regard, Roma must be given 
</p>
<p>opportunities for self-interpretation and self-representation.  
</p>
<p>24. Nevertheless, across the regions, negative stereotypes of Roma persist, describing 
</p>
<p>them as criminal, unworthy, unclean or aggressive. The Special Rapporteur has explained 
</p>
<p>how hate speech, including negative stereotyping of Roma, is widespread in the media, 
</p>
<p>including social media, and in public political discourse, and how Roma rarely have access 
</p>
<p>to media or other means necessary to challenge those perceptions.23 Hate speech is not only 
</p>
<p>a denigration of Roma identity, but impacts negatively on Roma community members&#8217; 
</p>
<p>sense of inclusion in the national psyche. The Special Rapporteur therefore understands a 
</p>
<p>key aspect of pillar 2 to include addressing hate speech through systematic intervention and 
</p>
<p>condemnation.  
</p>
<p>25. In the context of her global study, she also wishes to draw attention to incidents of 
</p>
<p>negative stereotyping of Roma outside Europe. For example, in Argentina, a now 
</p>
<p>discontinued television series, <i>Soy Gitano</i>, focused on so-called &#8220;Gypsy crime&#8221;. Although 
</p>
<p>the Roma community in Argentina denounced the soap opera to the National Institute to 
</p>
<p>Combat Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism, the complaint was dismissed on the 
</p>
<p>grounds that the series was fictional. A similar complaint was filed before the Canadian 
</p>
<p>Broadcast Standards Council following a show which contained strong discriminatory 
</p>
<p>statements towards Roma refugees in Canada. As a result of the complaint, the network 
</p>
<p>removed the video from their web page and issued an apology. The misrepresentation of 
</p>
<p>Roma in the media in Turkey was exemplified by a popular television series, <i>Cennet 
</i></p>
<p><i>Mahallesi</i>, which presented highly stereotypical depictions of Roma. In the United States of 
</p>
<p>America, a reality television programme entitled <i>My Big Fat American Gypsy Wedding</i>, a 
</p>
<p>spin-off of a show of the same name in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland, continues to be broadcast today. Both versions have been criticized for their 
</p>
<p>stereotypical approach and for misrepresenting Roma culture. 
</p>
<p>26. Beyond misrepresentation in the media, there are also State-sanctioned 
</p>
<p>communications vilifying Roma. In August 2011, a Russian newspaper published an 
</p>
<p>article called &#8220;Be careful!&#8221;, signed by an employee of the Ministry of the Interior, advising 
</p>
<p>readers to be extremely vigilant when dealing with Roma, not to enter into contact with 
</p>
<p>them in order to avoid psychological pressure on their part and never to invite them home. 
</p>
<p>The article also recommended that readers should immediately contact the police if they 
</p>
<p>spotted a suspicious Gypsy.24 In 2013, the Governor&#8217;s Office in Bursa, Turkey, issued an 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>official report on the situation of Roma in the city, using denigrating language and likening 
</p>
<p>Roma to criminals.25  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about discriminatory stereotypes and hate 
</p>
<p>speech against Roma women, including depictions of them as particularly fertile or 
</p>
<p>promiscuous, which expose them to different forms of gender-based violence, including 
</p>
<p>forced sterilization.26 To avoid exposing Roma women to abuse, sterilization procedures 
</p>
<p>must be based on clear legal provisions which ensure full, free and informed consent. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Pillar 3: equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>28. The substandard living conditions of Roma in Europe are well-documented.27 
</p>
<p>Between 70 and 90 per cent of Roma report living in conditions of severe material 
</p>
<p>deprivation. Exclusion from formal schooling remains widespread throughout Europe. Even 
</p>
<p>in those countries where a majority of Roma children complete primary school, most do not 
</p>
<p>obtain either a vocational certificate or a secondary qualification.28 In South-Eastern 
</p>
<p>Europe, the participation of Roma in education beyond primary school is dramatically 
</p>
<p>lower than that of the majority population, with only 18 per cent of Roma attending 
</p>
<p>secondary school compared to 75 per cent of the majority community, and less than 1 per 
</p>
<p>cent of Roma enrolled in university.29 Regarding health, European Roma are 
</p>
<p>disproportionately unvaccinated, have poorer than average nutrition and experience higher 
</p>
<p>rates of infant mortality and tuberculosis. Life expectancy among European Roma 
</p>
<p>communities is reportedly significantly lower than among non-Roma communities.30 
</p>
<p>Similar marginalization exists with regard to employment. In 12 surveyed European Union 
</p>
<p>countries, fewer than one out of three Roma were reported to be in paid employment.31 The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur welcomes the commitment of the European Commission to start 
</p>
<p>infringement proceedings in cases in which European Union member States are not meeting 
</p>
<p>their commitments under the Racial Equality Directive, and emphasizes that the 
</p>
<p>Commission should more actively pursue that in order to secure better outcomes for 
</p>
<p>European Union Roma. 
</p>
<p>29. Outside Europe, research indicates that Roma face similar challenges. Living 
</p>
<p>conditions in the Roma villages in central and southern Iraq are reportedly among the most 
</p>
<p>deplorable in the country. Many Roma live in windowless mud houses without electricity, 
</p>
<p>clean water, health care or adequate food, and are cut off from social security services. In 
</p>
<p>Brazil, many Roma settlements reportedly have no electricity and lack access to safe 
</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation, despite the fact that some families have been living there for 
</p>
<p>over 20 years. 
</p>
<p>30. Access to education continues to be a major obstacle for all Roma. The Government 
</p>
<p>of Argentina has recognized the high levels of illiteracy and school dropout of Roma 
</p>
<p>children.32 In Brazil, official data on literacy and/or school attendance of Roma children are

<p> 32 Responses from Argentina and the national human rights institution of Argentina to the questionnaire.  </p>


<p>lacking, but civil society organizations reported that very few Roma children living in 
</p>
<p>camps have ever been to school, and estimate that 90 per cent of the Roma living in camps 
</p>
<p>in Curitiba city are illiterate. Prejudice has also been identified as an obstacle for accessing 
</p>
<p>public schools in Brazil, where Roma children are reportedly not given the chance to enrol 
</p>
<p>on the pretext of a lack of space. A representative of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
</p>
<p>(UNICEF) has emphasized that teachers&#8217; biased attitudes towards <i>Lyuli</i> children in Central 
</p>
<p>Asia may result in violence at school. The illiteracy rate among Iraqi Roma is very high and 
</p>
<p>many Roma children there are forced to take on irregular jobs or resort to begging. In 
</p>
<p>Lebanon, 68 per cent of school-aged children reportedly do not attend school because of 
</p>
<p>significant obstacles such as discrimination, legal and economic barriers, leading to street 
</p>
<p>labour becoming a significant trend among Dom children.33 
</p>
<p>31. Roma face significant discrimination at all stages of access to labour markets, and 
</p>
<p>the rate of unemployment among Roma is often high. When they do have access to labour 
</p>
<p>markets, they are often offered short-term or low-skilled employment and are subject to 
</p>
<p>prejudice. In Azerbaijan, for 90 per cent of Roma families living in the Nasiminskiy and 
</p>
<p>Suraxani districts of Baku and from the Yevlakh region, begging is their main livelihood. In 
</p>
<p>Belarus, only 9 per cent of Roma are employed.34 Central Asian Roma are reported to 
</p>
<p>survive in conditions of poverty and deprivation, forced into begging and a semi-nomadic 
</p>
<p>lifestyle. In 2004, the unemployment rate among the more than 3,500 Mugat Roma living in 
</p>
<p>the Osh region of Kyrgyzstan was 90 per cent.35 In Lebanon, Dom communities often work 
</p>
<p>in the informal sector or are engaged in unskilled labour, and monthly family income levels 
</p>
<p>among the Dom are extremely low.36 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur regrets the lack of comprehensive health indicators and the 
</p>
<p>scarce evidence, including information on reproductive, maternal and child health, for 
</p>
<p>assessing the health situation of Roma outside Europe. Poverty, lack of identification 
</p>
<p>documents and lack of transportation from remote areas to health-care facilities all impact 
</p>
<p>on Roma health, which can be compounded by poor living conditions, such as living in 
</p>
<p>proximity to garbage dumps or polluted rivers. Factors precluding Roma access to health 
</p>
<p>care across the regions include Roma patients being refused medical treatment, having no 
</p>
<p>access to emergency services, being subject to verbal abuse, or being segregated in hospital 
</p>
<p>facilities.37 Furthermore, lack of access to health care may result from indirect 
</p>
<p>discriminatory practices when Roma have to provide identity or residency documents in 
</p>
<p>order to register and qualify for health-care benefits.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur also draws attention to particular groups of Roma who may 
</p>
<p>be victims of multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination. While many Roma migrate 
</p>
<p>for the full range of reasons that all persons chose to migrate, including to seek new 
</p>
<p>opportunities, the poverty Roma experience in their countries of origin, as well as racism, 
</p>
<p>discrimination and marginalization, are often important push factors. Moreover, once in a 
</p>
<p>destination country, Roma migrants often experience discrimination on multiple grounds, 
</p>
<p>including as Roma and as migrant non-citizens. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>expresses concern about the targeted expulsions of Roma migrants, sometimes undertaken 
</p>
<p>without their free, full and informed consent, including to countries where they are likely to 
</p>
<p>face discrimination. In 2010, about 8,000 Roma were reportedly expelled from France, and

<p>cases of the expulsion of Roma from Denmark, Germany, Italy and Sweden were also 
</p>
<p>reported at that time.38  
</p>
<p>34. Roma women and girls may also be vulnerable to multiple, intersecting forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and to violence, including gender-based violence and trafficking. Roma 
</p>
<p>women are also allegedly stereotyped as promiscuous, which exposes them to a heightened 
</p>
<p>risk of exploitation and sexual and gender-based violence.  
</p>
<p>35. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) of Roma origin experience specific challenges in 
</p>
<p>accessing basic rights, including housing, land and property, water and sanitation, health 
</p>
<p>services, employment, education and participation in public and political life. During the 
</p>
<p>ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Roma IDPs have been increasingly marginalized and have 
</p>
<p>limited access to even the most basic services.39 The Special Rapporteur on the human 
</p>
<p>rights of internally displaced persons reported in 2014 that Roma in the Balkans were 
</p>
<p>among the region&#8217;s most vulnerable IDPs.40 
</p>
<p>36. Statelessness also disproportionately affects Roma, who despite being born in or 
</p>
<p>having long-standing ties to a country, speaking the local language and having no other 
</p>
<p>country of citizenship, often have no access to nationality.41 Lack of documentation also 
</p>
<p>hampers not only Roma political participation, but also access to services, thereby 
</p>
<p>reinforcing the vicious circle of poverty and marginalization. An NGO report to the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on Ukraine indicated that up to 40 per 
</p>
<p>cent of Roma in the Odessa region lack at least one of the documents necessary to access a 
</p>
<p>range of services.42 In the Russian Federation, lack of personal documentation prevents 
</p>
<p>Roma from accessing employment, social allowances and health care, and from voting or 
</p>
<p>accessing education in some schools due to discriminatory practices of school authorities.43 
</p>
<p>In 2004, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed concern 
</p>
<p>about allegations concerning discrimination faced by Roma with regard to birth registration 
</p>
<p>and access to schools for their children in Brazil.44 
</p>
<p><b> D. Pillar 4: the right to effective participation  
</b></p>
<p>37. The effective and meaningful participation of Roma in the political arena is a pivotal 
</p>
<p>element in breaking the vicious cycle of stigma, discrimination and marginalization. The 
</p>
<p>right to effective participation is affirmed in article 25 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights,45 and reiterated in the Declaration (arts. 2, 4 (5) and 5 (1)). The 
</p>
<p>commentary to the Declaration further establishes that the right to participate in all aspects 
</p>
<p>of the life of the larger national society is essential, both in order for persons belonging to 
</p>
<p>minorities to promote their interests and values and to create an integrated but pluralist 
</p>
<p>society based on tolerance and dialogue (E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.5/2005/2, para. 35). 
</p>
<p>38. Despite those clearly defined international standards, Roma remain underrepresented 
</p>
<p>or not represented in the public administrations, institutions and political parties of many 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 38 See A/HRC/17/40 para. 20.

<p>States within Europe.46 The Special Rapporteur has found that no comparable studies or 
</p>
<p>research have been conducted in other regions, nor did she receive relevant information 
</p>
<p>from non-European States. Without information to the contrary, and given their 
</p>
<p>marginalized status, she can only infer that Roma outside Europe experience comparable, if 
</p>
<p>not heightened, political exclusion. 
</p>
<p>39. Roma may be intentionally or de facto restricted from participation. Barriers include 
</p>
<p>the lack of political will to dismantle structural discrimination, including the persistence of 
</p>
<p>negative stereotypes assuming that Roma have no interest and no skills for engaging in 
</p>
<p>politics.  
</p>
<p>40. Exclusion from public and political life must therefore be seen as both a cause and a 
</p>
<p>consequence of the lack of enjoyment of economic and social rights, including lack of 
</p>
<p>education opportunities, poverty, substandard living conditions and language barriers. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur also underlines how the widespread fragility of Roma individuals&#8217; legal 
</p>
<p>status impedes political participation. For example, in the Middle East, some Dom 
</p>
<p>individuals are reportedly unable to pay hospital fees when their children are born, so no 
</p>
<p>birth certificate is issued and the possibility of securing citizenship is denied.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Positive developments 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur notes that, due to the scant or total lack of information 
</p>
<p>received from countries outside Europe, it was difficult for her to provide a balanced 
</p>
<p>assessment of initiatives regarding Roma programmes across the regions. Nevertheless, she 
</p>
<p>attempts to highlight some key examples using the pillar framework. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Pillar 1: preventing and addressing violence against Roma 
</b></p>
<p>42. Although not all European States officially recognize 2 August as the International 
</p>
<p>Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is pleased that the European Parliament has recently adopted a resolution on 
</p>
<p>recognition of the memorial day of the Roma genocide during the Second World War and 
</p>
<p>that that many States are moving in that direction.47 In order to better recognize the victims 
</p>
<p>of the Roma genocide and to improve understanding of the situation of the Roma in 
</p>
<p>Sweden, in 2014 the Government published a white paper highlighting abuses and rights 
</p>
<p>violations of Roma throughout the twentieth century and showing the negative stereotyping 
</p>
<p>and discrimination they continue to face. 
</p>
<p>43. In 2014, ternYpe, the International Roma Youth Network, and its partners organized 
</p>
<p>a conference and youth event gathering 1,000 people from 25 countries to raise awareness 
</p>
<p>among young Europeans, civil society and decision makers about the Roma Holocaust, as 
</p>
<p>well as about anti-Gypsyism in the context of racism, hate speech and extremism in Europe.  
</p>
<p>44. The European Commission programme, Strategies for Effective Police Stop and 
</p>
<p>Search project was designed to improve police-minority relations through more accountable 
</p>
<p>use of policing power. It has been implemented with police and Roma in Bulgaria, Hungary 
</p>
<p>and Spain and has proven effective in improving police relations with Roma, producing 
</p>
<p>more efficient policing activities and increased legitimacy and trust.  
</p>

</p>
<p>day for the victims of World War II in Member States of the Council of Europe&#8221; (2013). </p>


<p>45. In Canada, in order to reduce discriminatory policing behaviours, in 2011&#8211;2012, 
</p>
<p>training on Roma culture was delivered, as part of the Hate Can Kill project, to Ontario 
</p>
<p>police, including information about the Roma Holocaust, the racially motivated violence 
</p>
<p>experienced by Roma and the lack of trust in police authorities among Roma communities. 
</p>
<p>In parallel, Roma families and young people were also educated on what constitutes a hate 
</p>
<p>crime, on relevant legal instruments and on the importance of reporting hate crimes to the 
</p>
<p>police. Following that training, in 2012 both the Toronto Police Force and the Hamilton 
</p>
<p>Police Force recorded hate crimes reported by people of Roma identity.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Pillar 2: protection and promotion of minority identity by combating 
</b></p>
<p><b>stereotypes and prejudice  
</b></p>
<p>46. In Hungary, the documentary film series &#8220;Mundi Romani &#8211; The World through 
</p>
<p>Roma Eyes&#8221; is a co-production of the Romedia Foundation. Each episode presents a 
</p>
<p>different aspect of Roma culture in locations in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the 
</p>
<p>Americas. The series provides insights into Roma culture and was nominated for and 
</p>
<p>received a number of local and international prizes.  
</p>
<p>47. Tallinn University in Estonia is conducting a study on stereotypes of various 
</p>
<p>nationalities in Estonian online media with the objective of mapping and analysing 
</p>
<p>stereotypes of individual nationalities. Additionally, the exhibition &#8220;We, the Roma&#8221;, which 
</p>
<p>reviews Estonian Roma history, culture and everyday life, opened in October 2013 and has 
</p>

</p>
<p>48. The Council of Europe has launched an awareness-raising campaign entitled 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dosta!&#8221;, which emphasizes the value of Roma for societies through an interactive website, 
</p>
<p>on television, in school projects and training for the media and teachers. It also awards a 
</p>
<p>prize to local authorities that have taken steps to uphold and protect the rights of Roma. The 
</p>
<p>Government of Latvia informed the Special Rapporteur that, in order to implement the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dosta!&#8221; campaign, its Ministry of Culture, together with the Latvian Centre for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, would organize an event entitled &#8220;Latvian Roma &#8211; between past and future&#8221; in 
</p>
<p>April 2015 in Riga, aimed at eliminating negative stereotypes about Roma and promoting 
</p>
<p>intercultural dialogue.49 
</p>
<p>49. Since 1991, the Museum of Romani Culture in Brno, the Czech Republic, has been 
</p>
<p>dedicated to the history and culture of Roma. The aim is to educate the younger generation, 
</p>
<p>to promote better appreciation and understanding of the roots of Roma identity and to fight 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and racism. 
</p>
<p>50. The University of Texas is home to the first university Romani Studies programme, 
</p>
<p>and has become the leading institution in the United States of America for studies on 
</p>
<p>Romani history, language and culture. The programme provides scholarships to Roma for 
</p>
<p>educational qualifications at any level and houses the Romani Archives and Documentation 
</p>
<p>Center, the largest collection of Romani materials in the world. 
</p>
<p>51. In Brazil, 24 May was declared National Roma Day by Presidential Decree in 2006 
</p>
<p>and has been acknowledged by Roma communities as an important public recognition of 
</p>
<p>the existence of the Brazilian Roma community.

<p><b> C. Pillar 3: equality, non-discrimination and recognition of anti-Gypsyism  
</b></p>
<p>52. Although just a few decades ago Roma issues were almost absent from international 
</p>
<p>discussions, the issue of discrimination against Roma, including anti-Gypsyism, has gained 
</p>
<p>increasing visibility. The European Union has developed a Framework for National Roma 
</p>
<p>Integration Strategies<b>, </b>and now holds an annual meeting of the<b> </b>European Platform for 
</p>
<p>Roma. Its 2013 recommendation on effective Roma integration measures broke new 
</p>
<p>ground, as the first European Union instrument targeted at combating discrimination and 
</p>
<p>prejudice against Roma, including multiple forms of discrimination. In addition, there is an 
</p>
<p>explicit commitment by the European Union to assist Turkey and the Western Balkans in 
</p>
<p>developing and implementing long-term, sustainable programmes to address the situation of 
</p>
<p>Roma, which is also an aspect of accession negotiations. Within the Council of Europe, a 
</p>
<p>Special Representative for Roma Issues has been appointed. 
</p>
<p>53. In Spain, the ACCEDER programme has adopted a multidimensional approach to 
</p>
<p>tackling discrimination against Roma by directly training Roma to increase their 
</p>
<p>employability and by involving other actors essential to eliminating barriers for Roma to 
</p>
<p>access the labour market, including the private sector, policymakers and society at large.  
</p>
<p>54. The National Institute to Combat Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (<i>Instituto 
</i></p>
<p><i>Nacional contra la Discriminaci&#243;n, la Xenofobia y el Racismo</i> &#8211; INADI) of the 
</p>
<p>Government of Argentina coordinates the &#8220;Discrimination Map&#8221; project in collaboration 
</p>
<p>with several universities. In 2013, the situation of the Roma was specifically addressed and 
</p>
<p>Roma were found to be among the most discriminated groups in Argentina. One priority of 
</p>
<p>INADI is establishing a dialogue with the Roma community in order to better understand 
</p>
<p>their needs and challenges.50 INADI also sponsored a book on Roma history, legends and 
</p>
<p>traditions and the documentary film &#8220;Roma &#8211; Gelem, Gelem&#8221; in 2015 with the goal of 
</p>
<p>introducing a shift at the cultural level to combat racism against Roma. 
</p>
<p>55. In order to address the underreporting by Roma of incidents of discrimination, the 
</p>
<p>Portuguese equality body has developed an informal complaints procedure whereby 
</p>
<p>complaints can be submitted on a website or sent by e-mail to any of the equality body 
</p>
<p>council members or through Roma organizations. That method has proved an effective way 
</p>
<p>of overcoming mistrust and has seen an increase in reports of discrimination filed by Roma.  
</p>
<p>56. The Finnish Ombudsman conducted a research study to identify the key issues 
</p>
<p>facing Roma communities in Finland. The survey was a response to the identified lack of 
</p>
<p>data on discrimination experienced by Roma. Better data is expected to enable national 
</p>
<p>authorities to intervene more effectively in cases of discrimination experienced by Roma, to 
</p>
<p>help them formulate concrete proposals for action to reduce the discrimination Roma face 
</p>
<p>in various aspects of life, and to improve the position of Roma within society.51 
</p>
<p>57. In Colombia, Decree 2957 of 2010 was adopted to set up a legal framework for the 
</p>
<p>protection of the rights of Roma in Colombia, recognizing collective rights for Roma 
</p>
<p>people. The same year, the National Commission for Dialogue for Roma People (<i>Comisi&#243;n 
</i></p>
<p><i>Nacional de Di&#225;logo para el Pueblo Rom</i>) was created to coordinate action between 
</p>
<p>governments and local communities.

<p><b> D. Pillar 4: the right to effective participation 
</b></p>
<p>58. The European Union has recognized that participation of Roma individuals and 
</p>
<p>communities cannot be reduced to occasional discussions, but must promote the 
</p>
<p>empowerment and active involvement of Roma, including through supporting Roma NGOs 
</p>
<p>to be effective.52 The 2015 European Platform for Roma Inclusion provided an opportunity 
</p>
<p>for participatory, interactive, operational-level discussions among all stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>including Roma individuals and grassroots organizations. 
</p>
<p>59. Portugal has established the Project for Municipal Roma Mediators, providing 
</p>
<p>intercultural training to 15 Roma mediators which led to their inclusion in 18 local 
</p>
<p>municipalities. The objective was to provide Roma inclusion-related services, guaranteeing 
</p>
<p>the establishment of close links between local services, organizations and local Roma 
</p>
<p>communities.53 
</p>
<p>60. In Brazil in 2015, the Commission on Minorities and Human Rights of the Congress 
</p>
<p>held a public hearing to discuss policies aimed at protecting the rights of the Roma ethnic 
</p>
<p>minority in Brazil. In addition, the Secretariat for the Promotion of Social Equality recently 
</p>
<p>organized a National Week on Roma. The initiative, which gathered over 300 Roma from 
</p>
<p>different regions, members of civil society organizations and government representatives, 
</p>
<p>facilitated discussions about challenges in relation to Roma access to health care, housing, 
</p>
<p>education, social and culture programmes. The programme adopted a set of 
</p>
<p>recommendations and launched a guide on public policies aimed at raising awareness of 
</p>
<p>Roma rights in Brazil.  
</p>
<p>61. The Government of Colombia consulted with Roma communities in the context of 
</p>
<p>drafting national development plans for the period 2014 to 2018 and committed to 
</p>
<p>implementing strategies to increase Roma visibility, improve their quality of life and 
</p>
<p>provide for improved access to their social, economic and cultural and political rights. In 
</p>
<p>Argentina, a local Roma NGO has been successful in initiating dialogues between civil 
</p>
<p>society and the State, which has proved to be key in promoting the visibility of Roma 
</p>
<p>culture.54  
</p>
<p>62. In Bulgaria, under the &#8220;Thank you, Mayor!&#8221; campaign, a grass-roots organization 
</p>
<p>invested in capacity-building initiatives for local Roma advocacy groups. The campaign 
</p>
<p>mobilized local activists and stakeholders, empowering them to develop and implement, in 
</p>
<p>partnership with local administrations, successful Roma inclusion strategies in 12 
</p>
<p>municipalities. The project demonstrates how inclusive dialogue between Roma 
</p>
<p>communities and local municipalities and a bottom-up approach can produce concrete 
</p>
<p>commitments from local administrations. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Challenges in the field of policy and programming on Roma 
rights: lessons learned 
</b></p>
<p>63. Despite a number of good initiatives that seek to address Roma disadvantage, Roma 
</p>
<p>communities worldwide still face situations of extreme poverty and marginalization across 
</p>
<p>a wide range of human rights indicators. In Europe, Roma still experience heightened levels 
</p>
<p>of disadvantage and marginalization.55 Outside Europe, the Special Rapporteur regrets that

</p>
<p> 53 Response from Portugal to the questionnaire. 
</p>
<p> 54 Response from Argentina to the questionnaire. 
</p>
<p> 55 A 2014 European Union report found that &#8220;there has not been much effective progress in any of the 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>very little has been done to acknowledge the disadvantage experienced by Roma and few 
</p>
<p>policies have been developed to address those concerns.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur thus believes it is necessary to reflect on the lessons learned, 
</p>
<p>both globally and in particular from the European experience, to understand better why 
</p>
<p>existing approaches have not managed to bring about structural change. Although she 
</p>
<p>recognizes that every Roma community is unique, and there is no blanket approach that will 
</p>
<p>accommodate every community, she believes that drawing some general lessons from real 
</p>
<p>examples may be helpful for all regions looking forward. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Lack of accurate data 
</b></p>
<p>65. Worldwide, comprehensive data on the situation of Roma communities has never 
</p>
<p>been collected. Even in Europe, where more robust efforts are made than elsewhere, 
</p>
<p>research indicates that Roma populations remain undercounted. For example, discrepancies 
</p>
<p>between official statistics and unofficial estimates of Roma populations across 12 countries 
</p>
<p>in Europe range from 45 to 99 per cent.56  
</p>
<p>66. Outside Europe, there are major gaps with regard to identifying and understanding 
</p>
<p>Roma identity. Many States still continue to deny the existence of Roma as a minority 
</p>
<p>group within their populations, or consider them outsiders, migrants or foreigners.57 When 
</p>
<p>statistics do exist at the national level, they are often based on censuses, but many Roma do 
</p>
<p>not disclose their identity in census surveys due to a lack of inclusion of the category of 
</p>
<p>Roma as an identity within the census, a reluctance to identify as Roma for fear of being 
</p>
<p>discriminated against, or a lack of options for indicating multiple identities.  
</p>
<p>67. Those discrepancies call into question how well States have developed procedures 
</p>
<p>that allow the expression of Roma ethnicity in a way that best reflects personal identities 
</p>
<p>and embraces the principle of self-identification. The Special Rapporteur therefore notes 
</p>
<p>that it is essential that all States make an effort to provide meaningful and respectful ways 
</p>
<p>to encourage Roma communities to self-identify in order to generate more accurate data on 
</p>
<p>Roma communities worldwide. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur further notes that the lack of accurate data on Roma 
</p>
<p>populations has important consequences and directly impacts the ability to develop policies 
</p>
<p>and programmes that comprehensively address the issues faced by Roma groups. 
</p>
<p>Disaggregated data allows inequalities to be revealed objectively and demonstrated 
</p>
<p>statistically, and provides clear markers by which progress towards targets can be 
</p>
<p>monitored and evaluated. The lack of accurate data in turn contributes to a lack of 
</p>
<p>evidence-based programmes building on clear indicators. Indeed, a recent European Union 
</p>
<p>report acknowledged the impact of the lack of disaggregated data for Roma programming.58  
</p>
<p><b> B. Lack of political will, including a reluctance to address anti-Gypsyism 
</b></p>
<p>69. Despite international standards prohibiting discrimination, stakeholders across the 
</p>
<p>regions pointed to the absence of political will as a key factor explaining the insufficient 
</p>
<p>implementation of those standards in the Roma context. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>challenges identified&#8221;. See http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/files/com_209_2014_en.pdf. 
</p>

<p>70. In the fight against anti-Gypsyism and discrimination, political will must be actively 
</p>
<p>encouraged. While much has already been achieved at the international and regional levels, 
</p>
<p>there is a gap at the national and local levels, which remain crucial for achieving 
</p>
<p>meaningful change for communities. Unfortunately, action taken to address Roma 
</p>
<p>disadvantage often still depends heavily on the personal commitment of the particular 
</p>
<p>political leader in power. Such an approach does not institutionalize anti-discrimination as a 
</p>
<p>political goal, but rather reduces it to a subjective choice dependent on the goodwill of 
</p>
<p>individual political actors. Moreover, as Roma are a disenfranchised minority group, they 
</p>
<p>will often have little political influence or negotiating power at the local level. If leaders 
</p>
<p>commit to combating discrimination against Roma as a national priority, that will be one 
</p>
<p>important way to provide local politicians with a political constituency to focus on Roma 
</p>
<p>rights.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Lack of a multisectoral, human rights-centred approach in policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>development 
</b></p>
<p>71. The marginalization experienced by Roma is often interconnected with disadvantage 
</p>
<p>in the area of economic and social rights, often stemming from, or leading to, further 
</p>
<p>impediments in civil and political rights and vice versa. However, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>has observed a tendency of Roma programmes to focus on short-term, issue-specific 
</p>
<p>projects that fail to adopt an integrated approach that addresses multisectoral disadvantage. 
</p>
<p>Many measures and instruments focus exclusively on one policy area and are delivered 
</p>
<p>through uncoordinated projects with insufficient connection to other, interconnected 
</p>
<p>policies and funds. For example, housing programmes that tackle issues of adequacy, 
</p>
<p>including ghettoization and segregation, that are not linked to employment opportunities 
</p>
<p>will have little prospect for long-term sustainability. Comprehensive solutions should take 
</p>
<p>account of intersecting discrimination that Roma face and ensure that programmes are 
</p>
<p>developed in genuine consultation with affected communities. 
</p>
<p>72. There is also an unfortunate tendency to compartmentalize the so-called &#8220;Roma 
</p>
<p>issue&#8221; into the category of poverty alleviation, and to view Roma issues through the 
</p>
<p>exclusive lens of economic and social rights. This can lead States to focus solely on 
</p>
<p>programmes that address questions of housing, health care, employment and education. 
</p>
<p>While such projects are critical to overcoming key areas of Roma disadvantage, this narrow 
</p>
<p>approach fails to incorporate an interconnected understanding of human rights and may also 
</p>
<p>further entrench the perception of Roma as impoverished beneficiaries of social support 
</p>
<p>rather than active rights holders. It also excludes other segments of Roma communities, 
</p>
<p>including middle-class Roma who may want to focus on their rights to political and public 
</p>
<p>participation or to culture. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur further observes that many policies and programmes fail to 
</p>
<p>adequately incorporate combating racism and anti-Gypsyism in their programming goals. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur reiterates that there are too many policies based exclusively on 
</p>
<p>improving Roma access to material or social benefits, including educational and/or 
</p>
<p>vocational training. Such policies, she warns, treat symptoms only and do not address the 
</p>
<p>root causes of disadvantage, which lie within deep-seated discriminatory attitudes that have 
</p>
<p>become entrenched over generations. She therefore emphasizes the need to better 
</p>
<p>incorporate anti-discrimination as an overarching element in all strategies and programmes 
</p>
<p>affecting Roma, including through outreach to non-Roma groups on non-discrimination and 
</p>
<p>equal treatment.  </p>


<p><b> D. Insufficient Roma participation  
</b></p>
<p>74. Most stakeholders consulted agree that the crucial issue of the political participation 
</p>
<p>of Roma has been neglected by most policymakers and institutions across the regions. 
</p>
<p>Despite numerous new programmes and the unprecedented achievements of Roma 
</p>
<p>intellectuals, professionals and activists around the world, Roma remain largely 
</p>
<p>underrepresented or unrepresented in local and national bodies, and remain peripheral in 
</p>
<p>regional and international decision-making bodies, including in institutions explicitly 
</p>
<p>established to protect and promote their rights. 
</p>
<p>75. Another concern expressed is the insufficient engagement of Roma communities in 
</p>
<p>the design, delivery and monitoring of programmes and policies affecting them. Even in 
</p>
<p>Europe, where efforts have been made to include Roma better, a recent evaluation showed 
</p>
<p>that Roma participation is often reduced to consultations, and meaningful and effective 
</p>
<p>participation remains a &#8220;distant objective&#8221;.59 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur observes that there are often underlying attitudes that 
</p>
<p>contribute to the lack of focus on empowerment of Roma communities and organizations. 
</p>
<p>They can be outright discriminatory attitudes, such as when decision-making authorities 
</p>
<p>adopt the paternalistic attitude that they are better equipped to make decisions on behalf of 
</p>
<p>Roma. However, there are also more subtle forms of bias, including the tendency to focus 
</p>
<p>on Roma as passive victims of discrimination, which may have the effect of perpetuating 
</p>
<p>erroneous assumptions about their inability to contribute to society. This in turn hampers 
</p>
<p>the shift from a perception of Roma as primarily passive victims of discrimination to an 
</p>
<p>acknowledgment of their role as active agents of transformation who can participate in 
</p>
<p>policy decisions that affect them. The Special Rapporteur notes that effective, meaningful 
</p>
<p>participation must be a transformative process that becomes an inclusive experience, 
</p>
<p>facilitating Roma involvement, empowerment and active citizenship. Such a participatory 
</p>
<p>approach must also guarantee that those whose voices are rarely heard are empowered, 
</p>
<p>including Roma women and young people. 
</p>
<p>77. Roma organizations at the local level are often institutionally weak and often have 
</p>
<p>few human and technical resources. As a result, they may lack the capacity to advocate 
</p>
<p>effectively on issues that are important to them or they may not be able to liaise effectively 
</p>
<p>and cooperate with other Roma organizations. These factors affect organizations&#8217; ability to 
</p>
<p>find consistent, meaningful opportunities for engaging in policy design, implementation 
</p>
<p>and monitoring. Efforts must be made to strengthen Roma rights organizations, not only 
</p>
<p>through better funding and support, but also through scholarships and education initiatives 
</p>
<p>to ensure that Roma young people are equipped with the necessary skills to become active 
</p>
<p>advocates for their own communities.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Need for improved access to complaint mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>78. In order to better address the discrimination Roma face, including anti-Gypsyism, 
</p>
<p>there is a need for complaint mechanisms of which Roma are aware, to which they have 
</p>
<p>access and in which they have confidence.  
</p>
<p>79. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that article 13 of the Racial Equality 
</p>
<p>Directive requires European Union member States to establish a body responsible for the 
</p>
<p>promotion of equal treatment, she regrets that research indicates that knowledge about and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 59 See www.romadecade.org/cms/upload/file/9765_file1_decade-intelligence-report.pdf, p. 6. </p>


<p>use of those mechanisms by Roma is limited.60 Even at the international level, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur receives few communications from Roma regarding their rights, and although 
</p>
<p>there have been a number of high-profile Roma rights cases at the European Court of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights,61 there have been relatively few such cases when considered in relation to 
</p>
<p>the significant disadvantages Roma in Europe face. Outside Europe, she has not received 
</p>
<p>any information about Roma accessing complaints mechanisms to address their concerns. 
</p>
<p>80. In this vein, she insists that States must improve knowledge among Roma about 
</p>
<p>their rights, including about discrimination, and their awareness of complaint mechanisms at 
</p>
<p>both the national and international levels. States should also develop measures that enable 
</p>
<p>Roma complainants to have easy access to such mechanisms. It is equally important that the 
</p>
<p>recommendations of any such mechanisms be swiftly implemented in order to promote a 
</p>
<p>sense of justice and faith in the processes concerned. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Limited recognition of history and lack of measures to address 
</b></p>
<p><b>long-standing prejudices and racism 
</b></p>
<p>81. The dispossession of and discrimination against Roma over centuries has led to a 
</p>
<p>situation of intergenerational disadvantage that has often engrained hopelessness in Roma 
</p>
<p>individuals and communities. Across the regions, however, the Special Rapporteur observes 
</p>
<p>that insufficient effort has been made to foster long-term durable intercultural dialogue or to 
</p>
<p>develop initiatives that build trust and foster relationships of mutual respect.  
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur believes that much can be achieved through recognition of 
</p>
<p>the cultural contributions of Roma. Positive initiatives in this regard include the promotion 
</p>
<p>and celebration of Romani culture through national history statements, inclusion in school 
</p>
<p>curricula, national days of celebration and the creation of museums and exhibitions. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, historical narratives are central to the identity of Roma communities, and a 
</p>
<p>better understanding by the majority society of the richness of Roma culture is an essential 
</p>
<p>demand of Roma communities in every region. Nevertheless, the history and contributions 
</p>
<p>of Roma culture are rarely adequately acknowledged or properly promoted. Rather, what 
</p>
<p>remain pervasive are biased, distorted stereotypes of Roma that contribute to a sense of 
</p>
<p>alienation and exclusion, especially among young people. 
</p>
<p>83. The lack of recognition of the fate of the Roma under the Nazi regime is often 
</p>
<p>referred to as the &#8220;forgotten Holocaust&#8221; and has been identified as a major obstacle to 
</p>
<p>restoring dignity and respect for the human rights of Roma worldwide. Although 2 August 
</p>
<p>is officially Roma Holocaust Remembrance Day, there is a need to continue to bring 
</p>
<p>heightened public attention to ensuring that the Roma Holocaust becomes part of public 
</p>
<p>consciousness.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Insufficient funding, and bureaucratic obstacles  
</b></p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur notes the importance of direct, efficient funding 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for Roma organizations. However, even within the European Union, where 
</p>
<p>significant funds are dedicated to addressing Roma disadvantage, challenges remain. 
</p>
<p>Firstly, within the European Union, not all of the available funds for Roma are being spent 
</p>
<p>or efficiently invested and the level of expenditure on this issue, especially by new member 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 60 See http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/854-EU-
</p>
<p>MIDIS_RIGHTS_AWARENESS_EN.PDF, pp. 9&#8211;10. 
</p>
<p> 61 See www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Roma_ENG.pdf. </p>


<p>States, is very small.62 This results in many cases in funds being directed towards short-
</p>
<p>term projects that are incapable of achieving any long-term, sustainable impact, therefore 
</p>
<p>reducing their positive impact on Roma communities. 
</p>
<p>85. Secondly, within the European Union, no monitoring mechanisms are in place to 
</p>
<p>evaluate how much money is invested in projects that directly or indirectly benefit Roma 
</p>
<p>people. The Special Rapporteur warns that without such accountability, there is the risk of 
</p>
<p>contributing to the perception that in the European Union, too many economic resources are 
</p>
<p>invested in Roma with few results, which in turn contributes to negative stereotypes about 
</p>
<p>Roma. 
</p>
<p>86. Concerns have been raised about technical and substantial challenges facing Roma 
</p>
<p>organizations in accessing European Union funding, including overly burdensome 
</p>
<p>bureaucratic requirements, constantly changing rules and formalities and liquidity and cash 
</p>
<p>flow issues. In addition, the level of expertise and the financial resources needed to 
</p>
<p>implement European Union programmes are often too onerous for smaller grass-roots 
</p>
<p>organizations. As a result, large funding sources are often absorbed by large non-Roma 
</p>
<p>recipients and just a small percentage reaches Roma communities. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur regrets that there is a lack of official information on funding 
</p>
<p>dedicated to measures to improve the situation of Roma communities outside Europe, 
</p>
<p>indicating that they are unlikely to exist. The Special Rapporteur therefore calls on all 
</p>
<p>Governments to dedicate sufficient funding to improving the situation of Roma. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur takes note of efforts to fight anti-Roma discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>and address Roma marginalization and disadvantage. However, while positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>developments and good practices have been identified, her global study has revealed 
</b></p>
<p><b>the deep-rooted problems of racism and extreme marginalization experienced by 
</b></p>
<p><b>Roma worldwide, and has highlighted the ongoing invisibility of many of these 
</b></p>
<p>communities&#8217; struggles.<b> Her report has also exposed the underlying structural 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination that Roma face, including the interrelation between anti-Gypsyism and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the socioeconomic marginalization and political exclusion that Roma experience.</b> 
</p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the numerous recommendations of other 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights mechanisms targeting Roma, urges all States to take immediate steps 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards implementing them, and adds the following recommendations.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Steps to combat discrimination, anti-Gypsyism and exposure to violence 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>States should implement fully the Declaration and other relevant regional and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards, including comprehensive anti-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation that prohibits all forms of discrimination, and identify State agencies 
</b></p>
<p><b>tasked with monitoring and combating discrimination. </b> 
</p>
<p>91. <b>States should pay particular attention to the ways in which memory and 
</b></p>
<p><b>mourning processes related to the Roma Holocaust are framed, collected and 
</b></p>
<p><b>disseminated, including through the media and formal and informal education 
</b></p>
<p><b>systems. In this regard, she recalls the importance of including Roma in all such 
</b></p>
<p><b>endeavours, including at all official ceremonies commemorating victims of the Second 
</b></p>
<p><b>World War.</b> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 62 See http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-10-121_es.htm. </p>


<p>92. <b>States must ensure that authorities effectively and promptly investigate any 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes against Roma individuals and communities, including by investigating any 
</b></p>
<p><b>alleged discriminatory motive behind the attacks. Police officers should refrain from 
</b></p>
<p><b>using force during police operations, including in informal settlements, and all 
</b></p>
<p><b>allegations of harassment or unlawful use of force by police should be thoroughly 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigated. </b> 
</p>
<p>93. <b>States should take measures to monitor hate speech and incitement to violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against Roma, including in the media and social media, and respond appropriately, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by prosecuting perpetrators. States should collect data on hate crimes 
</b></p>
<p><b>against Roma. Such data should include the reporting, investigation, prosecution and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sentencing of the crimes. The data should be made publicly accessible, while 
</b></p>
<p><b>respecting the right to privacy, in order to assist the development of policies to combat 
</b></p>
<p><b>hate crimes against Roma.</b> 
</p>
<p>94. <b>Political parties should prohibit inflammatory, racist, anti-Roma rhetoric and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that public discourse does not perpetrate stereotypical, racist, hateful or 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory views about Roma. They should take effective action against such 
</b></p>
<p><b>discourse. </b> 
</p>
<p>95. <b>The protection and promotion of the rights of Roma should be prioritized on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the political agenda in order to demonstrate a serious political commitment to 
</b></p>
<p><b>combating the causes and consequences of anti-Gypsyism and discrimination. </b> 
</p>
<p>96. <b>In order to address the root causes of anti-Gypsyism, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that the history, culture and traditions of Roma, in particular the Nazi 
</b></p>
<p><b>genocide, be taught in schools. Awareness-raising measures to inform non-Roma 
</b></p>
<p><b>populations about Roma history, identity and culture should be integrated into all 
</b></p>
<p><b>education efforts. </b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Guaranteeing the full enjoyment of the human rights of Roma: beyond the poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>States must ensure that measures addressing the socioeconomic vulnerability of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Roma are addressed not only through programmes addressing poverty and 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalization, but are part of a wider approach that tackles the widespread 
</b></p>
<p><b>prejudice, discrimination and racist attitudes against Roma, including anti-Gypsyism.</b> 
</p>
<p>98. <b>The Special Rapporteur thus urges all relevant stakeholders to think outside 
</b></p>
<p>the &#8220;poverty paradigm&#8221; and incorporate all aspects of minority rights into strategies 
</p>
<p><b>that address Roma disadvantage, including the protection and promotion of Roma 
</b></p>
<p><b>identity, language and culture and the guarantee of dignity and equality. Such 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes should guarantee that the specific needs of Roma women, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>Roma with disabilities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, young 
</b></p>
<p><b>people and older persons are heard and addressed. </b> 
</p>
<p>99. <b>There is a need for integrated approaches that combine measures in different 
</b></p>
<p><b>policy areas, strengthen political will at the national and local levels in particular and 
</b></p>
<p><b>build mutual trust and an openness to learn from past mistakes. Inclusion 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes should not be limited to material improvements; they should also 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute to the empowerment of both urban and rural Roma communities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen dedicated institutional attention to Roma rights and encourage Roma 
</b></p>
<p><b>leadership in order to break the vicious cycle of discrimination and marginalization. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Such programmes should ensure that Roma groups most at risk of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>and/or social and economic exclusion are also targeted and empowered. </b> </p>


<p>100. <b>Governments must ensure that sufficient funding is dedicated to improving the 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of Roma communities. Funds allocated at regional and national level, as well 
</b></p>
<p><b>as other financial instruments, should be expended efficiently and directed to the local 
</b></p>
<p><b>level.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Effective Roma participation and representation at all levels of decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Creating conditions for the effective participation of Roma in all aspects of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>life of the State, including in decision-making bodies, should be considered by States 
</b></p>
<p><b>as an integral aspect of good governance and a key priority in efforts to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>equality and non-discrimination. </b> 
</p>
<p>102. <b>Governments should ensure that Roma are represented at all levels of public 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions and bodies, including national parliaments, the civil service, the police and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the judiciary. Where Roma leaders are visible, their work should be promoted and 
</b></p>
<p><b>they should be supported to act as role models and raise awareness of Roma political 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation.</b> 
</p>
<p>103. <b>National human rights institutions should put in place specific mechanisms to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address Roma issues and recruit and retain Roma staff. They are encouraged to 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop outreach programmes that increase Roma participation in political, 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic, social and cultural life. They should ensure that Roma are both involved in 
</b></p>
<p><b>and have access to their programmes, including complaint mechanisms, and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that materials are available in the Romani language.</b> 
</p>
<p>104. <b>Governments, the United Nations and its specialized agencies, and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>international and regional organizations should mainstream Roma rights into all 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspects of their programming and make efforts to include Roma within their staff.</b> 
</p>
<p>105. <b>Roma and pro-Roma civil society organizations play a crucial role in breaking 
</b></p>
<p><b>down the barriers preventing the effective participation of Roma in all spheres of life. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Stakeholders are encouraged to collaborate and support those organizations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including through providing adequate financial support. </b> 
</p>
<p>106. <b>Successful Roma-controlled programmes that address issues of health, 
</b></p>
<p><b>education and other areas of concern in ways that are culturally appropriate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>adapted to local needs should be supported and replicated.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Role of the media 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Traditional and new media have the potential to promote intercultural dialogue 
</b></p>
<p><b>between Roma and non-Roma communities. The media should promote non-
</b></p>
<p><b>stereotypical portrayals of Roma, including through providing greater visibility to 
</b></p>
<p><b>Roma self-representation, history and culture. </b> 
</p>
<p>108. <b>The participation of Roma media professionals should be encouraged and 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes to train, recruit and support Roma media workers should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>implemented. The media must guarantee that they do not contribute to or allow hate 
</b></p>
<p><b>speech and incitement to hatred or violence. </b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Data collection 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Data collection should be based on self-identification and take place in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>sensitive manner, respecting privacy in accordance with international standards of 
</b></p>
<p><b>data protection. Roma civil society, individuals and communities should be involved 
</b></p>
<p><b>throughout the process, from designing data collection methods to collection and 
</b></p>
<p><b>analysis of the data. </b> </p>
