Overview
Norsemont  is  a  Canadian  public  company  engaged  in  the  acquisition,  exploration  and  development  of  natural  resource
properties.  Effective  April  5,  2007,  the  Company’s  common  shares  commenced  trading  on  the  Toronto  Stock  Exchange
(“TSX”)  under  the  trading  symbol  “NOM”.  Before  April  5,  2007,  the  Company  was  a  “Venture  Issuer”,  as  defined  in
National Instrument 51-102 and traded on the TSX Venture Exchange. Effective August 28, 2007, the Company’s common
shares were listed and commenced trading on the Bolsa de Valores de Lima (Lima Stock Exchange) under the same symbol
“NOM”.
The  Company  controls  the  advanced  Constancia  Project  in  Peru  and  the  recently  discovered  Pampacancha  prospect  held
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Norsemont Peru S.A.C., located in Lima. As of the date of this MD&A, the Company
has mineral interests in Peru as follows: 
 
Constancia Project, Peru 
 
Norsemont holds a one-hundred percent (100%) interest in the Constancia Project (“Constancia”).
On February 9, 2005, the Company signed an agreement with Rio Tinto Mining and Exploration Ltd. (“Rio Tinto”) whereby
the Company obtained the right to acquire up to a 70% interest in Constancia.

Management Discussion & Analysis 
For the year ended June 30, 2009 
 
An initial option, within the agreement, allowed the Company to earn an undivided 51% interest in the Constancia project by
making payments of US$5 million, completing work expenditures of US$7.8 million and issuing 1,250,000 common shares
of the Company (or cash in lieu of shares) over a period of nearly five years, ending October 31, 2009.
During  the  fiscal  year  2008,  the  Company  had  fulfilled  all  requirements  pursuant  to  this  initial  option.  The  Company
exercised the initial option in November 2007 and earned a 51% interest in Constancia.
Under  the  same  agreement,  a  subsequent  and  final  option  allowed  Norsemont  to  earn  an  additional  19%  interest  in
Constancia by paying Rio Tinto US$8 million. In March, 2008 the Company paid Rio Tinto US$8 million and exercised the
final  option  of  the  agreement  acquiring  Rio  Tinto’s  remaining  19%  interest  in  Constantia.  The  mineral  rights  are  held  by
Norsemont Peru.
Upon  commencement  of  commercial  production,  the  Company  is  required  to  also  make  a  final  one-time  payment  of
US$500,000 to Rio Tinto and  will pay a  net smelter return royalty (NSR) of 0.5% to a  maximum of  US$10  million to the
previous underlying owners.
In  November  2007,  Norsemont  entered  into  a  Mining  Concessions  Transfer  Agreement  and  Assignment  of  Contractual
Positions  with Mitsui  Mining and Smelting Company  Limited (“Mitsui”). Pursuant to the agreement, Mitsui transferred its
30% interest in the Constancia property to Norsemont  with no further obligation to Mitsui or the underlying owners of the
property, for a total consideration of US$9.8 million, payable over a twenty-month period with the final payment due on or
before  June  30,  2009.  Combined  with  the  Company’s  70%  interest  in  the  Constancia  project  obtained  from  Rio  Tinto,  the
purchase  provided  Norsemont  with  the  control  of  100%  of  the  Constancia  project.  This  purchase  has  been  capitalized  to
mineral properties on the balance sheet as at June 30, 2009 and 2008. The entire US$9.8 million has been paid to Mitsui as at
June 30, 2009 and no further obligations remain for this purchase.
Norsemont holds surface rights lease agreements with two Peruvian communities to gain access to the surface, of a portion of
the Constancia Property, for its mining exploration activities. The Company pays monthly lease costs of US$5,900.  The two
leases  have  twelve-month  terms  and  are  renewable  at  the  end  of  each  term  for  another  twelve  months.    One  of  two
agreements  has  been  finalized  for  the  coming  year  and  the  second  is  being  renegotiated  as  at  the  date  of  this  report.  In
addition  to  making  cash  rental  payments  to  the  communities,  the  Company  is  obligated,  under  the  existing  agreements,  to
provide educational assistance,  medical and veterinary  services as  well as an irrigation  system  in each of the communities.
These obligations approximate US$20,000 monthly.
The Company is currently completing a definitive feasibility study (“DFS”) on the Constancia Project and expects to release
the results of that study before the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2010 and file the full independent technical report in the
second fiscal quarter.
Two  independent  technical  reports  on  the  Constancia  Project,  summarized  below,  are  available  on  the  Sedar  website  at
www.sedar.com:
1)  A  pre-feasibility  Scoping  Study  dated  December  11,  2007  prepared  by  SRK  Consulting.  The  scoping  study
considers  an  open  pit  mining  operation  using  a  standard  milling  and  froth  flotation  plant  to  produce  high  grade
copper  and  molybdenite  concentrates.    For  economic  evaluation  purposes,  the  scoping  study  focused  on  three
operating scenarios: a 30,000 tonne per day (t/d) stand-alone case (SA), a 30,000 t/d expandable to 55,000 t/d case
(EX), and a 55,000 t/d stand-alone case (SA). Based on the current resource, the corresponding life of mine (LOM)
for the 30,000 t/d and 55,000 t/d stand alone cases are 20 and 12 years, respectively.

Management Discussion & Analysis 
For the year ended June 30, 2009
Estimated production for the 55,000 t/d SA case is approximately 112,218 tonnes per year of copper recovered over
the first five years, with a LOM annual average production of 90,411 tonnes. For the 30,000 t/d SA case estimated
production is 72,814 tonnes per year of copper recovered during the first five years, with a LOM annual average of
53,598 tonnes.  Based on a discount rate of 8 percent and a payback period which incorporates a two year start up,
the Constancia project’s ungeared Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and corresponding Net Present Value (NPV) for the
three operating scenarios are as follows:

The cash flow analysis used long-term price assumptions of $1.80 per lb Cu, $12 per lb Mo, and $11 per oz Ag. To
provide  an  appreciation  of  the  influence  of  metal  prices  to  the  project  cash  flow,  a  sensitivity  analysis  has  been
conducted modifying the copper price.  The results of the sensitivity analysis based on copper prices at $1.60 per lb,
$1.80 per lb and $2.00 per lb are as follows:

Notes: 1. Cash flow values are presented accounting for a 25% overall contingency and discount rate of 8%.
2. The cash flow values presented account for post tax and royalty payments.
Cash operating costs net of credits are estimated at $0.74 per lb over the 20-year project life for the 30,000 t/d SA
case  and  $0.67  per  lb  over  the  12-year  project  life  for  the  55,000  t/d  SA  case.  Capital  expenditure  estimates
(inclusive  of  a  25  percent  contingency)  for  the  three  operating  scenarios  are  US$605.6M,  US$617.3M  and
US$739.7M for the 30,000 t/d SA, 30,000 t/d EX to 55,000 t/d and 55,000 t/d SA, respectively.
Based on the positive results of the scoping study, the Company commissioned the DFS study mentioned above.
2)  Mineral  Resource  Update  and  Technical  Report,  dated  May  2008  prepared  by  GRD  Minproc  Limited  (GRD
Minproc).  The  report  estimates  an  Indicated  Resource  of  256.3  million  tonnes  grading  0.5  %  copper,  0.012  %
molybdenum and 4.4 g/t silver (0.62 % Cu-Equivalent) at a cutoff grade of 0.2% copper and an Inferred Resource of

Pampacancha, Peru 
  
The Company holds a one-hundred percent (100%) interest in Pampacancha.  
 
The Pampacancha prospect has been discovered approximately 2.7 kilometres south-east of the Constancia deposit and lies
within  an  area  over  which  the  Company  controls  100  percent  of  the  mineral  rights.  Norsemont  has  completed  a  ground
geophysical  survey  (magnetics  and  IP)  over  the  site  and  has  conducted  stream  and  rock-chip  sampling  over  a  27  square
kilometre area. Results from  the ground geophysical  survey indicate the presence of a number of  strongly  magnetic bodies
with coincident chargeability anomalies. Additionally, high-grade gold and silver mineralization associated with veins, shear
zones and limestone replacements occur in an area of about 6 square kilometres. The longest structure can be projected up to
one kilometre in length. Gold and silver returned values as high as 39 grams per tonne gold and 38 ounces per tonne silver.

For the year ended June 30, 2009 
 
Drill  results,  from  a  limited  drill  program  carried  out  in  mid  2008  at  Pampacancha,  have  defined  a  high  grade  skarn  and
porphyry exploration target with preliminary dimensions of approximately 1,000 by 400 metres.  Drill results are reported in
the table below. Holes PR-08-010 and PR-08-011 were drilled from the same platform approximately 420 metres from holes
PR-08-08 and PR-08-012. The results indicate that there are at least two zones of skarn mineralisation over this 1,000 metre
strike length. These zones will require follow-up drilling.

Note 1: Copper equivalent values (CuEQ) are estimated using long-term metal prices including: copper US$1.80 per lb, molybdenum 
US$12.00  per  lb,  and  silver  US$11  per  oz  and  gold  US$650  per  oz.  Adjustment  factors  to  account  for  differences  in  relative 
metallurgical  recoveries  for  copper,  molybdenum  and  silver  will  depend  upon  the  completion  of  definitive  metallurgical  testing. 
CuEQ  equals  Cu  percent  plus  Mo  percent  times  (8.00/1.20)  plus  Ag  grams  per  tonne  times  0.24/(1.20*22.05).  All  mineralized 
intercepts are at least 10 meters long and accept intervals of up to 5 meters internal dilution.
Chilloroya South, Peru 
 
The Chiloroya South area, with dimensions of 3.5km by 3.5km is located about 5.5 kilometres south of the Constancia-San 
Jose  deposit,  within  a  3  km  wide,  southwest-oriented  mineralized  corridor.  Mapping  and  surface  sampling  shows  strong 
evidence of porphyry-related copper-gold-molybdenum mineralisation occurs at the southern sector in an area of about 2.5 x 
2 km.  Of 152 rock samples taken from this area, 52% returned values from 0.1 up to 7.84 g/t Au, 85% were anomalous in 
copper, returning from 70 ppm up to a maximum of 1.33% Cu and 40% were anomalous in molybdenum, with values in the 
order of 10 up to 446 ppm Mo.  This area is coincident with a magnetic high and an 800 x 900 m chargeability anomaly, the 
latter  extending  westward  to  an  area  covered  by  post-mineral  quaternary  deposits.    One  kilometre  to  the  south,  there  is 
another site containing several SE-oriented quartz-tourmaline-limonite brecciated structures which occur in an area of 750 x 
340 m.    A  total  of  48  samples  were  collected  directly  from  the  quartz-tourmaline  breccias,  where  79%  were  anomalous  in 
gold, from 0.1 g/t Au up to 5.32 g/t Au; 65% anomalous in copper, from 71 ppm Cu up to 693 ppm Cu and 53% anomalous 
in molybdenum, from 8 ppm Mo to 75 ppm Mo.  This area is coincident with a large, 1000 x 900 m chargeability anomaly at 
depth, partially coincident with a magnetic high.  Extending below the post-mineral quaternary alluvium to the west of these 
areas two NS-oriented, 1200 x 800m chargeability anomalies occur.  
 
Several copper occurrences hosted by the Chilloroya sediments are associated with shear zones and vein-like structures occur 
also in the area.  At a distance of 500 m southwest of the felsic porphyry there is an open cut exposing green copper oxides

with randomly-oriented chalcopyrite veinlets;  mineralisation is not  well exposed on surface, but starts to be clearly defined 
just 0.50 m below surface.  Five samples taken from this area returned up to 1.49% Cu, 2.88 g/t Au and 521 ppm Mo.
The  evidence  of  mineralisation  reported  for  Chilloroya  South  strongly  suggests  the  presence  of  a  large  copper-gold-
molybdenum  system  at  depth.    Potential  exists  for  the  discovery  of  additional  mineralisation  of  this  style  and/or  porphyry
copper-gold-molybdenum mineralisation in other phases of the porphyry bodies
Results of Operations 
 
During  the  year ended June 30, 2009,  the Company reported a  net loss and comprehensive loss of $40  million  or  $0.72 per
share  and  compares  to  a  net  loss  and  comprehensive  loss  of  $37  million  or  $0.90  per  share  during  the  previous  year,
representing  an  increased  loss  of  $3  million.  The  most  significant  charge  to  the  statement  of  operations  for  the  current  and
comparable year was exploration costs, $26.2 million in the current year and $29.3 million in  the year ended June 30, 2008.
Other  significant  expenses  contributing  to  the  net  loss  include  a  $1.6  million  (2008  –  $1.8  million)  provision  charged  to
earnings for an impairment of the Company’s holding of long-term notes, a $2.3 million charge expense for the write-down of
long  term  receivables,  a  $5  million  charge  (2008  -  $1.8 million)  to  earnings  for  stock-based  compensation  and  $0.6  million
(2008 - $1.1 million) foreign exchange loss on the conversion of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
Mineral  property  exploration  expenditures  in  the  current  fiscal  year  of  $26.2  million  represent  the  costs  associated  with
completing  the  definitive  feasibility  study  at  the  Constancia  project.  Significant  drilling,  assaying  engineering  and
environmental  assessment  charges  were  incurred  throughout  the  year  in  support  of  the  DFS.  The  comparable  costs  of  $29.3
million  for  the  12  months  ended  June  20,  2008    include  US$11.6  million  of  option  payments  made  to  Rio  Tinto  and  $1.3
million of shares (500,000 shares) issued to Rio Tinto to fully execute the right to acquire 70% of Constancia. Of the $17.7
million of non-option payments in 2008, drilling, assaying and geological costs, associated with revising the resource estimate
at Constancia accounted for the majority of charges.
The results of the DFS are expected to be released by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2010. As such, it is anticipated that
exploration  costs  will  diminish  in  the  next  fiscal  year.  The  Company’s  has  two  priority  targets  for  further  evaluation,
Pampacanch and Chillaroya South that  will entail a drilling program. Significant costs  may be incurred to fully evaluate the
two prospects.
To the end of June 2009, more than 450 holes have been drilled in and around the Constancia Project. All but 24 of the holes
have been drilled by Norsemont, as Rio Tinto drilled these holes in 2003 and 2004. The 450 holes represent exploratory, infill
and condemnation diamond drilling. Approximately half of the holes have been drilled in fiscal 2009 and 2008.
In  the  2008  fiscal  year,  Norsemont  completed  a  detailed  ground  magnetic  survey  over  a  large  area  of  the  Company’s
concessions surrounding Constancia  which  was  followed up  with an  IP/Resistivity survey over the  same area. The  magnetic
survey highlighted several  magnetic anomalies located  south-east and  west of  the Constancia zone. During the current fiscal
year,  one  anomaly,  named  Pampacancha,  was  further  explored  by  means  of  rock  chip  and  stream  sediment  sampling  and  a
limited  drill  program.  Drilling  results,  tabled  above,  from  Pampacancha  were  released  in  the  second  fiscal  quarter  end.  A
number  of  narrow  copper-gold  and  gold  only  intercepts  encountered  in  drilling  program  highlight  the  potential  for  the
discovery of additional mineralisation in other anomalies. Nominal costs were incurred in the current fiscal year related to the
evaluation  of  Pampacancha  and  have  been  included  in  the  statement  of  operations  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2009,  within
exploration expenses.

Management Discussion & Analysis 
For the year ended June 30, 2009
As  noted  above,  the  Company  entered  into  a  Mining  Concessions  Transfer  Agreement  and  Assignment  of  Contractual
Positions with Mitsui in which Mitsui transferred all of its 30% interest in the Constancia property to Norsemont for a total
consideration of US$9.8 million. The Canadian dollar equivalent of US$9.8 million is recorded in mineral properties on the
balance sheet as at June 30, 2009 and 2008. The purchase has been paid in full with a fifth and final payment of US$4 million
made on June 30, 2009. No further payments, commitments or royalties are due to Mitsui.
Salary  and  wages  in  the  current  year  of  $1.7  million  (2008  -  $1.7  million)  has  remained  stable  as  management  and  staffing
levels has not differed from the comparable period. Future costs related to compensation will depend on decisions related to
the development of the Constancia Project in the 2010 fiscal year. Current plans do not envisage significant changes to current
staffing levels.
The  Company  maintains  corporate  offices  in  Toronto,  Canada  and  Lima,  Peru  and  office  and  related  administrative  related
expenses of $0.9 million have increased marginally, in the current year ended June 30, 2009 versus the comparable year ended
June 30, 2008, when $0.8 million was charged to the statement of operations.  The Canadian head office was re-located from
Vancouver,  B.C.  in  January  2008  to  Toronto.  Costs  associated  with  the  relocation  were  marginal  and  monthly  expenses,
related  to  office  infrastructure,  in  Canada,  have  reduced.  Due  to  expanded  needs  related  to  the  completion  of  the  DFS,  the
Peruvian  office  premises  also  relocated,  within  Lima,  at  the  end  of  the  2008  fiscal  year  and  related  monthly  costs  have
increased versus the 2008 comparable year. It is anticipated that office and administrative costs will remain stable in the next
fiscal year.
Professional fees have increased to $0.8 million in the current year ended June 30, 2009 from $0.5 million in the comparable
year  ended  June  30, 2008.  Management  and  the  Board  of Directors  have  relied  on  third  party  advisors  for  certain  corporate 
issues related to the potential reorganization of the Company, and other matters, and resulted in the higher charge.
Charges for amortization of $57,000 in the current year versus $133,000 in the previous year relates to write-off of leasehold
improvements,  related  to  the  Vancouver  office  premises,  recognized  in  the  previous  year  and  an  allocation  of  certain
depreciation  charges  at  Constancia  to  exploration  in  the  current  year.  Depreciation  should  remain  stable  in  the  next  fiscal
year.
As  at  June  30,  2009,  the  Company  held  a  $7  million  investment  in  long-term  notes  issued  by  a  trust  set  up  during  the
restructuring of the secured debt obligations, commonly known as “Asset Backed Commercial Paper” (“ABCP”). In August
2007, a number of sponsors of non-bank managed ABCP, including those with which the Company had invested, announced
that  they  could  not  place  ABCP  due  to  unfavourable  conditions  in  the  Canadian  capital  markets.   As  a  result,  the  affected
ABCP funds were subject to a plan of arrangement (the “Plan”) restructuring the ABCP into new, long-term notes.  The Plan
obtained court approval from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in June 2008 and was implemented in January 2009.
The breakdown of the new notes allocated to ABCP holders was determined by the relative value of the underlying assets that
each  trust  contributed.  The  Company’s  ABCP  was  contained  in  Structured  Investment  Trust  III  Series  A  and  were  replaced
with five new notes according to the following table:

1) In the event of liquidation, the order will commence  with Class C, then Class B followed by the Junior and Senior Class A 
notes.  
 
2) Although Class A-1 and A-2 and Class B will accrue interest quarterly at BA rates less 50 basis points, no interest will be paid 
out on Class A-2 until all principal and interest has been paid on A-1 and all principal has been paid on A-2.  Likewise, interest 
on Class B will not be paid until all accrued interest and principal has been paid on Class A-1 and A-2.  Class C notes attract a 
higher interest rate of 20% but acts as a residual class and realistic returns are expected to be less.
As a limited market developed for the notes at the end of the fiscal year, and as part of the strategy to maximize a return from
these investments, and strengthen the Company’s working capital position, subsequent to the year end, the Company disposed
of its holdings of Class A-1 and Class A-2 notes for proceeds of $3.2 million. As there appeared to be no evidence of certainty
that,  either  holding  or  disposing  of  the  remaining  Class  B,  C  and  15  notes,  would  result  in  a  recovery  of  the  estimated  fair
value, a full provision has been recorded against the carrying cost. Management will continue to monitor the situation and seek
to maximize returns on the investment on the remaining notes.
Based on a fair value estimation of the recoverability of the investments, management calculated the fair value of its holdings
of  ABCP  as  $3.6  million  and  has  recorded  a  provision  for  impairment  of  $3.5  million.  $1.7  million  of  the  impairment  was
charged to the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and $1.8 million was charged to the statement of
operations  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2008.  The  Company  received  $0.3  million  in  interest  the  current  year  and  has  been
recognized as a credit to the estimated fair value of the asset on the balance sheet as at June 30, 2009. The impairment charge,
combined with the return of capital, reduced the carrying cost of the notes to $3.2 million.
The Company pays a value added tax (“IGV”) in Peru on purchases of goods and services made domestically.  The Company
had  been  successful  in  renewing  agreements  with  the  Peruvian  government  to  recover  IGV  on  an  accelerated  basis,  until
March 31, 2009, at which time the government publicly  announced that agreements of this  nature  will  not be renewed after
this time. VAT paid related to mineral property expenditures prior to August 29, 2006, balances determined to be outside of
the scope of the agreement during the tenure of the agreement, and VAT which has been paid during the period April 1, 2009
to  June  30,  2009  (total  $2.3  million)  have  been  deemed  recoverable  only  when  future  sales  revenues  are  earned  from  the
related mineral properties, by offsetting the VAT otherwise payable at that time.  Due to the uncertainty in recovering these
receivables,  the  Company  charged  a  provision  to  the  statement  of  operations  to  June  30,  2009  for  the  full  $2.3  million.
Management will take all actions necessary to recover all IGV paid.
The  asset  retirement  obligation  represents  management’s  present  value  of  estimated  future,  third-party,  reclamation  and
closure costs at the Constancia Project. The majority of the estimated cost consists of the rehabilitation of land that has been
disturbed  by  the  construction  of  roads  and  drilling  platforms  to  date,  and  do  not  take  into  account  liabilities  that  may  arise
during  development,  construction  or  operating  a  mine  site.  As  at  a  June  30,  2009,  a  re-evaluation  of  future  site  restoration

Management Discussion & Analysis 
For the year ended June 30, 2009 
 
costs  at  Constancia  was  carried  out  and  revealed  that  the  area  of  disturbance  estimated  in  the  prior  year  was  greater  than
currently estimated.  As such,  the estimated  fair value of the estimate  was adjusted by $483,000 and a comparable reduction
was  made  to  mineral  properties  on  the  balance  sheet  as  at  June  30,  2009.  The  obligation  is  not  expected  to  increase
significantly  in  the  near  term  until  a  decision  is  made  to  commence  developing  the  Constancia  Project,  at  which  time  the
obligation will be re-evaluated to estimate the reclamation of a mine site instead of the current pre-development, exploration
site. The fair value of the liability is being accreted to future estimated costs over a three year term. The current year charge to
the statement of operations is $143,000.
The  Company  incurred  interest  of  $0.3  million  in  the  year  ended  June  30,  2009  related  to  the  issuance  of  a  $6  million
unsecured, convertible note on December 19, 2008 and a $3.8 million convertible note on March 31, 2009. The term of the
notes are three years and attract interest at 8%. The Company has allocated $6.6 million of the $9.8 million as long-term debt
on  the  June  30,  2009,  based  on  the  fair  value  of  a  similar  debt  instrument  without  associated  conversion  options.  The
remaining  $3.2  million  has  been  allocated  to  the  fair  value  of  the  warrants  ($1.8  million)  and  the  conversion  option  ($1.4
million).  The  face  value  of  the  notes  will  be  accreted  from  the  fair  value  over  the  life  of  the  two  notes  using  the  effective
interest method. The current years accretion charged to the statement of operations is $0.4 million. Both interest and accretion
will increase in the next fiscal year as the notes will attract interest and accretion charges based on a full year.
In  the  current  year,  the  Company  recognized  an  unrealized  foreign  exchange  loss  of  $0.6  million  on  the  translation  of  its
Peruvian operations, the conversion and settlement of its US dollar denominated payments to Mitsui Mining and other foreign
currency account balances. The US dollar strengthened considerably between the time the Company purchased the Constancia
mining rights from Mitsui (US$9.8 million) and the actual settlements of the liability and accounts for the majority of the loss.
This combined with losses attributable to the translation of its operating subsidiary, Norsemont Peru, resulted in the combined
loss of $0.6. Depending on the net asset position of Norsemont Peru, and the value of the U.S. dollars and Peruvian New Sol
versus the Canadian dollar, the Company will continue to recognize fluctuating foreign exchange gains and losses.
The  charge  to  the  statement  of  operations  for  stock  based  compensation  reflects  the  vested  portion  of  options  and  RSUs
granted  in  the  current  year  and  the  fair  value  calculated,  at  the  grant  date,  of  any  options  vesting  in  the  current  year.  The
current  year  charge  of  $5.1  million  versus  $1.8  million  in  the  previous  year,  in  the  main,  reflects  three  grants  of  options  to
service providers between July 2008 and June 2009 totaling 5,155,000 options and 54,000 RSUs issued to employees in Peru.
The previous year’s fair value includes a $1.8 million charge for 1,141,666 options and 65,000 RSUs granted in the previous
fiscal year.

During the above reported fiscal quarters, the Company has focused its efforts in acquisition, exploration and development of
the Constancia project. In the last eight reporting quarters, the Company completed and filed two technical reports increasing
the mineral resources at Constancia. These reports entailed extensive drilling, assaying and engineering analysis resulting in
the  significant  buildup  of  costs.  These  costs  are  expected  to  remain  high  while  the  Company  completes  the  definitive
feasibility study, expected by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2010.
Three months ended June 30, 2009
In the  fourth quarter ended June 30, 2009, the Company incurred a net loss of $10.3 million. The  majority of the loss  was
attributable  to  the  increase  in  exploration  expenses  of  $5.8  million.  The  Company  is  in  the  final  stages  of  completing  the
definitive  feasibility  study  in  the  fourth  quarter  and  incurred  extensive  costs.  The  remainder  of  the  loss  was  attributable  to
provisions for impairment of long-term investment and long-term receivables and the charges to the statement of operations
for stock-based compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the  year ended June 30, 2009, the  Company  completed  three private placements  and a rights offering  raising  gross
proceeds  of  $41.3  million  used  to  fund  operations,  exploration,  property  acquisition  costs  and  working  capital.  These
financings, while substantial, are not sufficient of themselves to enable the Company to fund all aspects of its operations and
working  capital  requirements,  and,  accordingly,  there  may  be  substantial  doubt  regarding  the  going  concern  assumption.
Management believes that it will be able to secure the necessary financing through a combination of the issue of new equity
or debt instruments, the entering into of joint venture arrangements or the exercise of warrants for the purchase of common
shares. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in these actions.

NORSEMONT MINING INC. 
 
Management Discussion & Analysis 
For the year ended June 30, 2009 
 
In  July  2008,  the  Company  completed  a  non-brokered  private  placement  of  3,000,200  units  at  $4.00  per  unit  for  gross
proceeds  of  $12  million.    Each  unit  consisted  of  one  common  share  and  one-half  of  one  common  share  purchase  warrant.
Each whole share purchase warrant entitles the holder to acquire one additional common share at an exercise price of $4.50
per  common  share  for  a  period  of  two  years  expiring  July,  2010.  As  at  June  30,  2008,  the  Company  had  collected  $6.2
million of the $12 million proceeds and these funds are reflected in cash and cash equivalents and share issuance  obligation
on the June 30, 2008 balance sheet. The remaining $5.8 million was collected in July 2008, prior to the close of the financing,
and the units were issued to investors.
On  December  19,  2008,  the  Company  issued  a  convertible,  unsecured  promissory  note  and  1,764,706  warrants  for  an
aggregate principal amount of $6 million. The  note has a principal amount of $6,000,000, bears interest at a rate of 8% per
annum  and  is  convertible  by  the  holders  into  common  shares  of  the  Company  at  any  time  up  to  December  19,  2011  at  a
conversion price of $1.70 per share. Each  whole  warrant  will entitle the shareholder to purchase one common share of the
Company at a price of $2.05 per share at any time until December 19, 2010.
On March 31, 2009, the Company issued a convertible, unsecured promissory note and 1,117,647 warrants for an aggregate
principal amount of $3.8 million to an existing shareholder of the Company. This note has a principal amount of $3,800,000
and bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum. Principal is convertible by the holder into common shares of the Company at
any time up to March 31, 2012 at a conversion price of $1.70 per share. Interest on this note is convertible by the holder into
common  shares  of  the  Company  at  prevailing  market  prices  less  allowable  discounts  to  market.  The  note  does  not  allow
forced conversion by the Company however; the Company can fully prepay principal and accrued interest at any time after
March  31,  2010.    Each  whole  warrant  will  entitle  the  holder  to  purchase  one  common  share  of  the  Company  at  a  price  of
C$2.05 per share at any time until March 31, 2011.
In  March  and  April  2009,  the  Company  completed  a  private  placement  of  units  made  up  of  common  shares  and  warrants.
6,364,706 units comprising one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant were placed at a price of
$1.60  per  unit  for  gross  proceeds  of  $10.2  million.  Each  whole  share  purchase  warrant  entitles  the  holder  to  acquire  one
additional common share at an exercise price of $1.90 per common share for a period of two years expiring in 2011.
On June 26, 2009, the Company completed a rights offering to holders of its common shares of record at the close of business
on June 1, 2009. Shareholders received one right for each common share held.  Six rights entitled the holder to purchase one
Unit at a price of $1.60 per unit. Each unit was comprised of one common share and one-half of a common share purchase
warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share for a term of two years at a price of $1.90. An
aggregate of 9,746,760 units, each unit comprising of one common share and one-half of one warrant, were issued and $15.5
million of gross proceeds were raised.
The Company’s reported working capital of $9.7 million as at June 30, 2009 compared to working capital of $5.2 million at
June 30, 2008, representing an increased position of $4.5 million and is indicative of the financings mentioned above and the
settling  of  the  full  $7.1  million  liability  to  Mitsui  recorded  as  at  June  30,  2008.      As  at  June  30,  2009,  the  Company  held
$12.6  million  in  cash  versus  $12.1  million  as  at  June  30,  2008.  At  both  balance  sheet  dates,  all  cash  was  held  in  bank
deposits.  As discussed above, the Company, as at June 30, 2009, held five  long-term notes that  were obtained  through the
restructuring of ABCP with a face value of $7 million.  Subsequent to the quarter end, in August 2009, the Company realized
$3.2 million in consideration for the disposition of the Class A-1 and Class  A-2 notes  which increased the  working capital
position of the Company. These notes were ranked senior to the Class B, C and 15 notes and management estimates that little
return, in the short-term, can be realized from the remaining notes. No secondary market has evolved for the remaining note
11
NORSEMONT MINING INC. 
 
Management Discussion & Analysis 
For the year ended June 30, 2009 
 
and  management  will  strive  to  dispose  of  the  holdings  at  the  earliest  possible  time  and  redeploy  the  proceeds  of  their
disposition into working capital.
Current assets excluding cash, as at June 30, 2009 versus 2008 have remained comparable.  $1.7 million of IGV associated
with  expenditures  made  in  Peru  to  March  31, 2009  are  included  in  working  capital  and  are  expected  to be  fully  recovered
within the 2010 fiscal year. A provision against the recovery of $2.3 million of IGV that is not expected to be recovered, until
sales are recognized from Constancia,is excluded from working capital.
Current liabilities at June 30, 2009 of $4.7 million, compared to $8.7 million as at June 30, 2008 reflects the full settlement of
the  Mitsui  liability.  The  Company  made  two  payments  in  the  current  year  of  US$7  million  fully  extinguishing  the
obligations.    Account  payable  as  at  the  current  year-end  increased  due  to  the  build-up  of  creditor  accounts  prior  to  the
finalization of the Rights offer. Accounts payable is expected to decrease significantly in the first fiscal quarter of 2010.
Net changes in non-cash  working capital balances resulted in a use of  $0.6  million in the current year. In the comparable
year of 2008 the Company  utilized $1.4 million. Cash  utilized to fund operations amounted to $30.1 million in the current
year and $31.9 million in the comparable year. In both periods, the majority of cash was utilized to advance the Constancia
project.
The Company’s operations in the year ended June 30, 2009 were funded primarily from cash on hand at June 30, 2008 and
funds generated from the private placement of units, convertible notes and warrants.
Other sources of funds potentially available to the Company as of September 23, 2009 are through the exercise of 19,607,020
share purchase  warrants  ranging in prices from  $1.70 to $4.50 per share expiring in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and through the
exercise  of  an  aggregate  of  11,724,275  stock  options  with  exercise  prices  ranging  from  $0.76  to  $4.04  per  share  expiring
between 2009 and 2013. There can be no assurance, however, that the trading price of the common shares on the  TSX will
exceed, by a material amount and for a reasonable period, the exercise price of such convertible securities at some time prior
to their expiry dates and that any or all of these outstanding convertible securities will be exercised.
The Company has not entered into any off balance sheet financings or other arrangements.
Risks and Uncertainties
Metals Prices Risks
The Company’s current operating business is the exploration for and development of base metals resources, and in particular,
copper opportunities.  Although copper prices have, in recent years, strengthened versus historical values, the spot price has
fallen from highs attained in 2007. The price of copper currently trades in the US$2.60 to US$2.80 per pound range and has
shown  recent  signs  of  strengthening  as  the  global  economy  emerges  from  recession.  The  price  has  been  and  will  remain
vulnerable  to  the  general  uncertainty  and  outlook  for  global  economic  growth  and  currency  fluctuations.    World  markets
however have been until now absorbing additional production without a significant devaluation of metals prices and there are
signals that demand for copper will outstrip the production from existing and known future supply. Other factors impacting
on copper and other metals prices have proven difficult to predict and will continue to add to the volatility of prices.

NORSEMONT MINING INC. 
 
Management Discussion & Analysis 
For the year ended June 30, 2009 
 
Financing Risks
The Company will have additional capital requirements in excess of its currently available resources to carry out  its planned
work program at its Constancia Project and will therefore be required to raise additional funds. In addition, if the Company’s
plans change, its assumptions change or prove inaccurate, or its capital resources in addition to projected cash flow, if any,
prove  to  be  insufficient  to  fund  operations,  the  Company  may  be  required  to  seek  additional  financing.  Although  the
Company has previously been successful in raising the funds required for its operations the ability of the Company to raise
additional funding in the current financial markets, attract joint venture or other strategic partners, on terms acceptable to the
Company,  can  be  affected  by  the  current  volatile  copper  and  financial  markets,  and  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the
Company will continue to have sufficient financing to meet its future capital requirements.
Exploration Risks
The Company has not had a history of operations or earnings and its overall success will be affected by its current or future
business activities. The Company is in the process of exploring and evaluating its interests in the Constancia Project and has
not yet determined whether these properties contain mineral deposits that are economically recoverable. The recoverability of
expenditures  incurred  to  acquire  or  earn  an  interest  in  these  resource  properties  are  dependent  upon  the  existence  of
economically  recoverable  reserves,  securing  surface  rights  and  maintaining  title  and  beneficial  interest  in  the  properties,
obtaining necessary financing to explore and develop the properties, and upon future profitable production or proceeds from
disposition of the resource properties.
Political Risks
The Company’s principal business is the exploration for mineral properties in Peru. Mineral property rights are regulated and
supervised  by  various  Peruvian  governmental  bodies.  Changes  in  laws,  regulations  or  policies  affecting  mineral  property
rights could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Lately, Peruvian governmental bodies have communicated their
intention  to  maintain  current  laws  and  regulations  enacted  that  ensure  the  security  of  proprietary  mineral  rights  and
management is unaware of any pending legislation, regulations or policies contrary to these communications.
Transactions with Related Parties
During the year ended June 30, 2009, the Company paid $167,000 (2008  - $168,000) for legal fees to a company controlled
by  an  officer  of  the  Company.  There  remained  no  liability  to  this  related  party  as  at  June  30,  2009.  The  Company  also
incurred  financing  charges  of  $0.4  million  (2008  –  nil)  to  a  shareholder  of  the  Company  that  also  provided  technical
consulting  services.  The  balance  was  fully  paid  subsequent  to  the  year-end.  Related-party  transactions  are  in  the  normal
course of operations and have been recorded at the exchange amounts agreed between the Company and related party.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The presentation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.  Significant areas requiring the use of estimates include the
assessment of impairment of long-lived assets including mineral properties, impairment of investments, amortization periods
of  furniture,  equipment  and  leasehold  improvements,  valuation  of  stock-based  compensation,  and  the  estimation  of  future
income tax assets and valuation allowance.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Management Discussion & Analysis 
For the year ended June 30, 2009 
 
The accounting policies described below are considered by management to be essential to the understanding and reasoning
used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements and the uncertainties that could have a bearing on its financial
results.
Asset retirement obligations:
The fair value of a liability  for an asset retirement obligation, such as site reclamation costs, is recognised in the period in
which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the costs to be incurred can be made.  The Company records
the estimated present value of future cash flows associated with site reclamation as a liability when the liability is incurred.
The discount used to calculate the present value is the Company’s estimated cost of capital.  Future costs are calculated using
an estimated inflation rate in the country that the third party costs are expected to be incurred.
At the end of each reporting period, the liability is increased to reflect the passage of time (accretion expense) and changes in
the estimated future cash flows underlying any initial fair value measurements.
Stock-based compensation:
The Company accounts for all stock-based payments and awards made to employees and non-employees under the fair value
based method. Fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. Option pricing models require the input
of highly subjective assumptions including the expected price volatility and the period in which the option will be exercised
or the expected life of the options. The estimates concerning volatility are made with reference to historical volatility, which
is not necessarily an accurate indicator of future volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
the fair value estimate, and therefore the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value
of the Company’s stock options.
Warrants:
The Company accounts for all warrant issuances under the fair value based method. Fair value is estimated using the Black-
Scholes  Option  Pricing  Model.  Warrant  valuation  models  require  the  input  of  highly  subjective  assumptions  including  the
expected  price  volatility  and  the  period  in  which  the  warrant  will  be  exercised  or  the  expected  life  of  the  warrants.  The
estimates concerning volatility are made with reference to historical volatility, which is not necessarily an accurate indicator
of future volatility.  Changes in the  subjective input assumptions can  materially affect the fair value estimate, and therefore
the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company’s warrants.
Convertible Notes:
The  Company  accounts  for  convertible  Notes  as  compound  financial  instruments  for  accounting  purposes  because  of  the
holder conversion option. An allocation between equity and liability (debt) was made using a fair value allocation of future
cash  flows.  Interest  is  payable  in  arrears  in  annual  installments  on  December  31  of  2009  and  2010  and  a  final  interest
payment on December 19, 2011 for the first note and December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012 for the second note. Principal
and  interest  cash  outflows  were  included  in  the  fair  value  calculation.  Based  on  the  fair  value  calculation  of  similar  debt
instruments  without  a  conversion  options,  management  estimated  the  liability  portion  of  the  instrument  and  allocated  the
residual  to  equity.  The  liability  components  of  the  two  notes  are  being  accreted  to  the  face  value  of  the  notes  over  the
expected terms to  maturity  using the effective interest  method. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can  materially
affect the fair value estimate, and therefore the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair
value of the Company’s convertible notes.

Changes in Accounting Policies including Initial Adoption:
Effective  July  1,  2008,  the  Company  adopted  the  provisions  of  the  following  new  Canadian  Institute  of  Chartered
Accountants ("CICA") accounting standards:
Capital Disclosures
Handbook  Section  1535,  Capital  Disclosures,  establishes  standards  for  disclosing  information  about  an  entity’s  capital  and
how  it  is  managed.  The  entity’s  disclosure  should  include  information  about  its  objectives,  policies  and  processes  for
managing  capital  and  disclose  whether  or  not  it  has  complied  and  the  consequences  of  non-compliance  with  any  capital
requirements to which it is subject.  
 
Mining Exploration Costs
In March 2009, the CICA issued EIC Abstract 174 - Mining Exploration Costs (“EIC-174”) which supersedes EIC Abstract
126  -Accounting  by  Mining  Enterprises  for  Exploration  Costs  (“EIC-126”),  to  provide  additional  guidance  for  mining
exploration enterprises on the accounting for capitalization of exploration costs and when an impairment test of these costs is
required. EIC 174 is applicable for the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements for its fiscal year ending May 31,
2009,  with  retroactive  application.  The  adoption  of  EIC  –  174  did  not  result  in  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s
consolidated financial statements.
Financial Instruments
In December 2006, the CICA issued Handbook Section 3862 Financial Instruments – Disclosures and Section 3863 Financial
Instruments  –  Presentation.  Section  3862  modifies  the  disclosure  requirements  of  Section  3861  Financial  Instruments  -
Disclosures and Presentation including required disclosure of the assessment of the significance of financial instruments for
an  entity’s  financial  position  and  performance;  and  of  the  extent  of  risks  arising  from  financial  instruments  to  which  the
Company is exposed and how the Company manages those risks.
Changes Not Yet Adopted:
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
In  November  2007,  the  CICA  approved  Section  3064  addressing  when  an  internally  developed  intangible  asset  meets  the
criteria  for  recognition  as  an  asset.  This  section  is  effective  for  fiscal  years  beginning  on  or  after  October  1,  2008.  The
Company does not expect the adoption to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.
In  June  2009,  the  CICA  amended  Section  3862,  Financial  Instruments  –  Disclosures  that  includes  additional  disclosure
requirements about fair value measurement for financial instruments and liquidity risk disclosures. These amendments entail
a three-level hierarchy that takes into account the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurements. The
amendments to Section 3862 apply for annual financial statements relating to fiscal years ending after September 30, 2009.
The Company has not yet adopted the disclosure requirements of this standard and does not expect them to have a material
impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Business Combinations ("Section 1582"), this new standards will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1,
2011. The Company is in the process of evaluating the requirement and impact to the consolidated financial statements of the
new standard. Section 1582 replaces Section 1581, Business Combinations, and establishes standards for the accounting for a
business  combination.  It  provides  the  Canadian  equivalent  to  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  ("IFRS")  3,
15

Management Discussion & Analysis 
For the year ended June 30, 2009 
 
Business Combinations. The  section applies prospectively  to business combinations  for  which the acquisition date is  on or
after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after January 1, 2011.
Section  1601,  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  ("Section  1601"),  and  Section  1602,  Non-Controlling  Interest  ("Section
1602").Sections 1601 and 1602 together replace Section 1600, Consolidated Financial Statements. Section 1601 establishes
standards  for  the  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements.  Section  1601  applies  to  interim  and  annual  consolidated
financial  statements  relating  to  fiscal  years  beginning  on  or  after  January  1,  2011.  Section  1602  establishes  standards  for
accounting  for  a  non-controlling  interest  in  a  subsidiary  in  consolidated  financial  statements  subsequent  to  a  business
combination. It is equivalent to the corresponding provisions of IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, and
applies to interim and annual consolidated financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the two new standards.
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
International Financial Reporting Standards
In 2006, the Canadian  Accounting  Standards Board ("AcSB") announced a plan that outlines the convergence of  Canadian
GAAP  with  IFRS  over  an  expected  five  year  transitional  period.  In  February  2008,  the  AcSB  announced  that  2011  is  the
changeover  date  for  public  accountable  companies  to  use  IFRS,  replacing  Canada's  own  GAAP.  The  transition  date  is  for
interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. The transition date of
January  1,  2011  will  require  the  restatement  for  comparative  purposes  of  amounts  reported  by  the  Company  for  the  year
ended  June  30,  2011. The  Company  has  begun  assessing  the  adoption  of  IFRS  for  2011,  and  the  identification  of  the  new
standards and their impact on financial reporting. At this time, the Company has not determined the impact of the transition
to IFRS.
Management  has  not  quantified  the  impact  of  the  conversion  and  will  be  conducting  an  ongoing  review  of  operations,
information systems and reporting procedures for the potential impact on each.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and
reported  to  senior  management,  including  the  Company’s  Chief  Executive  Officer  (“CEO”)  and  Chief  Financial  Officer
(“CFO”),  on  a  timely  basis  so  that  appropriate  decisions  can  be  made  regarding  public  disclosure.  Management  of  the
Company,  with  the  participation  of  the  CEO  and  the  CFO,  has  evaluated  the  design  and  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures as at June 30, 2009, as required by Canadian securities laws and has concluded that such
controls and procedures are effective.
The  Company’s  management,  under  the  supervision  of  the  CEO  and  the  CFO,  are  responsible  for  establishing  and
maintaining  the  Company’s  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting.  Internal  control  is  a  process  designed  to  provide
reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external
purposes  in  accordance  with  Canadian  GAAP.  Management  conducted  an  evaluation  of  internal  controls  over  financial
reporting  based  on  the  framework  established  in  “Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework”  issued  by  the  Committee  of
Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  this  evaluation  and  save  for  discussion  related  to
segregation  of  duties  below,  management  concluded  that  the  Company’s  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  were
effective as at June 30, 2009.

Management Discussion & Analysis 
For the year ended June 30, 2009 
 
During the evaluation it was determined that weaknesses existed in the design of internal control over financial reporting. Not
unlike  many  peers  in  the  junior  mining  industry  in  Canada,  the  Company  operates  a  relatively  small  head  office  and
concentrates its personnel at its operating office in  Lima, Peru and at the exploration offices at  Constancia. Due to  limited
personnel, at its Toronto head office, adequate segregation  of duties  was identified as  an area of  weakness.  The Company
does  not  have  any  immediate  plans  to  hire  additional  staffing  within  the  corporate  accounting  group,  but  will  continue  to
reassess internal requirements on a continual basis.
The CEO and the CFO have concluded however, that no material misstatements exist in the Company’s financial reporting as
at June 30, 2009.
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended  June
30,  2009  that  has  materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  the  Company’s  internal  control  over
financial reporting.
