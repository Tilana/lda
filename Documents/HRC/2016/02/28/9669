<p><i>Stressing</i> that the responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social issues 
</p>
<p>and threats to international peace and security must be shared among the nations of the 
</p>
<p>world and should be exercised multilaterally and that, in this regard, the central role must 
</p>
<p>be played by the United Nations as the most universal and representative organization in 
</p>
<p>the world, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> about the continued abuse by Member States of the extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>application of their national legislation in a manner that affects the sovereignty of other 
</p>
<p>States, the legitimate interests of entities or persons under their jurisdiction and the full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> the major changes taking place on the international scene and the 
</p>
<p>aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>Charter, including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental

<p>freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of 
</p>
<p>peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, the rule of law, pluralism, development, better 
</p>
<p>standards of living and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human 
</p>
<p>rights is essential for the full achievement of the purposes of the United Nations, including 
</p>
<p>the effective promotion and protection of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all 
</p>
<p>human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to 
</p>
<p>all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, such as race, 
</p>
<p>colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
</p>
<p>birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that democracy, development and respect for human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that democracy is 
</p>
<p>based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the promotion and the protection of human rights should be based 
</p>
<p>on the principle of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the 
</p>
<p>capacity of Member States to comply with their human rights obligations for the benefit of 
</p>
<p>all human beings, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that democracy is not only a political concept, but that it also has 
</p>
<p>economic and social dimensions, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that democracy, respect for all human rights, including the right to 
</p>
<p>development, transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of 
</p>
<p>society, and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary 
</p>
<p>foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with concern</i> that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, the inequitable distribution of wealth, 
</p>
<p>marginalization and social exclusion, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that dialogue among religions, cultures and civilizations could 
</p>
<p>contribute greatly to the enhancement of international cooperation at all levels, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining </i>the fact that it is imperative for the international community to ensure 
</p>
<p>that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world&#8217;s people, and that only through 
</p>
<p>broad and sustained efforts, based on our common humanity in all its diversity, can 
</p>
<p>globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable, </p>
