1.1
Acquisition of an interest in Atlantic Carbon Group PLC
Reason for the Meeting
On 3 August 2016, the Company announced to the ASX that it had entered into a binding agreement 
to acquire a 26.68% interest in Atlantic Carbon Group PLC (ACG).  As one of the options for financing 
the Acquisition, the Company may carry out a placement to sophisticated and professional investors, 
with the aim of raising up to $20 million by issuing Shares (Placement).  The Company is also evaluating 
whether the acquisition can be financed through debt funding and is holding discussions with various 
financiers.
If Shares are issued under the Placement, those Shares may be issued to investors in multiple tranches 
and  with  different  issue  prices.    The  issue  price(s)  for  the  Shares  that  may  be  allotted  under  the 
Placement  will  be  the  amount(s)  determined  by the  Directors.    However,  no  Shares  will  be  issued 
under the Placement with an issue price of less than 80% of the volume weighted average market 
price of the Shares traded on the ASX (as calculated over the last 5 days on which sales in the Shares 
were recorded before the day on which the issue of the relevant new Shares under the Placement 
occurs).

ACG Group operations
The  ACG  Group  is  a  high  grade  and  ultra-high  grade anthracite  producer  with operations  in  North 
Eastern Pennsylvania, USA.  It operates at a number of locations, all proximate to the town of Hazleton, 
Pennsylvania.
(a)
Stockton Mine1
The Stockton Mine is an established anthracite mine and was the top anthracite producing mine in 
the  United  States  during  20152.    It  is  a  fully  operational  open-cut  anthracite  mine  with  an  on-site 
processing plant (capable of washing 450,000 tons of Run of Mine anthracite per annum).
In  2015,  the  Company  (in  partnership  with  the  Reading,  Blue  Mountain  and  Northern  Railroad) 
constructed  a  new  rail  loading  facility  at  the  eastern  end  of  the  Stockton  Mine.  This  became 
operational on 11 August 2015 with the dispatch of anthracite to a steel industry customer in Indiana 
and a sugar processing company in Idaho.
In March and April 2014, ACG purchased 6 Komatsu Model HD785-7 100 ton haul trucks.  In February 
2015, ACG announced the purchase or more new equipment in partnership with Komatsu, including:


 
 
 
 
 
 

1 PC3000 hydraulic excavator; 
 
4 Komatsu Model HD785-7 100 ton haul trucks; 
 
2 Komatsu Model HM400-3 articulated haul trucks;
1 Komatsu Model PC490LC-10 hydraulic excavator;
2 Komatsu Model D275AX-SEO dozers; and
1 Komatsu Model WA500-7 wheel loader.
The new equipment was funded through an asset backed lease purchase agreement at a total cost of 
US$20 million over 6 years.  
 
Key performance statistics for the year ended 31 December 2015 relating to the Stockton Mine are 
set out below: 
 

Anthracite  production  of  204,746  tons,  an  increase  of  24%  on  the  previous  year  (2014: 
165,046 tons).


Run of Mine production of 638,697 tons, an increase of 87% on the previous year (2014: 
341,155 tons).
Total anthracite sales in 2015 of 261,564 tons.
ACG public documentation shows that the Stockton Mine has an estimated mine life of 10 years.

Hazleton Shaft Corporation3
In June 2016, ACG announced that it had completed the acquisition of Hazleton Shaft Corporation 
(HSC),  an  integrated  anthracite  mining  and  processing  company  operating  in  the  Hazleton  area  of 
Pennsylvania near the Stockton Mine.
HSC has traditionally mined waste stockpiles (called culm) to extract left-over anthracite.  As such, HSC 
has well developed skills in anthracite beneficiation and sizing, as typically waste stockpiles yield less 
than 10% anthracite.  HSC has a complex and efficient washery and sizing plant, but in addition, HSC 
has a 50% stake in a drier (also located at the Hazleton Shaft site) to dry anthracite for use in Electric 
Arc Furnaces, which is the dominant form of steel-making operation in the USA.  The drier reduces the 
inherent moisture of the anthracite to facilitate use in the foaming slag part of the electric arc process.
Hazleton Shaft Corporation operates the following 2 anthracite surface mines:


Hazleton  Shaft:  Hazleton  Shaft  is  immediately  adjacent  and  to  the  west  of  the  Stockton 
Mine. 
 
Jeansville: HSC has recently secured a permit for a new area 3.5 miles south of the existing 
operation called Jeansville.  Only in the last few weeks have ACG and HSC begun mining the 
Jeansville site.  Results to date are encouraging.  Unlike HSC's earlier operations, Jeansville 
is not a waste stockpile but rather an anthracite deposit.  Yields have increased dramatically 
to 75-80%, and this is expected to flow through to the profitability of ACG.
ACG expects that the acquisition of HSC will create operational advantages, including:




a substantial increase in production capacity; 
 
an increased reserve base providing long-term security and greater access to finance for new 
plant and equipment;
the ability to maintain production at optimum levels, avoiding the potential uncertainties 
associated with being a “one mine” operating company; and
the close geographical proximity of the operating mines and processing plants means that 
substantial economies of scale can potentially be achieved (e.g. in relation to administration 
and procurement).
(c)
Other non-operating mining assets4
Other non-operating assets held by members of the ACG Group include:
Pott & Bannon: Pott & Bannon is a future prospect site located 25 miles from the Stockton 
Mine.  It is well positioned in close proximity to major east-coast transportation hubs.  ACG 
is  currently  investigating  the  potential  resources  at  this  site  and  progressing  the  mine 
planning and engineering process with the view to bringing the site into production.  
 
Gowen: The Gowen Mine is a site that ACG inherited when it acquired the Stockton Mine.  
It was mined to exhaustion by Coal Contractors (1991) Inc in the 1990s.  The reclamation of 
the site was successfully completed in 2015.

Beaver  Brook  and  Sandy  Run:  These  sites  are  also  in  close  proximity  to  Hazleton, 
Pennsylvania  and  were  recently  acquired  as  part  of  the  acquisition  of  Hazleton  Shaft 
Corporation.  Mining permits are in place for both sites.  However, the anthracite reserves 
for both sites is unquantified.
1.4
Customers and sales
The  ACG  Group  currently supplies  anthracite to customers in the United States and Canada in the 
steel, metal reduction, carbon products and home heating industries.  It is also targeting exports in 
the international steel industry, particularly in Brazil, China, India and Western Europe.5

On 3 August 2016, the Company announced to the ASX that it had entered into a binding agreement 
(Acquisition Agreement) with Stephen Best (the current Managing Director of ACG) and persons and 
entities  connected  with  Stephen  Best  (being  Mayford  Equities  Limited,  Mary  Catherine  Best, 
Willoughby (465) Limited, Lucy Victoria Best, Helen Catherine Frankland, Penn Carb, Inc and Mount 
Charles (Mayfair) Limited) (Vendors), to acquire all the following shares and warrants issued by ACG 
(ACG Securities):

The exercise of the warrants would result in the Company acquiring a total of 1,618,017,264 ordinary 
class shares issued by ACG (amounting to an interest of 26.68% of ACG's issued share capital).

If on completion of the Acquisition the transfer of the ACG Securities would not result in the Company 
acquiring a 26.68% interest in ACG’s issued share capital, then before completion of the Acquisition 
the Vendors must (at no additional cost to the Company) purchase a sufficient number of additional 
shares issued by ACG to cover the shortfall (Top-Up ACG Securities) and also transfer those Top-Up 
ACG Securities to the Company at completion of the Acquisition.
When  determining  whether  the  required  26.68%  shareholding  will  be  satisfied,  the  percentage 
interest in ACG’s share capital acquired by the Company will be calculated as if the warrants that form 
part of the ACG Securities had been exercised and converted into shares, but excluding the impact of 
the exercise of any options referred to in section 1.2 of this Explanatory Statement.
Completion  of  the  Acquisition  is  subject  to  (and  conditional  on)  the  satisfaction  or  waiver  of  the 
conditions precedent described in section 1.10(a) of this Explanatory Statement.
1.9
Consideration for the Acquisition
Under the Acquisition Agreement, the consideration for the Acquisition consists of the following scrip 
and cash components:



Scrip:  On  completion  of  the  Acquisition,  the  Company  must  issue  to  the  Vendors  (in 
aggregate and in the proportions directed by the Vendors in writing) the number of Shares 
that  is  equal  to  US$3,000,000  (Consideration  Shares).    When  calculating  the  number  of 
Consideration  Shares  to  be  issued, the  Company must  use  the volume  weighted  average 
price of the Shares on the ASX during the last 10 trading days immediately before the day on 
which completion of the Acquisition is to occur and applying the AUD/USD exchange rate 
(published by a source reasonably determined by the Company) for the business day before 
the day on which completion of the Acquisition is to occur.
Cash component: On completion of the Acquisition, the Company must pay to the Vendors 
(in  aggregate  and  in  the  proportions  directed  by  the  Vendors  in  writing)  the  sum  of 
US$3,000,000  in  cash.   The  Company must  also  pay an  additional  US$50,000  to Mayford 
Equities Limited as consideration for the warrants that form part of the ACG Securities.
Negative control premium: On completion of the Acquisition, if the Company’s interest in 
ACG is at least 25.01% on a fully diluted basis (calculated as if all options, warrants and other 
securities issued by ACG at the time of completion of the Acquisition had been converted 
into  ordinary  class  shares),  the  Company  must  pay  to  Mayford  Equities  Limited  (at  the 
direction of and on behalf of all Vendors) the sum of US$2,000,000 in cash (less the amount 
that is required to be paid to ACG for all warrants held by the Vendors to be exercised and 
converted into ordinary class shares, being GBP 691,200).  Accordingly, it is expected that 
the  Company  will  need  to  pay  approximately  US$1,101,744  for  this  negative  control 
premium.9
1.10
Other key elements of the Acquisition
The other key commercial terms for the Acquisition are set out below:
(a)
Conditions precedent
If required by the Company during its due diligence, the offer from the Company to the Vendors to 
acquire the ACG Securities is subject to the Company and the Vendors entering into a more detailed 
share sale agreement documenting the Acquisition, with the terms of that agreement reflecting the 
terms of the Acquisition Agreement and other terms and conditions customary for a transaction of 
this type.
9 Based on a GBP/USD Exchange Rate where GBP 1.00 = US$ 1.299
Page 12 of 27
Completion of the Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions precedent.  These conditions must 
be satisfied as soon as reasonably possible after the date of the Acquisition Agreement, and can only 
be waived by the Company.  The conditions precedent are as follows:







The Company holding a general meeting and obtaining the requisite shareholder approvals 
for the transaction contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement. 
 
The Company raising at least $10 million through the allotment of new Shares (a condition 
that the Company may elect to waive if it is able to finalise a suitable debt facility to fund the 
Acquisition).  
 
The results of any due diligence investigation carried out by (or on behalf of) the Company 
in relation to the ACG Group being satisfactory to the Company in its absolute discretion.  
 
Certain prohibited events (e.g. winding up, insolvency, ceasing to carry on business, share 
capital  reduction/reconstruction,  disposal  of  a  substantial  part  of  business  or  property) 
(Prescribed Occurrences) not occurring in relation to any company within the ACG Group 
before completion of the Acquisition.  
 
The  Vendors  each  signing  an  escrow  agreement  under  which  they  agree  not  to  sell  or 
otherwise deal with any of the Consideration Shares for a period of 12 months following 
completion  of  the  Acquisition  (unless  the  dealing  is  part  of  a  transfer  arranged  by  the 
Company and approved by the relevant Vendor). 
 
On  Completion,  the  ACG  Securities  and  any  Top-Up  ACG  Securities  must  (in  aggregate) 
represent 26.68% of the issued share capital of ACG (calculated as if the warrants that form 
part of the ACG Securities had been exercised and converted into shares before completion 
of the  Acquisition,  but  excluding  the  impact of the  exercise of any  options  referred  to  in 
section 1.2 of this Explanatory Statement). 
 
The Vendors signing all documents reasonably required by the Company for the purpose of 
completing the Acquisition, including stock transfer form(s) for the ACG Securities and any 
Top-Up ACG Securities.
Further, the Company is not obliged to proceed with the Acquisition if it is required not to do so under 
the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (Takeover Code) or any other applicable law.
(b)
Termination
The Acquisition Agreement may be terminated by the Company in the event that completion of the 
Acquisition does not occur on or before 16 September 2016.
(c)
Warranties given by the Vendors
The Acquisition Agreement includes warranties from the Vendors in favour of the Company relating 
to  their  title  to  the  ACG  Securities  and  the  capacity  of  the  Vendors  to  enter  into  the  Acquisition 
Agreement.  The Acquisition Agreement also contains the following warranties from the Vendors:
As at the date of the Acquisition Agreement, the shares that form part of the ACG Securities 
constitute (in aggregate) 18.99% of the issued share capital of ACG (or 26.68% of the issued 
share capital if the warrants that form part of the ACG Securities had been exercised and 
converted into shares before the date of the Acquisition Agreement); 
 
No restriction notice (as defined in paragraph 1(2) of schedule 1B of the UK Companies Act 
2006) has been issued and remains in force in relation to any of the ACG Securities; and
Page 13 of 27



The Vendors collectively (and each Vendor in his/her individual capacity) are exempt persons 
for the purposes of the EU Financial Services Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 
2005, including (without limitation) pursuant to Articles 28 and 28A of that Order.
(d)
Warranties given by the Company
The  Company  did  not  provide  any  warranties  for  the  benefit  of  the  Vendors.    In  particular,  the 
Company makes no representation or warranty as to whether it may acquire or offer to acquire any 
other shares or securities in ACG as a result of or following completion of the Acquisition.
(e)
Completion
Completion  under  the  Acquisition  Agreement  is  to  take  place  on  the  first  day  by  which  all  of  the 
conditions precedent have been satisfied or waived.
(f)
Exclusivity
The Vendors have undertaken to not deal with, or enter into any agreement or arrangement to deal 
with, the ACG Securities or any other shares or securities in ACG issued or otherwise acquired by any 
Vendor (other than under the Acquisition Agreement) until completion of the Acquisition.
1.11
Funding the Acquisition
The  cash  consideration  payable  to  the  Vendors  in  relation  to  the  Acquisition  amounts  to 
approximately  $5,442,355.10    As  one  of  the  options  for  financing  these  costs  and  to  provide  the 
Company with additional working capital, the Company may carry out the Placement.  The Company 
is  also  evaluating  whether  the  Acquisition  can  be  financed  through  debt  funding  and  is  holding 
discussions with various financiers.
If the Company proceeds with the Placement, it is currently expected that the Company will seek to 
raise between $10 million and $20 million through the allotment of Shares to sophisticated investors 
and professional investors (as those terms are defined under the Corporations Act).
If Shares are issued under the Placement, those Shares may be issued to investors in multiple tranches 
and  with  different  issue  prices.    The  issue  price(s)  for  the  Shares  that  may  be  allotted  under  the 
Placement  will  be  the  amount(s)  determined  by the  Directors.    However,  no  Shares  will  be  issued 
under the Placement with an issue price of less than 80% of the volume weighted average market 
price of the Shares traded on the ASX (as calculated over the last 5 days on which sales in the Shares 
were recorded before the day on which the issue of the relevant new Shares under the Placement 
occurs).
The Company will not be issuing a prospectus or other form of disclosure document to investors if it 
proceeds  with  the Placement,  but  intends to  issue  a  “cleansing  notice”  under section  708A of  the 
Corporations Act in order to allow the trading of Shares issued under the Placement.
The Company has retained Blackwood Capital Limited to assist with the raising of funds under the 
Placement.

Changes to the Company’s capital structure
Assuming  that  the  Company  proceeds  with  the  Placement  and  does  not  elect  to  complete  the 
Acquisition  using  debt  funding,  immediately  following  completion  of  the  Acquisition  and  the 
Placement, the number of Shares on issue is expected to be as set out in the table below:

As noted above, the issue price(s) for Shares under the Placement has not been determined.  In the 
table above, for illustrative purposes, the issue price for Shares under the Placement has been set at 
$0.624 (which is 80% of the closing price of the Company’s Shares on 8 August 2016).  The actual issue 
price(s) under the Placement may be higher or lower, subject to the requirement that no Shares will 
be issued under the Placement with an issue price of less than 80% of the volume weighted average 
market price of the Shares traded on the ASX (as calculated over the last 5 days on which sales in the 
Shares  were  recorded  before  the  day  on  which  the  issue  of  the  relevant  new  Shares  under  the 
Placement occurs).
In addition to the Shares and partly paid shares listed above, the Company currently has a total of 
24,393,996  options  and  4,940,000  performance  rights  on  issue.    Neither  the  Acquisition  nor  any 
Placement are expected to have any impact on these other classes of Securities.
11 Calculated as if the 10-day volume weighted average price for the Company’s Shares on the day before completion of 
the Acquisition is approximately $0.78 (being the closing price for the Company’s Shares on the ASX on 8 August 2016)

Risks to be considered by Shareholders
There are a number of risks that Shareholders should consider when deciding on how to vote on 
Resolutions 1 and 2 – some specific to the Acquisition, some specific to the ACG Group and its 
operations, and some of a general nature.  These risks may individually or in combination materially 
and adversely affect the Company’s investment returns and the value of the Shares.  Many of these 
risks are outside the control of the Company.
Before deciding on how to vote on Resolutions 1 and 2, Shareholders should carefully consider the 
risk factors described below, together with all other information contained in this Notice.  If any of 
these risks and uncertainties, together with the possible additional risks and uncertainties of which 
the  Directors  are  currently  unaware  or  which  they  consider  not  to  be  material  in  relation  to  the 
                                                           
12 As at around the date of this Notice 
13 Based on USD/AUD exchange rate as at 9 August 2016
Page 16 of 27
Acquisition or the ACG Group, actually occur, the Company’s business, financial position, the amount 
of work able to be performed with the funds raised from the Placement or operating results could be 
materially and adversely affected.
In addition, Shareholders should be aware that generally the value of the Company's Shares on the 
ASX might rise and fall depending on a range of factors that affect the market price of Shares.  These 
include  local,  regional  and  global  economic  conditions  and  sentiment  towards  equity  markets  in 
general.
(a)
Completion risk
Completion of the Acquisition is conditional on the satisfaction of a number of conditions precedent.  
There is a risk that the conditions precedent in the Acquisition Agreement may not be satisfied in full.  
In the event that these conditions are not satisfied or waived, then the Company will not proceed with 
the Acquisition.  The Company is still in the process of conducting financial, commercial and legal due 
diligence  on  the  ACG  Group  and  this  due  diligence  exercise  may  uncover  issues  that  cause  the 
Company to decide to not proceed with the Acquisition.
(b)
Minority interest risks
After completion of the Acquisition, the Company will have a 26.68% interest in the issued capital of 
ACG  (calculated  as  if  the  warrants  that  form  part  of  the  ACG  Securities  had  been  exercised  and 
converted into shares, but excluding the impact of the exercise of certain options which have been 
issued  by  ACG).    The  Company  will  be  ACG’s  largest  shareholder,  but  will  still  be  a  minority 
shareholder.  As a minority shareholder, the Company will have limited control over the operations 
and decision making processes of the ACG Group.
(c)
ACG Group risks
The business activities of the ACG Group will be subject to risk factors of both a specific and general 
nature.  If any of the risks associated with the ACG Group materialise, then the business, results of 
operations,  financial  condition  and  prospects  of  the  ACG  Group  (and  therefore  the  return  on  the 
Company’s investment in ACG) could be materially and adversely affected, which could result in the 
loss of all or part of the Company’s investment. The principal risk factors are described below.  While 
some of these  risks can be mitigated by the use of appropriate safeguards and systems, many are 
outside the control of ACG and the Company and cannot be mitigated.


Mining and processing risks:  The ACG Group’s principal operations involve the mining of 
anthracite.    Its  operations  are  therefore  subject  to  all  of  the  hazards  and  risks  normally 
associated with mining and processing anthracite.  These include unusual and unexpected 
geological formations, rock falls, flooding and other conditions involved in the extraction of 
materials, any of which could result in damage to the mine and other producing facilities, 
damage to life or property, environmental damage and pollution and possible legal liability.  
These risks could have a material adverse impact on the business, operations and financial 
performance of the ACG Group, which could in turn have an impact on the Company’s return 
on its investment in ACG. 
 
Regulatory risks:  The ACG Group’s operations are subject to relevant environmental, health 
and safety laws and regulations.  There can be no assurance that new laws and regulations, 
amendments  to,  or  stringent  enforcement  of,  existing  laws  and  regulations  will  not  be 
introduced.  These could have a material impact on  the  ACG Group  and its performance.  
Further, there can be no assurance that all permits which  the  ACG  Group  requires for its 
operations will be retained or maintained on reasonable terms.  Breaches of relevant laws 
and regulations could also result in members of the ACG Group being fined or mining permits 
being cancelled.
Page 17 of 27





Volatility of commodity prices:  Commodity prices fluctuate and are affected by numerous 
factors  beyond  the  Company’s  or  ACG’s  control,  including  global  demand  and  supply, 
international economic trends, currency exchange  fluctuations,  expectations for inflation, 
speculative  activity,  consumption  patterns  and  global  or  regional  political  events.  
Fluctuations in commodity prices may adversely impact the performance of the ACG Group 
and  returns  of  the  Company’s  investment  in  ACG.    Further,  reduction  in  demand  for 
anthracite  could  lead  to  a  fall  in  prices,  which  could  lead  to  a  significant  fall  in  the  ACG 
Group’s cash flow and impact on the operating results and financial condition of ACG.
Dependent  on  key  personnel:    The  development  and  success  of  the  ACG  Group  are 
dependent on its executive management team and the ACG Group’s ability to recruit and 
retain high quality and experienced staff.  The loss of the service of key personnel or inability 
to recruit or retain quality staff could have an adverse effect on future business and financial 
conditions.
Foreign exchange risks:  The ACG Group reports its results in US dollars, while the functional 
currency of ACG (as the parent company) is Pounds Sterling.  This may result in additions to 
ACG’s  reported  costs.    Fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  between  currencies  in  which  ACG 
invests, reports or derives income may cause fluctuations in its financial results that are not 
necessarily related to the ACG Group’s underlying operations.
Financial  risks:    The  ACG  Group’s  operations  expose  it  to  a  variety  of  financial  risks  that 
include  the  effect of changes  in debt market  prices and foreign currency exchange  rates, 
credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
Future capital needs:  There is no guarantee that acceptable resources or funds will be found 
in the future.  The lack of capital could have a material adverse impact on the ACG Group 
and its prospects.
(d)
Risk of Shareholder dilution
As  a  consequence  of  the  proposed  allotment  of  Shares  under  the  Acquisition  Agreement  and  the 
Placement, the interests of existing Shareholders will be diluted.  Further, the Company may elect to 
issue additional Securities to fund its operations.  While the Company will be subject to the constraints 
of the Listing Rules regarding the percentage of its capital it is able to issue within a 12-month period 
(other  than  where  exceptions  apply),  Shareholders  may  be  diluted  as  a  result  of  the  allotment  of 
additional Securities in the future.
(e)
No guarantee in respect of investment
The above list of risk factors should not be taken as an exhaustive list of the risks faced by the Company 
or  by  Shareholders  in  relation  to  the  Acquisition  and  the  Placement.    The  Acquisition  carries  no 
guarantee in respect of return on investment.  Shareholders should consult with their professional 
adviser before deciding on how to vote on Resolutions 1 and 2.
2.
2.1
Listing Rule 7.1 (Resolutions 1 and 2)
Requirements for Shareholder approval
Listing Rule 7.1 provides that a company must not, subject to specified exemptions, issue or agree to 
issue more equity securities during any 12-month period than that amount which represents 15% of 
the number of fully paid ordinary securities on issue at the commencement of that 12-month period.  
Certain exemptions apply to this rule, including where the new allotment is approved by shareholders.
Page 18 of 27
Without  approval  from  Shareholders,  the  proposed  allotment  of  Shares  under  the  Placement 
(together with the Shares to be issued to the Vendors as consideration under the Acquisition) would 
cause the Company to exceed the 15% threshold imposed by Listing Rule 7.1.
2.2
Information required for approvals under Listing Rule 7.1
Listing Rule 7.3 details the information that needs to be given to Shareholders when approval is 
being sought under Listing Rule 7.1.  This information is summarised below:
Information required
Details
The names of the persons 
that will be issued the 
Shares
Acquisition
The Consideration Shares to be issued as part of the Acquisition will 
be  issued  to  the  Vendors  (being  Mayford  Equities  Limited,  Mary 
Catherine  Best,  Stephen  Best,  Willoughby  (465)  Limited,  Lucy 
Victoria Best, Helen Catherine Frankland, Penn Carb Inc and Mount 
Charles  (Mayfair)  Limited).    The  Consideration  Shares  are  to  be 
issued  among  the  Vendors  in  the  proportions  directed  by  the 
Vendors before completion of the Acquisition.
Placement
The identity of the investors under the Placement has not yet been 
determined.    If  the  Company  proceeds  with  the  Placement,  the 
Company  will  be  seeking  to  raise  funds  from  sophisticated  and 
professional investors (together with other categories of investors 
that do not need to receive a prospectus or other type of disclosure 
document under the Corporations Act).

Shares that the Company 
will issue
The date by which the 
Company will issue the 
Shares
Acquisition
On  completion  of  the  Acquisition,  the  Company  is  to  issue  the 
number of  Shares that  is equal  to US$3,000,000  calculated  using 
the volume weighted average price of the Shares on the ASX during 
the  last  10  trading  days  immediately  before  the  day  on  which 
completion of the Acquisition is to occur and applying the AUD/USD 
exchange rate (published by a source reasonably determined by the 
Company) for the business day before the day on which completion 
of the Acquisition is to occur.
Placement
If  the  Company  proceeds  with  the  Placement  and  $20  million  is 
raised under the Placement, the maximum number of Shares to be 
issued by the Company under the Placement will be the following 
amount:
$20 million ÷ the issue price
Further details regarding the issue price under the Placement are 
discussed in this table below.
Refer to section 1.12 of this Explanatory Statement for additional 
information  regarding  the  expected  changes  to  the  Company’s 
capital structure.
Acquisition
The  Consideration  Shares  are  to  be  issued  on  completion  of  the 
Acquisition.  Completion is to occur on the first business day after 
each of the conditions precedent (as summarised in section 1.10(a) 
of this Explanatory Statement) have been satisfied or waived.  The 
Company has the right to terminate the Acquisition Agreement on 
and from 16 September 2016 if all of the conditions have not been 
satisfied  or  waived  by  that  date.    In  any  event,  provided  that  all 
conditions precedent are satisfied or waived and completion of the 
Acquisition  occurs,  the  Consideration  Shares  will  all  be  issued 
simultaneously  on  the  same  date  (with  that  date  being  within  3 
months after the date of the Meeting).
Placement
If the Company proceeds with the Placement, all allotments under 
the Placement are to occur within 3 months after the date of the 
Meeting (and may occur progressively during that 3 month period).

The intended use of the 
funds raised
allotted under the Placement will be the amount(s) determined by 
the  Directors.    However,  no  Shares  will  be  issued  under  the 
Placement  with  an  issue  price  of  less  than  80%  of  the  volume 
weighted average market price of the Shares traded on the ASX (as 
calculated over the last 5 days on which sales in the Shares were 
recorded  before  the  day  on  which  the  issue  of  the  relevant  new

of  the  Consideration  Shares.    If  the  Company  proceeds  with  the 
Placement, the Company will seek to raise between $10 million and 
$20 million.  Additional information relating to the use of any funds 
raised  under  the  Placement  are  set  out  in  section  1.13  of  this 
Explanatory Statement.
2.3
Directors’ recommendation
The Directors unanimously recommend that the Shareholders vote in favour of Resolutions 1 and 2 
for the following reasons:



the approval of Resolution 1 is a condition precedent to completion of the Acquisition; 
  
the  approval  of  Resolution  2  may  be  required  to  fund  the  Acquisition,  increase  the 
Company’s working capital and provide the Company with additional resources to pursue 
new acquisition opportunities; and 
 
the Directors consider that the Acquisition and the Placement are in the best interests of the 
Company.
Accordingly, if you would like the Acquisition and the Placement to proceed, you should vote in 
favour of both Resolution 1 and Resolution 2.

Listing Rule 7.4 (Resolutions 3 and 4)
Requirements for Shareholder approval
As noted in section 2.1 of this Explanatory Statement, Listing Rule 7.1 provides that a company must 
not,  subject to specified exemptions, issue or agree to issue more equity securities during any 12-

on issue at the commencement of that 12-month period.
Listing  Rule  7.4  sets  out  one  of  the  exemptions  to  Listing  Rule  7.1,  which  provides  that  where  a 
company in general meeting ratifies a previous issue of securities (provided that the previous issue 
did not breach the Listing Rules), those securities will be deemed to have been made with shareholder 
approval for the purposes of Listing Rule 7.1.
Resolutions 3 and 4 seek approval from Shareholders that:


the allotment of 1,000,000 Options issued to Anglo Pacific on 31 December 2015; and 
 
the  allotment  of  4,300,000  Shares  issued  on  5  July  2016  following  the  exercise  of  other 
Options,

3.3
Directors’ recommendation
The Directors unanimously recommend that the Shareholders vote in favour of Resolutions 3 and 4 
for the following reasons:
the approval of Resolutions 3 and 4 would provide the Company with additional flexibility to 
issue  further  Securities  without  incurring  the  expense  associated  with  calling  a  general 
meeting; and 
 
the Directors consider that the ratification proposed by Resolutions 3 and 4 is in the best 
interests of the Company.

Instructions for completing ‘Appointment of Proxy’ form
1.
(Appointing a Proxy): A Shareholder entitled to attend and cast a vote at a General Meeting is entitled to appoint
a proxy to attend and vote on their behalf at the Meeting.  If the Shareholder is entitled to cast 2 or more votes
at the Meeting, the Shareholder may appoint a second proxy to attend and vote on their behalf at the Meeting.
However, where both proxies attend the Meeting, voting may only be exercised on a poll.  The appointment of
a second proxy must be done on a separate copy of the Proxy Form.  A Shareholder who appoints 2 proxies may
specify the proportion or number of votes each proxy is appointed to exercise. If a Shareholder appoints 2 proxies
and  the  appointments  do  not  specify  the  proportion  or  number  of  the  Shareholder’s  votes  each  proxy  is
appointed to exercise, each proxy may exercise one-half of the votes.  Any fractions of votes resulting from the
application of these principles will be disregarded.  A duly appointed proxy need not be a Shareholder of the
Company.
2.
(Direction to Vote): A Shareholder may direct a proxy how to vote by marking one of the boxes opposite to each
item of business in the Proxy Form.  Where a box is not marked the proxy may vote as they choose.  Where more
than one box is marked on an item the vote will be invalid on that item.
3.
(Signing Instructions):




(Individual): Where the holding is in one name, the Shareholder must sign.
(Joint Holding): Where the holding is in more than one name, all of the joint Shareholders should
sign.
(Power  of  Attorney):  If  you  have  not  already  provided  the  Power  of  Attorney  to  the  Company
Secretary, please attach a certified photocopy of the Power of Attorney to this Proxy Form when you
return it.
(Companies):  Where  the  Shareholder  is  a  company  and  has  a  sole  director  who  is  also  the  sole
company secretary, that person must sign and note that they are the sole director and sole company
secretary next to their signature.  Where the company (pursuant to section 204A of the Corporations
Act) does not have a company secretary, a sole director can also sign alone.  Otherwise, a director
jointly with either another director or a company secretary must sign.  Please sign in the appropriate
place to indicate the office held.
4.
(Attending the Meeting): Completion of a Proxy Form will not prevent individual Shareholders from attending
the General Meeting in person if they wish.  Where a Shareholder completes and lodges a valid Proxy Form and
attends  the  General  Meeting  in  person,  then  the  proxy’s  authority  to  speak  and  vote  for  that  Shareholder  is
suspended while the Shareholder is present at the General Meeting.
