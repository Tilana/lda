Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results
LOS ANGELES, August 4, 2016 – California Resources Corporation ("CRC" or the "Company") (NYSE:CRC), an
independent California-based oil and gas exploration and production company, today announced a net loss of $140
million or $3.51 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016, compared with a net loss of $68 million or $1.78 per
diluted share for the same period in 2015. The adjusted net loss1 for the second quarter of 2016 was $72 million or
$1.80 per diluted share, compared with an adjusted net loss of $51 million or $1.33 per diluted share for the same
period in 2015. For the first six months of 2016, the net loss was $190 million or $4.85 per diluted share, compared with
a net loss of $168 million or $4.40 per diluted share for the same period in 2015. The adjusted net loss for the first six
months of 2016 was $172 million or $4.39 per diluted share, compared with an adjusted net loss of $148 million or
$3.87 per diluted share for the same period of 2015. Adjusted EBITDAX2 for the second quarter and first six months of
2016 was $160 million and $284 million, respectively, compared with $270 million and $468 million for the second
quarter and first six months of 2015.
Quarterly Highlights Include:
•Quarterly total production of 140,000 BOE per day
•22% reduction in quarterly production costs year-over-year
•28% reduction in quarterly general and administrative costs year-over-year
•$80 million debt reduction in exchange for common stock during the quarter
•Cash from settled hedges of $2.29 per barrel of oil for the quarter
Todd Stevens, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "While the second quarter price improvements were
welcome, we continued our commitment to executing on items within our control, remaining focused on our core
financial and operating tenets. Over the past year we have reduced our debt by approximately $700 million from the
post-spin peak reached in early 2015. The recently announced tender would take us another step closer to our long
term goals, and we remain focused on continued deleveraging efforts."

Second Quarter Results
For the second quarter of 2016, CRC reported a net loss of $140 million or $3.51 per diluted share, compared with a
net loss of $68 million or $1.78 per diluted share for the same period of 2015. The 2016 quarter reflected lower
production costs, general and administrative expense, ad valorem expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization
expense (DD&A), exploration expense and interest expense, as well as gains on the retirement of notes and divestiture
of assets, more than offset by lower oil and gas realized prices and lower oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and gas
volumes. The second quarter 2016 adjusted net loss was $72 million or $1.80 per diluted share, compared with an
adjusted net loss of $51 million or $1.33 per diluted share for the same period of 2015. The 2016 adjusted net loss
excluded $137 million of non-cash derivative losses on outstanding hedges at June 30, 2016, $44 million of gains on
the retirement of the Company's unsecured notes, a $31 million gain from asset divestitures, and $6 million of other
non-recurring charges. The 2015 adjusted net loss excluded $17 million of after-tax non-recurring adjustments.
Adjusted EBITDAX for the second quarter of 2016 was $160 million, compared to $270 million for the same period of
2015.
Total daily production volumes averaged 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in the second quarter of 2016,
compared with 161,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2015, a 13-percent decrease which is within CRC's stated
production decline range. The second quarter 2016 production decline reflected management's decision to withhold
development capital and selective deferral of workover and downhole maintenance activity in the first half of the year.
The Company began increasing its activity levels gradually towards the end of the second quarter. Additionally,
temporary California pipeline disruptions negatively impacted CRC's ability to sell all of the oil the Company produced
in the second quarter of 2016, some of which CRC held in inventory at the end of the quarter. As a result, the actual
second quarter production was slightly higher than the reported volumes, which represent sales. The Company
expects this inventory to be sold in the third quarter of 2016 and be reported as production at that time. Year-over-year
average oil production decreased by 13 percent, or 14,000 barrels per day, to 90,000 barrels per day in the second
quarter of 2016, compared to the same period of the prior year. NGL production decreased by 11 percent to 16,000
barrels per day and natural gas production decreased by 14 percent to 202 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day.
In the second quarter of 2016, realized crude oil prices including the effect of cash received from settled hedges
decreased 23 percent to $43.70 per barrel from $56.73 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter 2016
hedges contributed an additional $2.29 per barrel to the realized crude oil price, compared with no effect in the second
quarter of 2015. Realized NGL prices increased 10 percent to $22.54 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 from
$20.47 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015. Realized natural gas prices decreased 33 percent to $1.66 per
thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in the second quarter of 2016, compared with $2.49 per Mcf in the same period of 2015.
Production costs for the second quarter of 2016 were $188 million or $14.76 per BOE, compared with $242 million or
$16.59 per BOE for the second quarter of 2015, a 22-percent reduction on an absolute dollar basis. The decrease was
driven by cost reductions across CRC's operations, particularly in well servicing efficiency, field personnel and lower
natural gas prices, as well as management's decision to selectively defer lower value workovers and downhole
maintenance activity. General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $61 million
Page 2
or $4.80 per BOE for the second quarter of 2016, compared with $85 million or $5.82 per BOE for the second quarter of
2015, reflecting employee and contractor cost-reduction initiatives. Adjusted G&A expenses for the second quarter of
2016 were $57 million or $4.49 per BOE, compared with $75 million or $5.13 per BOE for the second quarter of 2015.
Adjusted G&A expenses for both quarters excluded severance and other employee-related costs. Exploration
expenses of $5 million for the second quarter of 2016 were $2 million lower than the same period of 2015. Ad valorem
taxes of $26 million for the second quarter of 2016 were $14 million lower than the same period of 2015.
Six-Month Results
For the first six months of 2016, CRC reported a net loss of $190 million of $4.85 per diluted share, compared with a net
loss of $168 million or $4.40 per diluted share for the same period of 2015. The 2016 results reflected lower production
costs, general and administrative expense, ad valorem expense, DD&A expense, exploration expense and interest
expense, as well as gains on the retirement of notes and divestiture of assets, more than offset by lower oil, NGL and
gas realized prices and volumes. The first six-month adjusted net loss was $172 million or $4.39 per diluted share,
compared with an adjusted net loss of $148 million or $3.87 per diluted share for the same period of 2015. The 2016
adjusted net loss excluded $218 million of non-cash derivative losses on outstanding hedges at June 30, 2016, $133
million of gains on the retirement of the company's notes, a $31 million gain from asset divestitures, a $63 million
benefit from a deferred tax valuation allowance adjustment and $27 million of other non-recurring charges. The 2015
adjusted net loss excluded $20 million of after-tax non-recurring adjustments.
Adjusted EBITDAX for the first six months of 2016 was $284 million, compared to $468 million in the prior year period.
Total daily production volumes averaged 144,000 BOE in the first six months of 2016, compared with 163,000 BOE in
the first six months of 2015, a 12-percent decrease which is within CRC's stated production decline range. The
production decline in the first six months of 2016 reflected management's decision to withhold development capital and
selective deferral of workover and downhole maintenance activity in the first half of the year. CRC's year-over-year
average oil production decreased by only 11 percent, or 12,000 barrels per day, to 94,000 barrels per day in the first six
months of 2016, compared with the same period of the prior year. NGL production decreased by 6 percent to 17,000
barrels per day and natural gas production decreased by 16 percent to 199 MMcf per day.
Realized crude oil prices including the effect of cash received from settled hedges decreased 23 percent to $39.90 per
barrel in the first half of 2016 from $51.51 per barrel in the first half of 2015. Hedges contributed $4.38 per barrel to the
2016 realized crude oil price compared with $0.03 for 2015. Realized NGL prices decreased 8 percent to $19.35 per
barrel in the first half of 2016 from $21.00 per barrel in the first half of 2015. Realized natural gas prices decreased 31
percent to $1.85 per Mcf in the first half of 2016, compared with $2.67 per Mcf in the same period of 2015.
Production costs for the first half of 2016 were $372 million or $14.21 per BOE, compared with $484 million or $16.39
per BOE for the same period in 2015, a 23-percent reduction on an absolute dollar basis. The decrease was driven by
cost reductions across CRC's operations, particularly in well servicing efficiency, field personnel, energy use and lower
natural gas prices, as well as management's decision to increase economic thresholds
Page 3
and selectively defer lower value workovers and downhole maintenance activity. G&A expenses were $128 million or
$4.90 per BOE for the first half of 2016, compared with $161 million or $5.45 per BOE for the same period in 2015,
reflecting employee and contractor cost-reduction initiatives as well as lower 2016 stock-based compensation costs
due to the lower stock price. Adjusted G&A expenses were $110 million or $4.20 per BOE for the first half of 2016,
compared with $151 million or $5.11 per BOE for the same period of 2015. Adjusted G&A expenses for both years
excluded severance and other employee-related costs. Exploration expenses of $10 million for the first half of 2016
were $14 million lower than the same period of 2015. Ad valorem taxes were $53 million for the first half of 2016 and
$80 million for the same period of 2015.
Operating cash flow after working capital changes was $44 million for the first six months of 2016 and $232 million for
the first six months of 2015. In addition to the increase in net loss, the first half of 2016 reflected higher interest
payments, largely due to the timing of the payment due dates.
Operational Update
CRC did not have any drilling rigs running during the second quarter of 2016. This was consistent with CRC's
significantly reduced 2016 capital program which focused on investments designed to maintain the mechanical
integrity of its facilities and systems and operate them safely. The Company significantly slowed second quarter capital
investment in response to low commodity prices. Management's decision to withhold development capital and defer
well maintenance activity in the first half of the year reduced its production levels, particularly in the second quarter.
The Company is increasing the level of its capital and well maintenance activity in the second half of the year to a pace
that will bring the full-year investment to a level consistent with its plans. CRC expects that this higher activity level will
reduce its production decline rate in the second half of the year to bring the full-year decline to a range consistent with
its stated decline range. For 2016, CRC developed a dynamic capital program to align investments with projected
operating cash flow. The Company will monitor prices and cash flow throughout the year and retain flexibility to
increase investments in drilling and capital workovers, to the extent crude oil prices show sustained improvement,
while abiding by its financial covenants.
Hedging Update
CRC continues to opportunistically add hedges to protect its cash flow, margins and capital program and to maintain
liquidity. Currently, the Company has the following Brent-based crude oil and NYMEX-based natural gas hedges in
place:

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS
We define adjusted EBITDAX consistent with our credit facilities as earnings before interest expense; income taxes;
depreciation, depletion and amortization; exploration expense; and other non-cash, unusual and infrequent items. Our
management believes adjusted EBITDAX provides useful information in assessing our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows and is widely used by the industry and investment community. The amounts included in the
calculation of adjusted EBITDAX were computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
 
(GAAP). This measure is a material component of certain of our financial covenants under our credit facilities and is
provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with
GAAP. Certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a
company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of
depreciable and depletable assets. Adjusted EBITDAX should be read in conjunction with the information contained in
our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The following tables present a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures of net income / (loss) and net cash
 
provided by operating activities to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted EBITDAX:

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS
 
Our results of operations can include the effects of non-cash, unusual and infrequent transactions and events affecting
earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing, amount and frequency. Therefore, management uses a
measure called "adjusted net income / (loss)" and a measure it calls "adjusted general and administrative expense"
which exclude those items. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to disassociate items from management's
performance, but rather are meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing our performance
between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term.
Adjusted net income / (loss) and adjusted general and administrative expenses are not considered to be alternatives to
net income / (loss) and general and administrative expenses reported in accordance with GAAP.

 Total Barrels of Oil Equivalent (MBoe/d) (a)
 
  
 
 (a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on the equivalence of energy content between six Mcf of
natural gas and one Bbl of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence. The price of
 
natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and
has been similarly lower for a number of years. For example, for the six months ended June 30, 2016, the average
 
prices of Brent oil and NYMEX natural gas were $41.03 per Bbl and $2.02 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil-to-
gas price ratio of approximately 20 to 1.
