<p> The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 13/4, 
contains the findings and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food 
on his country visit to South Africa from 7 to 15 July 2011. The report first examines the 
state of food security in South Africa (sect. II) and the legal and policy framework guiding 
the efforts of the State (sect. III). It then outlines the content of a possible strategy for the 
full realization of the right to food that could ensure food availability (sect. IV) and access 
to food for all through appropriate social assistance programmes and income opportunities 
(sect. V). Such a strategy should also take into account the need to ensure that diets are 
adequate (sect. VI), and that the policies contributing to the right to food are sustainable in 
the long term (sect. VII).

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, conducted a 
mission to South Africa between 7 and 15 July 2011, at the invitation of the Government of 
South Africa. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur met with Ebrahim Ebrahim, 
Deputy Minister for International Relations and Cooperation; Gugile Nkwinti, Minister for 
Rural Development and Land Reform; Bathabile Dlamini, Minister for Social 
Development; Tina Joemat-Pettersson, Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; 
Lulama Xingwana, Minister for Women, Children and Persons with Disabilities; and 
Collins Chabane, Minister for Performance Monitoring, Evaluation and Administration. He 
also held meetings with the Departments for Trade and Industry, for Economic 
Development, and for Labour. He met with the then-Chief Justice of the Constitutional 
Court, the Honourable Justice Sandile Ngcobo; with the South African Human Rights 
Commission (SAHRC); with the Municipality of Johannesburg; and, in Durban, with the 
Municipality of eThekwini as well as with the authorities of the province of KwaZulu-
Natal. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his appreciation for the high level of 
cooperation extended to him by the Government and the various authorities he met.  
</p>
<p>2. Civil society organizations were consulted in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Durban. 
The Special Rapporteur also met with the United Nations agencies present in South Africa, 
as well as with academic experts. The mission included field visits to the informal 
settlement of Diepsloot in the Gauteng province and to the province of KwaZulu-Natal, 
where the Special Rapporteur visited a number of sites, including resettled communities 
around the area of Greytown. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for those who made 
possible these visits and consultations, which served to inform his views about the situation 
of the right to food in the country. 
</p>
<p>3. Since the abolition of apartheid in 1992&#8211;1994, South Africa has sought to move from 
an economic system that exclusively served the interests of the white minority, representing 
one tenth of the population, to a much more inclusive system that could reverse the injustices 
of the past and close the gap between the various groups composing society. This requires a 
broad-based development strategy that includes efforts towards the full realization of the right 
to food. The present report provides the building blocks for such a strategy.   
</p>
<p><b> II. The situation of food insecurity 
</b></p>
<p>4. South Africa still faces serious challenges in ensuring an adequate standard of living 
for its population. While overall economic growth has benefited many, others have been 
left behind, and inequality has increased since the end of apartheid. A rapid migration from 
rural areas into the cities in the context of high unemployment has resulted in the growth of 
informal peri-urban settlements where people live in situations of extreme poverty, such as 
Diepsloot on the outskirts of Johannesburg, where the Special Rapporteur met with 
residents during his mission. The situations of some of those who have remained in the 
rural areas remain equally desperate. 
</p>
<p>5. The proportion of people living in poverty declined during the first part of the 
decade, but this was reversed in 2008 when the poverty rate started deteriorating again 
against the backdrop of the national and international economic downturn.1 An estimated 
60 per cent of the population now live in income poverty, a very high level compared to

</p>
<p>other middle income countries. A total of 64 per cent of all children (11.9 million) live in 
families in income poverty (defined in 2008 as an income of less than R570), with 
significant disparities among regions, ranging from 36.7 per cent in Western Cape to 83.3 
per cent in Limpopo.2 Moreover, the poorest families have the largest number of children: 
an estimated 7 million children live in the poorest 20 per cent of households, compared to 
1.7 million in the richest 20 per cent.3 
</p>
<p>6. Inequality has deepened over the past decade, making South Africa today one of the 
most unequal societies in the world, with a Gini coefficient of 0.73 in 2006.4 Stark 
disparities in income remain between the South African white and black populations. In 
2006, the black African population constituted 79.4 per cent of the population but earned 
only 41.2 per cent of the national income, while the white 9.2 per cent of population earned 
45.3 per cent of the income.5 Poverty is also highly gendered, as female-headed households 
are generally much poorer than men.6 
</p>
<p>7. Certain segments of the population remain highly vulnerable to food insecurity. In 
2008, an estimated 20 per cent of South African households had inadequate or severely 
inadequate food access.7 A total of 32 per cent of children are hungry or are at risk of hunger 
in South Africa, although there are significant disparities among regions, ranging from 11.9 
per cent in Limpopo and 14.5 per cent in Western Cape to 33.5 per cent in Free State.8 
Women are also significantly more at risk than men,9 in part because of discrimination within 
households. Finally, a specific challenge facing the country is the impact of the spread of 
HIV/AIDS. South Africa, where one in eight children infected with AIDS worldwide lives, 
has the world&#8217;s highest incidence of HIV/AIDS, with a prevalence rate of 10.5 per cent (and 
17 per cent for adults aged 15&#8211;49 years).10 This has a significant effect on a person&#8217;s ability to 
access adequate food, since HIV/AIDS negatively affects access to employment and income. 
In addition, according to the World Health Organization, individuals living with HIV who are 
asymptomatic need to increase their energy intake by 10 per cent and symptomatic 
individuals need to increase their intake by 20 to 30 per cent.11 Moreover, malnourished 
individuals starting antiretroviral therapy are significantly more likely to die in a given period 
than well-nourished individuals.12 Therefore, HIV/AIDS contributes to food insecurity, and 
food insecurity in turn makes AIDS/HIV more deadly<i>.

<p>8. A large number of children experience chronic undernutrition in early childhood, 
seriously impairing their cognitive and physical development. One in five children are 
stunted as a result of chronic nutritional deprivation, while 1 in 10 children between 1 and 9

<p>years old are underweight,13 with the highest incidences of severe malnutrition in KwaZulu-
Natal (13.3 per cent), and the lowest in Limpopo (4.4 per cent).14 The two most recent 
national nutrition surveys carried out in South Africa (the 1999 and 2005 National Food 
Consumption Surveys) do not indicate any significant progress.  
</p>
<p>9. The province with the lowest level of children living in food insecurity (Limpopo) is 
also the province with the highest rate of children living in income poverty (83 per cent).15 
While this may be counter-intuitive, it illustrates the role of subsistence farming as a basic 
safety net: in Limpopo, with a population of about 5.4 million people (10.6 per cent of the 
total population), according to the 2007 Labour Force Survey, just under a million black 
Africans, 69 per cent of them women, are estimated to be involved in agriculture mainly for 
subsistence purposes.16 
</p>
<p>10. Methodologies, as well as definitions of hunger and food insecurity, differ among 
national surveys that monitor food insecurity, such as the General Household Survey (GHS) 
and the National Food Consumption Survey,17 and also within surveys over time. For 
example, the question used in the questionnaire to measure hunger in the GHS was changed 
considerably in 2009.18 Also, the GHS (2004 and 2005), the results of which were used in 
poverty estimations, reportedly substantially over- and underestimated the number of 
children in various categories. And there were contradictions between the various statistics 
compiled by the Government, non-governmental organizations and United Nations 
agencies.19 The mapping of food insecurity in the country therefore could be improved. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa guarantees the right of everyone to 
have access to sufficient food20 and to social security, including, if they are unable to 
support themselves and their dependents, appropriate social assistance.21 The Constitution 
further obliges the State to take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its 
available resources, to achieve the progressive realization of these rights. 
</p>
<p>12. However, while it has ratified a number of international human rights instruments 
that protect the right to food, South Africa has not ratified the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This is especially surprising since the Constitutional 
Court has developed an interpretation of the economic, social and cultural rights contained 
in the Constitution that is particularly progressive, and that is aligned with the standards of 
international human rights law in recognizing the justiciability of economic and social

<p>rights.22 The ratification of the Covenant would not impose on South Africa a burden it 
could not meet, since the interpretation of the Covenant takes into account the resource 
constraints faced by States. But it would allow the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights to address recommendations to the Government, based on good practices 
developed elsewhere, and thus help improve its progress towards the full realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>13. South Africa has various strategies and policies for realizing the right to food. The 
Integrated Food Security Strategy 2002 (IFSS) is intended &#8213;to attain universal physical, 
social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food by all South Africans at 
all times to meet their dietary and food preferences for an active and healthy life&#8214; (p. 6). 
The Strategy focuses on household food security in the rural areas, but also considers urban 
and peri-urban areas. It is aimed at: (a) increasing household production and trading; (b) 
improving income generation and job creation opportunities; (c) improving nutrition and 
food safety; and (d) increasing safety nets and food emergency management systems.  
</p>
<p>14. The Zero Hunger programme (2009) addresses the first pillar of the IFSS, which is 
to increase food production and trade. It is aimed at improving collaboration among 
national, provincial and non-governmental organizations as well as coordination of their 
inputs and resources to increase household food security and rural development; ensuring 
the establishment of effective support structures for farmers through capacity-building and 
the institutional strengthening for their improved participation; and encouraging the 
diversification of incomes through the production of vegetables, small stock and small-
scale aquaculture. A positive component of the Zero Hunger programme is the proactive 
posture it has adopted to send public civil servants to communities to identify households 
vulnerable to food insecurity.  
</p>
<p>15. The most recent document related to the right to food produced by the Government 
is the medium-term strategic framework for 2009&#8211;2014, entitled <i>Together Doing More and 
Better</i>. The document elaborates five strategic objectives, including to halve poverty and 
unemployment by 2014 (para. 10). Priority areas were identified to give effect to the above 
strategic objectives: (a) more inclusive economic growth, decent work and sustainable 
livelihoods; (b) economic and social infrastructure; (c) rural development, food security and 
land reform; (d) access to quality education; (e) improved health care; (f) the fight against 
crime and corruption; (g) cohesive and sustainable communities; (h) the creation of a better 
Africa and a better world; (i) sustainable resource management and use; and (j) a 
developmental State, including improvement of public services (para. 11). The Government 
has adopted 12 outcomes that collectively address the priority areas. Each outcome has a 
number of outputs and targets for measuring performance. The outcomes do not impose 
legal obligations, but they enable the President to direct ministerial work and coordinate 
interdepartmental action in the key priority areas of Government.23 In April 2010, the 
President signed performance agreements with all Cabinet Ministers, requiring that

</p>
<p>implementation forums and delivery agreements be set for each of the 12 outcomes, 
involving all departments, agencies and spheres of Government in implementation.24 
</p>
<p>16. Outcome 7 is defined as &#8213;vibrant, equitable and sustainable rural communities and 
food security for all&#8214;.25 The outcome 7 delivery agreement frames food security policy by 
addressing food availability, accessibility, utilization and affordability. It sets out the key 
work to be completed before 2014 as well as long-term targets for improving food security 
by identifying the specific activities particular departments must undertake to reach the 
outlined goals. One strength of this document is its multidimensional and interdepartmental 
approach to food security; it identifies the coordinating governmental department, core 
departments and key stakeholders for each output, thereby clearly delineating responsibility 
for the implementation of each activity. 
</p>
<p>17. The outcome 7 delivery agreement, however, has not yet specified or confirmed all 
targets.26 It also focuses predominantly on food security for rural populations, despite 
recognizing the universal rise in food prices and acknowledging that &#8213;the risks of increased 
food security may be more pronounced in urban and peri-urban areas, where people rely 
exclusively on purchasing their food&#8214;.27 Almost two-thirds of South Africans live in cities 
and an average of 70 per cent of the poor in Cape Town, Msunduzi and Johannesburg 
experience food insecurity.28 Nevertheless, it should be recognized that the majority of 
black South Africans have binding ties with the rural areas, and that rural areas suffered 
marginalization during the apartheid era along with the attendant social ills. 
</p>
<p>18. The Government has committed to ensuring the achievement of the outcomes 
through the establishment of the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation 
(DPME) within the Presidency.29 DPME collaborates with other departments and spheres of 
government to ensure that progress against the targets is monitored on the basis of 
measuring the indicators. Where progress is unsatisfactory, the Department identifies 
improvements to be made. While DMPE ensures monitoring and evaluation across all 
spheres of government, it is not independent from the Government. Rather it is responsible 
for assisting Government to focus and perform better in relation to the 12 outcomes; for 
identifying problems in a timely manner; and for assisting departments to overcome them.  
</p>
<p>19. These various strategies and policies demonstrate the commitment of the Government 
towards improving food security. However, commitments should translate into concrete 
action. Tremendous disparities in food security persist, linked strongly to inequality in terms 
of geography, gender and race. In order to overcome these disparities, the various strategies 
and policies, in particular the Outcomes Approach, should be strengthened by adopting a 
rights-based approach, as elaborated in the recommendations section of the present report.

<p><b> IV. Food availability: reforming the agricultural sector 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Three worlds of farming 
</b></p>
<p>20. The agriculture of South Africa is best described today as a three-tiered sector. First, 
an estimated 35,000 large-scale commercial farmers, predominantly of white origin, own 
farms with an average size of 2,500 hectares, according to Agri South Africa (Agri SA).30 
These farmers produce 95 per cent of all marketed outputs. They collectively occupied 87 
per cent of the agricultural land in 2003,31 and there is no indication that this figure has 
significantly changed since then. Since 1994 a second category of farmers has materialized, 
composed of approximately 200,000 black &#8213;emerging&#8214; farmers. These black entrepreneurs 
have benefited from post-1994 opportunities and public support such as agrarian reform 
and Black Economic Empowerment policies. The third category is composed of over 2.5 
million households, most in the former homelands, which practice small-scale subsistence 
farming, predominantly as an activity complementing other types of income sources, such 
as temporary work-related migration, social grants, off-farm employment, remittances from 
relatives living in urban areas, and other subsidiary livelihoods strategies such as, in certain 
regions, hunting and collecting edible plants.32 While subsistence farming is restricted to 
very small gardens providing only 5 per cent of the household income, it can provide poor 
households in some villages with savings equivalent to up to 3 months of income.33 In 
addition to these three categories, 652,000 farmworkers, and a much wider number of 
labour tenants and farm dwellers, also rely partly or completely on agriculture for their 
livelihoods. All in all, it is estimated that 6 million people depend on agriculture for their 
livelihoods.34 Agriculture accounts for only 10 per cent of total reported employment,35 
although 41 per cent of the total population lives in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>21. The main challenge facing South Africa is how to bridge the gap between these 
different worlds of farming. Land reform was seen as key in this regard, since a very 
unequal distribution of land was one of the most important legacies of apartheid: in 1994, 
87 per cent of the farmland was in the hands of 65,000 large white commercial farmers. 
Land reform has three components, including restitution of land to communities evicted 
during and prior to the apartheid era. Under the Restitution of Land Rights Act (Act No. 22 
of 1994), communities dispossessed of their land after 1913 can file a claim with the Land 
Claims Commission; the Government then pays the current occupier the market price for 
the land, which is given back to the communities concerned. A number of the communities 
have chosen financial compensation instead of taking possession of the land. The land 
reform programme also includes a land redistribution scheme, through which the 
Government buys land from large commercial farmers in order to provide land to 
disadvantaged individuals. Finally, it includes a grants programme, which allows

<p>disadvantaged individuals to acquire land. These programmes are based on the &#8213;willing 
</p>
<p>seller, willing buyer&#8214; principle that follows from the constitutional protection of the right to 
property; this has contributed, to a certain extent, to inflated prices for farmland, 
particularly during the past decade. 
</p>
<p>22. The stated policy aim of the Government is still to redistribute, by 2014, 30 per cent 
of the land held by white commercial farmers. However, this objective will not be 
achieved: it is estimated that 6.8 per cent of the land held by white commercial farmers has 
been transferred to black farmers or communities since 1994 (including 3.7 per cent 
through restitution), and of this land, almost 2 per cent has been returned to the former 
owners or to other white commercial farmers. Redistribution of land is thus proceeding at a 
very slow pace and, in fact, as a number of white commercial farmers have left farming 
since 1994 without being replaced, land concentration has increased since that period: while 
the total area controlled by white commercial farmers has remained almost unchanged, the 
number of white commercial farmers has almost halved. Even more striking, the 
Government has failed to provide adequate post-settlement support for the beneficiaries of 
land reform. The result has been that the vast majority of these beneficiaries have not been 
able to use the land productively. Many have been relegated to subsistence agriculture. 
Some have resold the land they received, or have leased it back to large landowners.  
</p>
<p>23. This failure illustrates what the Special Rapporteur emphasized in a report to the 
General Assembly on access to land: in agrarian reform schemes, a significant portion of 
the resources should go to supporting the beneficiaries in order to allow them to use the 
land productively, or else the reform will fail to improve livelihoods sustainably (A/65/281, 
para. 38). South Africa must make a clear choice: either it wishes to pursue land reform, 
and it must then accept the responsibility of providing effective support to its beneficiaries; 
or it must redefine its priorities, and provide the disadvantaged and landless blacks with 
alternative livelihood options. The current stated Proactive Land Acquisition Strategy of the 
Department of Rural Development and Land Reform is to buy land on the market and to 
lease it out to candidate black farmers for a limited period, at the end of which the ability 
for the lessee to use the land productively is to be assessed. While certainly a step in the 
right direction, this new strategy is not as such an answer to the question of capacity-
building. Individuals without or with only little experience require many years to become 
productive farmers. And they need what the State has to a large extent not delivered: 
adequate support, and access to hospitable markets. 
</p>
<p>24. The first substantial increase to post-settlement support  occurred in 2003 with the 
launch of the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP), aimed at providing 
post-settlement support to beneficiaries of the land reform programme; the Programme had 
a budget of US$ 119 million for 2010/2011. Improving the livelihoods of millions of rural 
households will require improved access to credit, skills, infrastructure and markets. But 
lack of human capacity, even more so than budget constraints, is an important obstacle. 
Coordination between the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform and the 
Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is still weak. For a viable small-scale 
farming sector to emerge, strong political will is required, and there will be a need to 
provide this sector with specific support, as current policies and the structure of the 
agricultural markets are shaped for the benefit, essentially, of the large-scale commercial 
sector.  
</p>
<p>25. While efforts are being made in this direction, the current policies are, for the most 
part, not targeting&#8212;or are failing to reach&#8212;those who have the greatest need for support. 
For instance, there is no cap on the amount one beneficiary can obtain from CASP, and 
provincial administration officers apparently tend to focus on a few large entrepreneurial </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>projects (such as large broiler units) because of the difficulties involved in trying to reach a 
large number of small producers, often located in remote areas.36 The benefits of the 
programme are unevenly distributed: the number of beneficiaries has constantly decreased 
since 2006/7, and while 50&#8211;200 households receive R500,000 or more, 35,000 receive 
R17,000, and 2.3 million are almost entirely left out.37 This mismatch is also illustrated by 
the fact that the most widespread product of the Micro-Agricultural Financial Institutions of 
South Africa is a &#8213;production loan&#8214; of US$ 13,500 at an interest rate of 8 per cent, which 
has mostly been used to develop broiler poultry, pig or ostrich production units&#8212;projects 
that tend to be operated by entrepreneur farmers, and not small-scale farmers. While CASP 
represents only an estimated 15 per cent of total agricultural support,38 and while other 
programmes, such as the Household Food Production Programme&#8212;implementing the &#8213;one 
home, one garden&#8214; principle of the Zero Hunger programme&#8212;have a more equitable 
distribution, one cannot but be struck by the mismatch between CASP and the primary 
IFSS objective of overcoming rural food insecurity by improving the participation of 
vulnerable households in &#8213;food production, trade and distribution&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>26. It is therefore unsurprising that the vast majority of the beneficiaries of land reform 
programmes remain trapped in a situation of dependency on social grants, remittances from 
relatives and temporary work-related migration. The support they receive is insufficient to 
enable the beginning of a dynamic of rural development that would improve their 
livelihoods, including household food security. Improving access to markets for small-scale 
farmers must be a priority. Efforts are being devoted to improve rural infrastructures, 
especially rural roads through the Expanded Public Works Programme. In addition, 
extension services should enhance the agricultural and marketing skills of small-scale 
farmers. Their access to credit and to information on prices, as well as their ability to cope 
with sanitary and phytosanitary barriers and quality standards, should all be improved.39 
However, while extension services have a key role in this regard, South Africa had only 
2,152 agricultural extension officers in 2008, which means that each officer is supposed to 
provide advice to 878 farmers.40 Current efforts to improve extension services, including 
through the Extension Recovery Plan of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries, should slightly increase the ratio of extension officers to farmers, and at the same 
time improve the quality of the advice given to farmers, thanks to a genuine commitment to 
train extension officers.  
</p>
<p><b> B. A rights-based approach to agricultural support schemes 
</b></p>
<p>27. The efforts of the Government to improve the quality of the support given to farmers 
could benefit from two important shifts. First, there is a need to adopt a more rights-based 
approach to the agricultural programmes in place. This means favouring the participation of 
the most vulnerable groups in the design of such policies; focusing policies on the needs of 
the most vulnerable groups; defining the beneficiaries as rights holders who can claim 
certain services from the Government, which in turn incurs obligations towards such rights

</p>
<p>holders. This improves the responsiveness of the policies to the real needs of the 
beneficiaries&#8212;moving towards a more bottom-up approach to agricultural support&#8212;as well 
as their ability to deliver results.  
</p>
<p>28. A rights-based approach requires that the gender dimension be adequately integrated 
in agricultural policies. Female-headed households are more likely to grow food for home 
consumption than are male-headed households.41 Yet, rural women appear to face particular 
obstacles, and it cannot be presumed that programmes intended to benefit all farmers will 
benefit women as much as others. For instance, women face cultural obstacles in their 
interactions with predominantly male extension-service officers who, moreover, may not 
belong to the same community as theirs, and they face even greater obstacles than men in 
access to credit, because of their difficulty to prove their ownership of land. Therefore, a 
gender-sensitive approach should be adopted in all agricultural programmes.  
</p>
<p>29. A rights-based approach also means prioritizing vulnerable groups in governmental 
programmes and policies, and thus in public spending. While the Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges the fact that, as underlined by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries, an adequate distribution of resources towards the targeted beneficiaries creates a 
serious administrative challenge, political will and adequate monitoring should support this 
effort. Public resources could for instance better focus on the 12 districts that have 
relatively high concentrations of black farmers and of land reform beneficiaries, as 
suggested in the Decentralized Small-Scale Farmer Strategy which has been proposed as 
part of the Programme to Support Pro-Poor Policy Development.42  
</p>
<p><b> C. Making markets more hospitable to small-scale farmers 
</b></p>
<p>30. The newly established black farmers are small-scale farmers, with poor access to 
markets, a lack of marketing skills, and a weaker bargaining position in the food chains. 
The food systems could and should be made to work better for this group of farmers. Three 
directions could be explored.  
</p>
<p>31. First, the Competition Act (No. 89 of 1998 as amended by Act No. 35 of 1999) 
provides that Competition Law should aim &#8213;(c) to provide employment and advance the 
</p>
<p>social and economic welfare of South Africans&#8230; (e) to ensure that small and medium-sized 
enterprises have an equitable opportunity to participate in the economy; and (f) to promote 
a greater spread of ownership, in particular to increase the ownership stakes of historically 
disadvantaged persons&#8214; (sect. 2). The Competition Commission could be encouraged to 
contribute further to addressing the imbalances in the food chain, not only by ensuring that 
the levels of concentration remain within acceptable limits, but also by protecting small 
food producers from the abuse of buyer power. It may be recalled in this regard that 
excessive buyer power can result not only from excessive concentration at certain segments 
of the food chain and in certain markets, but also from the concrete obstacles that small 
farmers may face in reaching markets, when they are in remote areas with poor 
communication routes to the urban centres and face buyers that are in a quasi-
monopsonistic position&#8212;in effect, the gatekeepers through which farmers must pass in 
order to reach consumers. The Competition Commission could also play a role in ensuring 
that high degrees of concentration, or the acquisition of dominant positions, be paired with 
an obligation to source from local and small-scale producers, as was discussed during the 
2011 takeover of Massmart by Wal-Mart.

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>32. Second, incentives could be developed to encourage the large commercial farmers to 
support emerging farmers&#8212;for instance by providing them with technical advice or by 
allowing them to benefit from their access to markets and relationships with buyers. The 2008 
Transformation Charter for Agriculture43 partly fulfils this function, as it encourages the 
establishment of a mentorship programme to accelerate the transferring of skills to new black 
entrants.44 But the AgriBEE Charter seems to have had limited impacts in that respect. 
Incentives, including fiscal incentives, could be strengthened to further support this process. 
The Special Rapporteur would also welcome the establishment of a permanent forum to 
encourage chain-wide learning of good practices in order to move towards food chains that 
are more inclusive. One encouraging development in this regard is that, at the time of the 
mission, SAHRC expressed its intention to set up an advisory committee45 that could deepen 
the work launched through the Southern Africa Food Security Change Lab, linking the 
various actors of the chain in the search for innovative solutions that could improve the 
sustainability of the food chains. This initiative could be further supported, and the further 
institutionalization of this dialogue could form part of a new framework law on the right to 
food.  
</p>
<p>33. Third, sourcing policies could serve to improve the access to markets for the benefit 
of small-scale farmers. The Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act (No. 5 of 
2000) already provides that public bodies may include among the specific goals of their 
procurement policies &#8213;contracting with persons, or categories of persons, historically 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged by unfair discrimination on the basis of race, gender or disability&#8214; (sect. 2 
(d) (i)). The Act could be further improved to allow for preferential treatment in favour of 
small-scale farmers, for instance for school-feeding or food relief programmes. Similarly, 
the private sector could be given incentives to source from local, small-scale farmers. This 
could be done gradually, with the proportion of sourcing from small-scale farmers rising 
over a number of years, in order to allow the sector to build up its capacity to meet demand.  
</p>
<p>34. Fourth, the State could stimulate the creation of food chains benefitting small-scale 
farmers by establishing cooperatives of small-scale farmers and by supporting the 
establishment of locally owned industries that transform agricultural products. The support 
programme for micro-mills is an example in this regard, as it is aimed at creating 
employment in rural areas and reducing concentration in the milling sector. It is also 
estimated that the project could achieve a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in costs, including 
through a decentralization of the storage capacity, which will reduce transport costs.  
</p>
<p>35. These various tools could be seen as part of a broader process of rebuilding the local 
food markets, which are generally more accessible to small-scale farmers than the larger 
export markets and improve access to fresh and nutritious food for urban consumers.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Food accessibility: protecting access to food for the poorest  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Social assistance 
</b></p>
<p>36.  The right to food requires that food be accessible&#8212;both physically and 
economically. Physical accessibility means that food should be accessible to all people, 
including the physically vulnerable, such as children, older persons or persons with 
</p>
<p>

</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>disabilities. Economic accessibility means that food must be affordable without 
compromising other basic needs, such as education fees, medical care or housing. 
</p>
<p>37. Social assistance grants are one way in which the Government ensures the 
constitutional guarantee to social security and to the right to food, particularly for those 
who need to purchase their food. The IFSS addresses food accessibility, in particular 
through pillar 4 on enhancing safety nets and food-emergency management systems. The 
main initiative is a national comprehensive social assistance programme grounded in the 
Social Assistance Act (No. 13 of 2004) and its various amendments.  
</p>
<p>38. The Social Assistance Act provides a national legislative framework for the 
provision of different types of social assistance grants, crisis intervention in the form of 
social relief of distress and the establishment of an inspectorate for social assistance. The 
South African Social Security Agency Act (No. 9 of 2004) provides for the effective 
management, administration and payment of social security and services through the 
establishment of the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA). SASSA is 
responsible for the administration of the social assistance programme. Additionally, it is 
charged with providing assistance to all grant applicants to help them understand and 
exercise their rights to social security; to provide beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries 
with information about grants; and to investigate any irregularities relating to grants.  
</p>
<p>39. Social security includes both social insurance (contributory schemes) and social 
assistance (non-contributory schemes). The Unemployment Insurance Fund and Workmen&#8217;s 
Compensation Fund comprise the contributory schemes and fall within the remit of the 
Department of Labour. The non-contributory schemes include the child support grant 
(currently for children up to 6 years of age, after 2012 for all children under 18), the foster-
child grant, the care-dependency grant, the older persons grant, the disability grant, grant-in-
aid and social relief of distress. An income-based means test is used to determine eligibility 
for each grant. The budget for the 2010&#8211;2011 social assistance programme is US$ 12 billion, 
with an additional US$ 69 million for the social relief from distress.46 The funds allocated to 
the social relief of distress increased from US $1.9 million in November 2008 to 
US$8 million in January 2009 and to US$ 69 million by 2011,47 underscoring the impact of 
the global economic and financial crises on South African households.  
</p>
<p>40. In 2010, approximately 15 million people benefited from the cash-transfer programme, 
representing 30 per cent of the total population. Of the 15 million beneficiaries, 10 million 
received the child support grant, 3 million people benefited from the older persons grant, 1 
million received the disability grant and 500,000 people received the foster-care grant. The 
reach of the cash-transfer programme highlights the profound poverty affecting South Africa 
today, although the country has successfully achieved millennium development goal 1 on 
halving the number of people living in extreme poverty.48 
</p>
<p>41. The social assistance programme is the Government&#8217;s main initiative for tackling 
poverty and inequality-related issues. It is aimed at: (a) immediately reducing poverty 
among groups that are not expected to fully participate in the labour market and thus are 
vulnerable to low income (older persons, children, and persons with disabilities); and (b) 
increasing investment in health, education and nutrition.  
</p>
<p>42. The Department of Social Development runs the National Food Relief Programme, 
which covers the provision of food parcels to the most vulnerable people to alleviate 
poverty. The national budget for this programme was R160 million in 2011. The target

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries are poor households spending less than R300 per month for food; vulnerable 
children and child-headed households; orphaned children; persons with disabilities; female-
headed households with insufficient/no income; and people living with HIV/AIDS and 
affected households. The food parcels distributed under this programme vary, but include 
fortified staple foods. Although the National Food Relief Programme is aimed at increasing 
food security, the scope and number of beneficiaries is unknown. This is in part due to the 
decentralized nature of the programme, which is administered through the provinces. 
Moreover, vulnerable groups are already covered by the various cash-transfer grants, and in 
general people cannot benefit from multiple grants.  
</p>
<p>43. The success of the South African social assistance scheme is a point of reference for 
many other countries. However, although the social assistance programme has been 
expanded to reach more people, protection gaps remain.49 
</p>
<p>44. A first gap is that lower than average levels of take-up rates in poorer and more rural 
areas have been documented despite eligibility, particularly in the provinces of KwaZulu-
Natal and Eastern Cape. While as many as 90 per cent of the people would be eligible for 
support in some rural areas, the take-up rates are much lower.50 Additionally, the younger 
the children in these rural areas, the greater the risk that they will not access the child 
support grants. A national study commissioned by the Department of Social Development 
in 2008 found widespread evidence of caregivers, especially in rural areas, not accessing 
the child support grant for their children until the fourth quarter of their first year. In 2009, 
at the national level, only 38 per cent of children under the age of one were receiving the 
child support grant, although about 60 per cent of children in this age group qualified for 
the grant.51 This points to the lack of information available to potential beneficiaries. The 
Department of Social Development is working to address this problem by establishing more 
SASSA offices throughout the country, deploying mobile trucks to reach more rural areas, 
and convening public meetings to provide information.  
</p>
<p>45. Second, individuals between the ages of 18 to 59 who are ineligible for one of the 
existing cash transfer grants are not covered by any social assistance scheme.  
</p>
<p>46. Third, the Expanded Public Works Programme could be developed into an 
entitlements-based scheme. With a budget of US$ 54 million for 2010/2011, the 
Programme proposes jobs in the areas of, inter alia, infrastructure building, environmental 
or social services, and community works that allow workers to reach out to the poorest 
communities and to identify the barriers that they face in having access to social services 
and in benefiting from social programmes. Five years after its inauguration in 2004, the 
Programme had led to the initiation of 16,869 projects and created about 600,000 work 
opportunities at an average daily wage of US$ 8.90, essentially in the rural provinces of 
Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State. In conformity with the stated objectives of the 
Programme, the main beneficiaries were women (53 per cent), young people (51 per cent) 
and people with disabilities (1.7 per cent). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Promoting household food gardens and urban agriculture</b>  
</p>
<p>47. An original part of the Zero Hunger programme is the Household Food Production 
Programme, better known as the One Home, One Garden programme. This has had proven 
effects on reducing food insecurity by ensuring the direct provision of nutritious food 
</p>
<p>  
 49 See SAHRC, <i>7th Report</i> (footnote 19 above).

</p>
<p>products, thus cushioning the poorest households against economic shocks. By May 2008, 
15,765 food-production packages had already been distributed and 6,390 vegetable gardens 
established.52 However, at this stage of the strategy&#8217;s implementation, the question arises as 
to how the scarce public resources and human capacity can be used to maximize its 
effectiveness. There are indications that collective solutions such as communal (rather than 
individual) gardens are more cost-effective and easier to support; a review of the existing 
Household Food Production Programme could take into account the need to make optimal 
use of resources available. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur has been particularly impressed by the strategy and 
programmes put in place by the City of Durban/eThekwini Municipality, which launched in 
2009 a peri-urban agroecology strategy. The City of Durban&#8217;s strategy&#8212;the Agroecology 
Delivery Model&#8212;aligns with the eThekwini policies to focus on poverty and 
unemployment, and it provides an excellent illustration of a set of policies recommended by 
the Special Rapporteur in a report on agroecology presented to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/16/49). The City of Durban surveyed 800 gardens and their needs, then mapped 
approximately 3,000 gardens through reviews of aerial photos. If adequately supported by 
public authorities, these gardens could progressively create 60,000 job opportunities.53 The 
area, which is home to 3.5 million people, has been divided into four agricultural zones, 
taking into account road access and farmer-association areas. Six agricultural support hubs 
have been established or are under development, including demonstration sites showcasing 
agroecology techniques, a research and development centre on agroecology, training sites, a 
packing and marketing hub, and a future seed bank.  
</p>
<p>49. The potential of under-used urban and peri-urban land for subsistence-level 
gardening, community-based market gardening and small-scale livestock farming in the 
former homeland towns of South Africa is well known.54 These community-based 
developments face obstacles, however, mainly related to security of land tenure.55 Indeed, 
even if poor black residents have the financial means, Government programmes, 
development planning and environmental regulations, and the current land and housing 
markets are major obstacles to the implementation of their ventures. Resistance from 
municipalities and prospective neighbours to low-income settlements is probably one of the 
first obstacles to overcome.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The situation of farmworkers, tenant labourers and farm dwellers  
</b></p>
<p>50. Farmworkers (totalling 652,000 individuals) are particularly vulnerable, because of 
the low rate of unionization (estimated at perhaps 2 per cent) and increased casualization of 
labour on farms, and because of the high degree of dependency of these workers on the 
farmer who employs them. The Labour Relations Act (No. 66 of 1995) and the Basic 
Conditions of Employment Act (No. 75 of 1997) both apply to farmworkers, a minimum 
wage exists (set in this sector at R1,300 by the relevant employment conditions 
commission), and sectoral determinations define elements such as standards for 
accommodation and the allowable level of deduction from salaries for the payment of 
services provided by the employer or the repayment of debts to the employer. But there are

</p>
<p>serious problems of enforcement, attributable not only to the lack of organization of these 
workers, but also to the limited capacity of the labour inspectorates (approximately 1,000 
labour inspectors cover the whole territory, for all sectors), and to the difficulty of 
performing unannounced inspections on farms located in remote areas.56 In addition, 
whereas hired migrant workers are especially vulnerable to abuse, these workers have few 
incentives to report abuses, since they fear being expelled from the territory and since it is 
difficult for them to find employment outside the informal sector. It is therefore welcome 
that the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries organized a summit on this issue 
in July 2010 and that a ministerial delivery forum was established as a result. These efforts 
should be pursued. 
</p>
<p>51. One major problem faced by South Africa concerns the lack of security of tenure for 
farm dwellers and labour tenants. While the Extension of Security of Tenure Act (No. 62 of 
1997) was intended to protect tenant labourers from the risk of being evicted, an unintended 
consequence of this legislation resulted in employers reducing the quality of the facilities 
on the farm, including housing, and switching to employment contracts, leading to what 
SAHRC has called &#8213;pre-emptive evictions&#8214;. SAHRC also noted that the claims of tenant 
labourers against the evictions they had been subjected to had not been handled with the 
required diligence, and that the almost exclusive focus of the legislation on the question of 
tenure security has led to a neglect of the need to protect tenant labourers with regards to 
their access to basic health, housing and education services on the farm.57 
</p>
<p>52. In part in order to address these concerns, the land tenure security bill was proposed 
in November 2010. At the time of the mission, a public consultation had been completed on 
the bill, and this new draft legislation was to be discussed in Parliament. It would replace 
both the Extension of Security of Tenure Act and the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act 
(No. 3 of 1996). Because the current bill still is subject to amendments, it would be 
premature to provide a detailed comment. However, the Special Rapporteur observes that 
the version of the bill issued by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform on 
23 December 2010 does not provide the security of tenure that is its object to strengthen. 
When asked to grant an order of eviction at the request of the owner, courts are directed to 
&#8213;have regard to (a) the reason for the proposed eviction; and (b) the fairness of the terms of 
any agreement between the parties&#8214; (art. 24, para. 3). This is too vague to provide the 
requisite security of tenure to the farm dwellers, and because it makes no reference to 
length of the time during which a particular farm dweller has been residing on the farm, it is 
inequitable for those who have no other livelihood options outside the farm. The Special 
Rapporteur is also concerned that the definition of persons &#8213;associated with persons 
residing or working on farms&#8214; in article 9 of the bill refers to the children of these persons 
only until they have reached the age of 18, which implies in theory that once they reach that 
age, these relatives could be forced to leave the farm, although they may have no other 
place to reside.

<p><b> D. Evictions in the mining sector 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that mining projects have often led 
communities to be displaced from their land, in conditions that may not always comply 
with the standards of international human rights law.58 
</p>
<p>54. The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2) and the 
basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement 
(A/HRC/4/18, annex I) define the standards applicable to evictions. In assessing whether or 
not displacement can be justified, States must adequately assess the impact on affected 
communities, and be able to justify any negative impacts in terms of compelling and 
overriding public interests and adequately explore alternatives that could minimize such 
negative impacts. States must also ensure that all potentially affected persons are fully 
consulted and, in cases of resettlement, are provided with fair compensation and not 
deprived of their sources of livelihood. Thus, persons who are resettled should be 
compensated with land commensurate in quality, size and value, or better. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Food adequacy: managing nutrition transition 
</b></p>
<p>55. South Africa, like many other middle-income countries today, is experiencing what 
is referred to as a &#8213;nutrition transition&#8214;, characterized by a shift to more processed foods, 
generally higher in saturated fats, sugars and salt, and to diets low in fruits and vegetables.59 
The supermarketization of the food system in South Africa played a role in this evolution, 
as well as advertising by agrifood companies: 9.5 per cent of all money spent on advertising 
in South Africa in 2007 was for food and beverages, and Unilever, the food and household 
goods manufacturer, is the top advertising spender in the country.60 In addition, changes in 
lifestyle and urbanization result in less physical activity and less time spent cooking in 
homes. This results in high levels of overweight and obesity in the population, combined 
with increasing incidence of micronutrient deficiencies. According to the 2005 National 
Food Consumption survey, a total of 51.5 per cent of women (15&#8211;49 years) were 
overweight or obese. The overall prevalence of overweight (BMI &gt;25) and obesity (BMI 
&gt;30) in South Africa is very high today according to regional standards, with more than 29 
per cent of men and 56 per cent of women being classified as overweight or obese. 
</p>
<p>56. South Africa already has very progressive laws on labelling of foods that should 
improve the ability for the consumer to make informed choices. In addition, in line with the 
World Health Organization&#8217;s 2004 Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, 
South Africa was preparing at the time of the mission a new implementation framework on 
obesity, physical activity and health. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this development. 
In his view, this strategy is fully complementary with the rebuilding of local food systems 
and the strengthening of links between local small-scale producers and urban consumers. 
</p>
<p>  
 58 A recent study found that thousands of poor people in rural areas had lost agricultural land&#8212;their 
</p>
<p>main means of livelihood&#8212;due to platinum mining activities and were generally offered little 
compensation and insufficient ways of making an alternative living. See Action Aid, <i>Precious Metal: 
The Impact of Anglo Platinum on Poor Communities in Limpopo, South Africa</i> (Johannesburg, 2008).

<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>Indeed, in a holistic perspective&#8212;focusing not only on informing consumers&#8217; choices but 
also on transforming the obesogenic environment&#8212;the Government could consider as part 
of the strategy educational campaigns to encourage continued reliance on traditional diets, 
combined with appropriate levels of physical activity. While traditional diets (particularly 
the maize porridge pap) are not necessarily balanced and should include a wide variety of 
foods, the commercially available maize meal that is fortified in South Africa, combined 
with traditional vegetables such as sweet potato, pumpkin, butternut, squash, onion, tomato, 
cabbage and imifino (a wild leafy green vegetable), present many advantages over the 
Western diet.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Sustainability: integrating the long term 
</b></p>
<p>57. Because it is on the frontline of climate change, South Africa should support the 
ability of its emerging small-scale farmers to cope with the combined effects of climate 
change and resource scarcity. As shown elsewhere by the Special Rapporteur 
(A/HRC/16/49), the Green Revolution model (based on a technology package consisting of 
improved seeds and chemical fertilizers) may not be the best suited to the poorest farmers 
working in the most difficult environments. The provincial government of Eastern Cape 
reached the same conclusion when assessing its Siyakhula/Massive Food Production 
Programme: public action, they concluded, should focus on agricultural models that do not 
use costly inputs and should not require beneficiaries of land reform programmes to 
implement business plans replicating the model of large-scale farming (the less the farmers 
respected the business plan and the more they relied on indigenous practices, including 
water harvesting techniques, the more likely they were to avoid failure).61  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Extension Recovery Plan, which should not 
only increase the number of extension personnel by 50 per cent, but also train the current 
personnel, as only 19.8 per cent of the 2,210 personnel are qualified to operate as 
agricultural advisors. He further notes that South Africa has an advantage, in that it is home 
to a number of civil society organizations that, and academics who, are well-experienced in 
agroecology. Indeed, several South African organizations, such as the Surplus People 
Project, the Association for Rural Advancement or farmer support groups established by 
universities, have already launched pilot projects and established contacts with pioneer 
countries in this area.62 Insights from these organizations and experiences could be very 
useful for accelerating the transition towards sustainable and productive agricultural 
systems, as well as for improving the efficiency of extension services. Researchers and 
well-trained agricultural advisors could support farmer-led processes, which could seek 
inspiration from well-known examples such as the Campesino a Campesino movement in 
Latin America. The potential to leverage the Expanded Public Works Programme to 
stimulate this transition towards sustainable agricultural systems is also significant: by 
April 2009, there were only 134 agriculture-related projects under the Programme out of a 
total of 16,869 projects.63

</p>
<p><b>the right to adequate food. He makes the following recommendations to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of South Africa: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Improve and streamline the collection of data on food security, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitor progress over time and inform policymaking;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Strengthen existing strategies and policies that relate to food security, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular the Outcomes Approach, by adopting a rights-based approach. This means 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the setting of targets and the identification of the concrete measures to be adopted 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be the result of meaningful public participation; that the authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible for implementation should be held accountable for results; that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>beneficiaries of all policies and programmes related to food security should be defined 
</b></p>
<p><b>as rights holders, and that the indicators allowing the measurement of progress should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be based on the normative components of the right to food, including non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination. To ensure accountability, independent monitoring is required of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government plans. This could be entrusted to the South African Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission. Additionally, ring fencing of resources is required to ensure sustainable 
</b></p>
<p><b>funding of these plans. Until these different conditions are met, the various strategies 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopted by the Government may remain ineffective, since there will be no sanction 
</b></p>
<p><b>associated with a failure to deliver;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Pursue and accelerate the creation of comprehensive rural development 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies, including agricultural policies, which would progressively improve the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to food of vulnerable groups. Priority should go to long-term structural changes 
</b></p>
<p><b>supportive of poor households, rather than only to the satisfaction of immediate, 
</b></p>
<p><b>short-term needs. In particular:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Beneficiaries of land reform should receive adequate post-settlement 
</b></p>
<p><b>support for 5 to 10 years, including access to funding, credit and training;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (ii) The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries could better 
</b></p>
<p><b>target beneficiaries of its programmes and prioritize vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>identified by the Integrated Food Security Strategy, focusing initially on the 12 
</b></p>
<p><b>districts that have relatively high concentrations of black farmers and of land 
</b></p>
<p><b>reform beneficiaries; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (iii) Access to markets should be improved for small-scale farmers who aim 
</b></p>
<p><b>to produce and sell surpluses, and the food chains should be made more 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive, while abuse of buyer power should be addressed by the Competition 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (iv) The establishment of cooperatives should be supported, as such 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperatives reduce transaction costs and facilitate access to markets for small-
</b></p>
<p><b>scale farmers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Rural development policies should empower rural women involved in 
</b></p>
<p><b>subsistence farming, including through an increased percentage of women 
</b></p>
<p><b>extension officers, and an improvement in women</b>&#8217;s<b> access to public services 
</b></p>
<p><b>and credit;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Improve social assistance schemes by addressing existing protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>gaps. The integration of cash transfer programmes within social assistance systems 
</b></p>
<p><b>and their grounding in solid legal and institutional frameworks framed by human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights norms and standards should be considered. Coverage could be significantly </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>strengthened by defining the beneficiaries as rights holders and by allowing rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>holders to file claims in cases of exclusion, thus creating a sense of entitlement among 
</b></p>
<p><b>the members of the intended target group.64 Efforts to improve the information 
</b></p>
<p><b>available to potential beneficiaries</b>&#8212;<b>such as the expansion of South African Social 
</b></p>
<p><b>Security Agency offices throughout the country, the deployment of mobile trucks to 
</b></p>
<p><b>reach more rural areas and the convening of public meetings to provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>information</b>&#8212;<b>should be continued and better funded. A basic income grant should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>established to provide support to individuals between the ages of 18 to 59 who are 
</b></p>
<p><b>ineligible for one of the existing cash transfer grants. Until such a basic income grant 
</b></p>
<p><b>is created, the Government may consider developing the Expanded Public Works 
</b></p>
<p><b>Programme into a more rights-based programme guaranteeing a minimum number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>days of employment to all those who have no other source of income, following the 
</b></p>
<p><b>model of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act in India;65  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Improve programmes, such as the One Home, One Garden programme, 
</b></p>
<p><b>to improve household food production, and consider prioritizing support for collective 
</b></p>
<p><b>projects such as communal urban and peri-urban subsistence-level or community-
</b></p>
<p><b>based market gardening, which maximize impacts;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Strengthen the protection of farmworkers by having labour inspectors 
</b></p>
<p><b>team with law enforcement officials, both in order to reduce the risk of bribery and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that labour inspectors are better supported in their attempts to have access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>farms, and by strengthening collaboration with union representatives who, following 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate training, could be certified to conduct inspections on farms and report to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Department of Labour any refusal by the farmer to have his/her farm inspected 
</b></p>
<p><b>for compliance with labour legislation;66  
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Review the legislation applicable to evictions in order to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with international human rights standards, which establish safeguards 
</b></p>
<p><b>that protect persons against being arbitrarily displaced from their home, especially in 
</b></p>
<p><b>relation to mining activities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Prioritize the rebuilding of local food systems and the strengthening of 
</b></p>
<p><b>links between local small-scale producers and urban consumers, in complement to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>new implementation framework on obesity, physical activity and health, in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>transform the obesogenic environment many poor urban consumers face;67  
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Stimulate a transition towards sustainable agricultural systems by 
</b></p>
<p><b>supporting agroecological practices such as agroforestry, organic agriculture by 
</b></p>
<p><b>small-scale farmers, water-harvesting techniques, biological control, intercropping, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and use of biological fertilizers, and by integrating agroecological practices into 
</b></p>
<p><b>agricultural extension services that should rely more on farmer-to-farmer methods of 
</b></p>
<p><b>disseminating knowledge (see A/HRC/16/49).
