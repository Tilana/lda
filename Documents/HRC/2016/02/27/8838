<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixth session from 30 
November to 11 December 2009.  The review of Costa Rica Republic was held at the 14th 
meeting on 8 December 2009.  The delegation of Costa Rica was headed by H.E. Mr. 
Bruno Stagno, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship. At its 17th meeting held on 11 
December 2009, the Working Group adopted the present report on Costa Rica. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Costa Rica: United Kingdom, Burkina Faso 
and the Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Costa Rica: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted / written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/CRI/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR), in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/CRI/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR, in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/CRI/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland, Argentina, Czech Republic, Denmark, Sweden, the 
Netherlands, Hungary, was transmitted to Costa Rica through the troika.  These questions 
are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 14th meeting, on 8 December 2009, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
Worship of Costa Rica opened his statement, recalling that the National Report was the 
result of a broad process of consultation and dialogue, which began in October 2008 and 
involved 29 government bodies and 23 civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>6. Costa Rica is the oldest democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean and has 
excellent human development indicators. Costa Rica abolished the army over 60 years ago 
and redirected resources towards social investment. The sustained growth in public 
expenditure over the last years has allowed for the continuous improvement in the living 
conditions of the population, as well as the construction of a solid institutional structure for 
the protection of human rights. This has been possible notwithstanding the difficulties 
resulting from being a middle-income developing country receiving scarce international 
cooperation. 
</p>
<p>7. The State provides basic health care, vaccination and emergency services for the 
entire population, whether or not they are insured. Costa Rica noted that education is free at 
the preschool, primary and secondary levels, as well as for special programmes for persons 
with disabilities, while public universities receive State subsidies. As stipulated in the 
Constitution, public expenditure in education must be more than six percent of the gross 
domestic product (GDP). In the national budget adopted for 2010, resources for education </p>


<p>have been increased by 14 percent, representing over 25 percent of the total budget for the 
executive power and 6.9 percent of the country&#8217;s GDP. 
</p>
<p>8. The 1949 Constitution is the regulatory basis guaranteeing full respect for the human 
rights of all the country's inhabitants. Under the Constitution, human rights provisions are 
directly applicable and take precedence over any regulation that would contradict or restrict 
them. The Constitutional Chamber, established in 1989, was given the power to annul laws 
and other enactments impinging upon the rights and provisions in the Constitution, as well 
as those recognized by the international treaties ratified by Costa Rica. This judicial body is 
one of the pillars of democracy and justice, guaranteeing human rights in the country. Since 
1992, constitutional justice stipulates that international human rights instruments take 
precedence over the Constitution itself, insofar as they offer individuals greater rights or 
guarantees. In addition, in national tribunals, United Nations conventions are directly 
applicable and justiciable, as are other regional and international human rights instruments 
adopted by Costa Rica. 
</p>
<p>9. Electoral democracy and respect to political and civil rights are guaranteed by the 
Supreme Tribunal of Elections (Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones) that oversees the 
electoral processes ensuring their normality. 
</p>
<p>10. The Ombudsman's Office (&#8216;Defensor&#237;a de los Habitantes&#8217;) was established in 1992 
in accordance with the Paris Principles. It defends human rights against State actions or 
omissions, channelling people's complaints against the public sector and protecting 
community interests. Furthermore, in 2006, the Legislative Assembly established the 
Special Committee on Human Rights (CEDH), whose duties include taking cognizance of, 
studying and reporting cases relating to human rights violations, considering and expressing 
opinions on relevant bills, and following up on the recommendations of the Ombudsman's 
Office and related bodies. 
</p>
<p>11. In addition, Costa Rica has a set of specialized public institutions providing a solid 
base to promote, address and respect human rights. Many of them are directly devoted to 
responding to the specific needs of particular or vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>12. Costa Rica highlighted that one of its main development objectives is the fight 
against poverty. The national poverty rate was reduced, for the first time in history, to under 
20 per cent of the population in 2006, and has since remained below that figure; it reached 
16.5 percent before the world financial crisis and now stands at 18.5 percent. In that same 
period, extreme poverty has declined from 5.6 to 4.2 percent of the population. 
</p>
<p>13. The &#8220;State of the Nation&#8221; report, providing an independent analysis of the overall 
situation in the country, noted in its 15th edition that the timely allocation of additional 
resources to social programmes managed to curb the impact of the current economic crisis 
on the incidence of poverty and inequality.  The Economic Commission for Latin America 
and the Caribbean (ECLAC) arrived at a similar conclusion in 2009. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation noted that, historically, Costa Rica has been a country of asylum and 
refuge. This tradition is ongoing and over 12 500 persons have taken refuge in the country, 
all of them with full access to social security benefits and the right to work.  
</p>
<p>15. In addition, Costa Rica is one of the countries in the world with the highest rate of 
reception of migratory flows: 600 thousand foreign persons live in Costa Rica with 
differing legal migratory status, as well as between 250 and 350 thousand persons in an 
irregular situation. The Costa Rican State funds the access to public services for the migrant 
population that cannot afford them. In this endeavour, the country lacks international 
assistance, as it is classified as a middle-income country. It is nevertheless its status as a 
middle-income country, in an impoverished regional context with stark inequalities in 
living standards, that makes Costa Rica a destination for important South-South migratory </p>


<p>flows. While the international community resolves this anachronism, Costa Rica continues 
to provide basic care services to migrants living in its territory, regardless of their legal 
status.  
</p>
<p>16. In the field of immigration Costa Rica has progressively renewed its legal 
framework and modernized its institutional structure through an approach seeking to 
strengthen the human rights of migrants. In particular, Costa Rica referred to the new law 
on immigration, which will come into force in March 2010. 
</p>
<p>17. Costa Rica noted that it has managed to consolidate and maintain a welfare state, 
adding that significant efforts are necessary in order to satisfy the needs of the most 
vulnerable groups. Costa Rica indicated that it shall strive to make human rights a cross-
cutting axis guiding the work of all national institutions, as set forth in the National 
Development Plan. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the interactive dialogue, 45 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations praised Costa Rica for the consultative approach adopted in the preparation of 
the national report, involving stakeholders and NGOs. They also commended Costa Rica 
for its commitments to the promotion and protection of human rights, including through the 
ratification of all major regional and international instruments and the building-up of a 
legislative and institutional framework to this end, its collaboration with human rights 
mechanisms and its leadership in promoting human rights internally and at the international 
level. Costa Rica&#8217;s efforts in reducing poverty were also highlighted. Recommendations 
made during the interactive dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>19. Algeria acknowledged that important measures had been taken to reduce poverty 
although they could not remedy structural poverty. Algeria congratulated Costa Rica for 
measures taken to improve women&#8217;s rights, such as the National Policy on Gender Equality 
and Equity (PIEG) or the National Employment Policy. Algeria also congratulated Costa 
Rica for its efforts aimed at ensuring the right to education for the population. Algeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>20. Malaysia noted that some of Costa Rica&#8217;s experiences were good practices that other 
countries can emulate. It recognized Costa Rica&#8217;s emphasis on good governance, and that 
socio-economic development and political stability were crucial. It commended Costa Rica 
for its success in maintaining relative peace and stability. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>21. Belgium asked for more information on measures taken to combat human trafficking 
and the role played by the National Institute for Women (INAMU) in this regard and on 
how it may be strengthened. Belgium formulated recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. The Netherlands highlighted that Costa Rica has a longstanding record of 
compliance with human rights, participates actively in international human rights bodies 
and has ratified all major human rights treaties as well as the Rome Statute. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. Belarus noted the steps taken by Costa Rica relating to poverty, the protection of the 
most vulnerable groups and the great attention given to unemployment. It also welcomed 
efforts made to strengthen education and the health system, as well as those made in 
protecting motherhood and children through the Strategic Plan for Motherhood and Healthy 
and Safe Childhood 2006-2015. It noted Costa Rica&#8217;s focus on combating violence against 
women and trafficking in persons. Belarus referred to the need to better combat 
discrimination and protect the rights of indigenous people and migrants. Belarus made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>24. Turkey noted the reinstitution of the National Plan and National Commission for 
Violence Prevention and Promotion of Social Peace. It commended the Social Assistance 
and Promotion and &#8220;Avancemos&#8221; Programmes. Turkey noted that more needed to be done 
for indigenous peoples. It noted the strategy on education and intercultural dialogue and 
that education was free and compulsory. It commended programmes for people with 
disabilities and the elderly. It noted a high percentage of dwellings in poor condition, 
especially of indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants, migrants. It encouraged the relevant 
authorities to take effective steps in providing all segments of the society with access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation. Turkey made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Maldives congratulated Costa Rica on its domestic, regional and international 
leadership on environmental issues &#8211;including through the promotion of the concept of the 
right to a healthy environment. Maldives asked to what extent the enjoyment of all human 
rights in Costa Rica is dependent on the effective enjoyment of the constitutional right to a 
healthy environment. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>26. Brazil asked about: policies for promotion of human rights, including relating to the 
fight against poverty and social inequality; measures to guarantee children&#8217;s and women&#8217;s 
rights, while combating discrimination, violence, trafficking and sexual exploitation. It 
asked about policies and legal framework for the rights of indigenous peoples and Afro-
descendants and the situation of those groups. It also asked about human rights and 
migrants and refugees&#8217; policy. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Austria encouraged Costa Rica to continue to involve stakeholders and NGOs in the 
follow-up of UPR recommendations. While welcoming the 2007 law criminalizing violence 
against women and an awareness raising campaign in this regard, Austria noted that the 
problem persists. Austria asked how Costa Rica intended to address the lack of access to 
education, especially in rural areas. Austria commended Costa Rica for the abolishment of 
the criminalization of homosexuals and transgender persons. Austria formulated 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Mexico recognized Costa Rica&#8217;s democratic tradition. It noted institutional 
improvements to prevent human rights violations as well as to ensure citizens&#8217; access to 
remedy and reparations. It asked about the implementation of the rights of persons with 
disabilities.  It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>29. Germany noted that Costa Rica was the model country in the region, in the vanguard 
in its commitment to peace and human rights. It noted that, in 2007, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination stated that acts of racial discrimination were 
considered as minor infractions punishable by a fine and asked about criminal legislation 
regarding acts of racism and racial legislation. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. The Czech Republic commended Costa Rica for its long term support of the OP-
CAT. It noted the concern expressed by the Human Rights Committee with regard to libel 
and defamation as press offences. It made recommendations.    
</p>
<p>31. Canada noted the efforts made to address the social development challenges of 
indigenous people and minorities (Office of the Attorney for Indigenous Affairs, 
indigenous languages translator in the judicial system). Canada noted the 2009 Migration 
and Aliens Act but noted that the Committee Against Torture and the Human Rights 
Committee expressed concerns related to pre-trial detention and detention of aliens. Canada 
welcomed Costa Rica&#8217;s efforts to improve the situation of women although discrimination 
against women persists. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Egypt commended the public human rights bodies and institutions focusing attention 
on groups requiring greater protection and specific initiatives. It welcomed the Legislative 
Assembly&#8217;s Special Committee on Human Rights. It commended the International </p>


<p>Humanitarian Law Commission as advisory body to the Executive. It appreciated the 
creation of an institutional culture in the education system founded on human rights and 
gender equality, and respect for differences of nationality, ethnicity, age, sex, religion and 
social condition. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Slovenia noted its commitment to human rights education. It highlighted the 
enactment of two laws aiming at combating violence against women and asked the 
delegation to elaborate on their concrete results, in particular about measures taken to 
implement access to justice and reparation for victims. It noted the concern expressed by 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child about street children or children working in the 
informal sector and asked about measures taken to address these issues. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Spain congratulated Costa Rica for the National Development Plan 2006-2010 and 
welcomed the decision to ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances. Spain asked about long-term plans and 
reform for the penitentiary system and about building new prisons. Recognizing the 
usefulness of immigration in agriculture, domestic work and private security, it asked about 
policies to improve the integration of migrants, and their right to education and health. 
Given indigenous communities&#8217; low human development indexes, it asked how the 
Autonomous Development of Indigenous Peoples Bill might improve the situation. Spain 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Chile highlighted the fact that Costa Rica is a consolidated democracy.  It valued the 
progress made in decreasing infant mortality rate, the law abolishing corporal punishment 
of children and adolescents and the criminalization of femicide. It made recommendations.    
</p>
<p>36. Costa Rica thanked delegations for the questions and recommendations made. 
Addressing questions on gender equality, Costa Rica made reference to its 2007-2017 
National Policy on Gender Equality and Equity and its 2008-2012 plan of action, as well as 
to legislation criminalizing violence against women and establishing the legal concept of 
femicide, adopted in 2008. Costa Rica also reported on amendments being introduced to the 
law on violence against women, following the declaration of unconstitutionality of articles 
regarding physical injury and on the 2010-2015 plan for the prevention of domestic 
violence.  
</p>
<p>37. Costa Rica noted that in 2008, the Ministry of Public Security and Governance and 
Police and UNFPA, initiated a social action platform, to train police officials to develop 
human rights policies aimed at addressing domestic violence, prevention of HIV/AIDS, 
racism, sexual commercial exploitation and gender, etc. 
</p>
<p>38. Concerning the subject of childhood, Costa Rica referred to the <i>Avancemos</i> 
programme which promotes that low-income children and adolescents stay in the formal 
education system through a system of conditional monetary subsidies. This programme 
covers about 13 per cent of the enrolled school population and has largely reduced the drop 
out rate.  Costa Rica noted that the 2009-2021 National Policy for Childhood and 
Adolescents stipulates that the State must prevent sexual commercial exploitation, protect 
victims and assist them to exercise their rights. Costa Rica also approved the 2008-2010 
National Plan to Combat Commercial Sexual Exploitation, which is incorporated into the 
National Development Plan.  
</p>
<p>39. Costa Rica referred to efforts carried out by the Ministry of Labour and Social 
Security, including a roadmap and several projects being implemented, which aim at 
eliminating the worst forms of child labour.  Costa Rica noted that the number of working 
children between 12 and 17 has dropped from 11 per cent in 2006 to 6.9 per cent in 2008. </p>


<p>Following the amendment of the family code, eliminating corporal punishment and 
degrading treatment of children, Costa Rica further informed of other efforts in this regard. 
</p>
<p>40. Since the ratification of ILO Convention No. 169 in 1993, Costa Rica has worked 
towards fulfilling the rights of indigenous populations. Article 76 of the Constitution 
stipulates that the State shall maintain and promote the national indigenous languages. 
There are 313 educational institutions in indigenous communities and the coverage of 
health services has been increased.  Costa Rica also referred to the <i>Extramuros</i> Programme, 
which provides food and milk to indigenous children. In addition, Costa Rica reported on 
the establishment of electoral and civil services in some indigenous communities, as well as 
the establishment of the Commission on Indigenous Electoral Affairs. Costa Rica further 
reported on the establishment of the Fiscal&#237;a of Indigenous Affairs in 2009, and on the 
Autonomous Development of Indigenous Peoples Bill, which aims at improving the legal 
framework for the protection and development of indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>41. With regard to racial discrimination, the delegation highlighted the inclusive nature 
of the Costa Rican State which makes no distinction based on ethnic, culture, race or 
religious origin, or on any other grounds. There is no judicial record of acts of hatred, so no 
legislation in this respect is deemed necessary. Costa Rica has expressed its commitment to 
ratify the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of Diversity in the 
Cultural Expressions and is planning a forum to follow up on the Durban review 
conference, as well as to comply with all international obligations in this regard.  
</p>
<p>42. Costa Rica further noted that it seeks to fight all forms of discrimination, including 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. 17 May was declared as the National Day 
against Homophobia. The delegation also referred to improvements in human rights 
training to protect vulnerable groups, including lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals.  
</p>
<p>43. With regard to persons with disabilities, Costa Rica noted that it has a law on Equal 
Opportunities for Disabled Persons which was enacted in 1996 and it ratified in 2008 the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. Costa Rica 
reported on efforts to facilitate the political participation of persons with disabilities in the 
forthcoming national elections in 2010.  
</p>
<p>44. Sweden welcomed the 2008 amendment to the Family Code to completely prohibit 
violence against women, although violence against children still occurs. While welcoming 
efforts made in this regard, Sweden relayed concerns expressed at the persistence of 
trafficking in persons. It noted that relevant Costa Rican legislation rather focused on 
international trafficking than on internal trafficking. Sweden expressed concerns regarding 
organised crime, impunity and labour rights. Sweden formulated recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Italy noted that it was one of the first countries to abolish capital punishment. It 
noted legislation to criminalise violence against women. However, it noted that problems in 
its implementation were reported. It welcomed initiatives to punish human trafficking and 
the National Development Plan. Italy made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. France asked more information on discrimination against migrants and the measures 
taken in this regard as well as on measures adopted to combat child labour, trafficking in 
children and child prostitution. France stated that nobody had been sentenced for torture 
although this is a crime since 2001. It welcomed the support by Costa Rica to the resolution 
of the Organisation of American States on human rights, sexual orientation and gender 
identity. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Uruguay noted that Costa Rica was a middle income developing country having 
difficulties in acceding to international aid for the implementation of national programs and 
noted that these efforts had been undertaken through public resources. Uruguay highlighted 
new legislation on children&#8217;s rights, particularly in the National Plan to Combat </p>


<p>Commercial Sexual Exploitation 2008-2010. It asked more information about the National 
Office for Childhood and the National Commission to Combat the Commercial Sexual 
Exploitation of Children and Adolescents, especially about staff training, population 
sensitization and social reintegration of victims. It welcomed the efforts regarding 
migrants&#8217; rights but noted reports that difficulties persist in this field. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Norway commended Costa Rica for its democracy and asked how it intends to 
involve civil society in the follow-up to UPR recommendations.  It noted that the 5th and 6th 
report to CEDAW are overdue.  It raised the issues of discrimination and violence against 
women and noted that they continue to be a problem. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. The Holy See highlighted the integration of women in political life as well as the 
low maternal mortality rate. It made reference to overcrowding and unsatisfactory health 
care in prisons and asked Costa Rica to provide details on the reform of the criminal code 
and the national plan relating to trafficking in persons. It also inquired about plans to 
reinforce legislation on sexual exploitation of children. It referred to the gaps of the judicial 
system. It formulated recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Nicaragua recognized Costa Rica&#8217;s historical solidarity with its neighbors and the 
fact that it has welcomed thousands of Nicaraguan citizens. It noted Costa Rica&#8217;s 
achievements in combating poverty, particularly through several successful social 
programs. It raised its concern by potential human rights violations against Nicaraguans 
living in Costa Rica.  It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. United States of America welcomed actions to combat commercial sexual 
exploitation and trafficking in children, including the National child Welfare Agency for 
Children programs and the National Plan to Combat Commercial Sexual Exploitation 2008-
</p><p>2010. It asked about measures aimed at reducing sexual exploitation of children and at 
sustaining or expanding these efforts. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Paraguay highlighted Costa Rica&#8217;s regional participation, particularly in the entry 
into force of the American Convention on Human Rights. It highlighted the National 
Development Plan. It recognized achievements in women&#8217;s rights, including the 
criminalisation of violence against women, the rights of female domestic workers, 
children&#8217;s rights, and right to health, especially for maternity and childhood. It recognized 
policies against racism, discrimination and xenophobia, in light of commitments made in 
the Durban Conference and its review.  
</p>
<p>53. China noted with appreciation that Costa Rica was the first country to sign and ratify 
ICCPR and ICESCR and acceded to seven core UN human rights instruments. It further 
noted that Costa Rica established a series of commission and other public bodies to protect 
specific groups and vulnerable groups, such as the Ombudsman Office or the International 
Humanitarian Law Commission. China welcomed the measures taken to improve living 
standards of its population and efforts in poverty reduction. It asked what measures were 
taken in this regard further to the financial crisis which had a negative impact in the 
alleviation of poverty.  
</p>
<p>54. Bulgaria praised the National Development Plan as an instrument for achieving real 
progress in fighting poverty and inequality. In this regard, it asked about mid-term and long 
term expectations. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. United Kingdom commended the creation of special services for the protection of 
women and children throughout the justice sector. The UK would like to see wider use of 
these resources, notably in ensuring that children are provided with appropriate services 
separate to adults. It was pleased that laws relating to domestic violence extend to economic 
violence but regretted that protection had been reduced since the annulment of two articles </p>


<p>under the law. It would like the law be strengthened to reduce the rate of femicide, sexual 
violence and trafficking of women. It referred to stakeholders&#8217; submissions about 
strengthening the framework against racism and racial discrimination although they 
reflected that xenophobia was still prevalent. It noted that the 1996 law on equality for 
disabled persons appeared insufficient and would welcome action to change perceptions 
towards disabled people, as well as towards lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups. 
It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Burkina Faso noted with satisfaction the various initiatives undertaken to ensure 
human protection to Costa Ricans and migrants. It noted that Costa Rica is party to various 
international and regional human rights instruments and collaborate with human rights 
mechanisms. It further noted the various plans and policies adopted for the implementation 
of human rights. Burkina Faso made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Responding to additional questions, Costa Rica highlighted that the Directorate-
General for Migration and Alien Affairs is responsible for the implementation of the new 
Law on Migration, which will enter into force on March 2010. The new law seeks to have a 
positive impact in the acceptance of migrants by the society, through key measures, such as 
the integration into the social security system and participation in social work at communal 
level. It favours the creation of adequate measures to combat xenophobia and 
discrimination against migrants. Public campaigns in this regard have been initiated 
already, including with the cooperation of various Consulates. Reference was also made to 
a project to promote and protect the rights of Ngobes temporary migrants during the period 
of the coffee harvest. Costa Rica also made reference to jurisprudence established by the 
Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, with regard to extending social benefits to 
foreigners legally residing in the country, as well as irregular children that are in conditions 
of poverty or extreme poverty.  Health services are also provided to all migrants in the 
border areas. Costa Rica is committed to bilateral cooperation, taking into account the 
common responsibility of the migration processes and therefore promotes and implements 
several bi-national projects, including some with the support of the IOM. Costa Rica made 
reference also to the recognition made by ECLAC with regard to some health and other 
projects. 
</p>
<p>58. Regarding children of migrants, Costa Rica noted that in addition to the rights 
guaranteed by the country, the 2009-2021 National Policy for Children and Adolescents, 
guarantees the right to universal education for all persons residing in the country, without 
any discrimination. It also noted that all children, regardless of their migratory situation, 
with or without identification, have free access to public health services. 
</p>
<p>59. Concerning refugees, and with the support of UNHCR, Costa Rica is working 
towards the establishment of an Office for the Study of Refugee cases. It is also providing 
regular training to migrant and boarder officials.  The new law, which is more in line with 
international commitments, including with the principle of <i>non refoulement</i>, will establish 
simplified control procedures and create a specialized Migration Police. The new 
legislation will also establish simplified procedures to request visas and establish a 
mechanism to appeal decisions by the Directorate General for Migration and Alien Affairs 
and by the Asylum and Visa Commission. 
</p>
