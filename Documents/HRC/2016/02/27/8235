<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in resolution 13/23, on enhancement of international 
cooperation in the field of human rights, which was submitted by Egypt on behalf of the 
Non-Aligned Movement and adopted without a vote, &#8213;reaffirms that it is one of the 
purposes of the United Nations and also the primary responsibility of Member States to 
promote, protect and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms 
through, inter alia, international cooperation&#8214; (para. 1). Addressing all actors on the 
international scene, the resolution highlights the legal dimension of &#8213;international 
cooperation in the field of human rights, in conformity with the purposes and principles set 
out in the Charter of the United Nations and international law&#8214; (para. 6) with regard to 
prevention, capacity-building and technical assistance (para. 8). Finally, the Council 
specifically requests &#8213;the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to explore ways and 
means to enhance cooperation in the field of human rights&#8214; (para. 14), to facilitate 
exchanges of information and best practices in this regard, taking into account the &#8213;views&#8214; 
of &#8213;States and relevant stakeholders&#8214;, and to submit proposals to the Council at its 
nineteenth session.  
</p>
<p>2. To this end, on 30 December 2009, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights submitted her report on enhancement of international cooperation in the 
field of human rights (A/HRC/13/19), pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 10/6. 
However, it must be acknowledged that, at this exploratory stage, the consultation has been 
fairly limited, notwithstanding the valuable initial responses received from eight Member 
States (Algeria, Bahrain, Burkina Faso, Iraq, Jordan, Monaco, Serbia and Ukraine) and 
from the Holy See, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), and the International 
Labour Organization (ILO), two national institutions (Jordan and Qatar) and a number of 
NGOs &#8211; a total of 15 responses in all.  
</p>
<p>3. In order to give effect to resolution 13/23, the Advisory Committee, pursuant to its 
recommendation 5/4, set up a drafting group, to be chaired by Mr. Seetulsingh, which it 
tasked with undertaking preparatory work on the topic before the in-depth discussion to be 
held at its sixth session, in January 2011. Mr. Decaux, Rapporteur of the drafting group, 
prepared a working paper (A/HRC/AC/6/CRP.4), which attempted to clarify the legal bases 
for international cooperation in the field of human rights and discuss the key issues that 
revolve around the dialectic between the two concepts. At its sixth session, the drafting 
group held an informal meeting with the sponsor of resolution 13/23 in order to clarify the 
nature of its mandate. The drafting group considered the working paper submitted by the 
Rapporteur, and the document was subsequently discussed by the Advisory Committee in a 
public meeting. The Advisory Committee adopted recommendation 6/4 on 21 January 
</p><p>2011. In it, the Committee took note of the preliminary discussions and requested that a 
revised document should be presented to the Committee at its seventh session. The 
Advisory Committee also noted that the drafting group would prepare a questionnaire to 
facilitate broad consultation with all stakeholders at the appropriate time. 
</p>
<p>4. At its sixteenth session, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 16/22 of 25 
March 2011 without a vote. The text had been submitted by Egypt on behalf of the Non-
Aligned Movement. In this resolution, which reproduces the broad thrust of resolution 
13/23, States and United Nations human rights mechanisms and procedures are invited to 
continue to pay attention to the importance of &#8213;mutual cooperation, understanding and 
dialogue in ensuring the promotion and protection of all human rights&#8214; (para. 14). In its 
resolution, the Human Rights Council furthermore takes note of the discussions held in the 
Advisory Committee, in fulfilment of its mandate, to explore &#8213;ways and means to enhance 
international cooperation in the field of human rights, in accordance with Council </p>


<p>resolution 13/23 of 26 March 2010 (para. 15). Without setting the Advisory Committee a 
specific deadline, the Human Rights Council states that it will continue its consideration of 
the matter in 2012. 
</p>
<p>5. At the Advisory Committee&#8217;s seventh session, Ms. Boisson de Chazournes was 
appointed Rapporteur of the drafting group. The Chairperson of the drafting group, Mr. 
Seetulsingh, presented the report that the group had drafted. After discussing the report, the 
Advisory Committee tasked the drafting group with submitting a final report to the 
Advisory Committee at its eighth session. On 1 September 2011, the secretariat of the 
Advisory Committee sent out a questionnaire, and by October 2011 about 10 responses had 
been received. Eight Member States (Cameroon, Cuba, France, Greece, Honduras, Iraq, 
Serbia and Uruguay) and a number of NGOs sent their observations and comments to the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>6. At its eighth session, the Advisory Committee considered and endorsed the present 
study for submission to the Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Basic documents on international cooperation in the field of 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p>7. Given the impossibility of citing all the relevant United Nations legal reference 
texts, a brief overview will suffice. The preamble of resolution 13/23 itself, for example, 
refers to many of the relevant texts. However, at this stage the main focus is on clarifying 
the legal framework for international cooperation in the United Nations system. It would be 
useful to supplement this overview with information on the practices of other international 
organizations, particularly at the regional level, and on experience gleaned from the 
development of multilateral and bilateral cooperation agreements. 
</p>
<p><b> A. International cooperation in the Charter of the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>8. International cooperation in the field of human rights has always been an important 
aspect of the mission of the United Nations. The Charter states that one of the purposes of 
the United Nations is to &#8213;achieve international co-operation in solving international 
problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and 
encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without 
distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion&#8214; (Article 1, paragraph 3). Article 13 states 
that: 
</p>
<p>&#8213;The General Assembly shall initiate studies and make recommendations for 
the purpose of: 
</p>
<p> (a) Promoting international co-operation in the political field and 
encouraging the progressive development of international law and its codification; 
</p>
<p> (b) Promoting international co-operation in the economic, social, cultural, 
educational, and health fields, and assisting in the realization of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or 
religion.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>9. Similarly, Chapter IX of the Charter, on &#8213;international economic and social co-
operation&#8214;, provides, in Articles 55 and 56, that &#8213;Members pledge themselves to take joint 
and separate action in co-operation with the Organization&#8214; (Art. 56) in order to achieve the 
purposes set forth in the preceding article, including &#8213;universal respect for, and observance 
of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, 
language, or religion&#8214; (Art. 55 (c)). The Chapter also provides for coordination between the </p>


<p>specialized agencies (Arts. 57 ff.). Lastly, the Charter includes a specific reference to 
consultation with &#8213;non-governmental organizations&#8214; on matters within the competence of 
the Economic and Social Council (Art. 71). 
</p>
<p>10. These provisions clearly show that the field of international cooperation is much 
broader than that of human rights, <i>stricto sensu</i>, and, at the same time, that this broad vision 
of &#8213;economic and social cooperation&#8214; clearly encompasses human rights. Hence, there is a 
need for an ongoing dialectic between solving &#8213;international problems of an economic, 
social, cultural, or humanitarian character&#8214; and strengthening human rights, but also 
between political cooperation and the &#8213;progressive development of international law&#8214;, 
including the codification of international human rights law. Similarly, the link between 
culture, education and human rights must be emphasized. This multifaceted form of 
cooperation reinforces and includes the human rights dimension, which is an element, not 
to say a condition, of that cooperation. 
</p>
<p>11. When human rights are set against the wider backdrop of international cooperation, 
the number of actors involved multiplies. In the first instance, the Charter is addressed to 
both Member States and the United Nations system itself, while highlighting the complex 
relationship between the United Nations and States, given that States have the obligation to 
work in cooperation with the United Nations on both a bilateral and multilateral basis. It 
can therefore be concluded that Member States also have a duty to cooperate through &#8213;joint 
and separate&#8214; action taken in the framework of their relations and institutions. In addition, 
this opportunity for multilateral cooperation is open to specialized agencies and regional 
organizations, although it is too soon to speak of the term &#8213;multi-multilateralism&#8214;, and 
account must also be taken of non-State actors, including civil society organizations, 
NGOs, foundations, the business world, companies and trade unions. International 
cooperation now takes place not just at the &#8213;supra-State&#8214; and &#8213;inter-State&#8214; levels or at the 
infra-State level, with the recent trend towards decentralization of cooperation and greater 
involvement of regions and local authorities, but also at the &#8213;transnational&#8214; level. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International cooperation in general documents of the General 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>12. The General Assembly, in its resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, adopted, 
in the context of promoting peaceful coexistence, the &#8213;Declaration on Principles of 
International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in 
accordance with the Charter of the United Nations&#8214; (hereafter referred to as the &#8213;1970 
Declaration&#8214;). Seven basic principles are set out, including the principle of refraining from 
the threat or use of force, the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, the principle 
relating to &#8213;duty not to intervene in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any State, in 
accordance with the Charter&#8214;, the principle of equal rights and self-determination of 
peoples, the principle of the sovereign equality of States and the principle that States are to 
fulfil &#8213;in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the Charter&#8214;. The 
fourth principle set out in the Declaration concerns the duty of States to cooperate with one 
another in accordance with the Charter.  
</p>
<p>13. This &#8213;duty&#8214; is described in the text of the Declaration as follows: &#8213;States have the 
duty to co-operate with one another, irrespective of the differences in their political, 
economic and social systems, in the various spheres of international relations, in order to 
maintain international peace and security and to promote international economic stability 
and progress, the general welfare of nations and international co-operation free from 
discrimination based on such differences.&#8214; To this end, inter alia: &#8213;(b) States shall co-
operate in the promotion of universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all, and in the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination </p>


<p>and all forms of religious intolerance.&#8214; It should be noted &#8212; in view of the fact that the 
Human Rights Council, in resolution 6/30, calls for the integration of a gender perspective 
&#8212; that the 1970 Declaration, which, for the most part, paraphrases the basic provisions of 
the Charter, omits all reference to gender-based discrimination and the principle of gender 
equality. Cooperation is envisaged: &#8213;in the economic, social and cultural fields&#8214; and &#8213;in the 
promotion of economic growth throughout the world, especially that of the developing 
countries&#8214;. 
</p>
<p><b> C. International cooperation in specific human rights documents 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) International Bill of Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is itself based on the obligations 
set forth in the Charter, states in its preamble that: &#8213;Member States have pledged 
themselves to achieve, in cooperation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal 
respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.&#8214; While the 
Declaration is mainly focused on the human rights of the individual, it does state, in article 
26, paragraph 2, that education: &#8213;shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship 
among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United 
Nations for the maintenance of peace&#8214;. In addition, article 28 states that: &#8213;Everyone is 
entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this 
Declaration can be fully realized.&#8214; Thus, it is only when the two covenants are taken 
together that the full extent of the commitment to cooperation for the promotion of human 
rights is made clear.  
</p>
<p>15. Thus, pursuant to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, &#8213;each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually and 
through international assistance and co-operation, especially economic and technical, to the 
maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full 
realization of the rights recognized ...&#8214; (art. 2, para. 1). More specifically, with regard to 
&#8213;the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger&#8214;, the Covenant provides that 
States &#8213;shall take, individually and through international co-operation, the measures, 
including specific programmes, which are needed&#8214; (art. 11, para. 2). Similarly, States 
&#8213;recognize the benefits to be derived from the encouragement and development of 
international contacts and co-operation in the scientific and cultural fields&#8214; (art. 15, para. 4). 
The same wording is not found in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
aside from article 1, which is common to both covenants and refers to the free disposal of 
natural resources &#8213;without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international 
economic co-operation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law&#8214;. 
In addition to the &#8213;international assistance and cooperation&#8214; expressly provided for in 
respect of the promotion of economic, social and cultural rights, should not all human rights 
be promoted through international cooperation, starting with legal cooperation and 
technical assistance in the area of education and vocational training of public officials?  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Other international human rights treaties 
</b></p>
<p>16. In certain treaties, explicit provisions refer to cooperation of the national authorities 
with the United Nations. One example is article 35 of the Convention relating to the Status 
of Refugees of 1951, which specifically mentions the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees. However, it is primarily in more recent treaties that explicit 
reference is made to cooperation. The last preambular paragraph of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child of 1989 recognizes &#8213;the importance of international co-operation for 
improving the living conditions of children in every country, in particular in the developing 
countries&#8214;, thus emphasizing the close link between cooperation and development. Article </p>


<p>45 states that, &#8213;in order to foster the effective implementation of the Convention and to 
encourage international co-operation in the field covered by the Convention&#8214;, the 
specialized agencies, such as UNICEF, have the right to participate in the work of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>17. This wording in the preamble to the Convention on the Rights of the Child is echoed 
in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which, in turn, recognizes &#8213;the 
importance of international cooperation for improving the living conditions of persons with 
disabilities in every country, particularly in developing countries&#8214;. Article 32 is concerned 
with the subject of international cooperation, in a very broad sense rather than solely as it 
relates to the specialized agencies: 
</p>
<p>&#8213;1.  States Parties recognize the importance of international cooperation and its 
promotion, in support of national efforts for the realization of the purpose and 
objectives of the present Convention, and will undertake appropriate and effective 
measures in this regard, between and among States and, as appropriate, in 
partnership with relevant international and regional organizations and civil society, 
in particular organizations of persons with disabilities. Such measures could include, 
inter alia: 
</p>
<p>&#8213;(a) Ensuring that international cooperation, including international 
development programmes, is inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p>&#8213;(b) Facilitating and supporting capacity-building, including through the 
exchange and sharing of information, experiences, training programmes and best 
practices; 
</p>
<p>&#8213;(c) Facilitating cooperation in research and access to scientific and 
technical knowledge; 
</p>
<p>&#8213;(d) Providing, as appropriate, technical and economic assistance, 
including by facilitating access to and sharing of accessible and assistive 
technologies, and through the transfer of technologies. 
</p>
<p>&#8213;2. The provisions of this article are without prejudice to the obligations of each 
State Party to fulfil its obligations under the present Convention.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>18. In addition, article 37, entitled &#8213;Cooperation between States Parties and the 
Committee&#8214;, states in paragraph 2 that the Committee is to give due consideration to: &#8213;ways 
and means of enhancing national capacities for the implementation of the present 
Convention, including through international cooperation&#8214;. Thus it juxtaposes two very 
different forms of cooperation. Similarly, article 38, entitled &#8213;Relationship of the 
Committee with other bodies&#8214;, is also concerned with the question of fostering: &#8213;the 
effective implementation of the present Convention and [encouraging] international 
cooperation in the field covered by the present Convention&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>19. In other words, all aspects of cooperation are covered: cooperation between States; 
cooperation between States and international organizations; cooperation between 
institutions; and cooperation with civil society. Article 32, on cooperation arrangements, 
refers to the following in turn: &#8213;international development&#8214;, &#8213;capacity-building&#8214; and the 
sharing of best practices; &#8213;access to scientific and technical knowledge&#8214;; &#8213;technical and 
economic assistance&#8214;; and the &#8213;transfer of technologies&#8214;. Most of these terms entail a form 
of solidarity, which may encompass its North-South but also its South-South dimension. 
Article 32, paragraph 2, serves as a reminder that this obligation to engage in international 
cooperation does not exonerate the State from its primary responsibility. The particularly 
detailed approach taken in the Convention could serve as a frame of reference for the 
interpretation of earlier treaties. </p>


<p><b> (c) Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action  
</b></p>
<p>20. The Vienna Declaration marked a turning point in the clarification of the role of 
international cooperation in the promotion and protection of human rights. After recalling 
Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations, the Conference affirms, in the preamble to 
the Declaration, the &#8213;commitment of the international community to human rights 
endeavours [through] an increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and 
solidarity&#8214;. Recalling the international commitments of States, the Conference asserts, in 
paragraph 1, subparagraph 2, of the first part of the Declaration that: &#8213;enhancement of 
international cooperation in the field of human rights is essential for the full achievement of 
the purposes of the United Nations&#8214;. In addition, it affirms, in paragraph 4, that: &#8213;the 
promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms must be 
considered as a priority objective of the United Nations in accordance with its purposes and 
principles, in particular the purpose of international cooperation. In the framework of these 
purposes and principles, the promotion and protection of all human rights is a legitimate 
concern of the international community.&#8214; In addition to technical cooperation, which is 
essentially focused on promoting development, the importance of political cooperation 
encompassing the protection of all human rights is clearly recognized in the Declaration. 
Paragraph 10 states that: &#8213;States should cooperate with each other in ensuring development 
and eliminating obstacles to development. The international community should promote an 
effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the 
elimination of obstacles to development.&#8214; Elsewhere, it is specified that States and 
international organizations should work &#8213;in cooperation with non-governmental 
organizations&#8214; (para. 13).  
</p>
<p>21. In more specific terms, in section C of the second part of the Declaration, entitled 
&#8213;Cooperation, development and strengthening of human rights&#8214;, it is recommended that 
&#8213;priority be given to national and international action to promote democracy, development 
and human rights&#8214; (para. 66). The measures listed in paragraph 67 concern the 
&#8213;strengthening of a pluralistic civil society&#8214; and include &#8213;assistance for ... the conduct of &#8230; 
elections&#8214;, but they also concern national structures, including penal establishments, and 
training of lawyers and judges. In addition, paragraph 74 states that: &#8213;actors in the field of 
development cooperation should bear in mind the mutually reinforcing interrelationship 
between development, democracy and human rights. Cooperation should be based on 
dialogue and transparency.&#8214; 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
</b></p>
<p>22. The text of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action also calls repeatedly 
for international cooperation and reaffirms: &#8213;the importance of the enhancement of 
international cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights and for the 
achievement of the objectives of the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance&#8214;. The Durban Declaration refers, more generally, to &#8213;cooperation, 
partnership and inclusion&#8214;, a &#8213;spirit of solidarity and international cooperation&#8214; and 
&#8213;cooperation among nations and ... peace&#8214;. Thus, it clearly acknowledges the importance of 
cooperation: &#8213;We recognize the importance of cooperation among States, relevant 
international and regional organizations, the international financial institutions, non-
governmental organizations and individuals in the worldwide fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and that success in this fight requires 
specifically taking into consideration the grievances, opinions and demands of the victims 
of such discrimination&#8214; (para. 110). While &#8213;cooperation with affected communities&#8214; is 
recommended in the Declaration, mention is also made of cooperation to enhance 
international mechanisms, &#8213;bilateral, regional and international cooperation&#8214; (para. 60), 
cooperation with NGOs (para. 69) and the development of national institutions (para. 91 
(c)). </p>


<p><b> (e) Cooperation in the new mandate of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>23. The General Assembly, in its resolution 60/251, repeatedly emphasized the 
importance of cooperation. In the preamble to the resolution, the General Assembly 
recognized that: &#8213;the promotion and protection of human rights should be based on the 
principles of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the capacity of 
Member States to comply with their human rights obligations for the benefit of all human 
beings&#8214;. The Human Rights Council itself must be guided in its work by, inter alia, the 
principles of &#8213;constructive ... dialogue and cooperation&#8214; (para. 4). The universal periodic 
review is considered to be a &#8213;cooperative mechanism, based on ... dialogue&#8214; (para. 5). More 
generally, the task entrusted to the Council is the following: &#8213;(f) Contribute, through 
dialogue and cooperation, towards the prevention of human rights violations and respond 
promptly to human rights emergencies&#8214;; and &#8213;(h) Work in close cooperation in the field of 
human rights with Governments, regional organizations, national human rights institutions 
and civil society.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>24. Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 reflects, in its turn, the broad thrust of these 
ideas. In accordance with this resolution, the objectives of the universal periodic review 
include &#8213;support for cooperation in the promotion and protection of human rights&#8214; (para. 4 
(e)) and &#8213;the encouragement of full cooperation and engagement with the Council, other 
human rights bodies and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights&#8214; (para. 4 (f)). The aim of the process is to enhance cooperation in the area of human 
rights (para. 27 (c)). In this same resolution, the Human Rights Council also refers to the 
possibility of &#8213;persistent non-cooperation&#8214; by a State with the universal periodic review 
process (para. 38). With regard to the complaint procedure, the confidential nature of which 
is designed to &#8213;enhance cooperation with the State concerned&#8214; (para. 86), the possibility of 
a &#8213;manifest and unequivocal lack of cooperation&#8214; is also envisaged (para. 104). However, 
the overall tone remains one of &#8213;constructive international dialogue and cooperation&#8214; with a 
view to the rationalization of mandates (para. 54). Accordingly, the country mandates are 
based on the principles of &#8213;cooperation and genuine dialogue&#8214; (para. 63), even though the 
possibility that a State might be uncooperative is acknowledged (para. 64). 
</p>
<p>25. Even more general wording is found in General Assembly resolution 60/1, which 
calls for efforts to &#8213;[encourage] tolerance, respect, dialogue and cooperation among 
different cultures, civilizations and peoples&#8214; (para. 14). This wording is echoed in the 
preamble to Human Rights Council resolution 13/23, which reaffirms that: &#8213;dialogue 
among religions, cultures and civilizations in the field of human rights could contribute 
greatly to the enhancement of international cooperation in this field&#8214; and then goes on to 
mention &#8213;the fact that mutual understanding, dialogue, cooperation, transparency and 
confidence-building are important elements in all the activities for the promotion and 
protection of human rights&#8214;. Cooperation thus takes on an added cultural dimension while 
retaining its original scope. As stated in paragraph 32 (the last paragraph) of the 
Millennium Declaration: &#8213;The United Nations is the indispensable common house of the 
entire human family, through which we will seek to realize our universal aspirations for 
peace, cooperation and development. We therefore pledge our unstinting support for these 
common objectives and our determination to achieve them.&#8214; 
</p>
<p><b> III. Challenges for international cooperation in the field of 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p>26. This brief overview clearly shows the wide variety of meanings that the very 
concept of cooperation can have. Before even starting to consider the legal scope of a 
&#8213;catch-all&#8214; concept that involves a wide range of actors, fields and registers, we should first 
distinguish it from similar terms. The texts cited above use a host of synonyms that focus </p>


<p>on &#8213;constructive dialogue&#8214; and &#8213;participation&#8214;. What is more, the idea can be implicit, 
without the word &#8213;cooperation&#8214; actually being used, when the intention is to harness the 
efforts of all stakeholders. Of particular relevance in this regard is the work carried out in 
parallel by the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee on the promotion of a 
democratic and equitable international order, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
8/5, and on human rights and international solidarity, pursuant to Human Rights Council 
resolutions 9/2, 12/9 and 15/3, and by the Independent Expert on human rights and 
international solidarity.  
</p>
<p>27. While it may be too soon to set up a typology, a systematic framework should be 
developed that will allow all the parameters involved to be taken into consideration. Only 
then will it be possible to envisage a dynamic, rather than static, approach to the issue with 
a view to identifying best practices for enhancing international cooperation in the area of 
human rights. These best practices are identified and disseminated through visits by 
experts, as well as through studies and reports. The universal periodic review, forums and 
other platforms for exchanging information at the national, regional and international 
levels, also provide a vehicle for their dissemination. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The many facets of international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The subjects of international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>28. The first parameter to consider is the wide variety of actors involved. In the first 
instance, within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations of 1945, international 
cooperation is to be interpreted as referring to the obligations of Member States vis-&#224;-vis 
the Organization and, as a corollary, to the relations between States. It is where inter-State 
law and the legal tenets of the Organization meet. This approach makes sense inasmuch as 
the Organization is itself a cooperative venture, with States acting with a common purpose 
in the framework of the Charter of the United Nations. In this sense, cooperation is a &#8213;duty&#8214; 
requiring Member States, by virtue of their status as such, to act as peace-loving nations 
that &#8213;accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and ... are able and willing to 
carry out these obligations&#8214; (Charter, Art. 4, para. 1). At this level of principle, cooperation 
is not a mere political gesture of goodwill, but a legal imperative of good faith. There is a 
close link between the duty to cooperate and the commitment to honour in good faith the 
obligations entered into under the Charter, as also stated in the 1970 Declaration referred to 
above. 
</p>
<p>29. At this first level, the concept concerns not only all the organizations of the United 
Nations family, including its financial institutions, but also other international and regional 
organizations. The existence of this diverse array of international organizations necessarily 
entails cooperative efforts among them and among their various agencies and mechanisms. 
International organizations and Member States cooperate on various levels in line with the 
objectives of consistency, synergy and effectiveness. The term &#8213;multi-multilateralism&#8214; 
highlights the difficulties involved in such an undertaking, since so many institutional and 
sociological factors come into play.  
</p>
<p>30. Besides this supranational dimension, cooperation also involves States and groups of 
States, whether on a bilateral or a multilateral basis. This is where work to identify best 
practices would be the most useful. However, as noted earlier, public cooperation has itself 
become more diverse, as the decentralization of cooperation arrangements has shifted the 
emphasis towards local authorities or parliamentary diplomacy based on cooperation 
between national parliaments.  
</p>
<p>31. National human rights institutions are a third type of stakeholder that should be 
recognized as a category in their own right, located as they are at the intersection between </p>


<p>public authorities and civil society. Given their independent nature and their influential 
position within their own country, these institutions make it possible to develop and 
implement measures to promote effective and active cooperation among the various 
stakeholders at the national and regional as well as the international levels.  
</p>
<p>32. International cooperation is no longer the preserve of the State alone. It has taken on 
a transnational dimension that encompasses economic actors, as represented by the business 
world and trade unions, and civil society actors, non-governmental organizations, 
associations, religious organizations and different schools of thought. The increasingly 
structured partnership that the United Nations and other international organizations have 
established with these different non-State actors adds a new dimension to international 
cooperation. However, it must be acknowledged that international bodies view the purpose 
of this partnership in terms of information, consultation, participation, and even 
outsourcing, rather than in terms of joint decision-making, joint management or joint 
responsibility.  
</p>
<p>33. One last dimension remains to be considered: the relations between non-State actors 
which are governed by private international law and those regulated by special systems 
such as those used in the world of sport. In this connection, the international crisis has only 
served to highlight the importance of ensuring that these private entities are governed by 
international standards, given that States are bound to respect, protect and implement all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms without any discrimination or bias. There is an 
ongoing risk that international human rights law could be &#8213;privatized&#8214; through the 
substitution of voluntary standards for the international <i>erga omnes</i> obligations by which 
the international community is bound.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Forms of international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>34. The aims of international cooperation are as varied as the subjects involved; hence 
the need for international organizations. International cooperation cuts across all aspects of 
international relations; it is not limited to the areas of &#8213;economic and social cooperation&#8214; 
enumerated in the Charter. For a long time, the notion of cooperation was associated with 
economic development and technical assistance, as may be seen from the provisions of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. However, judicial 
cooperation has since become an important element of a broader concept linking the 
establishment of the rule of law, human rights and development in the context of both 
training and legislation. At another level, cooperation goes hand in hand with the 
codification and progressive development of international law. The fight against terrorism 
has highlighted the importance of cooperation in judicial and police matters. Meanwhile 
efforts to promote cultural cooperation, a matter that falls within the purview of the United 
Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), have led to progress in 
human rights education and training and in the fight against racism and all forms of 
discrimination. The recent calls for cooperation among civilizations, cultures and religions 
form part of this logic. Lastly, these various elements of international cooperation would be 
meaningless without political cooperation, which is at the very heart of bilateral or 
multilateral diplomacy. 
</p>
<p>35. The idea of international cooperation cannot be reduced to a mere juxtaposition of 
national interests or the logic of power relations. It is based on at least three basic 
assumptions. First, it assumes the existence of a genuine partnership and a shared 
undertaking. The partnership must be based on recognition of the equal sovereignty of 
States, and yet, as we know, sovereignty, by its very nature, entails making a commitment 
and accepting the limits of sovereignty. It is difficult to imagine cooperation without 
reciprocity, since otherwise, what we are discussing is a form of assistance, not an 
association of equals. Each State must be a full partner in a cooperative effort and must </p>


<p>have a sense of involvement in and ownership of the undertaking. International cooperation 
between different kinds of entities, such as international organizations and non-State actors, 
involves different types of partnerships and is based on a recognition of their respective 
areas of competence and responsibility. Cooperation should not detract from the neutrality 
and impartiality of institutional mechanisms or of procedures for consultation with 
independent experts. 
</p>
<p>36. Cooperation also entails participation in a process. It is true that international 
cooperation pays a role in emergencies, such as a humanitarian disaster or an influx of 
refugees. More often, however, it is a longer-term process in which the parties work 
together to implement a policy, an agreement, an action plan or a programme or, in any 
event, to take action within a general framework with well-defined stages, objectives, 
indicators and assessment criteria. In other words, cooperation is not an end in itself but a 
means to an end. It is a way of mobilizing joint efforts with the aim of achieving an 
objective. Transparency, accountability and periodic assessments, which are essential 
features of this ongoing process, serve the purpose of measuring the results. Other 
assessment methods include studies conducted by external bodies and periodic reports. 
</p>
<p>37. Lastly, the idea of cooperation conveys some sense of a &#8213;shared ideal&#8214;. It is not just 
a matter of relations of good neighbourliness, coexistence or reciprocity, but rather of a 
willingness to look beyond mutual interests in order to advance the general interest. To 
cooperate is not just to choose dialogue over confrontation; it is to act together in pursuit of 
a common goal. The idea of international cooperation presupposes the existence of an 
international community that transcends the relations between States. It is in this sphere that 
the importance of international cooperation in the field of human rights becomes fully 
apparent, in that cooperation becomes inseparable from the realization of the common ideal 
set out in the Charter of the United Nations of 1945 and the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights of 1948. In the absence of an embryonic international community, it is 
Member States that assume responsibility, jointly and severally, for guaranteeing the rights 
so solemnly proclaimed in these instruments. 
</p>
<p>38. It remains to be seen how these principles of legal argument, which are derived from 
the notion of international cooperation itself, carry over into positive law. Article 56 of the 
Charter calls on all Member States to pledge themselves &#8213;to take joint and separate action 
in co-operation with the Organization&#8214; for the achievement of the purposes set forth in the 
preceding Article, particularly those of ensuring &#8213;universal respect for, and observance of, 
human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, 
or religion&#8214; (Art. 55 (c)). 
</p>
<p>39. Other specific obligations relating to other protagonists or other forms of 
international cooperation have been established within this general framework. Cases in 
point are the obligations assumed within other international organizations, particularly at 
the regional level, or through networks that are established after bilateral friendship or 
cooperation treaties are concluded. The strict definition of international cooperation and 
related legal obligations should not be allowed to obscure a broader vision of the notion of 
cooperation. As already indicated, cooperation cannot be reduced to a call for dialogue and 
coexistence or to the contrast between mutual understanding and confrontation. The 
establishment of dialogue can be a first step towards genuine cooperation, however. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International cooperation in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>40. This is the first area to look to for best practices for enhancing international 
cooperation, even if these practices do not necessarily encompass all the different elements 
of the ideal model just described and even if their focus is generally limited to the overall 
&#8213;effectiveness&#8214; of the system in place. The idea is not just to promote but also to ensure the </p>


<p>effective protection of human rights. Indeed, it is the entire system of human rights 
diplomacy, including the legal policies of States and the action programmes of international 
organizations, on which attention must be focused with a view to the development of a truly 
collective human rights strategy. 
</p>
<p>41. The first priority should be securing the universal application of international human 
rights instruments in line with the objective established at the Vienna World Conference on 
Human Rights. In this connection, the twentieth anniversary of the Conference could serve 
as an opportunity to review progress on the commitments made there. The process of 
achieving universal ratification should be stepped up, and awareness-raising activities 
should be directed towards eliminating the remaining obstacles to effective universal 
ratification. Moreover, a &#8213;reservations dialogue&#8214; should be launched to persuade States to 
withdraw reservations that serve no purpose and, above all, to refrain from entering 
reservations that are contrary to the purposes and objectives of the treaty concerned. These 
initiatives could be undertaken in the framework of the United Nations, but they could also 
be pursued at the regional level or in the context of a political dialogue between States, such 
as the dialogue being carried on by the European Union and China concerning various 
international covenants. 
</p>
<p>42. In addition to the ratification of treaties and their optional protocols, priority should 
be given to ensuring the effective application of treaties in the domestic arena through 
awareness-raising, training and information-sharing efforts, which may include sending 
experts on visits and carrying out institutional capacity-building projects and educational 
and knowledge-sharing activities. 
</p>
<p>43. An aspect of international cooperation that is still all too often neglected is the role 
of regional systems. In addition to the reports submitted by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), exchanges between rapidly developing 
regional systems should be encouraged by the United Nations in order to promote the 
exchange of experiences and the creation of synergies. Account being taken of the rule of 
<i>lis pendens</i>, the effectiveness of international cooperation could not but be enhanced if a 
system were to be established that allowed for information-sharing or coordination between 
global, regional and national monitoring bodies. Such a system, which should not, of 
course, encroach on such bodies&#8217; respective mandates, could be modelled on the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. The experiences of ILO and UNESCO in carrying out certain 
joint monitoring activities should be evaluated systematically and then applied to regional 
organizations, if and where appropriate. Lessons should be learned from the experience of 
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in conducting electoral and 
judicial monitoring that can then be used to strengthen international standards and facilitate 
coordination of field operations. Lastly, more emphasis should be placed on active 
participation by regional organizations in the work of United Nations bodies. 
</p>
<p>44. States furthermore have a duty to cooperate fully with monitoring bodies. It is 
surprising that there are still Member States that have not issued a standing invitation to the 
special procedures and that quite a number of States do not respond to urgent appeals or 
requests for information submitted by mandate holders. States should take joint 
responsibility for strengthening the human resources on which the treaty bodies can draw to 
carry out their work, whether with regard to State party reports or the consideration of 
individual communications. 
</p>
<p>45. An important aspect of cooperation is the follow-up given to recommendations, 
which requires the involvement of the State party concerned and also of other stakeholders. 
Mobilization of the relevant stakeholders and consultation with them are just as important 
as technical and financial assistance in implementing such recommendations. To that end, </p>


<p>the recommendations themselves should be clearly formulated. Moreover, the procedure for 
dealing with cases of continued non-cooperation must be effective. 
</p>
<p>46. One of the available mechanisms for this purpose is the Voluntary Fund for 
Financial and Technical Assistance, which was established by the Human Rights Council 
through resolution 6/17 to help countries implement the recommendations emanating from 
the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>47. A finding that a failing or violation has occurred should result not only in a 
declaration of culpability &#8212; a measure that in too many cases seems to be simply a matter 
of form &#8212; but also in legal action being taken and technical assistance provided to improve 
the situation on the ground; this is the procedure in effect at ILO. A fortiori, the complaints 
procedure should be reformed in order to enable the Human Rights Council to take 
effective and specific steps whenever the Working Group on Communications apprises it of 
cases of systematic violations. The Council could then function as an early warning 
mechanism. 
</p>
<p>48. International cooperation in the field of human rights also takes place within the 
international criminal justice system. In this regard, States&#8217; cooperation with the 
International Criminal Court is essential to expedite the prosecution and conviction of 
Rome Statute crimes.  
</p>
<p>49. In order to strengthen international cooperation, a review of the consultative status 
of non-governmental organizations is also called for. It is difficult to speak of a partnership 
when the NGO committee is made up entirely of Member States, without appropriate 
participation by non-governmental organizations themselves. A mixed parity-based system 
or a system of genuine tripartism, which includes independent experts serving as a neutral 
party, would be a definite improvement. The ritual call for the participation of all 
&#8213;stakeholders&#8214; does not suffice to support the vital role of non-governmental organizations 
in defending human rights across the world. Efforts should be made to achieve better 
synergies with independent non-governmental organizations in the area of information 
exchange and shared initiatives, and also by taking actions on the ground. 
</p>
<p>50. Lastly, international cooperation in the field of human rights is not the exclusive 
domain of multilateral diplomacy; it also relates to the work of the United Nations on the 
ground. In this connection, systematic assessments should be undertaken to determine how 
effective the local missions of the United Nations Development Programme, the human 
rights centres established by OHCHR and peacekeeping operations are in protecting and 
promoting human rights and in upholding humanitarian law. It is vitally important to define 
compliance objectives from the outset so as to ensure that respect for human rights is fully 
integrated into United Nations activities and, in particular, to assess results. A solemn 
declaration by the Secretary-General formally reaffirming the commitment of the United 
Nations to international human rights principles and obligations would be an important step 
towards making the Organization a full stakeholder in the application of rules adopted 
under its auspices. Such a declaration could also reaffirm the importance of various forms 
of institutional, bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> C. International cooperation and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>51. No discussion of human rights in the context of international cooperation should 
focus solely on human rights as such. In addition to the question of strengthening 
international cooperation in the field of human rights, human rights issues in all areas where 
international cooperation takes place should be examined using a cross-cutting approach &#8211; a 
form of mainstreaming. The existing situation remains somewhat paradoxical. On the one 
hand, States have undertaken international obligations and businesses have made voluntary </p>


<p>pledges in the framework of the Global Compact. On the other hand, international 
organizations remain in a kind of limbo, bound by no authoritative body of human rights 
law. The fact that States are sometimes sanctioned on the basis of the binding decisions of 
an international organization which does not itself have to answer for its own actions points 
up a highly regrettable legal vacuum. The centrality of human rights in international 
cooperation must be reaffirmed through the mainstreaming of human rights issues in all 
cooperation policies.  
</p>
<p>52. The negative impact of certain policies on human rights must not be ignored. The 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has expressed its views, in a general 
comment, on the impact of sanctions on the effective enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights. This issue needs to be addressed more broadly to allow for a systematic 
examination of the impact of structural adjustment strategies, international cooperation 
policies or certain forms of conditionality on the effective enjoyment of human rights, 
particularly by vulnerable groups and marginalized individuals.  
</p>
<p>53. Efforts to promote sustainable development and address the imperatives of human 
security must be supported. This is the thrust of the proposals made by the Secretary-
General in his report entitled &#8213;In larger freedom: towards development, security and human 
rights for all&#8214; (A/59/2005), in which he explored the close link between security, 
development and human rights. A joint initiative of the United Nations and ILO would be 
particularly worth pursuing in order to ensure that human rights are given a proper place in 
efforts to reconstruct the global system in the wake of the 2008 crisis. However, too low a 
priority continues to be accorded to &#8213;globalization with a human face&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>54. Immigration and its many aspects are currently the focus of worldwide attention. 
There are many historical, social and economic causes of this phenomenon. Cooperation is 
necessary in this domain to ensure that human rights are respected by the various States 
concerned.  
</p>
<p>55. Furthermore, States should foster the emergence of conditions favourable to 
development. Giving effect to the right to development is one means of achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals. The realization of this right at the international level starts 
with a commitment from OHCHR and continues with, inter alia, the establishment of 
partnerships and cooperation programmes, particularly for technical cooperation, as well as 
information and educational activities.  
</p>
<p>56. There is also a need for a clearer delineation of the relationship between human 
security and international cooperation in relation to confidence-building, security measures, 
arms controls, the implementation of humanitarian law and the workings of the criminal 
justice system. The experience of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, 
which, from the very beginning, established that there was a close link between security, 
cooperation and the &#8213;human dimension&#8214;, would repay further study, as it could be of help 
in identifying best practices and exploring the importance of linkages between human rights 
and cooperation and the limitations of this sort of conditionality. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Future prospects  
</b></p>
<p>57. The intention is to focus on international cooperation in the field of human rights 
without at this stage addressing the question of the place of human rights in international 
cooperation, including the sensitive issue of conditionality. The role of human rights in 
international aid to development would require an empirical assessment, in particular with 
regard to the scope and the modalities of such aid. </p>


<p>58. The emphasis should be on the United Nations human rights system, although 
coordination within the United Nations family and cooperation with other international and 
regional organizations have lost none of their relevance and should be used to open the way 
for consultations with stakeholders. Moreover, priority should be given to relations between 
States, bearing in mind their obligations under the Charter, particularly Articles 55 and 56, 
in which &#8213;Members pledge themselves [&#8230;] to take joint and separate action in co-operation 
with the Organization&#8214; for the achievement of the purposes set forth in the preceding 
Article, particularly those of ensuring &#8213;universal respect for, and observance of, human 
rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or 
religion&#8214;. These provisions are of such central importance that the commentary by Hans 
Kelsen on the Charter of the United Nations presents all human rights developments, 
beginning with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, under the rubric of 
&#8213;international cooperation&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>59. An examination of the main reference texts make it clear that the legal obligation of 
Member States to &#8213;take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization&#8214; has 
become more diverse and multifaceted over the 60 years that have passed since it was 
established. All the stakeholders in the contemporary human rights protection process are 
called upon to participate in this system of international cooperation, which involves a 
multiplicity of actors, while bearing in mind the respective functions and responsibilities of 
the different stakeholders. While the very notion of international cooperation in the strict 
sense of the term implies a willingness to work together on an equal footing in order to 
realize a common ideal, more loosely defined forms of dialogue, communication and 
information-sharing could be useful preliminary steps in building mutual trust, provided 
that they are not considered as ends in themselves. Such a dialogue should not be 
monopolized by States and should include all components of civil society, beginning with 
NGOs. 
</p>
<p>60. There are many methods and measures that could help to enhance international 
cooperation in the field of human rights. They require the participation of a broad spectrum 
of stakeholders at the international, national and local levels. The universal ratification of 
treaties and their effective application in the domestic arena should be encouraged. 
Dialogue between States and monitoring bodies also plays an important role, and the latter 
must have the necessary means made available to them.
