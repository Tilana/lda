Petroleum
Lundin Petroleum is one of the 
largest independent oil companies 
in Europe. It has two strategic focus 
areas, Norway and South East Asia. 
Norway is of particular importance 
to Lundin Petroleum representing 
around 75 percent of its reserves and 
production. In addition to Norway, the 
Company has operations in France, 
the Netherlands, Russia, Malaysia and 
Indonesia.
Lundin Petroleum has operations 
throughout the entire upstream value 
chain; exploration, development 
and production. Finding oil through 
exploration is Lundin Petroleum’s 
core competence and the Company 
has developed a strategy which has 
been very successful in Norway. 
This strategy has been adopted 
throughout the Company and is also 
producing results in South East Asia 
and elsewhere.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Our Business 
Model 
Lundin Petroleum’s business 
model is to generate 
sustainable value through 
exploration and production 
of hydrocarbons in a 
responsible way.
Lundin Petroleum’s strategy of organic growth involves identifying 
core areas of focus and then establishing a team of professionals 
with experience in those areas to use the latest technologies 
to explore for oil and gas. Discoveries will be appraised, and 
where they are deemed to be economic, progressed through the 
development phase and into the production stage. The cash ﬂ ow 
generated from production will be reinvested in exploration and 
development. Lundin Petroleum believes that it is through the 
development of this business model that it has achieved success in 
the past and will continue to deliver positive results in the future.
Our Vision
Our vision is to grow a proﬁ table upstream exploration and 
production company, focused on core areas in a safe and 
environmentally responsible manner for the long term beneﬁ t of 
our shareholders and society.
Our Strategy
Our Responsibility
Lundin Petroleum is pursuing the following strategy:
· Proactively investing in exploration to organically grow its reserve
base. Lundin Petroleum has an inventory of drillable prospects 
with large upside potential and continues to actively pursue new 
exploration acreage in core areas.
· Growing its existing asset base with a proactive subsurface strategy
to enhance ultimate hydrocarbon recovery.
· Acquiring new hydrocarbon reserves, resources and exploration
acreage where opportunities exist to enhance value.
Lundin Petroleum is responsible towards:
· shareholders, to realise and sustain a good return on investment
and a continuing growth of its asset base.
· employees, to provide a safe and rewarding working environment. 
· host countries, owners of the resources, to ﬁ nd and produce oil
and gas professionally, efﬁ ciently and responsibly.
· local communities, to contribute to local development and higher
living standards.
· society, to contribute to wealth generation while minimising the
impact of our activities on the environment.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Value Creation 
through 
Organic Growth
Creative thinking
Lundin Petroleum focuses on building core exploration areas in speciﬁ c countries with a 
clear objective to grow organically. The strategy is to improve our technical understanding 
and thereby to develop new play concepts. This is achieved by using the best available 
technology including acquiring and processing 3D seismic and by building teams of 
talented and experienced people who are encouraged to think creatively and to challenge 
conventional theories in the search for new oil deposits.
Converting discoveries into reserves and production
Lundin Petroleum focuses on organically increasing its reserves base. Following exploration 
and appraisal, sustainable value is created through the conversion of discoveries into 
reserves and production. The strategy is to continuously optimise reserves and production 
throughout the life cycle of the asset by utilising the latest technologies and, above all, the 
expertise of skilled people.
Unlocking value
Throughout all stages of the business cycle, Lundin Petroleum seeks to deliver outstanding 
value to our shareholders. All elements of the asset portfolio are constantly reviewed 
to determine that their value is fully reﬂ ected in the Lundin Petroleum share price. If 
it is determined that the value of an asset is not being fully reﬂ ected within the Lundin 
Petroleum share price, Lundin Petroleum will review all available options to determine how 
to realise the full value of that asset.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Chief Executive Officer’s 
Review
I am very excited about the prospects for Lundin Petroleum 
as we embark on another year. Our primary objective 
remains that of building long term and sustainable value for 
our shareholders. In that respect we continue to be primarily 
focused upon the discovery of new hydrocarbon resources 
through our exploration drilling activities. This strategy has 
delivered extremely positive results over the past ten years 
and I remain conﬁ dent that we have the licences, people and 
ﬁ nancial resources to continue to ﬁ nd new ﬁ elds with the 
materiality to have a positive impact on our valuation. Our 
2014 exploration work programme, with particular focus 
on the Barents Sea, on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and 
offshore Sabah, Malaysia, is most prospective in my opinion.
Financial resources sufficient to fund activities for 
foreseeable future 
The primary source of funding for our development, 
appraisal and exploration programmes is operating cash 
ﬂ ow from our existing production. Our current production 
activities are Brent oil dominated with low operating costs 
and cash taxes which therefore generate high operating cash 
ﬂ ow. An operating cash ﬂ ow net back1 of USD 81.70 per 
barrel was achieved in 2013 generating operating cash ﬂ ow 
of close to USD 1 billion. I expect this to continue in 2014 
with operating cash ﬂ ow in excess of USD 1 billion.
Our other source of funding is bank borrowings. We have 
excellent support from our 25 international banks which 
have recently increased our revolving credit facility to USD 
4.0 billion to fund our ongoing development and exploration 
activities. This larger facility will improve our ﬁ nancial 
ﬂ exibility as the Johan Sverdrup development expenditures 
start to be incurred and allow us to continue our aggressive 
exploration programmes. We are now fully funded for the 
foreseeable future with sufﬁ cient contingency to deal with 
unforeseen circumstances.
Production to increase to over 75,000 boepd 
from ongoing projects
Our production for 2013 averaged 32,700 boepd and in 
general our production assets performed in accordance 
with our expectations with the exception of the Brynhild 
development where ﬁ rst oil has been delayed until the 
second quarter of 2014. Our production forecast for 2014 is 
between 30,000 and 35,000 boepd with the declines from our 
existing ﬁ elds offset by the new production from Brynhild. 
Our 2015 production will increase to approximately 50,000 
boepd with the start-up of production from the Bøyla, 
Bertam and Edvard Grieg ﬁ elds in 2015 and will increase to 
over 75,000 boepd by the end of 2015.

Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
Development projects on track
We have made good progress on all our development projects. 
I believe that the frustrating delays to our Brynhild project are 
behind us and that we can achieve our second quarter ﬁ rst oil 
forecast. The subsea installation work was completed last year. 
The modiﬁ cation work on the Haewene Brim FPSO has now been 
substantially completed and the vessel is now back on location at 
the Shell operated Pierce ﬁ eld in the UK North Sea.
Following approval of the Bertam development project offshore 
Malaysia in 2013, we are encouraged by the progress on Bertam. 
The contract for the offshore platform has been awarded to 
Malaysian yard TH Heavy Engineering (THHE) and construction 
activities are now ongoing. The Bertam project will also utilise our 
100 percent owned Ikdam FPSO which was redeployed to Malaysia 
following the cessation of production from our Oudna ﬁ eld, 
offshore Tunisia. The modiﬁ cation of the FPSO to enable the vessel 
to be ﬁ t for purpose for Bertam is ongoing at the Keppel shipyard 
in Singapore. Development drilling on Bertam will commence 
later this year. First oil from Bertam is expected in the ﬁ rst half of 
2015.
We are also making good progress with the Edvard Grieg project. 
The jacket is substantially complete and will be installed on 
location this spring with the pre-drilling of development wells 
to commence in the third quarter of 2014. The procurement for 
all topside equipment is complete and construction activities 
are advancing satisfactorily. The project remains on budget and 
schedule for ﬁ rst oil in late 2015.
Appraisal – Johan Sverdrup a unique asset 
The appraisal of the Johan Sverdrup ﬁ eld is substantially 
complete. The working operator Statoil recently announced an 
updated full ﬁ eld resource estimate of between 1.8 and 2.9 billion 
boe and that ﬁ rst oil was forecast for late 2019. The ﬁ nal concept 
development decision was taken by the partners in February 
2014. This is a huge project and it is important that the right 
investments are made today to maximise long term value. This 
has been done and I believe all Johan Sverdrup partners are fully 
aligned in this respect. It is extremely exciting to be a material 
partner in this project as it takes shape. The quality, location 
and size of Johan Sverdrup are unique for any company, not just 
Lundin Petroleum, and will ultimately deliver material long term 
value.
It is sometimes easy with the size of Johan Sverdrup to forget the 
rest of our appraisal portfolio. Over the last couple of years we 
have had exploration discoveries at Luno II and Gohta in Norway 
and Tembakau offshore Malaysia. We will be drilling appraisal 
wells on all these discoveries in 2014 with potential to almost 
double our existing reserves. None of our production forecasts 
assume any contribution from these potential developments.
have any material exposure through our drilling programme. Very 
simply this is inaccurate on both counts.
We announced late last year our 2014 exploration programme 
which will target over 600 MMboe (unrisked) during the year. I 
reiterate exploration remains a key focus for us not only this year 
but for the foreseeable future.
In Norway we believe that there are more hydrocarbons to be 
found in the Utsira High. We are at the forefront of exploration 
activity in the region and still have the largest acreage position 
as this area develops infrastructure with the Edvard Grieg and 
Johan Sverdrup developments proceeding. We are also very 
excited with progress in the Barents Sea which we see emerging 
as an oil producing province in the next few years. There have 
been a number of important discoveries in the Barents Sea in 
recent months including our Gohta success and we see a marked 
increase in activity in the region from the industry. Our acreage 
position is already signiﬁ cant and I was pleased that we were 
recently awarded an additional four licences in the latest APA 
2013 licensing round. Our objective is to be at the forefront of 
exploration activity in the Barents Sea in the next ﬁ ve years where 
we think there is the potential to discover large new oil resources.
Similarly in South East Asia, 2014 will be a busy year. Our 
strategy to acquire new 3D seismic in areas overlooked by the 
majors in recent years has already yielded positive results with 
Bertam moving into development and Tembakau likely to be 
developed. We will be drilling in Sabah this year where we believe 
there is potential to make large oil discoveries close to existing 
infrastructure. We are also enhancing our portfolio in frontier 
areas such as the Cendrawasih VII licence in eastern Indonesia 
which contains some very exciting structures which we hope to 
drill in 2015.
Responsible growth
In summary, Lundin Petroleum is in an excellent position. We 
are fully funded with exposure to major projects such as Johan 
Sverdrup in low political risk areas and which will produce Brent 
oil for many years to come. We commit to having in place the 
necessary measures to ensure that, wherever we operate, our 
activities have a beneﬁ cial socio-economic effect and a limited 
impact on the environment. The long term investments we 
are making today will in my opinion deliver long term value 
growth to our shareholders. I thank you for your conﬁ dence and 
continued support.
Yours Sincerely,
Exploration – Barents Sea to grow in importance.
I have received comments recently that Lundin Petroleum is no 
longer an exploration focused company and that we no longer

of finding new resources 
is the best way to create 
sustainable value, not only for 
our shareholders but also for 
the benefit of society
Ian H. Lundin
Chairman of the Board

Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
Chairman’s 
Statement
A very important milestone for Lundin Petroleum was 
achieved on February 13, 2014 when the ﬁ nal concept 
selection for Phase 1 of the giant Johan Sverdrup ﬁ eld’s 
development was announced by the licence holders. 
The announcement was the result of the close and 
successful cooperation between all stakeholders as 
well as more than three years of appraisal drilling, 
geological and geophysical evaluation, engineering and 
environmental impact studies in order to come up with 
the right development concept for the ﬁ eld.
The largest development project
Johan Sverdrup will be the largest development project 
on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) since the 
1980s. The ﬁ rst phase of the development is scheduled 
to start production in late 2019 and is forecast to have 
gross production capacity of between 315,000 and 
380,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd). 
When the ﬁ eld reaches its plateau production of 
550,000 to 650,000 boepd it will account for over 25 
percent of Norway’s total oil production. The gross 
capital investment for Phase 1 is between NOK 100 and 
120 billion (USD 16 and 20 billion).
For Norway, Johan Sverdrup will generate over USD 150 
billion in tax revenue during the life of the ﬁ eld 
and thousands of jobs for decades to come. With the 
discovery of Johan Sverdrup in 2010, Lundin Norway 
established itself as one of the leading players on the 
NCS.
Continued growth
Today, Lundin Norway is the second most active 
operator in Norway with 62 licences stretching from 
the southern NCS to the Barents Sea. The Company is 
operating two development projects: Brynhild which 
will start production in the second quarter of 2014 and 
Edward Grieg which will come on stream in late 2015. 
In addition, the Company has secured rig capacity 
to fulﬁ l all of its drilling obligations and more. The 
ongoing exploration drilling programme continues to 
deliver results with two more oil discoveries in 2013, 
one on the Utsira High known as Luno II and one in 
the Barents Sea known as Gohta. The Gohta discovery 
proved the existence of additional source rock in the 
Barents Sea and we strongly believe in the potential 
of ﬁ nding more oil in the area. As Lundin Norway 
is maturing into a fully integrated exploration and 
production company, we look toward the future with 
conﬁ dence as we continue to grow.
Ian H. Lundin (centre) with Torstein Sanness (right) and Hans Christen Rønnevik (left)
Lundin Petroleum’s operations in South East Asia and Europe 
are all progressing well. The Company’s ﬁ rst development 
project in Malaysia, the Bertam ﬁ eld, is expected to come on 
stream in 2015. There are multiple potential prospects to be 
drilled in the South East Asia drilling programme in 2014.
Creating sustainable value
Our exploration success in the past few years is the best proof 
of that Lundin Petroleum’s strategy of ﬁ nding new resources 
is the best way to create sustainable value, not only for our 
shareholders but also for the beneﬁ t of society. I believe 
that it is important not to lose sight of our core values and 
humble beginnings as we move forward. I also hope that the 
entrepreneurial spirit of our founder which the Company’s 
management has embraced so well will continue to drive our 
Company.
The oil and gas industry is facing a huge challenge in meeting 
global energy demand for hydrocarbons in an affordable, 
efﬁ cient and environmentally friendly way.
will play a big role in meeting these expectations but it will 
also mean that it will be more difﬁ cult to make investments 
in certain sensitive areas from an economic and regulatory 
standpoint. Oil and gas continue to be the fuel of choice for 
power, transportation as well as feedstock for chemicals and 
most synthetic products, but renewable energy is rapidly 
becoming more accessible and competitive. As environmental 
awareness is spreading alongside improved living standards, 
health and education, the world is indeed becoming a better 
place for future generations.
I would like to extend a special thank you to all the women and 
men at Lundin Petroleum who work diligently and with care for 
our environment, to ensure a healthy and auspicious future for 
the Company and for society at large. Finally, many thanks to 
you fellow shareholders for your continued support.
Our ambitions as well as society’s expectations with regards to 
health, safety and the environment are growing continuously 
which of course comes at a cost. Technological innovation

A Sustainable Approach
As a responsible company, Lundin Petroleum not only adheres 
to applicable legislation, but also strives to conduct its business 
in accordance with best industry practice and principles for 
corporate citizenship embodied in recognised international 
initiatives. The Company has integrated corporate responsibility 
commitments and strategies into its business through the 
adoption of relevant policies, guidelines and procedures and 
strives for continuous improvement.
Due to the nature of oil and gas operations, Lundin Petroleum 
has focused on putting in place and developing a robust 
health, safety and environmental (HSE) framework. Policies 
on health, safety and the environment set out the Company’s 
commitment in this area, and the Green Book, the Company’s 
HSE management system, ensures these policies translate into 
good practice. Lundin Petroleum’s employees worldwide are 
trained in the application of the Company’s Code of Conduct, 
corporate responsibility policies and the Green Book to ensure 
understanding and compliance.
As part of its proactive approach to provide a safe working 
environment, experiences and lessons learnt are reported 
and shared continuously throughout the Company. Lundin 
Petroleum has also strengthened and developed its risk 
management system, integrating this approach within the areas 
of operation. Since Lundin Petroleum was created in 2001, there 
have not been any work-related fatalities.

Sustainable Investments
In order to increase the scale and impact of Lundin Petroleum’s 
sustainable investment projects, the Company entered into a 
partnership with the Lundin Foundation in 2013. The Lundin 
Foundation is a philanthropic organisation founded originally 
by the Lundin family. The Foundation is currently supported 
by a number of publicly traded natural resource companies 
committed to the highest standards of corporate social 
responsibility. The Foundation provides risk capital, technical 
assistance, and strategic grants to outstanding social enterprises 
and organisations across the globe, with a view to contributing 
to sustained improvements in social and economic development.
Lundin Petroleum’s Contribution
Supplying the World with a Basic Resource
Oil remains the primary source of world energy consumption 
and is estimated to remain so for decades to come. The world’s 
annual oil consumption currently amounts to roughly 33 billion 
barrels. This means that to ensure the current level of oil supply, 
the world needs to replace 33 billion barrels of oil every year. 
To put this in context, the giant Johan Sverdrup ﬁ eld has an 
estimated resource range of between 1.8 and 2.9 billion boe. 
Only by increasing the production from existing discoveries, by 
using new methods and technology to develop oil deposits, or by 
making new oil discoveries, can the current level of oil supply 
be maintained.
Making new discoveries is Lundin Petroleum’s core competence. 
The oil discoveries that the Company has made in Norway will 
prolong the country’s oil production by many decades.
Social Development
An oil discovery is a great economic resource, creating wealth 
and jobs, beneﬁ ting not only Lundin Petroleum’s employees, 
their families, and shareholders but also the local communities 
and society as a whole.
Investments
Lundin Petroleum’s business generates income when oil is 
produced. The exploration and development phases on the 
other hand require large investments, in particular drilling and 
construction of facilities and infrastructure. The investment 
budget for Lundin Petroleum in 2014 has been set at USD 2.1 
billion.
Taxes and Licences
One of Lundin Petroleum’s main ﬁ nancial contributions to 
society comes through taxes, paid in the form of corporate 
and production tax on the sales proceeds from oil and gas 
production. For example, the giant Johan Sverdrup discovery 
made by Lundin Petroleum is expected to generate more than 
USD 150 billion in tax revenues during the life of the ﬁ eld.

exceeded reserves additions, resulting in a small reduction in 
reserves. However, in 2014 appraisal wells will be drilled on the 
Gohta, Luno II and Tembakau discoveries with the potential to 
add between 90 to 180 MMboe to the reserves base. In addition, 
Johan Sverdrup resources will be booked as reserves once a Plan 
of Development and Operations (PDO) and a Unit Operating 
Agreement are approved.
In 2013, 4.5 MMboe of new reserve additions were identiﬁ ed, 
resulting in a two percent increase in reserves when compared to 
2012, excluding 2013 production of 11.9 MMboe.
The Reserves Changes graph shows reserves additions related to 
the continued good performance of the Volund ﬁ eld in Norway, 
as well as the inclusion of a further two inﬁ ll wells in the 
Alvheim ﬁ eld in Norway. The Bertam development in Malaysia 
received Field Development Plan (FDP) approval in September 
2013. As a result of optimising fuel oil consumption, reserves in 
the Bertam ﬁ eld increased. These increases in reserves resulted in 
a reserves replacement ratio of 38 percent at end of 2013 when 
compared to a total production of 11.9 MMboe in 2013.
92 percent of the 194.1 MMboe of reserves is related to oil and 
NGL (natural gas liquids) reserves. Lundin Petroleum quotes all 
of its reserves in working interest barrels of oil equivalent. All 
reserves are independently audited by ERC-Equipoise Ltd. (ERCE).

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Contingent Resources
end 2013 excluding Johan Sverdrup
342 MMboe
Lundin Petroleum also has a number of discovered oil and 
gas resources which are classiﬁ ed as contingent resources. 
Contingent resources are known oil and gas resources not yet 
classiﬁ ed as reserves due to one or more contingencies. Work 
is continuously ongoing to remove these contingencies and to 
mature contingent resources into reserves.
Excluding the Johan Sverdrup ﬁ eld in Norway, Lundin 
Petroleum has contingent resources of 342 MMboe. In 2013, 
two new ﬁ elds were discovered in Norway. The Gohta and 
Luno II discoveries resulted in additional contingent resources 
of 66 MMboe and 22 MMboe respectively. Both ﬁ elds will 
be appraised in 2014. This increase was partly offset by the 
relinquishment of the Peik licence in Norway, resulting in a 
decrease of 8 MMboe of contingent resources.
All reported contingent resources have been audited internally 
by a qualiﬁ ed reserves auditor in accordance with the Canadian 
NI 51–101 and the COGE Handbook with the exception of the 
Salina discovery (7 MMboe) where the Norwegian Petroleum 
Directorate (NPD) estimate has been used.
Johan Sverdrup contingent resources have been excluded from 
Lundin Petroleum’s estimates at the end of 2013 pending the 
completion of the PDO and the Unit Operating Agreement. At 
the end of 2011 and 2012, contingent resource estimates for 
Johan Sverdrup were included. The ﬁ eld, which was discovered 
in 2010, contains gross contingent resources of between 1.8 
and 2.9 billion boe as disclosed at the end of 2013 by pre-unit 
working operator Statoil. The Johan Sverdrup ﬁ eld is situated 
in licences PL501, PL502 and PL265. Lundin Petroleum has a 40 
percent interest in PL501 and a 10 percent interest in PL265.
By the end of 2013, 20 wells and six sidetracks have been 
drilled on the Johan Sverdrup ﬁ eld. The ﬁ eld appraisal 
programme is now substantially complete. Two more 
appraisal wells will be drilled in 2014. A Phase 1 conceptual 
development decision was made in February 2014. Front End 
Engineering and Design (FEED) studies have been awarded and 
PDO approval is expected in 2015.
Lundin Petroleum has a substantial contingent resource 
portfolio which provides a strong resource base for future 
reserves and production growth.

Prospective Resources
targeted 2014 
600 MMboe
Lundin Petroleum’s business model is to grow organically 
through exploration. This means identifying and maturing 
exploration targets, drill exploration wells, appraise discoveries, 
develop and ﬁ nally produce. To be successful with this strategy, 
access to world class exploration acreage and ﬁ rst class people 
is essential. Lundin Petroleum has focused upon two core 
exploration areas, Norway and South East Asia.
In Norway, Lundin Petroleum is the second largest operated 
acreage holder after Statoil and has been the most successful 
explorer in the last 10 years. By the end of 2013 Lundin 
Petroleum has drilled 35 exploration wells resulting in 
14 commercial discoveries at a cumulative ﬁ nding cost of 
USD 0.5 per boe. Lundin Petroleum was awarded another nine 
new licences in the APA 2013 licensing round, increasing its 
total licence acreage to approximately 23,000 km2. In 2014, 
Lundin Petroleum is planning to drill six exploration wells in 
Norway, targeting over 370 MMboe of prospective resources. 
There will be continued exploration activity beyond 2014 in the 
Utsira High (Johan Sverdrup area) and the Barents Sea. Lundin 
Petroleum believes that the Barents Sea will become a major oil 
producing province.
Since South East Asia was established as a core area in 2008, 
Lundin Petroleum now has a total of 12 Production Sharing 
Contracts (PSC) in Malaysia and Indonesia. In Malaysia, Lundin 
Petroleum is the second largest acreage holder after Petronas 
with a total licence acreage of 34,000 km2. Six exploration wells 
are planned to be drilled in 2014, three in Malaysia and three in 
Indonesia, targeting 216 MMboe of prospective resources.
In 2013, Lundin Petroleum was awarded the Cendrawasih VII 
Block in east Indonesia. This frontier exploration Block has a 
proven petroleum system and is situated in a shallow water 
environment. Based on existing 2D and 3D seismic, several 
structures have been identiﬁ ed with multi-billion barrel oil and/
or multi-trillion cubic feet of gas potential.
 
Furthermore, one exploration well is planned to be drilled 
in France and ﬁ ve exploration wells are planned in the 
Netherlands.
Lundin Petroleum only discloses prospective resource estimates 
for those prospects that will be drilled in the following year. 
However, many more prospects and leads have been identiﬁ ed 
from the large exploration licence portfolio and are being 
matured to be drilled in future years. In Norway, rig capacity 
is already secured into 2017 to drill further exploration wells. 
In South East Asia, large areas of new 3D seismic have been 
acquired in the Company’s core areas to help mature additional 
prospectivity and will result in further exploration drilling.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Production
Performance 2013
32,700 boepd
Forecast 2014
30,000–35,000 boepd
Once the Edvard Grieg field 
reaches plateau production, 
Lundin Petroleum’s net 
production is forecast to exceed 
75,000 boepd.
Lundin Petroleum produced 11.9 MMboe during 2013 at an 
average rate of 32,700 boepd. In early 2013, production for the 
full year was forecast to be between 33,000 and 38,000 boepd. 
Continued strong production in the Volund ﬁ eld was partly offset 
by lower than expected production from the Alvheim ﬁ eld in 
Norway as a result of integrity issues in three production wells. 
However, production was mainly impacted in the fourth quarter 
2013 by delays in the startup of the Brynhild ﬁ eld in Norway. 
Furthermore, onset of water production in the Volund ﬁ eld 
resulted in lower than expected production for the fourth quarter.
Lundin Petroleum’s production forecast for 2014 is in the range of 
30,000 to 35,000 boepd, at similar levels to 2013. Good production 
is expected from the Alvheim ﬁ eld with two wells expected to 
come back on stream in April 2014 following work-over. Further 
drilling on the Alvheim ﬁ eld is expected in 2014 and 2015, which 
will only contribute to production in 2015 and beyond. The 
Brynhild ﬁ eld is expected to come on stream in the second quarter 
2014. In total four wells will be drilled on the Brynhild ﬁ eld.
Development of the Bøyla and Edvard Grieg ﬁ elds are progressing 
according to schedule. Production start for the Bøyla ﬁ eld is 
expected in the ﬁ rst quarter 2015 and for the Edvard Grieg ﬁ eld, 
in the fourth quarter 2015. The Bertam ﬁ eld development plan 
was approved by Petronas in September 2013. Wellhead platform 
construction and FPSO repair and life extension work are ongoing 
and production start is expected in the second quarter 2015. These 
development projects will increase production to a 2015 average of 
approximately 50,000 boepd. Once the Edvard Grieg ﬁ eld reaches 
plateau production Lundin Petroleum’s net production is forecast 
to exceed 75,000 boepd.
The giant oil ﬁ eld Johan Sverdrup, with production start planned 
in late 2019, has the potential to quadruple the current net 
production when it reaches plateau production. This excludes 
any contribution from the rest of the contingent resource base, or 
any contribution from the exploration wells Lundin Petroleum is 
planning to drill.

2P Reserves
Lundin Petroleum calculates reserves and resources 
according to 2007 Petroleum Resources Management 
System (PRMS) Guidelines of the Society of Petroleum 
Engineers (SPE), World Petroleum Congress (WPC), American 
Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) and Society of 
Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE) and in compliance 
with the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook 
(COGE Handbook) and the Canadian National Instrument 
51–101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities. 
Lundin Petroleum’s reserves are audited by ERC-Equipoise 
Ltd. (ERCE), an independent reserves auditor. Reserves 
are deﬁ ned as those quantities of petroleum which are 
anticipated to be commercially recovered from known 
accumulations from a given date forward. Estimation 
of reserves is inherently uncertain and to express an 
uncertainty range, reserves are subdivided in Proved, 
Probable and Possible categories. Lundin Petroleum reports 
its reserves as Proved plus Probable (2P) reserves.
Proved reserves are those quantities of 
petroleum which, by analysis of geological 
and engineering data, can be estimated with 
reasonable certainty to be commercially 
recoverable, from a given date forward, 
from known reservoirs and under current 
economic conditions, operating methods 
and governmental regulations. Proved 
reserves can be categorised as developed 
or undeveloped. If deterministic methods 
are used, the term reasonable certainty 
is intended to express a high degree of 
conﬁ dence that the quantities will be 
recovered. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent 
probability that the quantities actually 
recovered will equal or exceed the estimates.
Resources Defined
Contingent Resources
Prospective Resources
Probable reserves are those 
unproved reserves which analysis 
of geological and engineering data 
suggests are more likely than not 
to be recoverable. In this context, 
when probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 
50 percent probability that the 
quantities actually recovered 
will equal or exceed the sum of 
estimated Proved plus Probable 
reserves.
Contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of 
a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations 
using established technology or technology under development, but 
are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to 
one or more contingencies. Contingencies may include factors such 
as economic, legal, environmental, technical, political and regulatory 
matters or a lack of markets. There is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable for the Company to produce any portion of the 
contingent resources.
Prospective resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, 
as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered 
accumulations by application of future development projects. 
Prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery 
and chance of development. There is no certainty that any portion of 
the prospective resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is no 
certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of 
the prospective resources.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Oil Market 
Overview
Oil Market – Words from the CEO 
As we have forecast, Brent oil prices have remained 
comfortably above USD 100 per barrel and I personally 
expect this to continue. The shale oil revolution in the 
United States continues to deliver increased oil supplies 
but geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East and North 
Africa continues to have a negative impact on supply. 
The Chinese economy has slowed but growth levels still 
remain high with continued strong commodity demand 
including oil. This Chinese demand coupled with, in my 
view, better demand than forecast from the developed 
world will ensure that oil prices remain ﬁ rm.
Prices will also be supported by the high levels of cost 
prevalent in our industry which over recent years 
have squeezed proﬁ tability margins. The level of cost 
inﬂ ation we have experienced over the last 10 years is not 
sustainable and will have an impact on future production 
as certain projects are deemed uneconomic.
C. Ashley Heppenstall
President and CEO
Population and Economic Growth
Both population and economic growth play a critical role in 
inﬂ uencing the demand for oil and oil products, particularly 
in developing countries where energy consumption levels are 
much lower relative to those observed in the developed world.
In 1960, the world’s population stood at three billion people 
and by the turn of the century that had doubled to six billion. 
Likewise long term trend economic growth has continued 
unabated averaging around two percent per annum in 
developed countries and six percent per annum in developing 
countries over the past decade. Looking ahead, by 2035 the 
population of the world is expected to grow to more than eight 
billion people accompanied by long term trend GDP growth 
rates of between two and three percent per annum.
Given that future growth is being driven by developing 
countries undergoing the process of industrialisation, the 
energy intensity of those countries is likely to increase with an 
expected narrowing of the gap in oil consumption per capita 
compared with developed countries. Developed countries 
consume more than ﬁ ve times the amount of those living in the 
developing world.
It presents a major challenge to the energy industry to deliver 
the supply required to meet this growing demand for oil, 
particularly when comparing the track record of the industry in 
replacing the oil it produces.

Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
Oil Consumption and Discoveries
Over the last decade the world’s new oil discoveries amount 
to approximately one third of the oil consumed. In the long 
run this will become challenging to sustain and can only be 
managed through a combination of developing new methods 
to use the energy consumed more efﬁ ciently and by increasing 
efforts to explore for and ﬁ nd new resource deposits or by 
reducing the demand for oil.
Lundin Petroleum remains conﬁ dent that this combination 
of macro-economic and supply side challenges will continue 
to provide long term support for oil prices. In terms of rising 
to meet the supply side challenge the industry faces, Lundin 
Petroleum continues to demonstrate an ability to do so by 
growing its reserves and resource base, which is expected to 
lead to a more than doubling of current production levels by the 
end of 2015 and quadrupling by the time that Johan Sverdrup 
reaches plateau production. Doing so within a climate of strong 
commodity prices will naturally lead to long term value creation 
for shareholders.

Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
Exploring for
Resources
Oil and gas exploration is Lundin Petroleum’s 
core competence. By constantly questioning 
and reevaluating established ways of 
analysing geological data, Lundin Petroleum 
has proven its ability to ﬁ nd new resources.
Lundin Petroleum places great trust in 
and responsibility upon its employees. 
The Company’s success is attributable to 
its talented teams of professionals with 
experience and considerable technological 
and geological expertise. Lundin Petroleum 
uses conventional methods and available 
data, but its integrated teams of geologists, 
geophysicists and technical experts have 
produced a creative way of analysing this 
information and thereby adapting a visionary 
approach to oil and gas exploration. Lundin 
Petroleum’s exploration strategy is to apply 
each individual’s professional and personal 
strengths into the organisation, and to 
actively encourage innovative thinking. Each 
exploration team is assembled to ensure 
multi-discipline exploration expertise. The 
working environment is based on joint efforts 
and is not measured individually, but rather 
at the company level.
Lundin Petroleum drilled 16 exploration and 
appraisal wells in 2013 and has plans to drill 
over 20 in 2014.
Developing
Resources
Producing
Reserves
Based on the results from its exploration and 
appraisal drilling, Lundin Petroleum creates a 3D 
simulation model of the reservoir as accurately 
as possible. Thereafter the Company establishes a 
conceptual development plan.
After exploration, appraisal and development, 
Lundin Petroleum enters into the production phase. 
The production phase is deﬁ ned as everything from 
extraction and processing to delivering the oil or gas 
for sale.
The plan sets out how to best manage the reservoir 
for production. It includes a programme for how to 
extract hydrocarbons as efﬁ ciently as possible from 
the reservoir, a plan for the engineering and design 
of all surface and subsurface facilities as well as 
infrastructure to deliver the resources. The
development plan also details all safety procedures 
and ensures that the environmental impact will be 
minimal.
Lundin Petroleum uses the best available 
technologies throughout this process in order to 
minimise all risks. Once a conceptual development 
plan has been approved by partners and it is 
demonstrated that resources can be recovered 
commercially, the resources in the ﬁ eld may be 
reclassiﬁ ed as reserves. Contracts can then be 
awarded for drilling, construction and installation of 
all facilities. During the construction phase Lundin 
Petroleum works closely with its partners and 
contractors with the common objective to deliver the 
components on schedule and within budget.
The installation phase involves transporting the 
facilities that have been constructed to a chosen 
location and assembling them on site. Thereafter, 
wells and infrastructure are connected to the 
facilities and production can begin.
Lundin Petroleum is currently constructing oil and 
gas production facilities in Norway, Malaysia and 
France.
Lundin Petroleum uses the income from its 
production assets to ﬁ nance its core activity, the 
exploration of new oil and gas resources. However, 
as the Edvard Grieg and Johan Sverdrup discoveries 
are developed and put into production, the focus on 
production operations will become more prominent. 
Production in Norway is increasing and has the 
potential to quadruple current net production when 
Johan Sverdrup reaches plateau production.
Whereas Lundin Petroleum’s exploration model 
is based on creativity and innovative analysis of 
geological information, its production operations 
rely upon proven methods in the industry with the 
use of best available technology and best practice. 
Lundin Petroleum aims to efﬁ ciently produce from 
each ﬁ eld and maximise the total quantity of oil or 
gas produced from the ﬁ eld. This requires thorough 
analysis during the development and production 
phase and can involve enhanced recovery methods, 
for example injecting water to sweep the oil towards 
selected production points.
The Company places great emphasis on safety. 
Operations are carried out with human, technical 
and organisational barriers in place, so that a breach 
of a single barrier cannot alone lead to any harm to 
people, the environment or the Company’s assets.

OPERATIONS – NORWAY
Norway
Norway is Lundin Petroleum’s 
principal area of operation. Lundin 
Petroleum’s strategy of organic 
growth has led to a portfolio of 
Norwegian licences comprising 
the full spectrum of exploration, 
appraisal, development and 
production assets.
Norway Operations
Lundin Petroleum entered Norway in 2003 and since then 
has built a leading acreage position including 62 licences 
focused in a number of core areas with activities within 
licences comprising exploration, appraisal, development and 
production. The exploration success in Norway has led to 
the Brynhild and Edvard Grieg developments and the 2013 
exploration programme resulted in additional discoveries in 
Luno II and Gohta. Both of these discoveries will be appraised 
during 2014. The Norwegian portfolio is dominated by the giant 
Johan Sverdrup ﬁ eld, discovered by Lundin Petroleum in 2010. 
The Johan Sverdrup ﬁ eld extends over three licences, PL501 
(WI 40%), PL265 (WI 10%) and PL502 and the ﬁ eld is therefore 
subject to a unitisation process which will determine the 
resource allocation to the licence partners. Following the drilling 
of 20 appraisal wells on the Johan Sverdrup ﬁ eld, Statoil, the 
working operator, announced a full ﬁ eld gross contingent 
resource range of 1.8 to 2.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent 
(boe) representing one of the top ﬁ ve discoveries made on the 
Norwegian Continental Shelf.
2013
2012
Six exploration wells and ﬁ ve appraisal wells are planned to be 
drilled in Norway in 2014.
Norway continues to represent the majority of Lundin 
Petroleum’s operational activities with production from Norway 
during 2013 accounting for 73 percent of total 2013 production 
and reserves at the end of 2013 accounting for 76 percent of 
total reserves. Lundin Petroleum’s contingent resources are also 
concentrated in Norway with 39 percent 1 of total contingent 
resources at the end of 2013 and thus underpinning Norway as 
the major production contributor for Lundin Petroleum in the 
years to come. Over the next three years, the majority of Lundin 
Petroleum’s development expenditure is anticipated to be 
channelled into Norwegian development projects.
Production
The production from the Norwegian assets delivered an 
annual average production rate of 23,900 boepd during 2013. 
Anticipated natural decline from the Alvheim and Volund 
reservoirs resulted in the reduction in production from 2012 
to 2013. The production was also impacted by three Alvheim 
wells being shut-in for a signiﬁ cant part of 2013 as well as the 
Alvheim FPSO being shut-in for maintenance for nine days in 
2013.
Alvheim
The net production from the Alvheim ﬁ eld (WI 15%) during 
2013 was 10,500 boepd, a decrease of 11 percent relative to 
2012. Overall the Alvheim ﬁ eld has outperformed expectations. 
However, during 2013 the ﬁ eld has produced below expectations 
due to three producing wells being shut-in for a large part 
of the year due to well integrity issues. One well was put 
back into production in late 2013 with the remaining two 
wells expected to be back on stream during April 2014. The 
2013 production underperformance will have no impact on 
the ultimate recoverable reserves from the ﬁ eld. By the end 
of 2013 the water-cut on the ﬁ eld had reached around 50 
percent. The ﬁ eld’s gross ultimate recoverable reserves have 
increased from 184 MMboe, at the time of the development

plan approval, to 307 MMboe driven by better than expected 
reservoir performance coupled with two new inﬁ ll wells drilled 
in 2011 and two further wells drilled in 2012. An additional 
three inﬁ ll wells are scheduled to be drilled in 2014 and 2015 
with the ﬁ rst of these expected to come onstream in early 2015. 
The gross contingent resources associated with the Alvheim 
ﬁ eld amounted to 41 MMboe at the end of 2013 and represent 
possible inﬁ ll targets for future production wells. In January 
2013, the Alvheim partnership was awarded additional acreage 
to the north of the Alvheim ﬁ eld through the APA 2012 
licensing round, adding growth potential to the asset through 
securing near-ﬁ eld acreage to unlock additional drilling targets. 
The cost of operations for the Alvheim ﬁ eld for 2013 was USD 5 
per barrel excluding one-off project related costs.
Volund 
The Volund ﬁ eld (WI 35%) achieved average net production 
of 12,200 boepd during 2013. The production during 2013 
exceeded expectations due to a combination of better than 
expected reservoir performance and Alvheim FPSO uptime. 
An additional Volund well commenced production in early 
2013. Since commencing production in 2010 the reservoir 
performance from the Volund ﬁ eld has exceeded expectations 
and as a result the gross reserves has increased from 50 MMboe 
at the time of submitting the plan of development for the ﬁ eld 
to 66 MMboe at the end of 2013. During 2014 certain long-lead 
items will be ordered to progress plans for two new potential 
inﬁ ll wells on the Volund ﬁ eld which may be drilled during 
2015. The cost of operations for the Volund ﬁ eld during 2013 
was below USD 2.5 per barrel.
Gaupe
First production from the Gaupe ﬁ eld (WI 40%) was achieved in 
the ﬁ rst quarter of 2012. Production from the Gaupe ﬁ eld has 
been below forecast since the commencement of production. 
Technical analysis indicates that the two production wells are 
connected to lower hydrocarbon volumes than was forecast 
prior to production start-up due to compartmentalisation of the
producing reservoir. Consequently the net reserves have been 
reduced to 0.2 MMboe and production is expected to cease in 
2014.

Edvard Grieg plan of development in June 2012.
The Edvard Grieg ﬁ eld is estimated to contain 186 MMboe of 
gross reserves with ﬁ rst production expected in late 2015 and 
forecast gross peak production of approximately 100,000 boepd. 
The gross capital cost of the Edvard Grieg ﬁ eld development 
is estimated at NOK 25 billion (USD 4 billion) which includes 
the building of a production and processing platform, oil and 
gas pipelines and the drilling of 15 wells. Contracts have been 
awarded to Kværner covering engineering, procurement and 
construction of the jacket and the topsides for the platform. 
Rowan Companies has been awarded a contract for a jack up rig 
to drill the development wells and Saipem has been awarded the 
contract for marine installation. The development is progressing 
according to schedule and the construction work on the jacket 
which commenced in 2012 is ongoing and is scheduled to be 
completed and installed during the spring of 2014. During 2013 
a plan for installation and operation (PIO) for the oil and gas 
export pipelines were submitted. The gas pipeline is scheduled 
to be installed during 2014 and the oil pipeline installation is 
scheduled in 2015. An appraisal well is currently being drilled 
in the southeastern part of the Edvard Grieg ﬁ eld in early 2014 
to target additional resources and ensure optimum development 
well placement.

returned to its offshore location at the Shell operated Pierce ﬁ eld 
in late 2013. The drilling of the remaining three development 
wells as well as the installation of a new production riser will 
be carried out during 2014. The ﬁ eld is scheduled to come

Johan Sverdrup – Appraisal
Lundin Petroleum discovered the Avaldsnes ﬁ eld in PL501 (WI 
40%) in 2010. In 2011, Statoil made the Aldous Major South 
discovery on the neighbouring PL265 (WI 10%) and following 
continuous appraisal drilling through 2011 it was determined 
that the discoveries were connected. In January 2012, the 
combined discovery was renamed Johan Sverdrup. Statoil, as 
the working operator for Johan Sverdrup, announced in late 
2013 an updated gross contingent resource range for the entire 
ﬁ eld of 1.8 to 2.9 billion boe with the resource predominately 
consisting of oil and thus ranking Johan Sverdrup in the top ﬁ ve 
discovered oil ﬁ elds in Norway in terms of size. In late 2013 a 
front end engineering and design (FEED) contract was awarded 
to Aker Solutions with a view to be in a position to submit 
a plan of development (PDO) by early 2015. A ﬁ nal concept 
development decision was taken by the partners in February

Erik Sverre Jenssen
Chief Operating Officer, Norway
A responsible operator 
As employees are involved in all sectors of Lundin 
Norway’s offshore activities, it is an important aspect 
of operations that the Company has measures in place 
to protect staff, contractors and the environment that 
they work in. More HSE information can be found in the 
Corporate Responsibilty section on pages 36–45
2014 having decided to develop the ﬁ eld in multi phases, with 
the ﬁ rst phase coming onstream in late 2019.
Phase 1 – field centre
Due to Johan Sverdrup’s size and lateral extension over a 
200 km2 area, the ﬁ eld will be developed in several phases 
and with multiple ﬁ xed platform installations. Phase 1 of the 
development will contain the ﬁ eld centre of four ﬁ xed platform 
installations as well as additional subsea installations. The 
ﬁ eld centre will consist of one processing platform, one riser 
platform, one wellhead platform with drilling facilities and one 
living quarter platform. The platforms will be installed on steel 
jackets in 120 metres of water and will be bridge-linked.
The ﬁ rst phase of the development is scheduled to start 
production in late 2019 and is forecast to have a gross 
production capacity of between 315,000 and 380,000 boepd. It 
is anticipated that between 40 and 50 production and injection 
wells will be drilled to support Phase 1 production, of which 11 
to 17 wells will be drilled prior to production start with a semi-
submersible rig to facilitate Phase 1 plateau production.
The gross capital investment for Phase 1, which includes oil 
and gas export pipelines as well as a power supply from shore, 
is estimated at between NOK 100 to 120 billion, including 
contingencies and certain market allowances for potential future 
increases in market rates. The Phase 1 ﬁ eld centre will also 
facilitate certain spare capacity for future phases and potential 
enhanced recovery. The licence partners are continuously 
evaluating options to optimise the level of investment for 
Phase 1.
Export pipeline
The Johan Sverdrup oil and gas production will be transported 
to shore via dedicated oil and gas pipelines. A 274 km 36”oil 
pipeline will be installed and connected to the Mongstad 
oil terminal on the west coast of Norway. A 165 km 18” gas 
pipeline will be installed and connected to the Kårstø gas 
terminal for processing and onward transportation. The export 
pipelines are estimated to cost gross NOK 11 billion.
The field
The discovery is of variable thickness of good quality sands. 
Appraisal wells have been drilled on both PL501 and PL265 that 
conﬁ rm the oil water contact and the reservoir quality at each 
well location as well as the likely areal extent and distribution 
of the reservoir.
During 2013, a total of seven appraisal wells have been drilled 
on the ﬁ eld giving a total of 20 wells drilled on the structure, six 
of which included sidetrack wells.
The Johan Sverdrup ﬁ eld contains two major reservoir units 
of Jurassic age, the Draupne sandstone, also referred to as the 
Volgian sandstone, and the underlying Vestland group. The 
Draupne sandstone has excellent reservoir characteristics and 
contains the majority of the Johan Sverdrup resources. The 
Vestland group is still a very good quality reservoir with multi 
Darcy sands, characterised by more shaly intervals (lower 
net to gross) and is laterally more variable. The quality of the
seismic is sufﬁ cient to allow accurate prediction of the reservoir 
top observed in most of the wells. The total Jurassic package 
thickness is variable throughout the ﬁ eld.
In March 2014 one appraisal well was drilled on the Avaldsnes 
High in PL501 (WI 40%), encountering a 13 metres of oil ﬁ lled 
excellent quality jurrasic reservoar and one well is currently 
drilling to the north of the Geitungen appraisal well 16/2-12 on 
PL265 (WI 10%).
Future phases
The Johan Sverdrup resources not developed as part of Phase 1 
will be developed through subsequent development phases. The 
scope and costs of further development phases has not yet been 
addressed by the Johan Sverdrup partners and will form the 
basis of later investment decisions.
Exploration
Lundin Petroleum follows an exploration strategy of identifying 
core areas and taking a major position with material ownership 
and operatorship. Annual exploration programmes are then 
based around working these core areas as well as identifying 
new core areas.
The current core areas are:
·  Utsira High
·  Barents Sea
New areas consist of:
·  Norwegian Sea
·  Møre Basin
Utsira High area
In 2007, Lundin Petroleum found the key to the geological 
setting on the Utsira High area with the Luno discovery which 
has led to the Edvard Grieg development. Subsequent drilling 
on similar structures around the Utsira High area led to the 
Avaldsnes discovery (Johan Sverdrup) in 2010. The work carried 
out in the area aligned with a greater understanding of the 
geology has generated further prospects which will be drilled 
over the coming years.
During 2013, another discovery was made with the Luno II 
discovery in PL359 (WI 40%) on the southwestern corner of 
the Utsira High with an estimated 25 to 120 MMboe of gross 
contingent resources. Subsequently, the eastern segment of the 
Luno II discovery in PL410 was appraised in late 2013 but failed 
to prove hydrocarbons at that location. One additional appraisal 
well will be drilled in the centre of the Luno II discovery in 
2014.
In addition to the Luno II well Lundin Petroleum drilled another 
three exploration wells on the Utsira High in 2013 with the 
Jorvik prospect on PL338 (WI 50%) discovering oil in tight 
reservoir rocks whilst the Biotitt well on PL544 (WI 40%) and the 
Torvastad well on PL501 (WI 40%) were dry.
Lundin Petroleum’s exploration programme in 2014 on the 
Utsira High area consists of one exploration well targeting the 
Kopervik prospect.

Barents Sea area
Since 2007 Lundin Petroleum has accumulated one of the 
largest acreage positions in the Barents Sea, most of which 
is in the Loppa High region, close to Statoil’s Johan Castberg 
discovery and Lundin Petroleum’s own Gohta discovery. 
Lundin Petroleum has acquired 2,700 km2 of 3D seismic, 
drilled ﬁ ve exploration wells resulting in two gas discoveries 
and one oil discovery in the area.
In 2013, Lundin Petroleum drilled one operated exploration 
well in the Barents Sea on PL492 (WI 40%) resulting in 
the Gohta discovery. The Gohta discovery is estimated to 
contain gross contingent resources of 111 to 232 MMboe 
and importantly proved an active Triassic source rock and 
a porous carbonate reservoir. Prior to the Gohta discovery, 
neither the Triassic/Upper permian oil source rock in the 
Loppa High region nor the carbonate reservoirs had been 
proven to work in the Barents Sea and therefore the Gohta 
discovery has far reaching consequences with respect to 
future exploration models in the area and could potentially 
upgrade the prospectivity for acreage which is on trend with 
the Gohta discovery such as PL609 (WI 40%) where Lundin 
Petroleum will drill the Alta prospect in 2014. One appraisal 
well is planned to be drilled on the Gohta discovery during 
2014. The well on the Langlitinden prospect on PL659 
(WI 20%) located on the southeastern fringe of the Loppa 
High in the Barents Sea has been completed encountering 
oil in tight reservoir and deemed non-commercial. Lundin 
Petroleum was awarded two additional operated licences 
in the Barents Sea during 2013, one through the 22nd 
Licensing round and one through the APA 2012 licensing 
round. In the APA 2013 licensing round, Lundin Petroleum 
was also awarded four new licences of which three are 
operated by the Company.
Southern North Sea 
Lundin Petroleum drilled two wells in the southern North 
Sea in 2013. The Ogna well was drilled on PL453s (WI 35%) 
and the Carlsberg well was drilled on PL495 (WI 60%) and 
both wells were dry. No wells are planned to be drilled in 
this area during 2014. In the APA 2013 licensing round 
Lundin Petroleum was awarded two new licences in the 
southern North Sea.
Møre area
The Albert well drilled on PL519 (WI 40%) in 2012 
encountered oil in thin Cretaceous reservoir sequence but 
due to this and the uncertain distribution of the reservoir 
the discovery is currently deemed uncommercial. Further 
exploration activity is planned in this area in 2014 with 
the drilling of the Storm prospect in PL555 where Lundin 
Petroleum holds a 60 percent interest and is the operator.

being evaluated for further prospectivity.
Licensing rounds
In January 2013, Lundin Petroleum was awarded seven exploration 
licences in the APA 2012 licensing round with four licences awarded 
in the North Sea, two in the Norwegian Sea and one in the Barents 
Sea. A further licence was awarded in the Barents Sea in the 22nd 
licensing round in 2013. In January 2014, Lundin Petroleum was 
awarded nine exploration licences in the APA 2013 licensing round 
with ﬁ ve licences in the North Sea and four in the Barents Sea.
Lundin Petroleum’s exploration programme in Norway for 2014 
will consist of six exploration wells for which drilling rigs have been 
secured.

Barents Sea
The fourth wave of 
exploration
The Barents Sea lies off the northern coast of Norway. Contrary 
to common perception, the southern portion of the Barents 
Sea, where Lundin Petroleum’s exploration licences are situated 
offers a relatively benign operating environment. Water 
depths are relatively shallow and the area is ice free due to 
the inﬂ uence of the Gulf Stream. The Norwegian Petroleum 
Directorate (NPD) estimates that the undiscovered resource 
potential of the Norwegian Barents Sea is between 3.2 and 17.7 
billion boe. The Barents Sea has been under explored relative 
to the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea with fewer than 100 
exploration wells drilled.
 
The ﬁ rst exploration wave in the Barents Sea came after the 
NPD conducted a strategic mapping exercise of the hydrocarbon 
potential on the Norwegian shelf. That exercise resulted in a 
gradual opening of the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea in 
the period between 1979 and 1982. Both areas were considered 
to contain a diversity of play types and petroleum systems. The 
NPD’s assessment of the resource potential in the Norwegian 
Sea was predominantly oil prone with some gas. In contrast, 
the Barents Sea was considered predominantly gas prone by the 
NPD with some oil potential. The major oil companies held a 
different view. Their focus was on the Barents Sea, where they 
saw predominantly oil potential. Following an initial drilling 
campaign in both areas, a series of oil and gas discoveries were 
made in the Norwegian Sea and a major gas discovery, Snøhvit, 
was made in the Barents Sea.

A second wave of exploration came from the strategic 
concession licensing round in 1986/1987 where the focus was 
on a series of large structures identiﬁ ed in the Barents Sea. A 
number of dry wells with some minor oil shows resulted from 
this second wave of exploration. Following this, a consensus 
formed within the major oil companies who believed: “Too late, 
the oil has leaked out during the uplift and the ice age.”
A third exploration wave came from within large concessions 
that were awarded with substantial follow up acreage in case of 
breakthroughs. Limited commercial success followed, with only 
minor discoveries made. The exception was the very positive 
Goliath oil discovery.
The fourth exploration wave started in 2004 with the inclusion 
of the Barents Sea in the APA licensing rounds, combined with 
the introduction of new players into Norway. The result so far 
has been a number of very promising discoveries including 
Johan Castberg, Wisting and Gohta. These breakthroughs 
have arisen through the application of new 3D seismic data 
combined with the creative thinking of geoscience experts 
seeking to unlock new play concepts.

Lundin Petroleum has been active in the Barents Sea for many 
years with applications and awards starting with the APA 2006 
licensing round. Within Lundin Petroleum, the Barents Sea 
is considered a very promising exploration area comparable 
in size with the North Sea. Following the same successful 
strategy applied on the Utsira High with the discovery of the 
Edvard Grieg and Johan Sverdrup ﬁ elds, Lundin Petroleum has 
established a core area around the southern part of the Loppa 
High. The reason for the focus on the Loppa High is a belief 
that this area has one of the highest chance for new oil and gas 
accumulations.
The recent oil discoveries Johan Castberg, Gohta and Wisting 
have conﬁ rmed this belief and consequently new opportunities 
are opening up as a result. The Johan Castberg discovery was 
made in 2011 by Statoil in PL532. A distinct direct hydrocarbon 
indicator was targeted and the well proved oil and gas in 
early to middle Jurassic sandstones of the Stø and Nordmela 
formations, with a gas-oil contact at 1,312 metres. The Gohta 
discovery was drilled in 2013 by Lundin Petroleum in PL492. 
The discovery well conﬁ rmed the presence of oil and gas in 
late Permian carbonate and siliciclastic rocks at around 2,300 
metres. The Wisting discovery was drilled in 2013 by OMV 
in PL537. That well found non-biodegraded oil in Jurassic 
sandstones at only a few hundred metres below the sea ﬂ oor. 
These recent oil discoveries have provoked a new wave of 
interest for exploration in the Barents Sea area. The Gohta 
discovery opens up a new oil play on the Loppa High – late 
Permian rocks exposed to weathering processes around 250 
million years ago. This play is likely to be present along the 
Loppa High crest. It may also be present in other places in the 
Barents Sea where late Permian rocks have been exposed and 
porosity and permeability developed due to weathering.
The “fresh” oil found in reservoirs at shallow depths in the 
Johan Castberg and Wisting discoveries suggest that oil charge
has occurred relatively recently, perhaps even during the 
most recent episodes of glaciation. If this is conﬁ rmed, it will 
signiﬁ cantly reduce the risk of hydrocarbon leakage through 
time. In addition, shallow reservoirs may exhibit good reservoir 
properties as a result of limited burial and sandstone diagenesis. 
This play may extend along the western margin of the Loppa 
High and northwards into the Hoop fault complex area.
PL492 was awarded to Lundin Petroleum in 2008. The main 
prospect in the licence, Gohta, was a large Permian four way 
structural closure. An exploration well was drilled down ﬂ ank 
on the structure by Shell in 1986. The well had oil shows, 
however, the Permian carbonate reservoir was too tight to ﬂ ow 
any ﬂ uids. Later detailed evaluation of the structure by Lundin 
Petroleum with the use of modern 3D seismic revealed that up-
dip from the well the Permian carbonates had been exposed to 
erosion and thereby rain water. Rain water was slightly acidic in 
the Permian era leading to partial dissolution of the carbonates, 
known as karstiﬁ cation. The result is that a tight carbonate rock 
can be transformed into a porous reservoir rock. The Gohta 
exploration well was drilled by Lundin Petroleum in 2013 to test 
this concept and it proved to be correct. A successful drill stem 
test (DST) was conducted, ﬂ owing more than 4,000 barrels of 
non-degraded oil per day through a 44/64 choke. An appraisal 
well is planned for 2014, to investigate the areal extent of the 
karstiﬁ cation.
After a long-standing dispute, the Norwegian and Russian 
authorities agreed on the border line between Norway and 
Russia in 2010. The Norwegian government has announced that 
the acreage in the Barents Sea bordering to Russia will be made 
available for exploration in the upcoming 23rd licensing round 
with licence awards expected in 2015. A group of companies, 
including Lundin Petroleum, committed to shoot advanced 3D 
seismic over the acreage to be offered for licensing in the 23rd 
Licensing round.

OPERATIONS – SOUTH EAST ASIA
Bertam field surface layout – FPSO and wellhead platform
South East Asia
Lundin Petroleum’s Bertam field, 
the first development in its South 
East Asia core area will start 
production in 2015.
Since entering Malaysia in 2008, Lundin Petroleum has grown 
its position to the point where the Company is now the second 
largest acreage holder after Petronas. In total the Company 
holds six Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) in Malaysia and six 
PSCs in Indonesia. As in Norway, Lundin Petroleum is pursuing 
an organic growth strategy in South East Asia. In recent years 
Lundin Petroleum has been successful in Malaysia in making 
several gas discoveries and one commercial oil discovery. 
During 2014, three exploration wells are planned to be drilled 
and one appraisal well will be drilled on the Tembakau gas 
discovery made in late 2012. The Bertam oil ﬁ eld offshore 
Peninsular Malaysia is being developed and the ﬁ eld is planned 
to commence production during 2015.
Lundin Petroleum’s assets in South East Asia are located 
offshore Malaysia and offshore and onshore Indonesia. Lundin 
Petroleum’s assets offshore Malaysia consist of approximately 
34,000 km2 of exploration acreage, four gas discoveries 
and three oil discoveries. The Indonesian assets consist of
30
Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
approximately 23,000 km2 of exploration acreage and one 
producing ﬁ eld onshore Sumatra.
Malaysia
Since completing its ten well exploration drilling programme 
offshore Malaysia in 2011 and 2012, Lundin Petroleum has at 
the end of 2013 discovered 13.7 MMboe of net reserves and 82 
MMboe of net contingent resources. Lundin Petroleum operates 
in two core areas in Malaysia.
Offshore Peninsular Malaysia
Lundin Petroleum holds four PSCs offshore Peninsular Malaysia 
and has drilled six exploration wells in the area resulting in 
two oil discoveries, Janglau and Ara, conﬁ rmed one existing oil 
discovery, Bertam, and made one gas discovery, Tembakau.
In 2013 Lundin Petroleum received development plan approval 
for the Bertam oil ﬁ eld on Block PM307 (WI 75%). The Bertam 
oil ﬁ eld is Lundin Petroleum’s ﬁ rst development project in 
Malaysia. The ﬁ eld contains net reserves of 13.7 MMboe and 
it will be developed with an unmanned wellhead platform 
producing to the FPSO which is owned by Lundin Petroleum. 
The contract for the wellhead platform was awarded to TH 
Heavy Engineering (THHE) in 2013 and platform construction 
commenced at THHE’s yard in Pulau Indah in late 2013. Keppel 
was awarded the contract to refurbish the FPSO and this work

commenced at Keppel’s shipyard in Singapore in 2013. The 
drilling of 13 development wells will commence in 2014 and 
will continue into 2015. Bertam is expected to come onstream 
in the second quarter of 2015 and gross plateau production 
of 15,000 bopd is also expected to be reached in 2015. The 
Tembakau gas discovery, which is also located in Block PM307, 
will be appraised during 2014.
The Tembakau discovery is currently estimated to contain 
306 bcf (51 MMboe) of gross contingent gas resources and the 
appraisal well has the objective to prove additional gas within 
the structure. Tembakau is believed to be a commercial gas 
discovery given its proximity to the east coast of the Peninsular 
of Malaysia and given that Peninsular Malaysia gas demand 
growth is projected to outpace gas production from offshore 
Peninsular Malaysia.
Block PM308A (WI 35%) contains the Janglau, Ara and Rhu 
discoveries in Oligocene oil sands. Due to the reservoir 
characteristics and their limited size none of these discoveries 
are currently deemed to be commercial.
In December 2012, Lundin Petroleum announced the award of a 
new PSC offshore Peninsular Malaysia. Block PM319 is operated 
by Lundin Petroleum with an 85 percent working interest with 
Petronas Carigali holding a 15 percent working interest. The 
Block covers an area of approximately 8,400 km² and is located 
west of Block PM307.
 
Offshore Sabah – East Malaysia
Lundin Petroleum holds two PSCs offshore Sabah in east 
Malaysia. Lundin Petroleum has drilled four exploration wells
offshore Sabah in east Malaysia since 2011 resulting in three gas 
discoveries, Tarap, Cempulut and Berangan.
Block SB303 (WI 75%) contains the Tarap, Cempulut, 
Berangan and Titik Terang gas discoveries with an estimated 
gross contingent resource of more than 340 bcf (57 MMboe). 
Lundin Petroleum continues to evaluate the potential for 
commercialisation of these gas discoveries, most likely 
through a cluster development. A number of possible 
development solutions are being evaluated as part of the gas 
commercialisation studies.
An acquisition of 500 km² of new 3D seismic in Block SB307/308 
(WI 42.5%) was completed during 2012 and from this data 
Lundin Petroleum has high graded a number of prospects. 
Two of these prospects, located on trend with the currently 
producing Shell ﬁ elds SF30 and South Furious, will be drilled 
in 2014. During 2013 a further 462 km2 of new 3D seismic was 
acquired in the southwest of Block SB307/308.
Sustainable investment programme 
Lundin Petroleum has an active sustainable investment 
programme in South East Asia through direct Company 
investment and through its partnership with the Lundin 
Foundation. See Sustainable Investments on pages 
43–45 for more information.

OPERATIONS – SOUTH EAST ASIA
Indonesia
Lematang (south Sumatra)
Lundin Petroleum has a 25.88 percent ownership in the 
onshore gas producing ﬁ eld Singa, onshore Sumatra. The ﬁ eld 
produced close to expectations during 2013. The current PSC 
expires in 2017 and the reserves associated with the ﬁ eld do not 
extend beyond 2017. Lundin Petroleum has booked additional 
contingent resources on Singa which will be converted to 
reserves if and when the PSC expiry date is extended. In early 
2014 a new gas sales agreement was put in place for the Singa 
ﬁ eld resulting in an increased gas sales price of USD 7.97 per 
million British Thermal Units (MMbtu) compared to the previous 
price of USD 5.2 per MMbtu.
Natuna Sea 
Lundin Petroleum has four PSCs in the Natuna Sea area with a 
90 percent operated working interest: Cakalang, Baronang and 
the Gurita PSCs. Lundin Petroleum farmed-out a ten percent 
interest in Cakalang, Baronang and the Gurita PSC to Nido 
Petroleum in 2013. In addition, the Company operates the 
South Sokang PSC with a 60 percent working interest. Three 
exploration wells were planned to be drilled in Indonesia during 
2014, two on the Baronang PSC and one on the Gurita PSC. The 
two wells on the Baronang PSC were completed in February and 
March 2014. Both wells encountered good quality reservoirs but 
neither well found any hydrocarbons.
Cendrawasih VII
During 2013 Lundin Petroleum agreed with SKKMigas to 
swap its Sareba Block with the 5,545 km2 Cendrawasih VII 
Block (WI 100%) offshore east Indonesia. The block contains 
an undeveloped Pliocene gas discovery and has 950 km2 of 
3D seismic which was shot in 2009. Lundin Petroleum plans 
to reprocess the 3D seismic survey ahead of deciding upon a 
possible exploration drilling programme.

OPERATIONS – CONTINENTAL EUROPE
Grandville field, Paris Basin France
Continental Europe
France and Netherlands
Lundin Petroleum continues to search for opportunities 
to extend the life of its mature assets in France and the 
Netherlands that provides the Company with stable oil and gas 
production. Given the favourable ﬁ scal regimes for upstream 
activity in France and the Netherlands, the Company has the 
incentive to continue to invest with the purpose of maintaining 
the strong operating cash ﬂ ow generated by these assets.
The French assets consist of mature onshore oil producing ﬁ elds 
in the Paris Basin operated by Lundin Petroleum and mature 
onshore oil producing ﬁ elds in the Aquitaine Basin operated 
by Vermilion. The Dutch assets consist of mature onshore and 
offshore gas producing ﬁ elds operated by Vermilion, GDF Suez, 
Oranje-Nassau Energie and Total.
The French and Dutch assets were acquired through a corporate 
acquisition of Coparex in 2002. The combined net reserves 
at the time of acquisition was around 32 MMboe and the net 
cumulative production from the date of acquisition up to the 
end of 2013 was 23.2 MMboe. The remaining net reserves 
at the end of 2013 was 25.9 MMboe demonstrating that a 
signiﬁ cant portion of the produced volume has been replaced 
with additional reserves through a pro-active inﬁ ll drilling and 
reservoir management strategy. The French assets also contain 
contingent resources of 12.8 MMboe net to Lundin Petroleum. 
During the course of 2013 the Grandville (WI 100%) 
redevelopment in the Paris Basin was going through a 
production ramp-up phase and towards the end of 2013 the 
production from the redevelopment had reached record 
production levels. Following the success at the Grandville ﬁ eld 
the Company plans to commence redevelopment of the Vert la 
Gravelle ﬁ eld during 2014.
The gas production in the Netherlands during 2013 was stable 
and the production performance was in line with forecast. 
During 2014 four development wells and ﬁ ve exploration wells 
are planned to be drilled.

In September 2013, the Russian president signed into law a 
change on taxes regarding offshore hydrocarbon extraction 
activities in order to incentivise offshore developments, 
including the Caspian Sea. The major change involved export 
duty which was reduced to zero for the period until 31 March 
2032 (compared to a previous rate which ranged from 55 to 65 
percent). The previous oil mineral extraction tax (MET) subsidy 
was eliminated as part of the changes, partially compensated 
by a reduced rate of 15 percent for seven years from the date 
of commercial production. The change provides an uplift in 
value for qualifying ﬁ elds, particularly important for Lundin 
Petroleum’s interest in the Morskaya ﬁ eld.

Corporate Responsibility (CR) Framework 
Lundin Petroleum is committed to carry out its worldwide 
operations in a responsible manner. This means that both 
strategic decisions and ﬁ eld activities take into consideration 
potential impacts on people and the environment. Lundin 
Petroleum has developed a CR framework that establishes 
systems and procedures to protect the health, safety and 
security of its stakeholders as well as the environment. The 
commitments to responsible corporate citizenship by which the 
Company is guided are set out in Lundin Petroleum’s Code of 
Conduct. The Company’s Policies, Guidelines and Management 
System further detail how each operating unit must implement 
the CR principles in their activities. CR is an evolving ﬁ eld 
which requires continuous improvement. This means seeking 
to achieve social, environmental and economic beneﬁ ts 
simultaneously.
Third Party Assessment 
At the beginning of 2013 Lundin Petroleum underwent a third 
party assessment of its CR framework and practice to conﬁ rm 
its alignment with industry best practice. Lundin Petroleum’s 
CR Management System was audited by Ernst & Young Sweden. 
The main ﬁ ndings were that “Lundin Petroleum has leading 
management systems relating to their material areas – Health, 
Safety and Environment (HSE)” and that the maturity levels of 
other CR areas were Established to Advanced. The third party 
audit ﬁ ndings and recommendations guided Lundin Petroleum 
in the process of reinforcing its CR management throughout the 
year.
Human Rights Policy and Guidelines
In 2013 Lundin Petroleum developed Human Rights Guidelines 
to operationalise the Policy it adopted further to the Board 
of Directors’ endorsement of the United Nations Guiding 
Principle on Business and Human Rights. The Guidelines were 
developed in accordance with stakeholder recommendations, 
including the European Commission’s Oil and Gas Sector Guide 
on Implementing the UN Guiding Principles. The Guidelines 
formalise the human rights due diligence process and requires 
that human rights risk assessments be conducted in countries 
of operations on a regular basis and, where relevant, to be 
followed up with further studies or measures.
Stakeholder Engagement Policy and Guidelines
In 2013, Lundin Petroleum formalised a long standing practice 
of open and constructive dialogue with stakeholders; the people 
and organisations which may be affected by or inﬂ uence the 
Company’s activities. Lundin Petroleum has a wide range of 
stakeholders such as shareholders, employees, governments, 
local communities, business partners, industry groups, 
NGOs, international organisations, academics and media. The 
Guidelines set up a process to ensure that the Company is aware 
of and manages effectively stakeholder issues.
Corporate Responsibility Management System Audit 
In 2013, Lundin Petroleum rolled out a Corporate Responsibility 
Management System Audit, a process to ensure its Code of 
Conduct commitments, namely human rights, anti-corruption, 
labour standards, environment, sustainable investments and 
stakeholders are respected throughout the Group. The audit 
covers all elements of its CR Framework except Health and 
Safety which are subject to a separate audit, environmental

Anti-Corruption Commitment
While Lundin Petroleum’s main focus remains on implementing 
Corporate Responsibility within the Group, it engages 
with international initiatives relevant to the Company’s 
commitments. Thus, in 2013, Lundin Petroleum became a 
supporting member of the Extractive Industries Transparency 
Initiative (EITI).
Partnership with Lundin Foundation 
In 2013 Lundin Petroleum entered into a partnership with the 
Lundin Foundation in order to increase the scale and impact 
of Lundin Petroleum’s sustainable investments. For more

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Health, Safety 
and Environment
The purpose of a Health, Safety and Environmental 
(HSE) management system (the Green Book) is to prevent 
accidents or incidents with an impact on people, 
environment and/or assets. The Company undertakes 
risk assessments and uses Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) as an HSE management tool, focusing not only 
on areas where incidents have already occurred, but 
where they could potentially occur in the future. Sharing 
experiences, lessons learned and best practice is also 
important and takes place informally within the Group on 
an ongoing basis and formally through bi-monthly HSE 
teleconferences and management visits to operations.
Since the Company was created, there have been no 
work-related fatalities in its operations. In 2013, Lundin 
Petroleum’s overall KPIs improved over previous years. 
The Lost-Time incidents were of a minor nature without a 
permanent impact on the people concerned. There were 
no reportable oil spills throughout the Group and as for 
the chemicals spills, they involved small amounts of non-
hazardous chemicals (a fraction of the volumes reported 
in the HSE Indicator Data table below).

Health, Safety and Environment 
Health, Safety and Environment is a priority in our business. 
In 2013 additional emphasis was placed on HSE management 
during development operations as well as contractor 
evaluations. HSE management system reviews were carried out 
on the Bertam Project in Malaysia and the Brynhild Project in 
Norway. In addition to assessing management of contractor 
performance, on-site visits were conducted at two shipyards in 
Singapore to evaluate the HSE practice of contractors.
While HSE is integrated in many different ways in daily 
operations, the following concrete examples illustrate how HSE 
managers and their teams promote HSE stewardship throughout 
the Group.
HSE Regional Meeting in South East Asia
A three-day meeting took place in October in Kuala Lumpur and 
Singapore with Lundin Petroleum HSE managers. The purpose 
of the meeting was to discuss implementation of the Group HSE 
strategy, as well as challenges and opportunities related thereto. 
Given that HSE is a fundamental part of risk management, a 
special session was held on risk, where HSE managers shared 
methods of identifying, preventing and managing risks within 
their respective operations. 
 
On its third day the team visited the Keppel and Jurong 
shipyards in Singapore where the FPSO is being modiﬁ ed for the 
Bertam ﬁ eld offshore Malaysia and the Flotel destined for the 
Edvard Grieg ﬁ eld is being built. The purpose of these site visits 
was to ensure contractors and suppliers adherence to Lundin 
Petroleum’s CR and HSE expectations.
The team also visited Oil Spill Response to familiarise themselves 
with the equipment that would be called upon in the event of 
an incident and to meet face to face the people who would assist 
the Company in such a case.

Group HSE Network Meeting
“The HSE meeting in South East Asia was the ﬁ rst of 
its kind within the Group. It offered the opportunity 
to share best practice regarding HSE and Risk 
Management and provide feedback on everyone’s 
activities and documentation. Further positive 
outcomes are strengthened relationships between HSE 
managers of different regions.”
 
Bernt Rudjord, 
HSE Manager, Lundin Norway
HSE Contractor Management
Lundin Petroleum is committed to ensure safety not only of its 
employees but of any one working for the Company. Contractor 
performance from an HSE perspective is evaluated during the 
contractor selection process as well as through inspections once 
contractors have been awarded a task.
Employees and contractors who work in the Company’s 
operational premises undergo an HSE induction course. 
 
In the fall, Lundin France convened 55 key contractor 
companies for an HSE awareness day. A total of 64 persons 
participated in the event during which the Company restated its 
HSE expectations and participants shared best practice.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Stakeholder
Engagement
It is important for Lundin Petroleum to communicate with its 
stakeholders, people and organisations which are impacted 
by or impact the Company. In its Code of Conduct, Lundin 
Petroleum identiﬁ es its main stakeholders to be its shareholders, 
employees, host countries, local communities and society at 
large and those continue to be the focus of the Company’s 
attention. In 2013, Lundin Petroleum developed a formalised 
process of stakeholder engagement which will be rolled out 
throughout the Group in 2014. The type and frequency of 
engagement differs among stakeholders according to the need 
and opportunity for engagement.
Shareholders
Shareholders are informed of Lundin Petroleum’s strategy 
and ongoing activities through public disclosure in the form 
of ﬁ nancial reports, press releases and through the website. 
The Company also engages with shareholders in individual 
or joint meetings and at the Annual General Meeting. In 
November 2013, Lundin Petroleum organised a site visit to 
French operations for a number of institutional shareholders to 
offer them a better understanding of means put in place to run 
operations in a sustainable and safe manner.
Employees
Engagement with staff takes place on a daily basis throughout 
the Group. In addition, senior management visits country 
ofﬁ ces. Training sessions, audits and individual meetings to 
discuss corporate responsibility issues in practice are held in the 
countries of operations.
Host Governments
Contact with host governments take place prior to the 
acquisition of a licence and the engagement with host 
governments at national and local level continues throughout 
the lifetime of an oil and gas asset.
Local Communities
Engagement with local communities takes place on the occasion 
of socialisation programmes, town hall meetings or local events 
held in the countries of operations.
International Initiatives
Lundin Petroleum also engages with a variety of organisations 
such as NGOs, International Initiatives and Industry Groups 
in different forums. In 2013 Lundin Petroleum participated in 
events dedicated at promoting responsible business practice 
such as the EITI Global Conference, the Global Compact Leaders’ 
Summit, the UN Forum on Business & Human Rights, the 
French Industrial Petroleum Union and the Norwegian Oil and 
Gas Association.
Lundin Petroleum also seeks to contribute to the better 
understanding of the importance and impact of Corporate 
Responsibility in its operations and to the sector by participating 
as speaker or panelist in conferences or workshops which also 
offer the opportunity to meet experts in relevant corporate 
responsibility ﬁ elds. One such conference was organised by 
the International Council on Swedish Industry and the Geneva 
Peacebuilding Platform on the subject of Leadership in Complex 
Markets.

about us
Shareholders
“I appreciate Lundin Petroleum’s invitation to visit 
the operations in France. The ﬁ eld visit gave me 
a better understanding of how the operations are 
run and how sustainability issues are integrated 
into the daily work. During the visit I got the 
opportunity to discuss environment, health and 
safety with the local team. My impression is that 
the employees take sustainability issues seriously 
and that the operations in France are well-

International 
Commitments
The United Nations Global Compact
The UN Global Compact is an initiative of the United Nations (UN) to encourage businesses and other 
actors in society to adopt sustainable and socially responsible practices by endorsing and reporting on the 
implementation of Ten Principles covering Human Rights, Labour Standards, Environment and Anti-
Corruption. Lundin Petroleum formally became a member of the Global Compact in 2010 and has worked 
progressively to implement the Principles in its daily operations. In 2013 Lundin Petroleum focused on 
further embedding the UN Global Compact Principles in its operational sites. The Company submitted its 
third Communication on Progress, made a ﬁ nancial contribution to the UN Global Compact Foundation to 
support its work in promoting the Ten Principles and participated in the Global Leaders Forum in New York 
to engage and share ideas with business and civil society leaders committed to implementing the Principles.
Human Rights
Lundin Petroleum’s Board of Directors strengthened the Company’s commitment towards human rights by 
formally endorsing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and by adopting a Human 
Rights Policy in 2012. In 2013 the Company focused on further embedding the Human Rights Policy 
through the adoption of Human Rights Guidelines. Employees in France, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway 
and Switzerland were trained on the Company’s Human Rights Policy & Guidelines. Lundin Petroleum 
participated in the second annual Forum on Business and Human Rights at the UN in Geneva in order to 
learn about the challenges of implementing the Guiding Principles, to exchange views and opinions on 
current best practices and to engage with human rights experts and stakeholders.
Anti-Corruption
Lundin Petroleum adopted its Anti-Corruption Policy and Guidelines in 2011. In 2013 it became a 
supporting company of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a voluntary initiative aimed 
at promoting anti-corruption and transparency through revenue disclosure. Lundin Petroleum actively 
promotes anti-corruption within the Group and in the public domain, at conferences, with business 
partners, as well as engages with peers on the issue of the global ﬁ ght against corruption. Furthermore, 
the Company is involved in an ongoing dialogue with the EITI Secretariat in Oslo; participated in the EITI 
Global Forum held in Sydney and attended the EITI Board meeting as observer. No cases of corruption 
were reported in 2013 throughout the Group under the Anti-Corruption Guidelines or the Whistleblowing 
Procedure.
Environment
Lundin Petroleum continues to promote environmental protection and awareness throughout its operations. 
The local operations assess potential effects of projects through baseline and environmental impact studies 
and contingency plans, and also support or take part in initiatives promoting environmental stewardship. 
Climate Change is an important issue for Lundin Petroleum; for the ﬁ fth consecutive year the Company has 
disclosed its climate change strategy and greenhouse gas emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). 
In 2013, it was ranked third among Nordic energy companies. The Company also adopted a new Climate 
Change Statement – emphasising its commitment to seek energy efﬁ ciency measures to reduce its carbon 
footprint – and became a CDP supporting company.
Labour Standards
Lundin Petroleum has committed in its Code of Conduct to respect and protect employees’ rights, including 
freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. It ensures equal opportunity without 
discrimination on the basis of age, culture, disability, gender, race, religion, etc. by selecting candidates 
based on their competence and qualiﬁ cations to perform the job. Every country of operations has a formal 
induction process in order to familiarise new employees with their rights and responsibilities and with 
Lundin Petroleum’s Code of Conduct and Corporate Responsibility Policies. In 2013 the Vice President 
Corporate Responsibility held individual discussions on International Labour Organisation Standards 
with Human Resource Managers throughout the Group in order to ensure that these procedures are fully 
integrated in practice. A CR handbook containing all the CR policies and guidelines was made available to 
staff worldwide. Robust processes for contractor selection and evaluation ensure that there is no child or 
other forms of forced labour in relation to Lundin Petroleum’s worldwide operations.

Sustainable
Investments
Lundin Petroleum funds a number of 
sustainable projects, primarily in its 
core areas of operations
In 2006, Lundin Petroleum established a Sustainable Investment 
Programme to promote social, economic, and environmental 
projects and organisations as well as citizenship among its 
employees. Since then, the Company has funded a signiﬁ cant 
number of projects, primarily in its core areas of operations.
In 2013, Lundin Petroleum continued to fund some of its long 
standing projects, such as SOS Children’s Villages. A selection of 
projects supported by Lundin Petroleum in 2013 can be seen on 
the maps on page 45.
Lundin Petroleum intends to pursue sustainable investments 
and community development projects associated with its 
operations. However, as the Company’s operations grow, so does 
the need to engage on a larger scale and in more sustainable 
and long term projects whose impact can be measured over 
time. This will better fulﬁ l the Company’s commitment under 
the United Nations Global Compact to further the Millennium 
Development Goals. At the beginning of 2013, Lundin Petroleum 
entered into a partnership with the Lundin Foundation, an 
organisation with a strong track record in philanthropy and 
social investments and an excellent reputation among its 
peers, having been selected as one of ten organisations to act as 
advisors on the OECD Guidelines on Social Impact Investments.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
The Lundin
Foundation
Lundin Petroleum has entered into an agreement with the 
Lundin Foundation through which 0.1 percent of the prior 
year’s revenues are contributed to the Foundation. Over the 
course of 2013, Lundin Petroleum contributed USD 1.3 million.
A minimum of 70 percent of contributed funds are dedicated to 
supporting projects in designated areas where Lundin Petroleum 
has exploration, development, or production assets. During the 
initial year of partnership, there has been a geographic focus on 
South East Asia and a sector focus on biodiversity conservation, 
sustainable ﬁ sheries and renewable energy.
Looking ahead to 2014, the Lundin Foundation is exploring 
additional partnerships in off-grid renewable energy and 
biodiversity conservation in Indonesia.
2013 Initiatives
Biodiversity Conservation – TRACC-Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia) 
The Coral Triangle region, named for its staggering number 
of corals (nearly 600 different species of reef-building corals 
alone), nurtures six of the world’s seven marine turtle species 
and more than 2,000 species of reef ﬁ sh. Over 120 million 
people live in the Coral Triangle and rely on its coral reefs for 
food, income and protection from storms. Current levels and 
methods of harvesting ﬁ sh are not sustainable and place this 
important marine area and its people in jeopardy. A changing 
climate threatens coastal communities and imperils fragile reefs. 
The challenge ahead is to develop sustainable solutions for the 
Coral Triangle’s inhabitants and protect one of the most diverse 
marine habitats on Earth at the same time.
In 2013, the Lundin Foundation entered into a partnership 
with TRACC-Borneo to expand coral planting and regenerate 
damaged reefs on which both ﬁ sheries and tourism depend in 
the Semporna District of Malaysia. Revenues from a seaweed 
and sea cucumber farm to be owned and operated by TRACC 
will ensure a revenue stream to support ongoing restoration 
activities.
Sustainable Fisheries – Rare (Indonesia) 
The world’s coastal ﬁ sheries are under enormous pressure. 
One billion people around the world rely on ﬁ sh for protein, 
yet more than 80 percent of ﬁ sh stocks are overexploited 
and declining. Developing tropical nations, including those 
in the Coral Triangle, suffer the most severe human and 
environmental costs. Half of the world’s catch is from coastal 
ﬁ sheries, where poorly-managed ﬁ shing and competition for 
scarce marine resources accelerate this deterioration. For island 
countries in the developing world, where ﬁ sh is often the 
primary source of protein, poorly managed ﬁ sheries translate 
into lost ﬁ sh catch equivalent to that which would provide 
130 to 300 million people with their minimum required daily 
protein.
Indonesia lies at the heart of the Coral Triangle, which is a 
center of tropical marine biodiversity, containing more than half
44
Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
of the world’s coral reefs, 75 percent of known coral species, 
more than 3,000 species of ﬁ sh and the largest area of mangrove 
forests. The estimated annual economic value of this rich 
ecological diversity is USD 2.3 billion. The persistent decline in 
ﬁ sheries due to overﬁ shing and the related deteriorating health 
of natural infrastructures such as coral reefs and mangroves 
pose a material threat to Indonesia’s economy, food security and 
livelihoods.
In 2013, the Lundin Foundation entered into a multi-year 
partnership with Rare, to support three innovative pilot projects 
in conservation and ﬁ sheries-management reform in near-
shore marine ecosystems. These pilots are designed to ensure 
proﬁ table and sustainable ﬁ sheries while boosting livelihoods, 
protecting habitats, and enhancing coastal resilience to climate 
change.
Access to Energy – Penampang Renewable Energy (Sabah, 
Malaysia) 
The ancestral forests of Malaysia’s indigenous people (the Orang 
Asal), though heavily degraded, are still among the richest in 
biological and cultural diversity. Malaysia’s indigenous people 
maintain custodianship over critical forested watersheds, 
banks of carbon, clean water, and biodiversity. Yet these forest 
ecosystems, and the subsistence communities who dwell there, 
are among Malaysia’s most vulnerable. Over 20 percent of 
Sabah’s population still lacks access to electricity.
Penampang Renewable Energy (PRE) leads a group of 
organisations and local businesses in Sabah, Borneo that have 
demonstrated decentralised, self-sustaining models for rural 
electriﬁ cation that empower communities rather than foster 
dependency.
In 2013, the Lundin Foundation entered into a partnership with 
PRE to design and install three micro-hydro systems in rural, 
off-grid communities and to recruit and train technicians from 
these communities in system maintenance.
Impact Reporting Investment Standards 
In 2011, the Lundin Foundation adopted Impact 
Reporting Investment Standards (IRIS). IRIS is the catalog 
of generally accepted performance metrics used by 
leading foundations to measure and report the social, 
environmental, and ﬁ nancial impacts of supported 
initiatives. Through ongoing ﬁ eld monitoring and 
evaluation, the Foundation will report annually on 
key performance indicators across its full portfolio of 
initiatives in South East Asia.

Corporate 
Governance
Introduction – Words from the Chairman
As Chairman of the Board of Directors of Lundin Petroleum, 
one of my primary duties is to ensure that the Board performs 
its functions and provides guidance to and oversees the work 
of Group management. For that to happen, it is obviously 
important that each Board member has sufﬁ cient competency 
and a strong interest in the future development of the Company.  
I am pleased that at the 2013 AGM, two new Board members 
were elected, Peggy Bruzelius and Cecilia Vieweg, based on the 
recommendations of the Nomination Committee. Peggy and 
Cecilia are both excellent additions to the Board. They not only 
bring skills and experience which complement the existing 
Board extremely well, but they also have a deep knowledge and 
understanding of corporate governance matters. As a result, 
Lundin Petroleum today has a strong and diverse Board which 
provides valuable insight into all aspects of the business, from 
ﬁ nancial and operational issues to geopolitical considerations, 
and of course, HSE and CR matters. I am also pleased to see that 
the interaction between the Board and Group management is 
very effective, including in connection with the ongoing work 
of the Reserves Committee, the Compensation Committee and 
the Audit Committee. In addition, the Board has an excellent 
HSE/CR Board Representative, Asbjørn Larsen, who has a very 
good understanding of the applicable rules and regulations and 
actively supports Group management.
It has been an interesting and exciting experience to serve as 
Chairman of Lundin Petroleum since 2002 and I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank the other Board members for 
their input and participation. I would also like to thank Group 
management for their excellent work during the year, as well 
as for the signiﬁ cant work that has gone into the preparation 
of each Board meeting. Finally, I would like to thank our 
shareholders for your trust and continued support.

Guiding Principles of Corporate Governance 
Since its creation in 2001, Lundin Petroleum has been guided by 
general principles of corporate governance to:
·  Protect shareholder rights
·  Provide a safe and rewarding working environment to all
employees
·  Abide by applicable laws and best industry practice 
·  Carry out its activities competently and sustainably 
·  Sustain the well-being of local communities in its areas of
operations
Lundin Petroleum adheres to principles of corporate governance 
found in both internal and external rules and regulations. 
As a Swedish public limited company listed on the NASDAQ 
OMX Stockholm, Lundin Petroleum is subject to the Swedish 
Companies Act and the Annual Accounts Act, as well as the Rule 
Book for Issuers of the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, which can 
be found on www. nasdaqomx.com. Lundin Petroleum is also

Swedish Code of Corporate Governance 
The Code of Governance is based on the tradition of self-
regulation and acts as a complement to the corporate 
governance rules contained in the Swedish Companies Act, the 
Annual Accounts Act and other regulations such as the Rule 
Book for Issuers and good practice on the securities market. The 
Code of Governance can be found on www.bolagsstyrning.se.
The Code of Governance is based on the “comply or explain 
principle”, which entails that a company may choose to 
apply another solution than the one provided by the Code of 
Governance if it ﬁ nds an alternative solution more appropriate 
in a particular case. The company must however explain why 
it did not comply with the rule in question and describe the 
company’s preferred solution, as well as the reasons for it. 
Lundin Petroleum complied with all the rules of the Code of 
Governance in 2013, other than in one instance as mentioned 
in the schedule on page 50 regarding the composition of 
the Nomination Committee. Furthermore, there were no 
infringements of applicable stock exchange rules during the 
year, nor any breaches of good practice on the securities market.

Lundin Petroleum’s Articles of Association, which form the 
basis of the governance of the Company’s operations, set forth 
the Company’s name, the seat of the Board, the object of the 
business activities, the shares and share capital of the Company 
and contain rules with respect to the Shareholders’ Meetings. 
The Articles of Association do not contain any limitations as 
to how many votes each shareholder may cast at Shareholders’ 
Meetings, nor any provisions regarding the appointment and 
dismissal of Board members or amendments to the Articles

its current phase of development, that the Board is composed 
of multi-faceted individuals who are well-suited for the job 
and whose expertise, experience and background is extensive. 
Further, in preparation of the elections at the 2013 AGM, the 
Nomination Committee considered the independence of each 
proposed Board member and determined that the composition 
of the proposed Board met the independence requirements 
of the Code of Governance both in respect of independence 
towards the Company and the Group management and towards 
the Company’s major shareholders. The independence of each 
Board member is presented in the schedule on pages 64–65.

prospects and the ﬁ nancial situation of the Company. In 
addition, decision items and issues of material importance 
to the Company are considered by the Board and the Board 
Committees report on matters as and when required. The 
Board’s yearly work cycle is illustrated in the above illustration.
· Statutory meeting following the AGM.
Board Meetings in 2013
During 2013, eight board meetings took place, including the 
statutory meeting. Two of these meetings took place over a 
two day period to give the Board ample time to review and 
discuss the Company’s business and activities. To develop the 
Board’s knowledge of the Company and its operations, a yearly 
ﬁ eld trip is carried out to one of the Company’s operational 
locations. In September 2013, the Board visited the Norwegian 
operations and an executive session, together with Group 
management, was held in connection with the Board meeting. 
At the executive session, in-depth operations reviews regarding 
the Group’s exploration and development activities were 
given, with a particular focus on the Norwegian and South 
East Asian operations. In addition, a reserves and production 
update, a ﬁ nancial overview of the Group, the annual Corporate 
Responsibility (CR) and HSE report, an Investor Relations report 
and a Communications and Media presentation were given.

during the year to present and report on speciﬁ c questions, as 
and when required.
The Board is also responsible for evaluating the work of the 
CEO on a continuous basis and shall carry out, at least once a 
year, a formal performance review. In 2013, the Compensation 
Committee, on behalf of the Board, undertook a review of the 
work and performance of Group management, including the

Evaluation of the Board’s Work 
A formal review of the work of the Board was conducted in 
November 2013 through a questionnaire submitted to all 
Board members, with the objective of ensuring that the Board 
functions in an efﬁ cient manner and, as applicable, to enable 
the Board to strengthen its focus on matters which may be 
raised. The topics considered included several aspects of the 
Board’s structure, work, meetings and general issues such as 
support and information given to the Board.
Individual feedback from all Board members was received and 
the overall conclusions were very positive and showed that the
structure and composition of the Board is appropriate and the 
Board members have relevant experience, including industry 
speciﬁ c and ﬁ nancial experience, which enables the Board to 
function as an effective governing body. Board members also 
regularly attend Board meetings and participate actively. The 
Board Committees’ duties and decision-making powers within 
the Board are clear, and the Committees report to the Board in 
an appropriate manner. The Board meetings are well planned 
and prepared, with high quality presentations, and enable 
the Board to effectively monitor the Company’s activities and 
performance. Board meetings in connection with visits to the 
operational areas were considered very important to provide
Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
55
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 2013
deeper knowledge and insight into the Company’s operations 
and local conditions. Individual suggestions received included 
that additional meetings in person could be considered as the 
Company and its business grows and that succession planning 
issues should be further discussed within the Board. Also, it 
was recognised that more time was now allocated to strategic 
discussions based on comments received through last year’s 
Board evaluation, however, given the importance of the issues, 
even more time could be allocated to discussing the Company’s 
overall strategy and its implementation.
The results and conclusions of the review were presented to the 
Nomination Committee.
Remuneration of Board Members
The remuneration of the Chairman and other Board members 
follows the resolution adopted by the AGM. At the 2013 AGM, 
the Chairman was awarded an amount of SEK 1,000,000 and 
each other Board member, with the exception of the CEO, an 
amount of SEK 490,000. The AGM further decided to award 
SEK 100,000 for each ordinary Board Committee assignment 
and SEK 150,000 for each assignment as Committee Chairman, 
however, limited to a total of SEK 900,000 for Committee work. 
No remuneration is paid for any assignments in relation to 
the Reserves Committee. In addition, the 2013 AGM approved 
an amount of SEK 2,000,000 to be paid to Board members for 
special assignments outside the directorship.
The remuneration of the Board of Directors is detailed further in 
the schedule on pages 64–65 and in the notes to the ﬁ nancial 
statements – see Note 31 on pages 112–113.
Board Committees and the CR/HSE Representative
To maximise the efﬁ ciency of the Board’s work and to ensure a 
thorough review of certain issues, the Board has established a 
Compensation Committee, an Audit Committee and a Reserves 
Committee and has appointed a CR/HSE Board Representative. 
The tasks and responsibilities of the Committees are detailed in 
the terms of reference of each Committee, which are annually 
adopted as part of the Rules of Procedure of the Board. Minutes 
are kept at Committee meetings and matters discussed are 
reported to the Board. In addition, informal contacts take 
place between ordinary meetings as and when required by the 
operations.
7
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee assists the Board in Group 
management remuneration matters and receives information 
and prepares the Board’s and the AGM’s decisions on matters 
relating to the principles of remuneration, remunerations 
and other terms of employment of Group management. The 
objective of the Committee in determining compensation for 
Group management is to provide a compensation package 
that is based on market conditions, is competitive and takes 
into account the scope and responsibilities associated with the 
position, as well as the skills, experience and performance of 
the individual. The Committee’s tasks also include monitoring
and evaluating programmes for variable remuneration, the 
application of the Policy on Remuneration as well as the current 
remuneration structures and levels in the Company. For further 
information regarding Group remuneration matters, see the 
remuneration sections of this report on pages 58–61.
8
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in ensuring that the 
Company’s ﬁ nancial reports are prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Swedish 
Annual Accounts Act and accounting practices applicable to a 
company incorporated in Sweden and listed on the NASDAQ 
OMX Stockholm and the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Audit 
Committee itself does not perform audit work, however, it 
supervises the Company’s ﬁ nancial reporting and assesses 
the efﬁ ciency of the Company’s ﬁ nancial internal controls, 
internal audit and risk management, with the primary 
objective of providing support to the Board in the decision 
making processes regarding such matters. In addition, the 
Committee is empowered by the Committee’s terms of reference 
to make decisions on certain issues delegated to it, such as 
review and approval of the Company’s ﬁ rst and third quarter 
interim ﬁ nancial statements on behalf of the Board. The Audit 
Committee also regularly liaises with the Group’s statutory 
auditor as part of the annual audit process and reviews the 
audit fees and the auditor’s independence and impartiality. The 
Audit Committee further assists the Company’s Nomination 
Committee in the preparation of proposals for the election of 
the statutory auditor at the AGM.
9
Reserves Committee 
The Reserves Committee reviews and reports to the Board on 
matters relating to the Company’s policies and procedures 
for reporting oil and gas reserves and related information as 
per National Instrument 51–101 (NI 51–101) issued under 
applicable Canadian securities regulation. The Reserves 
Committee reports to the Board on the Company’s procedures 
for disclosing oil and gas reserves and other related information, 
on the appointment of the independent qualiﬁ ed reserves 
auditor and on the Company’s procedures for providing 
information to the independent qualiﬁ ed reserves auditor. 
The Reserves Committee also meets with Group management 
and the independent qualiﬁ ed reserves auditor to review, and 
determine whether to recommend that the Board approve, the 
statement of reserves and other oil and gas information required 
to be submitted annually under NI 51–101.
10
CR/HSE Board Representative
The Board of Directors has a leadership and supervisory role 
in all CR and HSE matters within the Group and appoints 
yearly one non-executive Director to act as the CR/HSE Board 
Representative. The tasks of the CR/HSE Board Representative 
include to liaise with Group management regarding CR and HSE 
related matters and to regularly report on such matters to the 
Board of Directors. The current CR/HSE Board Representative is 
Asbjørn Larsen. More information about the Company’s CR/HSE 
activities can be found in the Corporate Responsibility section 
on pages 36–45.

Management 
Management structure 
The President and CEO of the Company, C. Ashley Heppenstall, 
is responsible for the management of the day-to-day operations 
of Lundin Petroleum. He is appointed by, and reports to, the 
Board and is also the only executive Board member. He in turn 
appoints the other members of Group management, who assist 
the CEO in his functions and duties, and in the implementation 
of decisions taken and instructions given by the Board, with the 
aim of ensuring that the Company meets its strategic objectives 
and continues to deliver responsible growth and long-term 
shareholder value.
Lundin Petroleum’s Group management consists of highly 
experienced individuals with worldwide oil and gas experience 
and in addition to the CEO, comprises the following:
·  The Investment Committee, which in addition to the CEO
includes 
–the Chief Operating Ofﬁ cer (COO), Alexandre Schneiter, who 
is responsible for Lundin Petroleum’s worldwide exploration 
and production operations, as well as HR;
–the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer (CFO), Mike Nicholson, who is
responsible for the ﬁ nancial reporting, internal audit, risk 
management, tax, treasury function and economics; and
–the Senior Vice President Development (SVP Development),
Chris Bruijnzeels, who is responsible for operations, reserves 
and the optimum development of Lundin Petroleum’s asset 
portfolio, as well as IT.
·  The Vice President Corporate Responsibility, Christine Batruch,
who is responsible for the Group’s CR and HSE strategy, the 
Vice President Legal, Jeffrey Fountain, who is responsible for 
all legal matters within the Group and the Vice President 
Corporate Planning and Investor Relations, Teitur Poulsen, 
who is responsible for Group investor relations as well as all 
matters relating to the corporate planning and development of 
Lundin Petroleum.
·  The General Managers/Managing Directors who are responsible
for the day-to-day activities of the local operational entities.
A management change occurred as per 31 December 2013 as the 
Company’s former CFO, Geoffrey Turbott, decided to step down 
as CFO following ten years in this position. Mike Nicholson, who 
has worked for the Company since 2005 through various roles 
and most recently as Managing Director in South East Asia, was 
appointed as the new CFO as of 1 January 2014. Mike Nicholson 
was replaced by Paul Atkinson in South East Asia, who has held 
various senior managerial positions since 2001 in multinational 
oil and gas companies, including in Lundin Petroleum’s 
predecessor companies.
Group management tasks and duties 
The tasks of the CEO and the division of duties between the 
Board and the CEO are deﬁ ned in the Rules of Procedure and 
the Board’s instructions to the CEO. In addition to the overall 
management of the Company, the CEO’s tasks include ensuring 
that the Board receives all relevant information regarding the 
Company’s operations, including proﬁ t trends, ﬁ nancial position 
and liquidity, as well as information regarding important events 
such as signiﬁ cant disputes, agreements and developments in 
important business relations. The CEO is also responsible for
58
Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
preparing the required information for Board decisions and for 
ensuring that the Company complies with applicable legislation, 
securities regulations and other rules such as the Code of 
Governance. Furthermore, the CEO maintains regular contacts 
with the Company’s stakeholders, including shareholders, the 
ﬁ nancial markets, business partners and public authorities. To 
fulﬁ l his duties, the CEO works closely with the Chairman of the 
Board to discuss the Company’s operations, ﬁ nancial status, up-
coming Board meetings, implementation of decisions and other 
relevant matters.
Under the leadership of the CEO, Group management is 
responsible for ensuring that the operations are conducted in 
compliance with all Group policies, guidelines and procedures 
in a professional, efﬁ cient and responsible manner. Regular 
management meetings are held to discuss all commercial, 
technical, HSE, ﬁ nancial, legal and other relevant issues within 
the Group to ensure the established short and long-term 
business objectives and goals will be met. A detailed weekly 
operations report is further circulated to Group management 
summarising the operational events, highlights and issues of the 
week in question. Group management also travels frequently to 
oversee the ongoing operations, seek new business opportunities 
and meet with various stakeholders, including business 
partners, suppliers and contractors, government representatives 
and ﬁ nancial institutions. In addition, Group management 
liaises continuously with the Board, and in particular the Board 
Committees and the CR/HSE Board Representative, in respect 
of ongoing matters and issues that may arise, and meets with 
the Board at least once a year at the executive session held in 
connection with a Board meeting in one of the operational 
locations.
12
Investment Committee 
The Company’s Investment Committee, which consists of CEO, 
CFO, COO and SVP Development, was established by the Board 
in 2009 to assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities in 
overseeing the Company’s investment portfolio. The role of the 
Investment Committee is to determine that the Company has 
a clearly articulated investment policy, to develop, review and 
recommend to the Board investment strategies and guidelines 
in line with the Company’s overall policy, to review and 
approve investment transactions and to monitor compliance 
with investment strategies and guidelines. The responsibilities 
and duties include considering annual budgets, supplementary 
budget approvals, investment proposals, commitments, 
relinquishment of licences, disposal of assets and performing 
other investment related functions as the Board may designate. 
The Investment Committee has regularly scheduled meetings 
and meets more frequently if required by the operations.
Remuneration
Group Principles of Remuneration 
Lundin Petroleum aims to offer all its employees compensation 
packages that are competitive and in line with market 
conditions. These packages are designed to ensure that the 
Group can recruit, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals 
and reward performance that enhances shareholder value.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 2013
The Group’s compensation packages therefore consist of four 
elements, being (i) base salary; (ii) yearly variable salary; (iii) 
long-term incentive plan; and (iv) other beneﬁ ts. As part of the 
yearly assessment process, a Performance Management Process 
has been established to align individual and team performance 
to the strategic and operational goals and objectives of the 
overall business. Individual performance measures are formally 
agreed and key elements of variable remuneration are clearly 
linked to the achievement of stated and agreed performance 
measures.
To ensure compensation packages within the Group 
remain competitive and in line with market conditions, the 
Compensation Committee undertakes yearly benchmarking 
studies. For each study, a peer group of European oil and gas 
companies of similar size and operational reach is selected, 
against which the Group’s remuneration practices are measured. 
The levels of base salary, yearly variable salary and long term 
incentives are set at the median level, however, in the event of 
exceptional performance, deviations may be authorised.
As the Group continuously competes with the peer group to 
retain and attract the very best talent in the market, both at 
operational and executive level, the Group’s compensation 
packages are determined primarily by reference to the 
remuneration practices within this peer group.
In addition, the Compensation Committee may request other 
advice and assistance of external reward consultants, which it 
did in 2013 through the HayGroup.
Policy on Remuneration
The remuneration of Executive Management follows the 
principles that are applicable to all employees, however, these 
principles must be approved by the shareholders at the AGM. 
The Compensation Committee therefore prepares yearly for 
approval by the Board and for submission for ﬁ nal approval 
to the AGM, a Policy on Remuneration for the Executive 
Management. Based on the approved Policy on Remuneration, 
the Compensation Committee subsequently proposes to the 
Board for approval the remuneration and other terms of 
employment of the CEO. The CEO, in turn, proposes to the 
Compensation Committee, for approval by the Board, the 
remuneration and other terms of employment of the other 
members of the Executive Management.
The tasks of the Compensation Committee also include 
monitoring and evaluating the application of the Policy on 
Remuneration approved at the AGM and, to fulﬁ l this task, the 
Compensation Committee prepares a yearly report, for approval 
by the Board on the evaluation of remuneration of the Executive 
Management. The statutory auditor of the Company further 
veriﬁ es on a yearly basis whether the Company has complied 
with the Policy on Remuneration. Both reports are available 
on the Company’s website and the Policy on Remuneration 
approved by the 2013 AGM is included in this Corporate 
Governance Report.
POLICY ON REMUNERATION FOR THE EXECUTIVE 
MANAGEMENT AS APPROVED BY THE 2013 AGM
Application and Objectives of the Policy
In this Policy on Remuneration, the terms “Executive 
Management” or “Executives” refers to the President and 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer (CEO), the Executive Vice President 
and Chief Operating Ofﬁ cer, the Vice President Finance 
and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, and the Senior Vice President 
Operations (Senior Vice President Development as of 1 
January 2014).
It is the aim of Lundin Petroleum to recruit, motivate and 
retain high calibre Executives capable of achieving the 
objectives of the Group, and to encourage and appropriately 
reward performance in a manner that enhances 
shareholder value. Accordingly, the Group operates this 
Policy on Remuneration to ensure that there is a clear link 
to business strategy and a close alignment with shareholder 
interests and current best practice, and aims to ensure 
that the Executive Management is rewarded fairly for its 
contribution to the Group’s performance.
Compensation Committee
The Board of Directors of Lundin Petroleum has established 
the Compensation Committee to, among other things, 
administer this Policy on Remuneration. The Compensation 
Committee is to receive information and prepare the Board 
of Directors’ and the Annual General Meeting’s decisions 
on matters relating to the principles of remuneration, 
remunerations and other terms of employment of the 
Executive Management. The Compensation Committee 
meets regularly and its tasks include monitoring and 
evaluating programmes for variable remuneration for the 
Executive Management and the application of this Policy 
on Remuneration, as well as the current remuneration 
structures and levels in the Company.
Elements of Remuneration
There are four key elements to the remuneration of 
Executive Management: 
a) basic salary; 
b) yearly variable salary; 
c) long-term incentive plan; and 
d) other beneﬁ ts.
that special circumstances in this speciﬁ c case warranted 
such a deviation, as permitted by Chapter 8, section 53 of 
the Swedish Companies Act, in view of Geoffrey Turbott’s 
substantial contribution to the Company and its predecessor 
companies over the past 18 years. Further details regarding the 
remuneration of Executive Management in 2013, including the 
agreed severance arrangement, can be found in the notes to the 
ﬁ nancial statements – see Notes 31–32 on pages 112–115.
In 2013, the Board agreed on a deviation from the Policy on 
Remuneration and approved a severance arrangement for the 
Company’s former CFO, Geoffrey Turbott. The Board considered

remuneration to the Executive Management to the 2014 AGM, 
please see the Directors’ report, page 83.
60
Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
Basic Salary
The Executive’s basic salary shall be based on market 
conditions, shall be competitive and shall take into 
account the scope and responsibilities associated with the 
position, as well as the skills, experience and performance 
of the Executive. The Executive’s basic salary, as well as 
the other elements of the Executive’s remuneration, shall 
be reviewed annually to ensure that such remuneration 
remains competitive and in line with market conditions. 
As part of this assessment process, the Company, as well 
as the Compensation Committee, periodically undertakes 
benchmarking comparisons in respect of its remuneration 
policy and practices. 
 
The advice and assistance of specialised consultants may 
be requested in connection with these comparisons and 
the Compensation Committee shall ensure that there is 
no conﬂ ict of interest regarding other assignments such 
consultants may have for the Company and the Executive 
Management.
Yearly variable salary
The Company considers that yearly variable salary is an 
important part of the Executive’s remuneration package 
where associated performance targets reﬂ ect the key drivers 
for value creation and growth in shareholder value. Through 
its Performance Management Process, the Company sets 
predetermined and measurable performance criteria for each 
Executive, aimed at promoting long-term value creation for 
the Company’s shareholders. 
 
The yearly variable salary shall, in the normal course of 
business, be based upon a predetermined limit, being 
within the range of 1–12 monthly salaries. However, the 
Compensation Committee may recommend to the Board of 
Directors for approval yearly variable salary outside of this 
range in circumstances or in respect of performance which 
the Compensation Committee considers to be exceptional.
a greater personal commitment to the Company. Therefore, 
the Board believes that the Company’s LTIP for Executive 
Management should be related to the Company’s share price.
As per the Swedish Code of Governance, the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting shall decide on all share and share-
price related incentive schemes for Executive Management. 
Information on the principal conditions of proposed LTIPs 
for Executive Management (if any) is available, as part of 
the documentation for the Annual General Meeting, on 
www.lundin-petroleum.com.
Other Benefits
Other beneﬁ ts shall be based on market terms and shall 
facilitate the discharge of each Executive’s duties. Such 
beneﬁ ts include statutory pension beneﬁ ts comprising a 
deﬁ ned contribution scheme with premiums calculated on 
the full basic salary. The pension contributions in relation to 
the basic salary are dependent upon the age of the Executive.
Severance Arrangements
A mutual termination period of between one month and 
six months applies between the Company and Executives, 
depending on the duration of the employment with the 
Company. In addition, severance terms are incorporated into 
the employment contracts for Executives that give rise to 
compensation, equal to two years’ basic salary, in the event 
of termination of employment due to a change of control of 
the Company.
The Compensation Committee shall approve termination 
packages that exceed USD 150,000 in value per individual.
Authorisation for the Board
The Board of Directors is authorised to deviate from the 
Policy on Remuneration in accordance with Chapter 8, 
section 53 of the Swedish Companies Act in case of special 
circumstances in a speciﬁ c case.
Long-term Incentive Plan
The Company believes that it is appropriate to structure 
its long-term incentive plans (LTIP) to align Executive 
Management’s incentives with shareholder interests. 
Remuneration which is linked to the share price results in
Outstanding Remunerations 
Information regarding previously approved remunerations 
to Executive Management, which remain outstanding (if 
any), is available in the Company’s Annual Report and on 
www.lundin-petroleum.com.
In June 2010, the Swedish International Public Prosecution Ofﬁ ce commenced an investigation into alleged violations of 
international humanitarian law in Sudan during 1997–2003. The Company has cooperated with the Prosecution Ofﬁ ce by 
providing information regarding its operations in Block 5A in Sudan during the relevant time period. As repeatedly stated, 
Lundin Petroleum categorically refutes all allegations of wrongdoing and will cooperate with the Prosecution Ofﬁ ce’s 
investigation. Lundin Petroleum strongly believes that it was a force for good in Sudan and that its activities contributed to 
the improvement of the lives of the people of Sudan.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 2013
Internal Control and Risk Management for the Financial 
Reporting
Introduction
The responsibility of the Board of Directors for internal control over 
ﬁ nancial reporting is regulated by the Swedish Companies Act, the 
Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Code of Governance. 
The information in this report is limited to internal control and 
risk management regarding ﬁ nancial reporting and describes how 
internal control over the ﬁ nancial reporting is organised, but does 
not comment on its effectiveness.
Internal control system for financial reporting 
Lundin Petroleum’s objective for ﬁ nancial reporting is to provide 
reliable and relevant information for internal and external purposes, 
in compliance with existing laws and regulations, in a timely and 
accurate manner. An internal control system for ﬁ nancial reporting 
has been created to ensure that this objective will be met. An 
internal control system can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss, and is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the 
ﬁ nancial reporting objectives.

The Five Key Components
Lundin Petroleum’s Financial Reporting Internal 
Control System consists of ﬁ ve key components, as 
described below and is based upon the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO) model. The internal control of ﬁ nancial 
reporting is a continuous evaluation of the risks and 
control activities within the Group. The evaluation 
work is an ongoing process that involves internal and 
external benchmarking, as well as improvement and 
development of control activities.

Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013

Internal Auditor
The internal auditor of Lundin Petroleum provides an 
independent and objective appraisal function established 
as a service adding value to the organisation. The internal 
auditor is concerned with the adequacy and effectiveness 
of systems of control and whether they are managed, 
maintained, complied with and function effectively. To 
this end, the internal auditor will evaluate controls that 
promote efﬁ cient management reporting, compliance 
with procedures, protection of organisational assets and 
interests and effective control. The internal auditor reports 
to the Audit Committee.
1.  Control Environment
Lundin Petroleum’s Board of Directors has the overall 
responsibility for establishing an effective internal 
control system. The Audit Committee assists the Board in 
relation to the ﬁ nancial reporting, internal control and 
the reporting of ﬁ nancial risks. The Audit Committee also 
supervises the efﬁ ciency of the internal auditing, internal 
control and ﬁ nancial reporting and reviews all interim and 
annual ﬁ nancial reports.
The CEO is responsible for maintaining in the daily 
operations an effective control environment and for 
operating the system of internal control and risk 
management in the Group and is assisted by Group 
management at varying levels. Lundin Petroleum’s 
internal auditor is further responsibile for ensuring that 
the internal control framework is adhered to.
The development and implementation of a Group-
wide framework of consistent policies and procedures, 
to strengthen the internal control of the Group, is a 
continuous process. Together with laws and external 
regulations, these internal policies and procedures form 
the control environment which is the foundation of the 
internal control and risk management process at Lundin 
Petroleum. All employees are accountable for compliance 
with these policies and procedures within their areas of 
control and risk management.
2.  Risk Assessment
Risk assessment is an integrated part of the internal 
control framework and is performed on an ongoing basis 
at Lundin Petroleum. Risk assessment is a process that 
identiﬁ es, sources and measures the risk of material error 
in the ﬁ nancial reporting and accounting systems of the 
Group. This process is the basis for designing control 
activities to mitigate identiﬁ ed risks.
Risks relating to ﬁ nancial reporting are monitored and 
assessed by the Board through the Audit Committee. As 
part of the risk assessment, Lundin Petroleum reviews and 
analyses the risks that exist within the ﬁ nancial reporting 
process and structures its internal control systems around 
the risks identiﬁ ed. The risks are assessed, on a quarterly 
basis, through a standardised methodology based on 
likelihood and impact and are then documented in a
Group-wide risk map. When risks are identiﬁ ed and evaluated, 
control activities are implemented to minimise the risks in the 
ﬁ nancial reporting process. Conclusions of the risk assessment 
are reported to management and the Board through the Audit 
Committee. Identiﬁ ed risk areas are mitigated through business 
processes with incorporated risk management, policies and 
procedures, segregation of duties and delegation of authority. 
For further details on the different risks, see the Risks and Risk 
Management section on pages 70–71.
3.  Control Activities
The ﬁ nance department of each Group company is responsible 
for the regular analysis of the ﬁ nancial results and for reporting 
thereon to the ﬁ nance department at Group level. Various 
other control activities are also incorporated into the ﬁ nancial 
reporting process to ensure that the ﬁ nancial reporting gives 
a true and fair view at any reporting date and that business is 
conducted efﬁ ciently.
The Investment Committee oversees the Group’s investment 
decisions through the annual budget process, supplementary 
budget requests submitted during the year etc., and makes 
recommendations to the Board as required. The Investment 
Committee meets regularly and its review and approval process 
constitutes an important control activity within the Group.
The internal auditor performs on a regular basis risk 
assessments and audits as per an internal audit plan which is 
approved by the Audit Committee twice per year. In addition, 
the internal auditor coordinates joint venture audits that are 
undertaken by Lundin Petroleum. In the oil and gas industry, 
operations are conducted through joint venture arrangements, 
where partners share the costs and risks of the activities. To 
ensure that accounting procedures are followed and costs are 
incurred in accordance with the joint operating agreement, for 
non-operated assets, joint venture partners have audit rights 
over the operating partner.
4.  Information and Communication
Communicating relevant information throughout all levels of 
the Group, as well as to external parties, in a complete, correct 
and timely manner is an important part of the internal control 
framework.
Internal policies and procedures relating to the ﬁ nancial 
reporting, such as the Authorisation Policy, the Group 
Accounting Principles Manual and the Finance and Accounting 
Manual, are updated and communicated on a regular basis by 
Group management to all affected employees and are accessible 
through the information system network.
For communication to external parties, a communications 
policy has been formulated. The policy has been approved by 
the Board and deﬁ nes how external information is to be issued, 
by whom and the way in which the information should be 
given.
Significant internal documents that form the 
control environment at Lundin Petroleum: 
· The Code of Conduct: the Code of Conduct sets out 
the principles by which Lundin Petroleum is guided 
and describes the responsibilities it has towards its 
stakeholders.
· The Anti-fraud Policy: this policy outlines the
employees’ responsibilities with regard to fraud 
prevention, what to do if fraud is suspected and what 
action will be taken by management in the case of 
suspected or actual fraud.
· The Whistleblowing Policy: this policy was adopted 
to complement the anti-fraud policy as a means to 
address serious concerns that could have a signiﬁ cant 
impact on the Group.
· The Authorisation Policy: this policy deﬁ nes the limits
of authority that are applicable within the Group.
· The Group Accounting Principles Manual: this
manual outlines the Group’s accounting principles 
and explains how transactions are to be accounted 
for and requirements for disclosure. The manual 
focuses upon the accounting policies to be applied 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS).
· The Finance and Accounting Manual: this manual
describes the day-to-day ﬁ nancial procedures within 
the Group.
· The Risk Management Policy: the risk management
policy establishes a common understanding of the 
Company’s minimum requirements and principles to 
be followed in relation to the management of risk for 
all activities undertaken by the Group.
5.  Monitoring
In order to ensure the effectiveness of the internal control in 
respect of the ﬁ nancial reporting, monitoring activities are 
conducted by the Board, the Audit Committee and Group 
management, including the Company’s CFO. The internal 
auditor and the Group ﬁ nance department monitor compliance 
with internal policies, procedures and other policy documents. 
Further, an important monitoring activity carried out by the 
internal auditor is to follow-up on the results of the previous 
years’ internal audits and risk assessments to ensure that the 
appropriate corrective measures have been implemented. 
Monitoring takes place at a central level, but also locally in the 
Group companies.

The Board of Directors of Lundin Petroleum AB (publ)
Auditor’s report on the Corporate Governance Statement
To the annual meeting of the shareholders of Lundin Petroleum AB (publ), corporate identity number 556610–8055
It is the Board of Directors who is responsible for the Corporate Governance Statement for the year 2013 on pages 46–66 and that it 
has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.
We have read the corporate governance statement and based on that reading and our knowledge of the company and the group we 
believe that we have a sufﬁ cient basis for our opinions. This means that our statutory examination of the Corporate Governance 
Statement is different and substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.
In our opinion, the Corporate Governance Statement has been prepared and its statutory content is consistent with the annual 
accounts and the consolidated accounts.

THE LUNDIN PETROLEUM SHARE AND SHAREHOLDERS
The Share
and Shareholders
Lundin Petroleum share 
The Lundin Petroleum share is listed on the Large Cap list of the 
Nasdaq OMX (OMX) Stockholm in Sweden and is part of the OMX 
30 index. The share is also listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange 
(TSX) in Canada.
Market capitalisation
Lundin Petroleum’s market capitalisation as at 31 December 
2013 was MSEK 39,866.
Liquidity
During the year a total of 264 million shares were traded on the 
OMX to a value of approximately MSEK 37,772. A daily average 
of 1.06 million Lundin Petroleum shares were traded on the 
OMX in Stockholm. 0.2 million shares were traded on the TSX to 
a value of approximately CAD 5.27 million. A daily average of 
1,429 Lundin Petroleum shares were traded on the TSX.
Share capital and voting rights
The registered share capital as at 31 December 2013 amounted 
to SEK 3,179,106 represented by 317,910,580 shares with a 
quota value of SEK 0.01 each and representing one vote each. All 
outstanding shares are common shares and carry equal rights to 
participation in Lundin Petroleum’s assets and earnings.
Own purchased shares
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Lundin Petroleum held 
on 8 May 2013 resolved to authorise the Board of Directors to 
decide on the repurchase and sale of Lundin Petroleum shares 
on the OMX and TSX during the period until the next AGM. The 
maximum number of shares that can be repurchased and held 
in treasury from time to time cannot exceed ﬁ ve percent of all 
shares of Lundin Petroleum. The purpose of the authorisation
is to provide the Board of Directors with a means to optimise 
Lundin Petroleum’s capital structure and to secure Lundin 
Petroleum’s exposure in relation to the LTIPs.
The total number of repurchased shares held by Lundin 
Petroleum on 31 December 2013 amounted to 8,340,250.
AGM resolution
During the AGM in 2013 it was resolved that the Board of 
Directors is authorised to issue no more than 35 million new 
shares, without the application of the shareholders’ pre-emption 
rights, in order to enable the Company to raise capital for the 
Company’s business operations and business acquisitions. If the 
authorisation is fully utilised the dilution effect on the share 
capital will amount to ten percent.
Dividend policy
Lundin Petroleum’s primary objective is to add value to 
the shareholders, employees and society through proﬁ table 
operations and growth. This will be achieved by increased 
hydrocarbon reserves, developing discoveries and thereby 
increasing production and ultimately cash ﬂ ow and operating 
income. This added value will be expressed partly by a long-term 
increase in the share price and dividends.
The size of any dividend would have to be determined by 
Lundin Petroleum’s ﬁ nancial position and the possibilities 
for growth through proﬁ table investments. Dividends will be 
paid when Lundin Petroleum generates sufﬁ cient cash ﬂ ow 
and operating income from operations to maintain long-term 
ﬁ nancial strength and ﬂ exibility. Over time the total return to 
shareholders is expected to transfer from an increase in share 
price to dividends received.
Lundin Petroleum is progressing on a number of 
transformational development projects which will require 
funding. This development funding will take priority over 
dividend payments.

RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk
Management
The objective of risk management is to identify, understand 
and manage threats and opportunities within the business 
on a continual basis. This objective is achieved by creating a 
mandate and commitment to risk management at all levels of 
the business. This approach actively addresses risk as an integral 
and continual part of decision making within the Company 
and is designed to ensure that all risks are identiﬁ ed, fully 
acknowledged, understood and communicated well in advance. 
The ability to manage and or mitigate these risks represents 
a key component in ensuring that the business aim of the 
Company is achieved. Nevertheless oil and gas exploration,
development and production involve high operational and 
ﬁ nancial risks, which even a combination of experience, 
knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to fully 
eliminate or which are beyond the Company’s control.
Lundin Petroleum has identiﬁ ed the following principal risks 
relative to the Group’s performance. The impact of risks within 
any one of these segments can inﬂ uence the reputation of the 
Company (reputational risk). In addition to these identiﬁ ed 
principal risks, Lundin Petroleum Group management reviews 
all its business risks, including project execution, operational, 
ﬁ nancial and Health Safety and Environment risks on a 
quarterly basis. Risk mitigation is discussed and if required 
additional measures are implemented.
Description of risk
Strategic Risk
Mitigation – Risk management
Failure to create shareholder value and meet shareholder 
expectations 
A strategy that is ineffective and poorly communicated or ex-
ecuted may lead to a loss of investor conﬁ dence and a reduction 
in the share price.
Lundin Petroleum’s business model clearly deﬁ nes the vision and strategy of the 
Company. Throughout all stages of the business cycle, Lundin Petroleum seeks to 
generate shareholder value by proactively investing in exploration to organically 
grow the reserve base, exploiting the existing asset base and acquiring new or 
disposing of reserves, as well as through an opportunistic approach.
Inadequate asset portfolio management 
Ineffective management may lead to a failure to understand and 
unlock the full value of an asset which could negatively impact 
shareholder value.
Strong communication channels are coupled with effective leadership in order 
to maintain creativity and an entrepreneurial spirit. This ensures that the entire 
organisation works towards the same goal.
Lundin Petroleum continually reviews the economic value of the existing asset 
portfolio in order to ensure that the value of each asset within the portfolio is 
well understood, communicated and fully reﬂ ected within the share price.
Ineffective recruitment, retention and management of human 
capital 
An inability to attract and retain employees could cause short and 
medium term disruption to the business.
The Lundin Petroleum recruitment and compensation strategy is aligned with 
corporate goals and objectives and takes into consideration industry trends. The 
Performance Management process is designed to drive engagement and create a 
philosophy of ownership at all levels of the Company.
Lack of corporate responsibility and environmental awareness 
A real or perceived lack of corporate responsibility and 
environmental awareness can have an adverse impact on the 
people the Company works with, on the environment in which 
the Company operates and as well as on its reputation. Any such 
impact on the Company’s reputation could in turn impact its 
license to operate, ﬁ nancing or access to new opportunities.
Lundin Petroleum’s Corporate Responsibility framework is applied to all its 
activities and includes monitoring of risk mitigation measures, reporting 
and investigation of all incidents. Communication plans and management of 
stakeholder relations are designed to maintain good and effective relationships. 
(See also pages 36–45 Corporate Responsibility for more information).
The Company’s aim is to explore for and produce oil and gas in an economically, 
socially and environmentally responsible way, for the beneﬁ t of all its 
stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, business partners, host and 
home governments and local communities.
Financial Risk 1
Cost escalation and investment oversight 
Adequate policies must be in place to ensure that all necessary 
internal and external approvals are in place prior to the 
commitment to spend. Any change in expenditures must be 
captured in a timely manner through the reporting requirements.
Through the Lundin Petroleum annual budget and supplementary budget 
approval process the Company has implemented a rigorous process of oversight 
of all expenditure on a continual basis. This process ensures that expenditure 
is in line with approvals from the Investment Committee and that change is 
communicated in a thorough and timely manner.
Liquidity risk 
The risk that the Group may not be able to settle or meet its 
obligations on time or at a reasonable price, could lead to inability 
to fund exploration and development work programmes.
Lundin Petroleum monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity 
requirements to ensure that it has sufﬁ cient cash to meet operational needs. 
The economics and planning department continuously monitors the macro and 
micro economic environment impacting the Group’s business to ensure that 
management is informed of developments impacting capital decision making.
Credit risk 
The risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with 
banks and ﬁ nancial institutions as well as credit exposure to 
customers.
Lundin Petroleum’s policy is to limit credit risk by limiting the customers and 
partners to major oil companies and only use major banks. If there is a credit risk 
for oil and gas sales, the policy is to require an irrevocable letter of credit for the 
full value of the sale.
Financial reporting risk 
The risk that material misstatements in ﬁ nancial reporting and 
failure to accurately report ﬁ nancial data could lead to regulatory 
action, legal liability and damage to the Company’s reputation.
The internal control system for ﬁ nancial reporting is in place to ensure the

Description of risk
Operational Risk
Development projects do not achieve stated objectives 
Ensuring that development projects remain on budget, on 
schedule and achieve operational objectives is essential in 
ensuring that shareholder value is maximised.
Mitigation – Risk management
All development projects must pass through the Lundin Petroleum value process 
that requires technical, ﬁ nancial, Investment Committee and Board approval 
of all investment decisions. The development project management process 
assigns a steering committee that provides guidance, direction and control to the 
project. Government organisations, partners and third party groups also provide 
independent oversight.
In Norway the Company is governed by the detailed guidelines for plan for 
development and operation of a petroleum deposit (PDO) and plan for installation 
and operation of facilities for transport and utilisation of petroleum (PIO) as 
published by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.
Health, safety and environment (HSE)
A major operational HSE event could have a negative impact on 
the people and environment in which the Company works. This 
in turn can have an adverse impact on valuation.
Lundin Petroleum promotes active management of HSE issues throughout the 
Group. Proactive risk management, HSE policies, and an HSE management system 
in compliance with statutory requirements are an integral part of operations. (See 
also pages 36–45 Corporate Responsibility for more information.)
Major operational incident
Apart from the HSE impact of a major operational incident, 
there can be signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial consequences for oil spill 
response, replacement of equipment and liability
Increase in production costs 
Production costs are affected by the normal economic drivers 
of supply and demand as well as by various ﬁ eld operating 
conditions.
Availability of operational equipment 
Oil and gas exploration and development activities are 
dependent on the availability of drilling and related equipment. 
An inability to procure equipment on a timely basis may delay 
exploration and development activities.
Reserve and resources estimates
In general, estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas re-
serves and the future net cash ﬂ ows therefrom are based upon a 
number of variable factors and assumptions. All such estimates 
are to some degree speculative, and classiﬁ cations of reserves 
are only attempts to deﬁ ne the degree of speculation involved.
Inability to replace and grow reserves 
The ability to increase reserves will depend not only on the 
ability to explore and develop the Company’s present portfolio 
of opportunities, but also on the ability to select and acquire 
suitable producing assets or prospects.
Ineffective systems to prevent bribery and corruption 
Corruption can occur in any country of operation. Incidents 
of non-compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws 
could be damaging to Lundin Petroleum, its reputation and 
shareholder value.
External Risk
Geopolitical Risk 
The Company is, and will be, actively engaged in oil and gas 
operations in various countries. Changes to laws within these 
countries may lead to negative consequences such as but not 
limited to the expropriation of property, cancellation of or 
modiﬁ cation of contract rights, and or increased taxation.
Fluctuation in the price of oil and gas 
The price of oil and gas are affected by the normal economic 
drivers of supply and demand as well as the ﬁ nancial investors 
and market uncertainty.
Fluctuation in currency rates 
Crude oil prices are generally set in US dollars, whereas costs 
may be in a variety of currencies. Fluctuation in exchange rates 
can therefore give rise to foreign exchange exposures
Interest rate risk 
The uncertainty in future interest rates could have an impact 
on the Company’s earnings. The Group’s interest rate risk arises 
from long-term borrowings.
Lundin Petroleum’s management systems are in place to avoid Major Operational 
Incidents. However oil and gas operations will never be completely risk free and 
the potential for incidents (although reduced to a minimum) will remain. Therefore 
all Operations are reviewed on a regular basis to assess the risk of incident and to 
ensure that adequate Insurance coverage is in place.
Effective procurement and cost control management processes are essential in 
ensuring that reasonable cost levels are achieved relative to business plans. Diligent 
operations management and effective maintenance planning help to ensure 
efﬁ ciency during operations. Production delays and declines from normal ﬁ eld 
operating conditions cannot be eliminated and may adversely affect revenue and 
cash ﬂ ow levels to varying degrees.
Advanced planning of the Company’s operational programme includes ensuring 
that the contracting strategy and procurement process is in place. Regular 
engagement with contractors and suppliers as well as consideration for equipment 
as part of the licence application process mitigates the risk.
Reserves and resource calculations undergo a comprehensive internal peer review 
process and adhere to industry standards. All reserves are independently audited 
by ERC-Equipoise Ltd. as part of the annual reserves audit process. (See also pages 
12–17 Reserves, Resources and Production for more information.)
The use of effective peer review for subsurface analysis and well site selection 
together with a well deﬁ ned strategy for recruitment and retention of talented 
personnel mitigates the risk. (See also pages 12–17 Reserves, Resources and 
Production for more information.)
A consistent application of Lundin Petroleum’s Code of Conduct, together with 
policies and procedures that clearly deﬁ ne levels of authority and internal control 
requirements help to mitigate risk. In 2010 Lundin Petroleum joined the UN 
Global Compact to further conﬁ rm the Company’s commitment to ethical business 
practice and the Board of Directors adopted in 2011 an anti-corruption policy and 
guidelines. (See also pages 36–45 Corporate Responsibility for more information.)
The Company reviews its portfolio of assets in relation to its ﬁ nancial performance 
on a regular basis. The consideration of political risk elements is a key component 
driving investment decisions for the Company as a whole. Local laws are monitored 
and the Company strives to ensure comprehensive interpretation and compliance 
with any changes that may impact the business.
Lundin Petroleum’s policy is to adopt a ﬂ exible approach towards oil price 
hedging based on an assessment of the beneﬁ ts of the hedge contract in speciﬁ c 
circumstances.
Lundin Petroleum’s policy on currency rate hedging is, in case of currency 
exposure, is to consider setting the rate of exchange for known costs in non-US 
Dollar currencies to US Dollars in advance so that future US Dollar cost levels can 
be forecasted with a reasonable degree of certainty. The functional currencies of the 
companies in the Group are reviewed annually.
Lundin Petroleum regularly assesses the beneﬁ ts of interest rate hedging on 
borrowings.

The Volund ﬁ eld production during the year has exceeded 
forecast due to better than expected performance of the 
reservoir and the Alvheim FPSO uptime. An additional Volund 
development well was drilled in 2012 and put onstream early in 
2013 resulting in Volund continuing to produce at close to full 
ﬂ owline capacity. Water breakthrough has now occurred in all 
of the four producing wells on Volund with total ﬁ eld water cut 
as at the end of 2013 being approximately 35 percent. The cost 
of operations, excluding project speciﬁ c costs, for the Volund 
ﬁ eld during the year was below USD 2.50 per barrel.
Production from the Alvheim ﬁ eld during the year was below 
expectations. This was due to the shut-in of three production 
wells due to well integrity issues in two of the wells, both
of which were shut-in during January 2013, and a ﬂ owline 
integrity issue in a well which was shut-in in June 2013. 
The ﬂ owline integrity issue has been resolved with the well 
coming back onstream in September 2013. Work-over activity 
commenced on the remaining two shut-in wells during the 
fourth quarter 2013. The two worked-over wells are expected 
to be brought back onstream in April 2014. Maintenance work 
on the Alvheim FPSO was successfully completed during the 
planned shut-in in August 2013. There was no production 
shut-in on the Alvheim FPSO in the previous year. The Alvheim 
FPSO uptime levels for the year of close to 96 percent have had 
a positive impact on the Alvheim production against forecast. 
The cost of operations for the Alvheim ﬁ eld, excluding well 
intervention and other one-off related project work, was 
around USD 5.00 per barrel during the year. The one-off well 
intervention work during 2013 is being recorded as additional 
cost of operations and is forecast to account for USD 1.25 per 
boe of Lundin Petroleum’s total cost of operations for the 
full year. Three inﬁ ll development wells are scheduled to be 
drilled on Alvheim in 2014 and 2015 resulting in an increase 
of net reserves in Alvheim for the ninth consecutive year. 
The previously announced drilling of the North Kameleon 
exploration prospect north of the Alvheim ﬁ eld is now expected 
to take place in 2015 due to delays in the Transocean Winner rig 
schedule.
Production from the Gaupe ﬁ eld during the year has been in 
line with expectations and the production shut-in during August 
2013 for planned maintenance also progressed as expected with 
the ﬁ eld re-commencing production in September 2013. The 
Gaupe ﬁ eld is expected to cease production in 2014.
Development
Brynhild
The Brynhild ﬁ eld installation of the subsea template and 
manifolds, as well as the installation of production and injection 
ﬂ ow lines, have been successfully completed. The drilling of 
the ﬁ rst of four development wells has reached ﬁ nal target 
depth and the well has found both the top of the reservoir and 
the quality of the reservoir as expected. The Haewene Brim 
FPSO, which will receive the crude oil from the Brynhild ﬁ eld, 
is owned by Bluewater and contracted to Shell, the operator of 
the Pierce ﬁ eld offshore United Kingdom. The FPSO arrived at 
the dry dock in Scotland in July 2013 for topside modiﬁ cation 
and life extension work. This work was completed later than 
planned with the FPSO leaving the yard in November 2013 
approximately two months behind schedule. The FPSO was 
re-moored at the Pierce ﬁ eld location late in 2013 for further

installation and commissioning work including the installation 
of a new production riser. First oil from the Brynhild ﬁ eld is 
forecast in the second quarter of 2014.
Bøyla 
The Bøyla ﬁ eld will be developed as a 28 km subsea tie-back 
to the Alvheim FPSO with two production wells and one water 
injection well. Fabrication of the ﬁ eld’s subsea structures has 
commenced and drilling of the three development wells is 
scheduled to take place in 2014 with the Transocean Winner 
rig. The ﬁ rst oil date has been revised to the ﬁ rst quarter 2015 
due to a delay in the Transocean Winner rig schedule. The Bøyla 
ﬁ eld development costs remain on budget.
Edvard Grieg
The Edvard Grieg ﬁ eld development is progressing on schedule 
and on budget. Construction and engineering work on the 
jacket, topside and export pipelines is ongoing. First oil from the 
Edvard Grieg ﬁ eld is still expected in late 2015.
All the major contracts for the Edvard Grieg development 
have been awarded. Kværner has been awarded a contract 
covering engineering, procurement and construction of the 
jacket and the topsides for the platform and a contract has 
been awarded to Rowan Companies for a jack-up rig to drill the 
development wells. Saipem has been awarded the contract for 
marine installation. During the year, a plan for installation and 
operation (PIO) has been submitted to the Ministry of Petroleum 
and Energy for the 43 km long Edvard Grieg oil pipeline and 
the 94 km long Edvard Grieg gas pipeline. The pipelines will 
be jointly owned by the licence partners in Edvard Grieg PL338 
and Ivar Aasen (formerly Draupne) PL001B/PL028B/PL242 with 
Lundin Petroleum having an ownership of 30 percent in the oil 
pipeline and 20 percent in the gas pipeline. Statoil will be the 
operator of the pipelines. The oil pipeline will be tied-into the 
Grane oil pipeline and the gas pipeline will be tied-in to the 
Sage Beryl gas system in the United Kingdom. Installment of the 
gas pipeline will be carried out in the summer of 2014 and the 
oil pipeline will be installed in 2015. The jacket construction 
commenced in 2012 and is now substantially complete and is 
expected to be shipped offshore in the second quarter of 2014 
for installation. The construction of the topside commenced in 
2013 and installation is planned during the summer of 2015. An 
appraisal well has commenced drilling in the southeastern part 
of the Edvard Grieg reservoir in the ﬁ rst quarter of 2014 with 
potential to increase reserves and optimise the location of the 
Edvard Grieg development wells.
The Edvard Grieg development plan incorporates the provision 
for the coordinated development solution with the nearby 
Ivar Aasen ﬁ eld located in PL001B and operated by Det norske 
oljeselskap ASA (Det norske). The Ivar Aasen development plan 
was approved by the Norwegian authorities during the ﬁ rst 
quarter of 2013.
Appraisal
Johan Sverdrup 
Lundin Petroleum discovered the Avaldsnes ﬁ eld in PL501 
(WI 40%) in 2010. In 2011, Statoil made the Aldous Major South 
discovery on the neighbouring PL265 (WI 10%). Following 
appraisal drilling, it was determined that the discoveries were 
connected and in January 2012 the combined discovery was 
renamed Johan Sverdrup. During 2013 an appraisal well drilled 
in PL502 (WI 0%) conﬁ rmed that a small portion of the ﬁ eld also 
extends into PL502.
A total of 20 wells have now been drilled on the Johan 
Sverdrup ﬁ eld and the appraisal campaign is now substantially 
complete. Statoil, the pre-unit operator of the ﬁ eld has released 
an updated gross contingent resource estimate for the Johan 
Sverdrup ﬁ eld of 1.8 to 2.9 billion boe and a ﬁ rst oil date of late 
2019. In order to retain the targeted plan of development (PDO) 
approval schedule of 2015, a FEED contract was awarded to Aker 
Solutions in late 2013. A development concept selection was 
made in early 2014.
During the year, seven appraisal wells have been completed. 
Five appraisal wells have been drilled on PL501 during the year 
with results in terms of reservoir thickness and quality as well as 
oil columns being substantially in line with expectations.
One appraisal well was drilled on PL265 which was production 
tested from two zones with 1,500 bopd ﬂ ow test from a lower 
sandstone layers with interbedded shales and 5,900 bopd 
from an upper zone with excellent quality Jurassic sandstone. 
One exploration well and one side track from the successful 
appraisal well were drilled west of the boundary fault on PL265 
but both encountered basement with non-commercial reservoir 
properties.
One successful appraisal well was also drilled on PL502 during 
the year.

The completion of the well 16/4–6S targeting the Luno II 
prospect in PL359 (WI 40%) was announced in May 2013 as 
an oil discovery. The well was drilled on the southwestern 
ﬂ ank of the Utsira High approximately 15 km south of the 
Edvard Grieg ﬁ eld. Lundin Petroleum estimated that the 
Luno II structure, which is believed to span across two separate 
reservoir segments, contains gross contingent resources of 25 
to 120 MMboe  as well as gross prospective resources of 10 
to 40 MMboe for the Luno II North segment. The contingent 
resources relate to the southern segment of the Luno II structure 
and the prospective resources to the northern segment. Late 
in 2013, the potential Luno II discovery extension into PL410
(WI 70%) was appraised by well 16/5–5 but the well found 
the reservoir shallower than expected with worse reservoir 
quality and lower oil saturation than expected. The extension 
is therefore regarded as non-commercial. The 25 to 120 MMboe 
resource range is prior to the drilling of the 16/5–5 appraisal 
well in PL410.  A second Luno II appraisal well is planned to be 
drilled on PL359 during the ﬁ rst half of 2014.
In September 2013, Lundin Petroleum announced a signiﬁ cant 
oil and gas discovery in the Barents Sea called Gohta. Well 
7120/1–3, drilled on PL492 (WI 40%) approximately 35 km 
north of the Snøhvit ﬁ eld, encountered a 100 metre gross
76
Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
hydrocarbon column in Permo-Carboniferous carbonate 
reservoir of which the top 25 metres consisted of gas. The well 
was production tested and achieved a better than expected ﬂ ow 
rate of 4,300 bopd through a 44/64” choke with a gas to oil ratio 
of 1,040 scf/bbl, conﬁ rming good production properties from 
the reservoir. The Gohta discovery is estimated to contain gross 
contingent resources of 105 to 235 MMboe. The Gohta discovery 
is likely sourced from a local Triassic oil kitchen which upgrades 
other prospects on PL492 and adjoining acreage PL609 (WI 40%) 
to the north. One appraisal well is planned to be drilled on 
Gohta and one exploration well on the Alta prospect on PL609 
in 2014.
To the east of the Gohta discovery, the Langlitinden prospect, 
operated by Det norske, on PL659 (WI 20%) located to the 
southeast of the Loppa High spudded in January 2014. The well 
encountered oil in tight reservoar and was deemed to be non-
commercial.
In October 2013, well 6608/2-1S drilled on PL330 (WI 30%) and 
operated by RWE Dea Norge AS was announced as a dry hole. 
The well was targeting Jurassic sandstones in the Sverdrup 
prospect (not to be confused with the Johan Sverdrup discovery 
in the North Sea) in the northern Norwegian Sea. The well 
encountered an active petroleum system but failed to encounter 
any reservoir and was plugged and abandoned.
In December 2013, well 16/2–20S targeting the Torvastad 
prospect on PL501 (WI 40%) on the Utsira High was completed. 
The well found good quality Jurassic reservoir but the reservoir 
was deep to prognosis and therefore waterbearing. The well 
was announced as a dry hole. A side-track to the 16/2–20S well 
to the west was commenced in December to ascertain whether 
the good quality sand would extend up-dip to the west. The side 
track did encounter a reservoir section up-dip but with poor 
reservoir quality and was also declared dry.
 
Lundin Petroleum plans to drill six exploration wells in Norway 
during 2014. In addition to the Kopervik, Alta and Langlitinden 
exploration wells, further wells are planned to be drilled on 
the Storm, Lindarormen and Vollgrav prospects. The Storm 
prospect on PL555 (WI 60%), located in the northern North Sea, 
is planned to be drilled during the second quarter 2014. In the 
second half of 2014, the Lindarormen well on PL584 (WI 60%) 
is forecast to be drilled in the Norwegian Sea to the south of the 
Asgard ﬁ eld and to the southwest of the Draugen ﬁ eld. In the 
second half of 2014, the Vollgrav well on PL631 (WI 60%) is also 
planned to be drilled in the northern North Sea between the 
Statfjord and Gullfaks ﬁ elds.
Licence awards and relinquishments
During the reporting period, Lundin Petroleum was awarded 
seven licences through the APA 2012 licensing round and one 
additional licence in the 22nd Norwegian licensing round. 
Four licences were relinquished during the reporting period. 
In January 2014, it was announced that Lundin Petroleum had 
been awarded nine licences through the APA 2013 licensing 
round, including four new licences in the Barents Sea. In 
January 2014, Lundin Petroleum farmed-out ten percent in 
PL546 (WI 50% after farm-out) to Petrolia Norway AS.

Overall production levels from France during the year have 
increased with good production from the Grandville ﬁ eld in 
the Paris Basin which continues to ramp up production from 
increased water injection capacity and a higher well stock. This 
increase is partially offset by a production underperformance 
from certain Aquitaine Basin ﬁ elds related to various, non-
reservoir related, mechanical failures. The Hoplites exploration 
well on the Est Champagne concession (WI 100%) is planned to 
be drilled in 2014.
The Netherlands
Production from the Netherlands has been in line with the 
forecast during the year.
Five exploration wells are planned to be drilled during 2014: one 
onshore on the Leeuwarden licence (WI 7.23 %), two onshore 
on the Gorredijk licence (WI 7.75%) and one onshore on the 
Slootdorp licence (WI 7.23%). One offshore exploration well is 
planned to be drilled on the E17 licence (WI 1.20%).
South East Asia 
Malaysia
The Bertam oil ﬁ eld, offshore Peninsular Malaysia received 
development approval from Petronas in October 2013 with ﬁ rst 
oil expected in 2015. Lundin Petroleum is planning to drill three 
exploration wells and one appraisal well in Malaysia in 2014.
Offshore, Peninsular Malaysia
Lundin Petroleum holds four licences offshore Peninsular 
Malaysia with a 75 percent operated working interest in PM307, 
a 35 percent operated working interest in PM308A, a 75 percent 
operated working interest in PM308B and a 85 percent operated 
working interest in PM319. Block PM307 contains the Bertam 
ﬁ eld and the Tembakau gas discovery.
A ﬁ eld development plan for the Bertam ﬁ eld was approved 
by Petronas and development commenced during the year. 
The Bertam ﬁ eld will be developed using a 20 slot Wellhead 
Platform adjacent to the spread-moored Ikdam FPSO which 
is owned 100 percent by Lundin Petroleum. The subsurface 
development concept consists of 13 horizontal wells and one 
deviated well completed with electrical submersible pumps. The 
FPSO life extension work contract has been placed with Keppel 
Shipyard and work is ongoing in Singapore. The wellhead 
platform contract has been awarded to TH Heavy Engineering 
(THHE) and work is ongoing at the yard in Pulau Indah close to 
Kuala Lumpur. Development drilling is planned to commence

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
during the summer of 2014. The total gross capital investment 
associated with the Bertam ﬁ eld development, excluding any 
FPSO related costs, is estimated at approximately MUSD 400.
The Bertam ﬁ eld is estimated to contain gross reserves of 
18.2 MMboe and is scheduled to commence ﬁ rst oil in 2015 with 
a gross plateau rate of 15,000 bopd.
A 3D seismic acquisition programme over the northern part of 
Block PM307 and the southern part of Block PM319 (WI 85%) 
was completed during the year and processing of the seismic 
is ongoing. The Tembakau gas discovery made in 2012, with 
gross best estimate contingent resources of 306 billion cubic feet 
(bcf), will be appraised as part of the next offshore Peninsular 
Malaysia drilling campaign to commence in the second quarter 
of 2014. An exploration well is planned to be drilled on the 
Rengas oil prospect on PM307 in 2014.
East Malaysia, offshore Sabah
Lundin Petroleum holds two licences offshore Sabah in east 
Malaysia with a 75 percent operated working interest in 
Block SB303 and a 42.5 percent operated working interest in 
Block SB307/308. Block SB303 contains four gas discoveries 
containing a gross best estimate contingent resource of 347 bcf.
Lundin Petroleum continues to evaluate the potential for 
commercialisation of the Berangan, Tarap, Cempulut and Titik 
Terang gas discoveries in Block SB303, most likely through a 
cluster development. Seismic processing of the 500 km2 Emerald 
3D survey on SB307 was completed during the year and two 
prospects, Maligan and Kitabu, within the Emerald 3D are 
planned to be drilled in 2014. An additional 500 km2 3D seismic 
acquisition referenced as the Francis 3D, on SB307/308 was 
completed at the end of July 2013 and processing of the seismic 
is scheduled to be completed in the ﬁ rst half of 2014.
Indonesia
Lundin Petroleum’s assets in Indonesia are located in the 
Natuna Sea and offshore northeastern Indonesia and onshore 
south Sumatra. The Indonesian assets consist of approximately 
24,750 km² of exploration acreage and one producing ﬁ eld 
onshore Sumatra.

Exploration 
Baronang/Cakalang 
Exploration drilling on the Baronang Block (WI 90%) is 
commenced in the ﬁ rst quarter of 2014 with a well and a 
sidetrack targeting the Balqis and Boni prospects. Both wells 
encountered good quality reservoars but neither well found any 
hydrocarbons.
Gurita
Following the completion of the interpretation of the 3D seismic 
acquisition of 950 km² acquired in 2012, the Gobi prospect has 
been identiﬁ ed as the targeted prospect for the 2014 exploration 
well on the Gurita Block (WI 90%). The Gobi prospect, which is 
estimated to contain gross 24 MMboe of prospective resources, 
is a fault-dip closure on the south ﬂ ank of the Jemaja High, with 
stacked closures at multiple levels for Oligocene aged ﬂ uvial 
and alluvial sands which have been proven in many wells in 
the Natuna Basin. The Gobi prospect is scheduled to be drilled 
in 2014. In the event that the Hakuryu 11 rig is delayed further 
there is a risk that the Gobi-1 well is delayed until 2015.
South Sokang
A 3D seismic acquisition programme of 1,000 km² has been 
completed on the South Sokang Block (WI 60%) during the year. 
The seismic processing and interpretation is schedule to be 
completed in the ﬁ rst half of 2014.
Cendrawasih VII
In July 2013, Lundin Petroleum announced that it had signed a

Lagansky Block
In the Lagansky Block (WI 70%) in the northern Caspian 
a major oil discovery, Morskaya, was made in 2008 and is 
estimated to contain gross best estimate contingent resources 
of 157 MMboe. In October 2013, Lundin Petroleum announced 
a Heads of Agreement with Rosneft whereby Rosneft will 
acquire a 51 percent shareholding in LLC PetroResurs which 
owns a 100 percent interest in the Lagansky Block. Rosneft’s 
consideration in return for the 51 percent equity stake relates 
to historical spending on the Block and will be paid to Lundin 
Petroleum and Gunvor through a deferred payment mechanism. 
Following the completion of this transaction, Lundin Petroleum 
will have a 34.3 percent effective interest in the Lagansky Block. 
It is expected that the Rosneft acquisition will be completed in 
the ﬁ rst half of 2014.

The oil produced in Russia is sold on either the Russian 
domestic market or exported into the international market. 
47 percent (45 percent) of Russian sales for the year were on 
the international market at an average price of USD 108.49 per 
barrel (USD 109.93 per barrel) with the remaining 53 percent 
(55 percent) of Russian sales being sold on the domestic market 
at an average price of USD 50.91 per barrel (USD 49.98 per 
barrel).
Sales of oil and gas are recognised when the risk of ownership 
is transferred to the purchaser. Sales quantities in a period can 
differ from production quantities as a result of permanent and 
timing differences. Permanent differences arise as a result of 
paying royalties in kind as well as the effects from production 
sharing agreements. Timing differences can arise due to under/
over lift of entitlement, inventory, storage and pipeline balances 
effects.
The change in under/over lift position amounted to a charge of 
MUSD 45.2 (credit of MUSD 30.7) to the income statement and 
primarily related to Norway where sales volumes were higher 
than production volumes for the year due to the timing of the 
cargo liftings in relation to the Alvheim Blend sales contract.
Other revenue amounted to MUSD 16.8 (MUSD 25.6) for the year 
and included the quality differential compensation received 
from the Vilje ﬁ eld owners to the Alvheim and Volund ﬁ eld 
owners, tariff income from France and the Netherlands and 
income for maintaining strategic inventory levels in France. 
The previous year includes MUSD 11.0 relating to an equity 
redetermination settlement in the Netherlands.

Note: USD per boe is calculated by dividing the cost by total production 
volume for the period.
The total cost of operations for the year was MUSD 114.6 
(MUSD 105.6) and included costs associated with well 
intervention work on the Alvheim and Volund ﬁ elds, Norway 
and well intervention work and maintenance projects in the 
Paris Basin ﬁ elds, France. Excluding operational projects, the 
2013 average cost of operations was USD 7.45 per barrel.
Royalty and direct production taxes amounted to MUSD 44.0 
(MUSD 51.3) and included Russian Mineral Extraction Tax 
(MET) and Russian Export Duties. The rate of MET is levied on 
the volume of Russian production and varies in relation to 
the international market price of Urals blend and the Rouble 
exchange rate. MET averaged USD 23.13 (USD 22.92) per barrel 
of Russian production for the year. The rate of export duty on 
Russian oil is revised monthly by the Russian Federation and 
is dependent on the average price obtained for Urals Blend for 
the preceding one month period. The export duty is levied on 
the volume of oil exported from Russia and averaged USD 54.61 
(USD 57.08) per exported barrel for the year.
Change in inventory position amounted to a net credit of 
MUSD 2.0 in the year compared to a net MUSD 14.8 charge in 
the previous year. During 2013, there was only one cargo lifting 
from the Aquitaine ﬁ elds, France, and the lifting was during the 
third quarter. In 2012, there were liftings of inventory from the 
Ikdam FPSO on the Oudna ﬁ eld, Tunisia, which was the main 
reason for the MUSD 14.8 charge for the previous year.
Other costs amounted to MUSD 13.5 (MUSD 1.8) and mainly 
related to a provision recognised for contractual obligations 
post the expected cessation of production date on the Gaupe 
ﬁ eld and a mark-to-market valuation of an operating cost share 
arrangement on the Brynhild ﬁ eld whereby the amount of 
operating costs varies with the oil price. Both of these items are 
non-cash and will unwind against actual expenses in the future.
Depletion and decommissioning costs
Depletion and decommissioning costs amounted to MUSD 174.2 
(MUSD 191.4) and are detailed in Note 3. Norway’s contribution 
to the total depletion charge for the year was 73 percent at an 
average rate of USD 13.40 per barrel. The lower depletion charge 
for 2013 compared to 2012 is in line with the lower production 
volumes and as a result of the lower depletion charge on the 
Gaupe ﬁ eld following the impairment of the carrying value at 
31 December 2012.
Decommissioning costs charged to the income statement in the 
year amounted to MUSD 13.3 (MUSD 5.3) and primarily related 
to the increase in the Gaupe ﬁ eld site restoration estimate 
following the operator’s review of the decommissioning timing 
and cost. The costs reported in the previous year related to the 
decommissioning of the Oudna ﬁ eld, Tunisia.
Exploration costs
Exploration costs expensed in the income statement for the 
year amounted to MUSD 287.8 (MUSD 168.4) and are detailed 
in Note 3. Exploration costs expensed in the year mainly related 
to the cost of drilling the wells on the Sverdrup prospect, 
Luno II South, Biotitt, Cliffhanger, Carlsberg, Ogna and Jorvik 
in Norway as well as associated licence costs. In addition, costs 
associated with certain licences that were relinquished in 
Norway and unsuccessful licence applications in the Norwegian 
22nd licensing round were expensed.
Impairment costs
Impairment costs expensed in the income statement for the 
year amounted to MUSD 123.4 (MUSD 237.5) and are detailed in 
Note 3. The carrying values of the Janglau and Ara discoveries 
on PM308A, Malaysia, were fully expensed in 2013 for an 
amount of MUSD 41.7 (MUSD –). In addition, impairment costs 
of MUSD 81.7 which related to the gas discoveries on PL438 
Skalle, PL533 Salina and PL088 Peik, Norway, were expensed as 
they are currently deemed uncommercial.
General, administrative and depreciation expenses
The general, administrative and depreciation expenses for the 
year amounted to MUSD 43.6 (MUSD 31.8) which included a 
non-cash charge of MUSD 3.3 (MUSD 9.1) in relation to the 
Group’s Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) scheme.
The cash charge amounted to MUSD 35.9 (MUSD 19.6) for the 
year and includes the reallocation of costs previously charged 
through operations and certain advisory fees including business 
development activities.
80
Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
The non-cash charge to the income statement resulting from 
the LTIP recognised over the year has partly been offset by the 
reduction in the Lundin Petroleum share price. The provision 
for the LTIP is calculated based on Lundin Petroleum’s share 
price at the balance sheet date using the Black and Scholes 
method and is applied to the portion of the outstanding LTIP 
awards which are recognised at the balance sheet date. Any 
change in the value of the awards due to a change in the share 
price impacts all awards recognised at the balance sheet date 
including those of previous periods with the change in the 
provision being reﬂ ected in the income statement. Lundin 
Petroleum has mitigated the cash exposure of the LTIP by 
purchasing its own shares. For more detail refer to Note 32.
Fixed asset depreciation charges for the year amounted to 
MUSD 4.4 (MUSD 3.1).
Financial income
Financial income for the year amounted to MUSD 3.3 
(MUSD 27.3) and is detailed in Note 4. The previous year 
includes a gain on consolidation of a subsidiary of MUSD 13.4 
and a net foreign exchange gain of MUSD 6.2.
Financial expenses
Financial expenses for the year amounted to MUSD 86.3 
(MUSD 48.5) and are detailed in Note 5.
Interest expense for the year amounted to MUSD 5.3 (MUSD 6.8) 
and represented the proportion of interest charged to the 
income statement. An additional amount of interest of 
MUSD 18.2 (MUSD 3.4) associated with the funding of the 
Norwegian development projects was capitalised in the year.
Net foreign exchange losses for the year amounted to MUSD 46.5 
(MUSD 6.2 gain). Foreign exchange movements occur on the 
settlement of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
and the revaluation of working capital and loan balances to the 
prevailing exchange rate at the balance sheet date where those 
monetary assets and liabilities are held in currencies other than 
the functional currencies of the Group reporting entities. During 
the year the US Dollar strengthened against the Norwegian 
Krona and this has resulted in reported foreign exchange losses. 
Lundin Petroleum’s underlying value is US Dollar based as this 
is the currency in which the majority of revenues are derived. 
A strengthening US Dollar currency has a positive overall value 
effect on the business as it increases the purchasing power of 
the US Dollar to purchase the currencies in which the Group 
incurs operational expenditure. Lundin Petroleum has hedged 
certain foreign currency operational expenditure amounts 
against the US Dollar as detailed in the Derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments section below. During the year, the realised 
exchange gain on settled foreign exchange hedges amounted to 
MUSD 5.5 (MUSD 11.7).
The amortisation of the deferred ﬁ nancing fees amounted to 
MUSD 8.7 (MUSD 6.6) for the year and related to the expensing 
of the fees incurred in establishing the USD 2.5 billion ﬁ nancing 
loan facility in June 2012 over the period of usage of the facility.
Loan facility commitment fees for the year amounted to 
MUSD 17.1 (MUSD 10.3). The increase over the previous year 
relates to the commitment fees on the undrawn portion of the 
USD 2.5 billion ﬁ nancing facility entered into in June 2012 
compared to the commitment fees on the undrawn portion of 
the MUSD 850 previous ﬁ nancing facility.
Income taxes
The overall tax charge for the year amounted to MUSD 215.1 
(MUSD 418.4) and is detailed in Note 6.
The current tax charge for the year amounted to MUSD 24.5 
(MUSD 341.3) of which MUSD 2.9 (MUSD 311.8) related to 
Norway. The decrease in the Norwegian tax charge compared 
to the previous year is mainly due to the increased level of 
development and exploration expenditure in Norway as shown 
in the Non-current assets section below.
The deferred tax charge for the year amounted to MUSD 190.6 
(MUSD 77.1) of which MUSD 196.2 (MUSD 80.4) related to 
Norway. The deferred tax charge arises primarily where there 
is a difference in depletion for tax and accounting purposes. In 
addition, previously unrecognised Dutch ﬁ scal unity tax losses 
were recognised following the ﬁ eld development approval of 
the Bertam ﬁ eld, Malaysia, resulting in a MUSD 8.9 deferred tax 
credit in the fourth quarter of 2013.
The Group operates in various countries and ﬁ scal regimes 
where corporate income tax rates are different from the 
regulations in Sweden. Corporate income tax rates for the Group 
vary between 20 percent and 78 percent. The effective tax rate 
for the Group for the year amounted to 75 percent. This effective 
rate is calculated from the face of the income statement and 
does not reﬂ ect the effective rate of tax paid within each country 
of operation. The high overall effective rate of tax for the year 
is largely driven by Norway where the tax rate is 78 percent and 
that there was not a full tax credit on the impairment costs in 
Norway and Malaysia, reported in 2013.
Non-controlling interest
The net result attributable to non-controlling interest for the 
year amounted to MUSD -4.7 (MUSD  -4.3) and related mainly 
to the non-controlling interest’s share in a Russian subsidiary 
which is fully consolidated.

are mainly related to the part of the tax loss carry forwards 
in the Netherlands that are expected to be utilised against 
future tax liabilities. The increase compared to the previous 
year in deferred tax assets relates mainly to the recognition of 
previously unrecognised Dutch ﬁ scal unit tax losses following 
the approval of the ﬁ eld development for the Bertam ﬁ eld, 
Malaysia, in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Current assets
Inventories amounted to MUSD 22.8 (MUSD 18.7) and included

and that contains similar elements of remuneration for Group 
Management as the 2013 Policy on Remuneration being base 
salary, yearly variable salary, Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
and other beneﬁ ts.
The Board will propose that the AGM also resolve on a new 
long-term, performance-based incentive plan in respect of 
Group Management and a number of key employees of Lundin 
Petroleum. LTIP 2014 gives the participants the possibility to 
receive shares in Lundin Petroleum subject to i.a. the fulﬁ lment 
of a performance condition under a three year performance 
period commencing on 1 July 2014 and expiring on 1 July 
2017. The performance condition is based on the share price 
growth and dividends (Total Shareholder Return) of the Lundin 
Petroleum share compared to the Total Shareholder Return of a 
peer group of companies. At the beginning of the performance 
period, the participants will free of charge be granted awards 
which, provided that i.a. the performance condition is met, 
entitle the participant to be allotted free of charge shares in 
Lundin Petroleum at the end of the performance period.
The number of performance shares that may be allotted 
to each participant is limited to a value of three times his/
her annual gross base salary for 2014. The total number of 
performance shares that may be allotted under LTIP 2014 is 
700,000, corresponding to approximately 0,2 percent of the total 
number of outstanding shares in Lundin Petroleum. The Board 
of Directors may reduce (including reduce to zero) allotment 
of performance shares at its discretion, should it consider the 
underlying performance not to be reﬂ ected in the outcome of 
the performance condition, for example, in light of operating 
cash ﬂ ow, reserves, and health and safety performance.
Joint venture creditors and accrued expenses amounted 
to MUSD 334.5 (MUSD 213.9) and MUSD 41.0 (MUSD 8.3) 
respectively and related mainly to the increased development 
and drilling activity in Norway.
The participants will not be entitled to transfer, pledge or 
dispose of the LTIP awards or any rights or obligations under 
LTIP 2014, or perform any shareholders’ rights regarding the 
LTIP awards during the performance period.
Other liabilities amounted to MUSD 42.6 (MUSD 15.4) and 
are detailed in Note 24. The overlift position amounted to 
MUSD 29.2 (MUSD 0.5) and related to the overlift of the Alvheim 
and Volund ﬁ elds production entitlement at 31 December 2013.
Short term provisions amounted to MUSD 46.2 (MUSD 8.8) 
and related to the current portion of the provision for Lundin 
Petroleum’s LTIP scheme. The current portion of the provision 
includes the vested amount of the phantom option plan payable 
in May 2014. For more information refer to Note 29, Related 
party transactions.
The LTIP awards entitle participants to acquire already existing 
shares. To ensure delivery of the required number of shares 
under LTIP 2014, the Board of Directors will consider means to 
secure the Company’s commitment. One method would be to 
enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms 
in accordance with market practice, whereby the third party in 
its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares in 
Lundin Petroleum to the participants.
The details of the proposal are available on 
www.lundin-petroleum.com.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held in Stockholm on 
15 May 2014.
In addition, as in previous years, the Board of Directors will 
further seek authorisation to deviate from the Policy on 
Remuneration in case of special circumstances in a speciﬁ c case.
Board’s Proposal for Remuneration to Group 
Management
The intention of the Board of Directors is to propose to the 
2014 AGM the adoption of a Policy on Remuneration for 2014 
that follows in essence the same principles as applied in 2013
For a detailed description of the Policy on Remuneration applied 
in 2013, refer to the Corporate Governance report on pages 
46–66. The remuneration to Board and Executive Management 
is detailed in Notes 31 and 32.

Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
Lundin Petroleum’s annual report has been prepared in 
accordance with prevailing International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) and International Financial Reporting 
Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) interpretations adopted by 
the EU Commission and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act 
(1995:1554). In addition RFR 1 “Supplementary Rules for Groups” 
has been applied as issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting 
Board. The Parent Company applies the same accounting 
policies as the Group, except as speciﬁ ed in the Parent Company 
accounting policies on page 116.
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process 
of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving 
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are signiﬁ cant to the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements are disclosed under the headline “Critical 
accounting estimates and judgements”.
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention, as modiﬁ ed by the revaluation 
of available for sale ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial assets and 
liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through 
other comprehensive income.
Accounting standards, amendments and 
interpretations
As from 1 January 2013, Lundin Petroleum has applied the 
following new accounting standards: IFRS 13 Fair value 
measurement, revised IAS 1 Presentation of ﬁ nancial statements 
and amendment to IFRS 7 Financial instruments.
IFRS 13, “Fair value measurement” The standard aims to 
improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a 
precise deﬁ nition of fair value and a single source of fair value 
measurement and disclosure requirements for use across 
IFRSs. The standard does not have any signiﬁ cant effect on the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the Group.
Amendment to IAS 1, “Financial statement presentation” The 
amendment includes a requirement to group items presented in 
other comprehensive income on the basis of whether they are 
potentially reclassiﬁ able to proﬁ t or loss subsequently.
Amendment to IFRS 7, “Financial instruments – disclosures” The 
amendment includes new disclosures and does not have any 
signiﬁ cant effect on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the 
Group.
The following new issued standards are not mandatory for 
the 2013 ﬁ nancial statements and have not been adopted 
early. These standards might lead to signiﬁ cant changes in 
the accounting and standard practice for the industry. Careful 
consideration will be required to assess the practical implication 
for the Group.
IFRS 9, “Financial instruments” The standard addresses the 
classiﬁ cation, measurement and recognition of ﬁ nancial assets 
and ﬁ nancial liabilities. IFRS 9 is effective from 1 January 2015,
and not from 1 January 2013 as originally intended. The Group 
is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no 
later than the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2015.
IFRS 10, “Consolidated ﬁ nancial statements” The objective of the 
standard is to build on existing principles by identifying the 
concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity 
should be included within the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements 
of the parent company. The Group intends to adopt IFRS 10 from 
1 January 2014.
IFRS 11, “Joint arrangements” The standard is focusing on the 
rights and obligations of the joint arrangement rather than 
its legal form. There are two types of joint arrangement: joint 
operations and joint ventures. Joint operations arise where a 
joint operator has rights to the assets and obligations relating 
to the arrangement and hence accounts for its interest in assets, 
liabilities, revenue and expenses. Joint ventures arise where the 
joint operator has rights to the net assets of the arrangement 
and hence equity accounts for its interest. The Group intends to 
adopt IFRS 11 from 1 January 2014. See section jointly controlled 
entities below.
IFRS 12, “Disclosures of interests in other entities” The standard 
introduces a range of new and expanded disclosure 
requirements. These will require the disclosure of signiﬁ cant 
judgements and assumptions made by management in 
determining whether there is joint control and if there is a joint 
venture, a joint operation or another form of interest. The Group 
intends to adopt IFRS 12 from 1 January 2014.
Principles of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the sole 
right to exercise control over the operations and govern the 
ﬁ nancial policies generally accompanying a shareholding of 
more than half of the voting rights. The existence and effect 
of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or 
convertible are considered when assessing the Group’s control. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group and are de-consolidated from 
the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for 
business combinations. The consideration transferred for 
the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets 
transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of 
the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The 
consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or 
liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. 
Identiﬁ able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The non-controlling interest in a subsidiary represents the 
portion of the subsidiary not owned by the Group. The equity 
of the subsidiary relating to the non-controlling shareholders is 
shown as a separate item within equity for the Group. The Group 
recognises any non-controlling interest on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of 
acquiree’s identiﬁ able net assets.
90
Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition 
date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the 
acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-
measurement are recognised in proﬁ t or loss.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-
controlling interest over the net identiﬁ able assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair 
value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference 
is recognised in proﬁ t or loss.
Inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses on 
transactions between group companies are eliminated. Proﬁ ts 
and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are 
recognised in assets are also eliminated. Accounting policies 
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
Jointly controlled entities
As stated above, a subsidiary that is controlled by the Group will 
be fully consolidated within the results of Lundin Petroleum. 
Joint control exists when the Group does not have the control 
to determine the strategic operating, investing and ﬁ nancing 
policies of a partially owned entity without the co-operation 
of others. When this is the case the entity is proportionally 
consolidated.
These jointly controlled entities will be accounted for  in 
accordance with IFRS 11 joint arrangements, effective from 1 
January 2014 and will be accounted for using the equity method. 
The effect of the change in the accounting policy on the 2013 
income statement and the balance sheet at 31 December 2013 of 
the Group is shown below. The change in accounting policy will 
not have any impact on earnings per share.

1RF Energy group will be accounted for as a joint venture using the equity
method.
Jointly controlled assets
Oil and gas operations are conducted by the Group as co-
licencees in unincorporated joint ventures with other companies. 
The Group’s ﬁ nancial statements reﬂ ect the relevant proportions 
of production, capital costs, operating costs and current assets 
and liabilities of the joint venture applicable to the Group’s 
interests.
Associated companies
An investment in an associated company is an investment in an 
undertaking where the Group exercises signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence but 
not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of at least 
20 percent but not more than 50 percent of the voting rights. 
Such investments are accounted for in the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with the equity method and are 
initially recognised at cost.
Other shares and participations
Investments where the shareholding is less than 20 percent 
of the voting rights are treated as available for sale ﬁ nancial 
assets. If the value of these assets has declined signiﬁ cantly or 
has lasted for a longer period, the cumulative loss is removed 
from equity and an impairment charge is recognised in the 
income statement. Dividends received attributable to these assets 
is recognised in the income statement as part of net ﬁ nancial 
items.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the ﬁ nancial statements of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (‘functional 
currency’). The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are presented 
in United States Dollars, which is the currency the Group has 
elected to use as the presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance 
sheet date and foreign exchange currency differences are 
recognised in the income statement. Transactions in foreign 
currencies are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the 
transaction date. Exchange differences are included in ﬁ nancial 
income/expenses in the income statement except deferred 
exchange differences on qualifying cash ﬂ ow hedges which are 
recorded in other comprehensive income.
Presentation currency
The balance sheets and income statements of foreign Group 
companies are translated for consolidation purposes using the 
current rate method. All assets and liabilities are translated at 
the balance sheet date rates of exchange, whereas the income 
statements are translated at average rates of exchange for the 
year, except for transactions where it is more relevant to use the 
rate of the day of the transaction. The translation differences 
which arise are recorded directly in the foreign currency 
translation reserve within other comprehensive income. Upon 
disposal of a foreign operation the translation differences 
relating to that operation will be transferred from equity to the 
income statement and included in the result on sale. Translation 
differences arising from net investments in subsidiaries, used for

Classification of assets and liabilities
Non-current assets, long-term liabilities and provisions consist 
of amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid more than 
twelve months after the balance sheet date. Current assets and 
current liabilities consist solely of amounts that are expected 
to be recovered or paid within twelve months after the balance 
sheet date.
Oil and gas properties
Oil and gas operations are recorded at historical cost less 
depletion. All costs for acquiring concessions, licences or 
interests in production sharing contracts and for the survey, 
drilling and development of such interests are capitalised on a 
ﬁ eld area cost centre basis.
Costs directly associated with an exploration well are capitalised. 
If it is determined that a commercial discovery has not been 
achieved, these exploration costs are charged to the income 
statement. During the exploration and development phases, 
no depletion is charged. The ﬁ eld will be transferred from the 
non-production cost pool to the production cost pool within oil 
and gas properties once production commences, and accounted 
for as a producing asset. Routine maintenance and repair costs 
for producing assets are expensed as production costs when they 
occur.
Net capitalised costs to reporting date, together with anticipated 
future capital costs for the development of the proved and 
probable reserves determined at the balance sheet date price 
levels, are depleted based on the year’s production in relation 
to estimated total proved and probable reserves of oil and gas 
in accordance with the unit of production method. Depletion of 
a ﬁ eld area is charged to the income statement through cost of 
sales once production commences.
Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by 
analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated 
with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable, from 
a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under current 
economic conditions, operating methods and governmental 
regulations. Proved reserves can be categorised as developed 
or undeveloped. If deterministic methods are used, the term 
reasonable certainty is intended to express a high degree of 
conﬁ dence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 90 percent
Probable reserves are those unproved reserves which analysis of 
geological and engineering data suggests are more likely than not 
to be recoverable. In this context, when probabilistic methods 
are used, there should be at least a 50 percent probability that 
the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of 
estimated proved plus probable reserves.
Proceeds from the sale or farm-out of oil and gas concessions in 
the exploration stage are offset against the related capitalised 
costs of each cost centre with any excess of net proceeds over all 
costs capitalised included in the income statement. In the event 
of a sale in the exploration stage, any deﬁ cit is included in the 
income statement.
Impairment tests are performed annually or when there are 
facts and circumstances that suggest that the carrying value 
of an asset  capitalised costs within each ﬁ eld area cost centre 
less any provision for site restoration costs, royalties and 
deferred production or revenue related taxes is higher than 
the anticipated future net cash ﬂ ow from oil and gas reserves 
attributable to the Group’s interest in the related ﬁ eld areas. 
Capitalised costs cannot be carried unless those costs can be 
supported by future cash ﬂ ows from that asset. Provision is made 
for any impairment, where the net carrying value, according to 
the above, exceeds the recoverable amount, which is the higher 
of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, determined 
through estimated future discounted net cash ﬂ ows using prices 
and cost levels used by Group management in their internal 
forecasting. If there is no decision to continue with a ﬁ eld 
speciﬁ c exploration programme, the costs will be expensed at the 
time the decision is made.
Other tangible assets
Other tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation. Depreciation is based on cost and is calculated on 
a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of 20 years 
for real estate and 3 to 5 years for ofﬁ ce equipment and other 
assets. The FPSO vessel will be depreciated over its remaining 
useful life once the upgrade of the vessel has been completed.
Additional costs to existing assets are included in the assets’ net 
book value or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic beneﬁ ts associated with 
the item will ﬂ ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. The net book value of any replaced parts is 
written off. Other additional expenses are deemed to be repair 
and maintenance costs and are charged to the income statement 
when they are incurred.
The net book value is written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount when the net book value is higher. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost 
to sell and value in use.
Impairment of assets excluding oil and gas properties
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there 
is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an 
indicator of impairment exists or when impairment testing for
92
Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
an asset is required, the Group makes a formal assessment of 
the recoverable amount. Where the carrying value of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired 
and is written down to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use. Value in use is calculated by discounting 
estimated future cash ﬂ ows to their present value using a 
discount rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset. When 
the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an 
impairment loss is recognised with the expensed charge to the 
income statement. If indications exist that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or are decreased, the 
recoverable amount is estimated. When a previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed the carrying amount of the asset 
is increased to the estimated recoverable amount but the 
increased carrying amount may not exceed the carrying amount 
after depreciation that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Financial instruments
Assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus 
transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
unless stated otherwise. Financial assets are derecognised when 
the rights to receive cash ﬂ ows from the investments have 
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Lundin Petroleum recognises the following ﬁ nancial 
instruments:
· Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using
the effective interest method less provision for impairment. 
Translation differences are reported in the income statement 
except for the translation differences arising from long-term 
loans to subsidiaries used for ﬁ nancing exploration activities 
and for which no ﬁ xed terms of repayment exists, which are 
recorded directly in other comprehensive income.
· Other shares and participations (available for sale ﬁ nancial 
assets) are valued at fair value and any change in fair value 
is recorded directly in the fair value reserve within other 
comprehensive income until realised. Where other shares and 
participations do not have a quoted market price in an active 
market and whose fair value cannot be measured reliably, 
they are accounted for at cost less impairment if applicable. 
A gain or a loss on available for sale ﬁ nancial assets shall 
be recognised in other comprehensive income, except for 
impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses until 
the ﬁ nancial asset is derecognised.
· Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value
on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method of 
recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the 
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument. The Group 
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on 
an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes 
in fair values or cash ﬂ ows of hedged items. When derivatives 
do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group has only cash ﬂ ow hedges which qualify for hedge 
accounting. The effective portion of changes in the fair value 
of derivatives that qualify as cash ﬂ ow hedges are recognised in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive 
income are transferred to the income statement in the period 
when the hedged item will affect the income statement. When 
a hedging instrument no longer meets the requirements for 
hedge accounting, expires or is sold, any accumulated gain 
or loss recognised in other comprehensive income remains in 
shareholders’ equity until the forecast transaction no longer is 
expected to occur, at which point it is transferred to the income 
statement.
Inventories
Inventories of consumable well supplies are stated at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value, cost being determined on a 
weighted average cost basis. Net realisable value is the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable 
variable selling expenses. Inventories of hydrocarbons are stated 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Under or overlifted 
positions of hydrocarbons are valued at market prices prevailing 
at the balance sheet date. An underlift of production from a ﬁ eld 
is included in the current receivables and valued at the reporting 
date spot price or prevailing contract price and an overlift of 
production from a ﬁ eld is included in the current liabilities and 
valued at the reporting date spot price or prevailing contract 
price. From 1 January 2013, the change in the over or underlift 
position is reﬂ ected in the income statement as revenue.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, cash in hand 
and interest bearing securities with original maturities of three 
months or less.
Equity
Share capital consists of the registered share capital for the 
Parent Company. Share issue costs associated with the issuance 
of new equity are treated as a direct reduction of proceeds. Excess 
contribution in relation to the issuance of shares is accounted for 
in the item additional paid-in-capital.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity 
share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including 
any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) 
is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity 
holders until these shares are cancelled or sold. Where these 
shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received, net 
of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and 
related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to 
the Company’s equity holders.
The change in fair value of other shares and participations is 
accounted for in the fair value reserve. Upon the realisation 
of a change in value, the change in fair value recorded will be 
transferred to the income statement. The change in fair value 
of hedging instruments which qualify for hedge accounting 
is accounted for in the hedge reserve. Upon settlement of the 
hedge instrument, the change in fair value remains in other 
comprehensive income until the hedged item effects the income 
statement. The currency translation reserve contains unrealised
Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
93
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
translation differences due to the conversion of the functional 
currencies into the presentation currency.
Retained earnings contain the accumulated results attributable to 
the shareholders of the Parent Company.
Provisions
A provision is reported when the Company has a legal or 
constructive obligation as a consequence of an event and when 
it is more likely than not that an outﬂ ow of resources is required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation using a discount 
rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the obligation. The increase 
in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as ﬁ nancial 
expense.
On ﬁ elds where the Group is required to contribute to site 
restoration costs, a provision is recorded to recognise the future 
commitment. An asset is created, as part of the oil and gas 
property, to represent the discounted value of the anticipated 
site restoration liability and depleted over the life of the ﬁ eld 
on a unit of production basis. The corresponding accounting 
entry to the creation of the asset recognises the discounted value 
of the future liability. The discount applied to the anticipated 
site restoration liability is subsequently released over the life 
of the ﬁ eld and is charged to ﬁ nancial expenses. Changes in 
site restoration costs and reserves are treated prospectively and 
consistent with the treatment applied upon initial recognition.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of 
transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 
amortised costs using the effective interest method, with interest 
expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a ﬁ nancial liability and of allocating interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments 
through the expected life of the ﬁ nancial liability, or a shorter 
period where appropriate.
Revenue
Revenues from the sale of oil and gas are recognised in the 
income statement net of royalties taken in kind. Sales of oil 
and gas are recognised upon delivery of products and customer 
acceptance or on performance of services. Incidental revenues 
from the production of oil and gas are offset against capitalised 
costs of the related cost centre until quantities of proven and 
probable reserves are determined and commercial production 
has commenced. From 1 January 2013, the change in the over or 
underlift position is reﬂ ected in the income statement as revenue.
Service income, generated by providing technical and 
management services to joint ventures, is recognised as other 
income.
The ﬁ scal regime in the area of operations deﬁ nes whether 
royalties are payable in cash or in kind. Royalties payable in cash 
are accrued in the accounting period in which the liability arises. 
Royalties taken in kind are subtracted from production for the 
period to which they relate.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of qualifying assets are added to the cost of 
those assets. Qualifying assets are assets that take a substantial 
period of time to complete for their intended use or sale. 
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of 
speciﬁ c borrowings pending to be used for the qualifying asset 
is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. 
This applies on the interest on borrowings to ﬁ nance ﬁ elds under 
development which is capitalised within oil and gas properties 
until production commences. All other borrowing costs are 
recognised in proﬁ t or loss in the period in which they occur. 
Interest on borrowings to ﬁ nance the acquisition of producing 
oil and gas properties is charged to income as incurred.
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee beneﬁ ts such as salaries, social premiums 
and holiday pay, are expensed when incurred.
Pension obligations
Pensions are the most common long-term employee beneﬁ ts. 
The pension schemes are funded through payments to insurance 
companies. The Group’s pension obligations consist mainly of 
deﬁ ned contribution plans. A deﬁ ned contribution plan is a 
pension plan under which the Group pays ﬁ xed contributions. 
The Group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised 
as an expense when they are due.
The Group has one obligation under a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan. 
The relating liability recognised in the balance sheet is valued 
at the discounted estimated future cash outﬂ ows as calculated 
by an external actuarial expert. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group does not 
have any designated plan assets.
Share-based payments
Lundin Petroleum recognises cash-settled share-based payments 
in the income statement as expenses during the vesting period 
and as a liability in relation to the long-term incentive plan. The 
liability is measured at fair value and revalued using the Black & 
Scholes pricing model at each balance sheet date and at the date 
of settlement, with any change in fair value recognised in the 
income statement for the period.
Income taxes
The components of tax are current and deferred. Tax is 
recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, in which case it is matched.
Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received for the year 
in question and also includes adjustments of current tax 
attributable to previous periods.
94
Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
Deferred income tax is a non-cash charge provided, using the 
liability method, on temporary differences arising between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values. 
Temporary differences can occur for example where investment 
expenditure is capitalised for accounting purposes but the tax 
deduction is accelerated or where site restoration costs are 
provided for in the ﬁ nancial statements but not deductible for 
tax purposes until they are actually incurred. However, the 
deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable proﬁ t nor loss. Deferred income 
tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments 
in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax is determined 
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the 
deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable proﬁ t will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
from additional drilling, observation of long-term reservoir 
performance or changes in economic factors such as oil price and 
inﬂ ation rates.
Information about the carrying amounts of the oil and gas 
properties and the amounts charged to income, including 
depletion, exploration costs, and impairment costs is presented 
in Note 7.
Impairment of oil and gas properties 
Key assumptions in the impairment models relate to prices 
and costs that are based on forward curves and the long-term 
corporate assumptions. Lundin Petroleum carried out its annual 
impairment tests in conjunction with the annual reserves 
audit process. The calculation of the impairment requires the 
use of estimates. For the purpose of determining an eventual 
impairment the assumptions that management uses to estimate 
the future cash ﬂ ows for value-in-use are future oil and gas 
prices and expected production volumes. These assumptions and 
judgements of management that are based on them are subject 
to change as new information becomes available. Changes in 
economic conditions can also affect the rate used to discount 
future cash ﬂ ow estimates and the discount rate applied is 
reviewed throughout the year.
Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities in 
the balance sheet where they relate to the same jurisdiction in 
accordance with IAS 12.
Information about the carrying amounts of the oil and gas 
properties and impairment of oil and gas properties is presented 
in Note 3 and Note 7.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker being Executive Management, which, due to the unique 
nature of each country’s operations, commercial terms or ﬁ scal 
environment, is at a country level. Information for segments 
is only disclosed when applicable. Segmental information is 
presented in Notes; Note 3 Segment information, Note 6 Income 
taxes and Note 7 Oil and gas properties.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The management of Lundin Petroleum has to make estimates 
and judgements when preparing the ﬁ nancial statements of the 
Group. Uncertainties in the estimates and judgements could 
have an impact on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
and the Group’s result. The most important estimates and 
judgements in relation thereto are:
Estimates in oil and gas reserves
Estimates of oil and gas reserves are used in the calculations 
for impairment tests and accounting for depletion and site 
restoration. Standard recognised evaluation techniques are used 
to estimate the proved and probable reserves. These techniques 
take into account the future level of development required to 
produce the reserves. An independent reserves auditor reviews 
these estimates. See page 126 Reserve quantity Information. 
Changes in estimates in oil and gas reserves, resulting in 
different future production proﬁ les, will affect the discounted 
cash ﬂ ows used in impairment testing, the anticipated date of 
site decommissioning and restoration and the depletion charges 
in accordance with the unit of production method. Changes 
in estimates in oil and gas reserves could for example result
Provision for site restoration 
Amounts used in recording a provision for site restoration are 
estimates based on current legal and constructive requirements 
and current technology and price levels for the removal of 
facilities and plugging and abandoning of wells. Due to changes 
in relation to these items, the future actual cash outﬂ ows in 
relation to the site decommissioning and restoration can be 
different. To reﬂ ect the effects due to changes in legislation, 
requirements and technology and price levels, the carrying 
amounts of site restoration provisions are reviewed on a regular 
basis.
The effects of changes in estimates do not give rise to prior year 
adjustments and are treated prospectively over the estimated 
remaining commercial reserves of each ﬁ eld. While the Group 
uses its best estimates and judgement, actual results could differ 
from these estimates.
Information about the carrying amounts of the Provision for site

Note 3 – Segment Information
The Group operates within several geographical areas. Operating segments are reported at country level which is consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to Executive Management.
The following tables present segment information regarding; revenue, production costs, exploration costs, impairment costs of oil and gas 
properties, gross proﬁ t and certain asset and liability information regarding the Group’s business segments. In addition segment information is 
reported in Note 6 Income taxes and Note 7 Oil and gas properties.
Revenues are derived from various external customers. There were no intercompany sales or purchases in the year or in the previous year, 
and therefore there are no reconciling items towards the amounts stated in the income statement. Within each segment, revenues from 
transactions with a single external customer amount to ten percent or more of revenue for that segment. 70 percent of the total revenue is 
contracted with one customer. The Parent Company is included in other.

During 2013, MUSD 18.2 (MUSD 3.4) of interest was capitalised relating to Norwegian development projects.
Exchange rate variations result primarily from ﬂ uctuations in the value of the USD currency against a pool of currencies which includes, 
amongst others, EUR, NOK and the Russian Rouble (RUR). Lundin Petroleum has USD denominated debt recorded in subsidiaries using a 
functional currency other than USD. The foreign currency exchange loss, net includes a realised exchange gain of MUSD 5.5 (MUSD 11.7) on 
settled foreign exchange hedges.

1   The speciﬁ cation of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities does not agree to the face of the balance sheet due to the netting off of balances in the
balance sheet when they relate to the same jurisdiction.
The deferred tax asset is primarily relating to tax loss carried forwards in the Netherlands for an amount of  MUSD 30.9 (MUSD 12.6) and 
unused uplift carry forward in Norway of MUSD 59.4 (MUSD–). Deferred tax assets in relation to tax loss carried forwards are only recognised 
in so far that there is a reasonable certainty as to the timing and the extent of their realisation.
The deferred tax liability arises mainly on accelerated allowances, being the difference between the book and the tax value of oil and gas 
properties primarily in Norway, and tax on the excess value of the acquired assets in Russia. The deferred tax liability will be released over the 
life of the assets as the book value is depleted for accounting purposes.
Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has Dutch tax loss carry forwards of approximately MUSD 181 (MUSD 161). The tax losses can be carried forward and utilised for 
up to 9 years. A deferred tax asset relating to MUSD 57 (MUSD 110) of the tax loss carry forwards has not been recognised as at 31 December 
2013 due to the uncertainty as to the timing and the extent of the tax loss carry forward utilisation. This treatment is consistent with the 
comparative year’s accounts.

In 2012, the reclassiﬁ cation from Non-Production cost pools to Production cost pools related to the production start-up on the Gaupe ﬁ eld, 
Norway.
Impairment
Lundin Petroleum carried out its impairment testing at 31 December 2013 in conjunction with the annual reserves audit process. Lundin 
Petroleum used an oil price deck of USD 100 (USD 100) per bbl inﬂ ating at 2% (2%) per annum, a future cost inﬂ ation factor of 2% (2%) per 
annum and a discount rate of 8% (10%) to calculate the future post-tax cash ﬂ ows. As a result of the impairment testing performed, the 
carrying values of the Janglau and Ara discoveries on PM308A, Malaysia, were fully expensed in 2013 for an amount of MUSD 41.7 (MUSD –). 
In addition, impairment costs of MUSD 81.7 which related to the gas discoveries on PL438 Skalle, PL533 Salina and PL088 Peik, Norway, were 
expensed as they are currently deemed uncommercial. For further information on impairment, see the Directors Report on page 80.
Capitalised borrowing costs 
During 2013, MUSD 18.2 (MUSD 3.4) of capitalised interest costs were added to oil and gas properties and relate to Norwegian development 
projects. The interest rate for capitalised borrowing costs is calculated at the external facility borrowing rate of LIBOR plus the margin of 2.75% 
per annum.
Exploration expenditure commitments
The Group participates in joint ventures with third parties in oil and gas exploration activities. The Group is contractually committed under

The depreciation charge for the year is based on cost and an estimated useful life of 3 to 5 years for ofﬁ ce equipment and other assets. Real 
estate is depreciated using an estimated useful life of 20 years and taking into account its residual value. Depreciation is included within the 
general, administration and depreciation line in the income statement.
The FPSO will be depreciated over its remaining useful life once the upgrade of the vessel has been completed. For further information on 
FPSO, see the Directors Report on page 82.

In October 2009, Lundin Petroleum received 50 million shares of ShaMaran Petroleum Corp. (ShaMaran) in consideration for the sale of Lundin 
International BV (LIBV), a 100% owned subsidiary, which had commenced negotiations for Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) relating 
to exploration and development blocks in Kurdistan. The investment was booked at the fair value of the shares at the date of acquisition 
and under accounting rules, any subsequent movement in the fair value of the shares is being recorded in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
The fair value of ShaMaran is calculated using the quoted share price at the Toronto Stock Exchange at the balance sheet date and is detailed 
below.

Note 11 – Financial Risks, Sensitivity Analysis and Derivative Instruments
As an international oil and gas exploration and production company operating globally, Lundin Petroleum is exposed to ﬁ nancial risks such 
as currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risks, liquidity risks as well as the risk related to the ﬂ uctuation in the oil price. The Group seeks 
to control these risks through sound management practice and the use of internationally accepted ﬁ nancial instruments, such as oil price, 
interest rate and foreign exchange hedges. Lundin Petroleum uses ﬁ nancial instruments solely for the purpose of minimising risks in the 
Group’s business.
Capital management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and to meet its committed 
work programme requirements in order to create shareholder value. The Group may put in place new credit facilities, repay debt, or other 
such restructuring activities as appropriate. Group management continuously monitors and manages the Group’s net debt position in order to 
assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet the objectives and to maintain ﬂ exibility. Lundin Petroleum is not subject to 
any externally-imposed capital requirements.
No signiﬁ cant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2013.
Lundin Petroleum monitors capital on the basis of net debt. Net debt is calculated as bank loans as shown in the balance sheet less cash and 
cash equivalents.

The increase compared to 2012 is mainly due to the funding of the Norwegian development activities.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk to the earnings due to uncertain future interest rates.
Lundin Petroleum is exposed to interest rate risk through the credit facility (see also liquidity risk below). Lundin Petroleum will assess the 
beneﬁ ts of interest rate hedging on borrowings on a continuous basis. If the hedging contract provides a reduction in the interest rate risk at a 
price that is deemed acceptable to the Group, then Lundin Petroleum may choose to enter into an interest hedge.

In the ﬁ rst quarter of 2013, Lundin Petroleum entered into a three year ﬁ xed interest rate swap, starting 31 March 2013, in respect of 
MUSD 500 of borrowings, ﬁ xing the LIBOR rate at approximately 0.57 percent per annum. Further interest rate hedges were entered into in 
March 2014, see Note 34 Subsequent Events.
Currency risk
Lundin Petroleum is a Swedish company which is operating globally and therefore attracts substantial foreign exchange exposure, both 
transactional as well as conversion from functional currency to presentation currency. The functional currency of Lundin Petroleum’s 
subsidiaries are Norwegian Kroner (NOK), Euro (EUR) and Russian Rouble (RUR), as well as US Dollar, making Lundin Petroleum sensitive to 
ﬂ uctuations of these currencies against the US Dollar, the presentation currency.
Transaction exposure
Lundin Petroleum’s policy on the currency rate hedging is, in case of currency exposure, to consider setting the rate of exchange for known 
costs in non-US Dollar currencies to US Dollars in advance so that future US Dollar cost levels can be forecasted with a reasonable degree 
of certainty. The Group will take into account the current rates of exchange and market expectations in comparison to historic trends and 
volatility in making the decision to hedge.
The Group entered into currency hedging contracts ﬁ xing the rate of exchange from USD into NOK to meet NOK operational and tax 
requirements as summarised in the table below. Under IAS 39, subject to hedge effectiveness testing, all of the hedges are treated as effective 
and changes to the fair value are reﬂ ected in other comprehensive income. At 31 December 2013, a current asset amounting to MUSD 3.2 
(MUSD 9.1) and a non-current asset of MUSD 3.0 (MUSD –) has been recognised representing the fair value of part of the currency hedging 
contracts. The comparative period short term current asset related to currency hedge contracts. In addition, a current liability of MUSD 4.0 
(MUSD –) and a non-current liability of MUSD 1.6 (MUSD –) has been recognised representing the fair value of the outstanding currency and 
interest rate hedges.

Price of oil and gas
Price of oil and gas are affected by the normal economic drivers of supply and demand as well as the ﬁ nancial investors and market 
uncertainty. Factors that inﬂ uence these include operational decisions, natural disasters, economic conditions, political instability or conﬂ icts 
or actions by major oil exporting countries. Price ﬂ uctuations can affect Lundin Petroleum’s ﬁ nancial position.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GROUP

The impact on the net result from a change in oil price is reduced due to the 78 percent tax rate in Norway.
Lundin Petroleum’s policy is to adopt a ﬂ exible approach towards oil price hedging, based on an assessment of the beneﬁ ts of the hedge 
contract in speciﬁ c circumstances. Based on analysis of the circumstances, Lundin Petroleum will assess the beneﬁ ts of forward hedging 
monthly sales contracts for the purpose of establishing cash ﬂ ow. If it believes that the hedging contract will provide an enhanced cash ﬂ ow 
then it may choose to enter into an oil price hedge.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group did not enter into oil price hedging contracts. There are no oil price hedging contracts 
outstanding as at 31 December 2013.
Credit risk
Lundin Petroleum’s policy is to limit credit risk by limiting the counter-parties to major banks and oil companies. Where it is determined that 
there is a credit risk for oil and gas sales, the policy is to require an irrevocable letter of credit for the full value of the sale. The policy on joint 
venture parties is to rely on the provisions of the underlying joint operating agreements to take possession of the licence or the joint venture 
partner’s share of production for non-payment of cash calls or other amounts due.
As  at  31  December  2013,  the  Group’s  trade  receivables  amounted  to  128.9 (MUSD 125.9). There is no recent history of default. Other 
long-term and short-term receivables are considered recoverable. The provision for bad debt as at 31 December 2013 amounted to MUSD – 
(MUSD –). Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with banks having strong long-term credit ratings.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is deﬁ ned as the risk that the Group could not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. Group 
treasury is responsible for liquidity, funding as well as settlement management. In addition, liquidity and funding risks and related processes 
and policies are overseen by management.
On 25 June 2012, Lundin Petroleum entered into a seven year senior secured revolving borrowing base facility of USD 2.5 billion to provide 
funding for Lundin Petroleum’s ongoing exploration expenditure and development costs, particularly in Norway. This facility was increased 
to USD 4.0 billion in February 2014. It is expected that the Group’s ongoing development and exploration expenditure requirements will be 
funded by the Group’s operating cash ﬂ ow and the loan facility. No loan repayments are required for the credit facility in 2014. See Note 22 for 
more information regarding the Group’s credit facility.
Lundin Petroleum has, through its subsidiary Lundin Malaysia BV, entered into Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) with Petroliam Nasional 
Berhad, the oil and gas company of the Government of Malaysia (Petronas). Bank guarantees have been issued in support of the work 
commitments in relation to these PSCs and the outstanding amount of the bank guarantees at 31 December was MUSD 11.9 (MUSD 75.4).

The USD 2.5 billion ﬁ nancing facility, entered into on 25 June 2012 
is a revolving borrowing base facility secured against certain cash 
ﬂ ows generated by the Group. In February 2014 the facility was 
increased to USD 4.0 billion. The amount available under the facility 
is recalculated every six months based upon the calculated cash ﬂ ow 
generated by certain producing ﬁ elds at an oil price and economic 
assumptions agreed with the banking syndicate providing the 
facility. The maturity date of the bank facility is June 2019 and there 
is a loan reduction schedule which commences in 2016 and reduces 
to zero by the ﬁ nal maturity date. In addition, the amount available 
to borrow under the facility is based upon a net present value 
calculation of the assets’ future cash ﬂ ows. Based on the reduction 
schedule and the current availability calculation, part of the current 
outstanding bank loan balance falls due within ﬁ ve years.

The table above analyses the Group’s ﬁ nancial liabilities into 
relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at 
the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. Loan 
repayments are made based upon a net present value calculation 
of the assets’ future cash ﬂ ows. No loan repayments are currently 
forecast under this calculation.
The Group’s credit facility agreement provides that an “event of 
default” occurs where the Group does not comply with certain 
material covenants or where certain events occur as speciﬁ ed in 
the agreement, as are customary in ﬁ nancing agreements of this 
size and nature. If such an event of default occurs and subject to 
any applicable cure periods, the external lenders may take certain 
speciﬁ ed actions to enforce their security, including accelerating the 
repayment of outstanding amounts under the credit facility. The 
Group is not in breach of the debt covenants.

Note 25 – Pledged Assets
In June 2012, Lundin Petroleum entered into a seven year senior 
secured revolving borrowing base facility of USD 2.5 billion as 
described in Note 22 Financial Liabilities. The facility is secured by a 
pledge over the shares of certain Group companies and a charge over 
some of the bank accounts of the pledged companies. The pledged 
amount at 31 December 2013 is MUSD 1,870.3 (MUSD 1,831.3) 
equivalent and represents the accounting value of net assets of the 
Group companies whose shares are pledged as described in the 
parent company section below.
Note 26 – Contingent Liabilities and Assets
Contingent Liabilities 
In connection with the acquisition by Lundin Petroleum of the 
additional 30 percent interest in the Lagansky Block in 2009, Lundin 
Petroleum has agreed to pay to the former owner of the Lagansky 
Block a fee to be based on USD 0.30 per barrel of oil in respect of 
30% of the proven and probable reserves in the Lagansky Block as at 
the date a decision is made to proceed to a development.
Contingent Assets 
In connection with the acquisition of a 30 percent interest in the 
Lagansky Block by a subsidiary of Gunvor International BV in 2009, 
Gunvor has agreed to pay to Lundin Petroleum a fee to be based on 
USD 0.15 per barrel of oil (up to gross 150 MMbbls) and USD 0.30 
per barrel of oil (over gross 150 MMbbls) of the proven and probable 
reserves in the Lagansky Block as at the date a decision is made to 
proceed to a development.
The amounts of the contingent asset and liability related to the 
Lagansky Block are dependent on the outcome of future exploration 
and production activities. Due to the uncertainties related to these 
activities, estimates of the cash inﬂ ow and outﬂ ow cannot be 
calculated with certainty.
In connection with the sale by Lundin Petroleum of its Salawati 
(Indonesia) interests to RH Petrogas in 2010, RH Petrogas has 
agreed to pay to Lundin Petroleum up to MUSD 3.9 as deferred 
consideration. The amount and timing of such payment will be 
determined based on certain future ﬁ eld developments within the 
Salawati Island Block.

3  In December 2013, the Compensation Committee awarded a bonus for 2013 of one month’s salary to Executive Management. In January 2014, the
Compensation Committee reassessed the bonus payments made for 2013 considering the employees’ contributions to the results of the Group and the 
achievement of personal targets and awarded additional bonuses payable in January 2014. The same reassessment was made in January 2013 for 2012 
and the amounts are included in the cost of 2013.
4 Other remuneration paid during 2013 relates to fees paid for special assignments undertaken by Board members on behalf of the Group. The payment
of such fees was in accordance with fees approved by the 2013 AGM.
Board members
There are no severance pay agreements in place for any non-executive directors and such directors are not eligible to participate in any of the 
Group’s incentive programmes.
Executive Management
The pension contribution is between 15% and 18% of the qualifying income for pension purposes. Qualifying income is deﬁ ned as annual base 
salary and short-term variable salary and is capped at approximately TCHF 842 (TUSD 946). The normal retirement age for the CEO is 65 years.
A mutual termination period of between one month and six months applies between the Company and Executive Management, depending on 
the duration of the employment with the Company, where the maximum applies as of the tenth year of employment. In addition, severance 
terms are incorporated into the employment contracts for Executives that give rise to compensation, equal to two years’ base salary, in the 
event of termination of employment due to a change of control of the Company.
During the fourth quarter of 2013, Lundin Petroleum announced that Geoffrey Turbott, VP Finance and CFO, will leave the Company in 
mid-2014. Under agreed severance terms, Geoffrey Turbott will receive a payment equal to one years’ base salary on his departure, which the 
Board authorised as a permitted deviation from the Policy on Remuneration for the Executive Management, taking into account the special 
circumstances of his substantial contributions to the Company over his years of service.
See page 58–61 of the Corporate Governance report for further information on the Company’s principles of remuneration and the Policy on 
Remuneration for the Executive Management for 2013.
Note 32 – Long-Term Incentive Plans
The Company maintains the long-term incentive plans (LTIP) described below.
Unit Bonus Plan
In 2008, Lundin Petroleum implemented a LTIP scheme consisting of a Unit Bonus Plan which provides for an annual grant of units that 
will lead to a cash payment at vesting. The LTIP has a three year duration whereby the initial grant of units vested equally in three tranches: 
one third after one year; one third after two years; and the ﬁ nal third after three years. The cash payment is conditional upon the holder of 
the units remaining an employee of the Group at the time of payment. The share price for determining the cash payment at the end of each 
vesting period will be the ﬁ ve trading day average closing Lundin Petroleum share price prior to and following the actual vesting date. The 
exercise price at vesting date 31 May 2013 was SEK 139.89.

LTIPs that follow the same principles as the 2008 LTIP have subsequently been implemented each year for employees other than Executive 
Management.
The following table shows the number of units issued under the LTIPs, the amount outstanding as at 31 December 2013 and the year in which 
the units will vest.

LTIP awards are recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements pro rata over their vesting period. The total carrying amount for the provision for the 
Unit Bonus Plan including social costs at 31 December 2013 amounted to MUSD 8.8 (MUSD 12.0). The provision is calculated based on Lundin 
Petroleum’s share price at the balance sheet date. The closing share price at 31 December 2013 was SEK 125.40.
Phantom Option Plan
At the AGM on 13 May 2009, the shareholders of Lundin Petroleum approved the implementation of an LTIP for Executive Management (being 
the President and Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, the Chief Operating Ofﬁ cer, the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and the Senior Vice President Development) 
consisting of a grant of phantom options exercisable after ﬁ ve years from the date of grant. The exercise of these options entitles the recipient 
to receive a cash payment based on the appreciation of the market value of the Lundin Petroleum share. Payment of the award under these 
phantom options will occur in two equal instalments: (i) ﬁ rst on the date immediately following the ﬁ fth anniversary of the date of grant and 
(ii) second on the date which is one year following the date of the ﬁ rst payment.
The LTIP for Executive Management includes 5,500,928 phantom options with an exercise price of SEK 52.91. The phantom options will vest in 
May 2014 being the ﬁ fth anniversary of the date of grant. The recipients will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the average closing 
price of the Company’s shares during the ﬁ fth year following grant, less the exercise price, multiplied by the number of phantom options. The 
participants of the phantom option plan are not entitled to receive new awards under the Unit Bonus Plan whilst the phantom options are still 
outstanding. The Phantom options outstanding as at 31 December 2013 are detailed in the following table:

2014. In accordance with the rules of the phantom option plan, Geoffrey Turbott will receive full settlement for his entitlement under the plan 
in 2014.
Lundin Petroleum purchased 6,882,638 of its own shares up to 31 December 2010 at an average cost of SEK 46.51 per share to mitigate against 
the exposure of the LTIP. The Lundin Petroleum share price at 31 December 2013 was SEK 125.40. The provision for LTIP amounted to MUSD 68.2 
including social charges as at 31 December 2013 and the market value of these shares held at 31 December 2013 was MUSD 134.4. The gain in the 
value of the own shares held cannot be offset against the cost for the LTIP in the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with accounting rules.

Lundin Petroleum Annual Report 2013
121
Auditor’s Report
To the annual meeting of the shareholders of Lundin 
Petroleum AB (publ), corporate identity number 
556610-8055
Report on the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts
We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts of Lundin Petroleum AB (publ) for the year 2013. The 
annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company 
are included in the printed version of this document on pages 
73–121.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President 
for the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
The Board of Directors and the President are responsible 
for the preparation and fair presentation of these annual 
accounts in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and of 
the consolidated accounts in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU, and the 
Annual Accounts Act, and for such internal control as the Board 
of Directors and the President determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
Auditor’s responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in 
Sweden. Those standards require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error. In 
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal 
control relevant to the company’s preparation and fair 
presentation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit 
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
made by the Board of Directors and the President, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufﬁ cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinions.
Opinions
In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared 
in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present 
fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁ nancial position of the 
parent company as of 31 December 2013 and of its ﬁ nancial 
performance and its cash ﬂ ows for the year then ended in 
accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated 
accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual 
Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the 
ﬁ nancial position of the group as of 31 December 2013 and of
their ﬁ nancial performance and cash ﬂ ows for the year then 
ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards, as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts 
Act. Our opinions do not cover the corporate governance 
statement on pages 46–66. The statutory administration report 
is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts.
We therefore recommend that the annual meeting of 
shareholders adopt the income statement and balance sheet for 
the parent company and the group.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, we have also audited the proposed appropriations of 
the company’s proﬁ t or loss and the administration of the Board 
of Directors and the President of Lundin Petroleum AB (publ) for 
the year 2013.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President
The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for 
appropriations of the company’s proﬁ t or loss, and the Board of 
Directors and the President are responsible for administration 
under the Companies Act.
Auditor’s responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion with reasonable 
assurance on the proposed appropriations of the company’s 
proﬁ t or loss and on the administration based on our audit. 
We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards in Sweden.
As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’ proposed 
appropriations of the company’s proﬁ t or loss whether the 
proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.
As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from liability, in 
addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, we examined signiﬁ cant decisions, actions taken and 
circumstances of the company in order to determine whether 
any member of the Board of Directors or the President is liable 
to the company. We also examined whether any member of the 
Board of Directors or the President has, in any other way, acted 
in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts 
Act or the Articles of Association.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufﬁ cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.
Opinions
We recommend to the annual meeting of shareholders that the 
proﬁ t be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the 
statutory administration report and that the members of the 
Board of Directors and the President be discharged from liability 
for the ﬁ nancial year.

This information has been made public in accordance with the Securities Market Act (SFS 2007:528) and/or the Financial Instruments Trading Act (SFS 
1991:980).
Forward-Looking Statements 
Certain statements made and information contained herein constitute “forward-looking information” (within the meaning of applicable securities 
legislation). Such statements and information (together, “forward-looking statements”) relate to future events, including the Company’s future 
performance, business prospects or opportunities. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to estimates of 
reserves and/or resources, future production levels, future capital expenditures and their allocation to exploration and development activities, future 
drilling and other exploration and development activities.  Ultimate recovery of reserves or resources are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of 
amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.
All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Statements concerning proven and probable reserves and 
resource estimates may also be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements and reﬂ ect conclusions that are based on certain assumptions that 
the reserves and resources can be economically exploited. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, 
beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as “seek”, 
“anticipate”, “plan”, “continue”, “estimate”, “expect”, “may”, “will”, “project”, “predict”, “potential”, “targeting”, “intend”, “could”, “might”, “should”, 
“believe” and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be “forward-looking statements”. Forward-looking statements involve 
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such 
forward-looking statements.  No assurance can be given that these expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct and such forward-looking 
statements should not be relied upon.  These statements speak only as on the date of the information and the Company does not intend, and does 
not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable laws. These forward-looking statements 
involve risks and uncertainties relating to, among other things, operational risks (including exploration and development risks), productions costs, 
availability of drilling equipment, reliance on key personnel, reserve estimates, health, safety and environmental issues, legal risks and regulatory 
changes, competition, geopolitical risk, and ﬁ nancial risks. These risks and uncertainties are described in more detail under the heading “Risks and Risk 
Management” and elsewhere in the Company’s annual report.  Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of risk factors should not be construed as 
exhaustive. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.   Forward-looking statements are 
expressly qualiﬁ ed by this cautionary statement.
Reserves and Resources
Unless otherwise stated, Lundin Petroleum’s reserve and resource estimates are as at 31 December 2013, and have been prepared and audited in 
accordance with National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (“NI 51-101”) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook (“COGE Handbook”).”). Unless otherwise stated, all reserves estimates contained herein are the aggregate of “Proved Reserves” and “Probable 
Reserves”, together also known as “2P Reserves”. For further information on reserve and resource classiﬁ cations, see “Reserves, Resources and 
Production” in the Company’s annual report.
Contingent Resources
Contingent Resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using 
established technology or technology under development, but are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Contingencies may include factors such as economic, legal, environmental, political and regulatory matters or a lack of markets.  There is 
no certainty that it will be commercially viable for the Company to produce any portion of the Contingent Resources.
Prospective Resources
Prospective Resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by 
application of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both a chance of discovery and a chance of development.  There is no certainty 
that any portion of the Prospective Resources will be discovered.  If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce 
any portion of the Prospective Resources. Unless otherwise stated, all Prospective Resource estimates contained herein are reﬂ ecting a P50 Prospective 
Resource estimate. Risked Prospective Resources reported herein are partially risked. They have been risked for chance of discovery, but have not been 
risked for chance of development.
 
BOEs
BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf : 1 Bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method 
primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
Designated Foreign Issuer
The Company is a reporting issuer in certain Canadian jurisdictions. However, the Company is a “designated foreign issuer” as deﬁ ned in National 
Instrument 71-102 Continuous Disclosure and Other Exemptions Relating to Foreign Issuers, and is subject to foreign regulatory requirements, including 
those of the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. As such, the Company is exempt from certain requirements otherwise imposed on reporting issuers in Canada.

Petroleum
Lundin Petroleum is one of the 
largest independent oil companies 
in Europe. It has two strategic focus 
areas, Norway and South East Asia. 
Norway is of particular importance 
to Lundin Petroleum representing 
around 75 percent of its reserves and 
production. In addition to Norway, the 
Company has operations in France, 
the Netherlands, Russia, Malaysia and 
Indonesia.
Lundin Petroleum has operations 
throughout the entire upstream value 
chain; exploration, development 
and production. Finding oil through 
exploration is Lundin Petroleum’s 
core competence and the Company 
has developed a strategy which has 
been very successful in Norway. 
This strategy has been adopted 
throughout the Company and is also 
producing results in South East Asia 
and elsewhere.
