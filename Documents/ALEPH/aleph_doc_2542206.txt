              Notes to Condensed Financial Statements
December 31, 2003
NOTE 1    BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared without
         audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
         Exchange Commission.  The interim financial statements reflect all
         adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to
         present a fair statement of the results for the period.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
         financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
         accounting principles have been condensed or omitted.  It is
         suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in
         conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included
         in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10KSB for the year ended
         September 30, 2003.  The results of operation for the period ended
         December 31, 2003 are not necessarily indicative of the operating
         results for the full years.
NOTE 2    LIQUIDITY/GOING CONCERN
The Company does not have significant assets, not has it established
          operations and has accumulated losses since inception.  These
          factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
          continue as a going concern.  It is the intent of the Company to
          seek a merger with an existing, well-capitalized operating company.
          The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
          result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
NOTE 3    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company owes a related party for the expenses paid on their
          behalf for the period ending December 31, 2003 in the amount of $60.
          The Company has recorded a liability of $9,237 as of December 31,
          2003.  The unsecured loan bears no interest and is due on demand.
NOTE 4    SUBSEQUENT EVENT
As of November 29, 2005, the Company has been deemed released from a
          November 11, 1989 Judgment with interest totaling $55,673.22, a
          December 31, 1986 Federal Tax Lien totaling $506.77, and a December
          31, 1987 Federal Tax Lien totaling $538.94.  The total amount of
          $56,719 is the total amount of the reported accrued liabilities.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
Plan of Operation.
- ------------------
Our Company's plan of operation for the next 12 months is to:(i)
consider guidelines of industries in which our Company may have an interest;
(ii) adopt a business plan regarding engaging in business in any selected
industry; and (iii) to commence such operations through funding and/or the
acquisition of a "going concern" engaged in any industry selected.
Our Company's only foreseeable cash requirements during the next 12
months will relate to maintaining our Company in good standing in the State
of Delaware, as well as legal and accounting fees.  Management does not
anticipate that our Company will have to raise additional funds during the
next 12 months.
Results of Operations.
- ----------------------
Three Months Ended December 31, 2003 compared to Three Months Ended December
31, 2002.
- ---------
In the quarterly period ended December 31, 2003, we had sales of $0,
compared to the quarterly period ended December 31, 2002, with sales of $0.
General and administrative expenses were $60 for the December 31, 2003 period
compared to $1,156 for the December 31, 2002 period.  We had net loss of $60
for the December 31, 2003 period compared to a net loss of $1,156 for the
December 31, 2002 period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources.
- --------------------------------
Our total assets as of December 31, 2003, were $4,889.  We do depend
on a shareholder being able to loan us money to fund our attempt to get and
maintain our Company current in its filings and if this shareholder is not
able to loan us the money our ability to continue in our attempt to get and
maintain our Company current would be substantially reduced.
Forward-Looking Statements.
- ---------------------------
The foregoing discussion contains forward-looking statements that
discuss, among other things, future expectations and projections regarding
future developments, operations and financial conditions. All forward-looking
statements are based on management's existing beliefs about present and future
events outside of management's control and on assumptions that may prove to be
incorrect. If any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, Westcott's actual
results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, projected or
intended.
Item 3.   Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
President and Secretary, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures.  Based on this evaluation, our President and Secretary concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed or filed by us is recorded,
processed or summarized, with the time periods specified in the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It should be noted
that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.  In addition, we
reviewed our internal controls over financial reporting, and there have been
no changes in our internal controls or in other factors in the last fiscal
quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal control over financial reporting.

CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO
         SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002
I, Wayne Bassham, President of Westcott Products Corporation (the "small
business issuer"), certify that:
1.   I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-QSB of the small
business issuer;
2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such
statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by
this Quarterly Report;
3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other
financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows of the small business issuer as of, and for, the periods presented in
this Quarterly Report;
4.   The small business issuer's other certifying officer(s) and I are
responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the small business issuer and have:
a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          small business issuer, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
          made known to me by others within those entities, particularly
          during the period in which this Quarterly Report is being prepared;
b)   evaluated the effectiveness of the small business issuer's
          disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this Quarterly
          Report my conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure
          controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this
          Quarterly Report based on such evaluation; and
c)   disclosed in this Quarterly Report any change in the small business
          issuer's internal control over financial reporting that occurred
          during the small business issuer's most recent fiscal quarter (the
          small business issuer's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an
          annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
          to materially affect, the small business issuer's internal control
          over financial reporting; and
5.   The small business issuer's other certifying officer(s) and I have
disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting, to the small business issuer's auditors and the audit
committee of the small business issuer's board of directors (or persons
performing the equivalent functions);
a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
          or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the small business issuer's
          ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
          information; and
b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
          other employees who have a significant role in the small business
          issuer's internal control over financial reporting.
