ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Azco Mining Inc. (“Azco” or “the Company”) is a U.S. mining company, incorporated in August 1991 in
the  state  of  Delaware,  with  a  general  business  strategy  to  acquire  and  develop  mining  properties
amenable  to  low  cost  production.    Azco  is  currently  focused  on  financing  efforts  to:  (1)  fund  the  re-
opening and enhancement of its Black Canyon mica project located in Arizona and (2) acquire high
quality gold, silver and/or copper properties.  Information about Azco, including a posting of the most
recent financial reports, can be viewed on the Company’s web site, www.azco.com.
In November 2002, the Company suspended crushing and concentrating activities at its Black Canyon
mine  due  to  economic  constraints.    Limited  production,  marketing  and  sales  have  continued  at  its
Glendale  mica  processing  facility  using  inventoried  mica,  while  the  Company  seeks  sources  of
financing for the project.
In April 2003, the Company sold its 30% share of Cobre del Mayo S.A. de D.V. (“Cobre del Mayo”), the
Mexican corporation that holds the Piedras Verdes copper project, to Frontera Cobre del Mayo S.A. de
D.V.  (“Frontera”),  for  consideration  of  $250,000.    In  addition,  the  Company  was  to  receive  an  initial
deferred payment of $250,000, upon the date of construction commencement of the Piedras Verdes
copper project, if the COMEX price of copper is less than $1.00 per pound or $500,000 if the COMEX
price is greater than $1.00 per pound.  Upon the date of commercial production, the Company was to
2
receive  an  additional  payment  of  $500,000,  if  the  COMEX  price  is  less  than  $1.00  per  pound  or
$1,000,000 if the COMEX price is greater than $1.00 per pound.  Frontera also agreed to pay Azco a
royalty  of  $0.02  per  pound  of  copper  produced  and  sold  from  Piedras  Verdes  during  any  calendar
quarter the average COMEX price is equal to or greater than $1.20 per pound, until such time as the
initial  deferred  payment,  the  subsequent  deferred  payment  and  the  royalty  aggregate  in  total
$4,750,000.  In June 2003, the Company subsequently assigned all payment and royalties, defined
under the terms of the sale of its interest in Cobre del Mayo, to Mr. Alan Lindsay (“Mr. Lindsay”) and Mr.
Anthony  Harvey  (“Mr.  Harvey”),  former  officers  and  directors  of  the  Company,  under  the  terms  of  a
settlement agreement.
Prior to the sale of its copper assets, Azco was dedicated to the exploration and development of copper
projects  utilizing  the  solvent  extraction-electrowinning  (“SX-EW”)  process.    Azco’s  principal  mineral
property  was  the  Sanchez  copper  project  located  northeast  of  Safford,  Arizona.    Azco  also  owned
interests in two other copper properties, the Piedras Verdes and Suaqui Verde properties located in
Sonora  State,  Mexico.    In  1995,  with  the  approval  of  shareholders,  Azco  sold  the  Sanchez  copper
property and 70% of the Piedras Verdes property to Phelps Dodge Corporation for gross consideration
of $40 million.
In March 1999, Azco completed the acquisition of Arizona Mica Properties, Inc. (“Arizona Mica”), an
Arizona corporation, which owned the rights to develop 43 unpatented lode-mining claims located in
Yavapai  County,  Arizona.    Azco  obtains  its  mica  from  these  mining  claims.    The  Arizona  Mica
acquisition was accomplished through the merger of Arizona Mica with and into Azco’s wholly owned
subsidiary,  Sanchez  Mining  Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation,  with  Sanchez  being  the  surviving
corporation.    Sanchez  subsequently  changed  its  name  to  Azco  Mica,  Inc.    In  connection  with  the
merger, Azco issued an aggregate of 4,500,000 shares of its common stock in equal amounts to each
of the three shareholders of Arizona Mica: Lawrence G. Olson, John O. Rud and Floyd R. Bleak.
A predecessor of Azco was incorporated in July 1988 under the laws of Colorado to acquire the mining
rights  to  the  Sanchez  Project,  as  well  as  certain  other  mineral  properties.    In  August  1991  the
predecessor  was  merged  into  Azco,  a  newly  incorporated  Delaware  corporation.    In  October  1991,
Azco acquired all of the shares of Filton Enterprises Limited, a Gibraltar corporation, in return for the
issuance of 3,650,000 Azco common shares.  At that time, Filton owned rights in two copper properties
both located in Sonora State, Mexico, the Piedras Verdes and Suaque Verde properties.  Filton was
dissolved in 1994 and its assets were distributed to Azco.
In July 1992, Azco merged with Azco Mining Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“Azco Wyoming”), with Azco
being  the  survivor  of  the  merger.    At  the  time  of  the  completion  of  the  merger,  Azco  Wyoming  had
3,946,550  shares  issued  and  outstanding  and  Azco  had  12,633,822  common  shares  issued  and
outstanding.  In connection with the merger, one common share of Azco was issued in exchange for
each Azco Wyoming share.  Azco Wyoming was formerly a British Columbia corporation incorporated
in August 1981 under the laws of the Province of British Columbia under the name 241145 B.C. Ltd.
  241145  B.C.  Ltd.  changed  its  name  to  Canarex  Resources  Inc.  in  June  1983,  then  to  International
Baron  Resources  Ltd.  in  January  1988,  and  finally  to  Azco  Mining  Inc.  in  February  1992.    Azco
Wyoming was continued under the laws of Wyoming in May 1992 prior to merging with Azco.
Recent Developments
Since June 30, 2004 and through the date of this filing, Azco has remained minimally active while it
continues to seek sources of new financing.  The Black Canyon mica mine has not operated since
operations  were  suspended  in  November  2002.    The  Glendale  processing  facility  has  continued  to
operate on an intermittent basis in fiscals 2003 and 2004, as required to fill purchase orders, using mica
from inventory.  The Company has continued, on a limited basis, to sell mica to key customers in the
plastics and cosmetic industries, and during fiscal 2004 generated $167,863 in revenues.  In addition,
the Company financed its activities by selling $367,000 and $256,000 of common stock in fiscal years
2004 and 2005 respectively, and $885,491 of common stock in fiscal 2006 through December 20, 2005
In fiscal 2003, Azco raised approximately $1,000,000 through the sale of securities to Cornell Capital
Partners (“Cornell”) under an equity line of credit agreement and a securities purchase agreement.
3
The  Company  entered  into  these  two  agreements  with  Cornell  in  June  2002  and  September  2002
respectively.  The Company issued the maximum of 6,000,000 shares allowed under the terms of the
agreements.
In July 2002, in conjunction with the October 2000 departure of two former executives, Mr. Lindsay and
Mr. Harvey, Azco entered into a settlement agreement with these two former directors whereby Azco
was  required  to  make  monthly  payments  of  $10,000  to  each  director  through  June  2004,  with  a
remaining balance of $90,000 due in July 2004.  The Company paid $184,906 through March 31, 2003.
 Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Azco agreed also to provide Lindsay and Harvey with
150,000 shares each of unrestricted common stock in Azco Mining Inc.  The shares were issued in July
2002.
In  April  2003,  due  to  the  Company’s  default  status  under  the  settlement  agreement,  Lindsay  and
Harvey filed for and were granted a writ of garnishment against the Company, whereby the court seized
$85,908  of  the  Company’s  funds.    In  June  2003,  the  Company  entered  into  a  second  settlement
agreement with the former directors, which released the Company from the first settlement agreement in
return for cash payments totaling $102,257, the issuance of 600,000 shares of the Company’s common
stock to each of the former executives and the assignment of all of the Company’s future rights under
the terms of the sale of its interest in Cobre del Mayo.
In April 2003, the Company sold its 30% share of Cobre del Mayo S.A. de D.V. (“Cobre del Mayo”), the
Mexican corporation that holds the Piedras Verdes copper project, to Frontera Cobre del Mayo S.A. de
D.V.  (“Frontera”),  for  consideration  of  $250,000.    In  addition,  the  Company  was  to  receive  an  initial
deferred payment of $250,000, upon the date of construction commencement of the Piedras Verdes
copper project, if the COMEX price of copper is less than $1.00 per pound or $500,000 if the COMEX
price is greater than $1.00 per pound.  Upon the date of commercial production, the Company was to
receive  an  additional  payment  of  $500,000,  if  the  COMEX  price  is  less  than  $1.00  per  pound  or
$1,000,000 if the COMEX price is greater than $1.00 per pound.  Frontera also agreed to pay Azco a
royalty  of  $0.02  per  pound  of  copper  produced  and  sold  from  Piedras  Verdes  during  any  calendar
quarter the average COMEX price is equal to or greater than $1.20 per pound, until such time as the
initial  deferred  payment,  the  subsequent  deferred  payment  and  the  royalty  aggregate  in  total
$4,750,000.  In June 2003, the Company subsequently assigned all payment and royalties, defined
under the terms of the sale of its interest in Cobre del Mayo, to Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Harvey, former
officers and directors of the Company, under the terms of a settlement agreement.
Azco  incurred  no  exploration  expenses  during  fiscals  2004  and  2003  in  connection  with  Cobre  del
Mayo. Prior to the sale of its interest in Cobre del Mayo, the Company elected to dilute its interest in the
project, as was permitted by the terms of the Cobre del Mayo shareholders’ agreement.
4
The Company incurred no exploration expense during fiscal 2004 in connection with its lease of the
mineral property owned by New Planet Copper Mining Company in La Paz County, Arizona.  In August
2003, the Company sold its interest in this property subject to an option to reacquire a 25% interest at
the time of any future commercial development. In September 2005, the Company reacquired the lease
of the mineral property owned by New Planet Copper Mining Company.
Products
Azco produced and sold mica-filled plastic pellets to the manufacturers of reinforced plastics in the first
quarter  of  fiscal  2004.    Currently  the  Company  is  unable  to  produce  plastic  pellets  due  to  a  lack  of
working capital but has continued to sell, to a key customer, the mica needed to produce the pellets.
 Azco also has continued to sell cosmetic grade mica on a limited basis.  The Company has limited
quantities of inventoried mica available for its key mica customers, while it seeks financing to resume
production.
Azco produced and sold no feldspathic sand, a by-product of mica production, during fiscal 2004. In
the first half of fiscal 2003, Azco sold feldspathic sand as golf course bunker sand and as stucco sand.
  Sand  sales  ceased  due  to  the  suspension  of  crushing  and  concentrating  operations  at  the  Black
Canyon mine in November 2002.
Marketing
Marketing  efforts  have  been  placed  on  hold  pending  the  resumption  of  production.    The  Company
maintains contact with current and past customers.
Customers
Azco  sells  its  cosmetic  grade  mica  to  Presperse,  Inc.  and  to  KOBO,  who  distribute  the  product  to
cosmetic manufacturers.  The Company sells its mica-filled plastic pellets and mica powder to a major
plastic consumer in Canada.  Azco sold no feldspathic sand products in fiscal 2004.
Competition
Many companies are engaged in the exploration and development of mineral properties.  Azco is at a
disadvantage  with  respect  to  those  competitors  whose  technical  and  financial  resources  exceed
Azco’s.
Azco’s  main  competitors  include  Olglebay  Norton  Specialty  Minerals,  Engelhard  Corp.  and  Georgia
Industrial Minerals, who are significant producers of wet ground mica; and Oglebay Norton and J. R.
Simplot, who are important suppliers of manufactured sand to the Phoenix, Arizona area.
Research And Development
Azco  has  retained  Transmit  Technology  Group,  LLC,  of  Arlington,  Texas,  in  the  past,  to  provide
research and development support for its mica-filled plastic products.  Azco’s mica has been evaluated
and  tested  by  several  potential  customers  in  the  cosmetics  and  plastics  industries.    The  Company
intends,  if  and  when  financing  for  the  mica  project  can  be  arranged,  to  continue  its  research  and
development efforts.  Currently the Company is conducting no research and development.
Employees And Consultants
As of June 30, 2004, we had one full-time employee and two part-time consultants.  Our employees are
not covered by labor union contracts or collective bargaining agreements.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
Black Canyon Mica Project
Background
In  1999  Azco  acquired  the  Black  Canyon  mica  project  from  Arizona  Mica  Properties,  Inc.,  a  private
Arizona  corporation.    The  project  included  43  unpatented  mining  claims  at  Black  Canyon,  30  miles
north of Phoenix, Arizona, and a pilot plant situated in Glendale, Arizona.  As part of its due diligence
process, the Company carried out a marketing study, performed metallurgical testing and confirmatory
diamond drilling, and conducted an environmental audit and title work.
Azco also conducted a geologic mapping program that recorded the many pegmatite dikes that host the
ore bodies.  This work identified mica deposits lying outside the area of the original 43 mining claims,
and  additional  claims  were  acquired.    Azco  currently  controls  67  unpatented  mining  claims  and  9
millsite claims covering approximately 1,385 acres.
During  1999-2001,  Azco  began  construction  of  the  Glendale  processing  plant,  obtained  operating
permits from the Bureau of Land Management and the State of Arizona and carried out an initial mining
campaign.
In  2002,  the  Company  commissioned  the  processing  facilities  at  the  mine  site  and  in  Glendale,
operated for several months on a test basis and achieved limited production and commercial sales.
 Operations at the mine site were suspended in November 2002.
The ultimate design capacity of the operation was set by reference to market share goals.  Capacity
was set as 10,000 tons (20 million pounds) per year of finished mica product, which is calculated also
to yield 180,000 tons per year of by-product feldspathic sand.  The installed capacities at the mine site
and at the Glendale processing plant are capable of operating but at a throughput rate less than full
planned  capacity.    In  order  to  achieve  full  design  capacity,  the  installation  of  additional  processing
equipment is required, and will depend on the Company’s receipt of adequate financing.
Azco  is  seeking  new  funding  in  the  amount  of  $4.0  million  to  upgrade  and  expand  the  mining  and
processing  facilities  in  order  to  reach  planned  capacity  and  to  provide  working  capital.    These
expansions are required in order to achieve the higher throughputs necessary for sustained economic
operation.
The Company’s total expenditures on the Black Canyon project have exceeded $10 million.
Location and Access
The Black Canyon mine is located about 30 miles north of Phoenix, Arizona, 3.5 miles west-southwest
of Black Canyon City.  It can be reached via U.S. Interstate 17, which connects Phoenix with Flagstaff,
and by a connecting dirt road for the last eight miles.
The Glendale processing plant is located in an industrial area on the west side of Phoenix, Arizona, 47
miles to the south of the mine site.
6
Mineral Title
Azco’s property holdings at and around the Black Canyon mine consist of 67 Federal unpatented
mining claims in Yavapai County, Arizona and 9 Federal millsite claims in Maricopa County, Arizona,
which in total cover approximately 1,385 acres.  The claims are located on public land and held
pursuant to the General Mining Law of 1872.  The mining rights are fully owned by the Company.  The
claims are in good standing in accordance with the mining laws of the United States.
Additional details of Azco’s claims are as follows:  In Yavapai County, the claims are Spencer Nos. 1-
43, 77, 79, 122-127, 146-153, 155, 157, 184, and 186-190, located in Sections 12, 13, 14, 23 and 24,
Township 8N Range 1E and Sections 6, 7 and 8, T8N R2E, and recorded by the Bureau of Land
Management on 2/25/1999 and by Yavapai County on 2/26/1999.  In Maricopa County, the claims are
Mica Millsite Nos. 12, 14, 16, and 19-24, located in Sections 27 and 28, T8N R2E, and recorded by the
Bureau of Land Management on 9/17/1999 and by Maricopa County on 9/20/1999.
In order to maintain its claims in good standing, Azco must pay annual assessment fees to the Bureau
of Land Management and record the payment of rental fees with Yavapai and Maricopa Counties.
 Annual assessment and recording costs total approximately $10,000.  The Company has paid the
required fees for the 2005 and 2006 assessment years (September 1, 2004 through August 31, 2006).
Mining and Processing Facilities
7
The Black Canyon project consists of two integrated operating facilities.  The mine site west-southwest
of Black Canyon City contains the ore reserves where the Company proposes to conduct open pit
mining operations.  The crusher, the concentrator and the feldspathic sand plant are located at the mine
site.  These facilities depend on diesel generators for power.  Plans call for mining to be carried out by
conventional open pit methods.  The ore is trucked from the pit and delivered to a nearby stockpile
located adjacent to the crusher and concentrator.  Mica flakes are separated from the pegmatite host
rock in a process that involves multi-stage crushing and screening to -3/16” size.  Mica is concentrated
from the crushed material utilizing air classifiers.  The resulting concentrate, containing 95% mica, is
trucked to the Glendale processing plant for further processing.
In the mica concentrating process at the mine site, the majority of the crushed host rock, which
otherwise would be discarded as waste, is converted into feldspathic sand for sale into the local
market.  Processing of the feldspathic sand involves screening and magnetic separation to yield sand
fractions of various sizes.  The sand products are either bagged for shipment or trucked in bulk to
customers.
The mica concentrate is further processed at the 5-acre Glendale plant and office site on the west side
of Phoenix.  The processing is designed to achieve the desired product sizes and meet the quality
requirements of the market place.  The plant is housed in an 18,000 square foot steel framed building,
where equipment is installed for wet grinding, dewatering, drying, and air classification and bagging.
 The final products are placed into 50-pound bags or into 1000-pound supersacks ready for shipment to
customers.
Operations at the mine site were suspended in November 2002.
Azco is seeking new funding in the amount of $4.0 million to upgrade and expand the mining and
processing facilities in order to reach planned capacity and to provide working capital.  These
expansions are required in order to achieve the higher throughputs necessary for sustained economic
operation.
Permits
In 1999, Azco obtained approval for the Black Canyon Plan of Operations from the Bureau of Land
Management and the State of Arizona.  An Environmental Assessment, Clean Water Act Permit and Air
Quality  Procedures  were  all  approved.    An  Aquifer  Protection  Permit  was  not  required  because
processing operations at the mine site did not propose the use of water.
Geology and Mineralization
The mica deposits occur as pegmatite dikes cutting Precambrian schist and granite.  These dikes are
steeply dipping tabular bodies, continuous along strike and with depth.  The main pegmatite dikes are
hosted  by  the  schist  and  have  a  northeasterly  trend  parallel  to  the  structural  grain  of  the  schist.
  Because  the  light  colored  pegmatite  dikes  are  more  resistant  to  weathering  than  is  the  enclosing
schist, the dikes stand out at the surface as elongated light colored ridges relatively easy to discern and
to map geologically.
In the area of the drilled ore reserves, a concentration of pegmatite occurs as a dike swarm and as
massive irregular bodies of pegmatite.  An associated major structure, the Central Pit fault, appears to
have created a zone of dilation that provided open space for intrusion of the pegmatite.  Drilling has
identified seven individual dikes that range from approximately 4 feet to over 20 feet in thickness.  At
the surface, massive pegmatite crops out over a width exceeding 50 feet.
The minerals of potential economic value are all found associated with the pegmatite dikes, and consist
of muscovite mica, feldspar and silica.  Muscovite mica, the principal commodity, constitutes a major
accessory mineral of the pegmatite dikes and is ubiquitous in the pegmatite.  Based on visual estimates
of drill core, the content of muscovite in the pegmatite ranges from 5% to 35%.  The muscovite is light to
whitish  green  in  color  and  occurs  as  discrete,  coarse-grained  inclusions  as  well  as  fine-grained
disseminations in the pegmatite.  Feldspar and silica, by-products of the proposed mining operation,
make up most of the remaining component minerals of the pegmatite on about a 1:1 ratio.
8
Ore Reserves
In 1998 and 1999, based on geologic mapping, Azco drilled 41 inclined core holes and collected 59
samples of pegmatite exposed on the surface, at two central locations.  The drill holes and surface
samples were spaced approximately 50 feet apart.  The holes ranged from 200 to 600 feet in length,
and drilling totaled 13,070 feet.  The drilling covered only a small portion of the zones of outcropping
mica-bearing rocks mapped on the Company’s mining claims.
Mintec Inc., an independent geological engineering firm, analyzed Azco’s drilling and sampling results,
designed the mining plan and calculated the ore reserves.  In-place mining reserves for the pit design
were calculated as 2,399,500 tons of proven ore grading 7.54% mica and 1,527,200 tons of probable
ore  grading  7.37%  mica,  for  total  reserves  of  3,926,680  tons  of  ore  grading  7.48%  mica,  at  a  cutoff
grade of 2.47% mica.  Approximately 60% of the mica contained in these reserves is expected to be
recoverable after losses due to mining and beneficiation
Mica
Azco’s mineral reserves contain high quality muscovite or “white mica”.  Mica is a mineral characterized
by crystals that can be easily split into thin elastic sheets and is valued for its unique combination of
chemical, physical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties.  Muscovite exhibits perfect cleavage,
flexibility and elasticity, infusibility, low thermal and electrical conductivity, high dielectric strength, light
weight,  good  insulating  characteristics,  and  is  stable  when  exposed  to  moisture,  light  and  high
temperatures.  Because of these properties, muscovite has found widespread application in plastics,
automotive coatings, cosmetics, paints, catalysis and composite formulations.
Azco plans, once adequate financing is obtained, to produce 10,000 tons (20 million pounds) annually
of premium wet-ground mica and intends to penetrate existing markets and to establish its own markets
in plastics, cosmetics and ultra-micronized applications.
In fiscal 2004 Azco sold a portion of the mica it produced and retained a portion in inventory.  The
Company  sold  mica  products  to  customers  in  the  plastics  and  cosmetics  industries  and  for  other
specialized applications.   Sales to key customers are continuing on a limited basis.  In addition, other
potential consumers have conducted trial tests of the Company’s mica products.
Feldspathic Sand
Azco’s feldspathic sand is produced as a by-product of mica concentration and is screened and sized
for sale into the Phoenix construction and recreational markets.  Products include golf course bunker
sand and sand used in stucco, mortar and other specialized construction applications.  The Company
plans,  once  suitable  financing  is  obtained,  to  produce  180,000  tons  of  feldspathic  sand  products
annually.
Currently  sand  producers  in  California  and  Nevada  supply  sand  to  the  Phoenix  manufactured  sand
market. Because the material has to be trucked long distances in order to reach Phoenix, trucking costs
are significant and constitute a substantial proportion of the final selling price.  The location of Azco’s
Black  Canyon  mine  only  30  miles  from  Phoenix  provides  the  Company  with  a  transportation  cost
advantage over competitors who import sand into Arizona.
In fiscal 2004 Azco sold no feldspathic sand products.  In 2003 the Company sold its entire inventory of
feldspathic sand to customers in the Phoenix area.
Impairment Charge and Carrying Value of Assets
In  fiscal  2003,  management  determined  that  an  impairment  charge  of  $3,291,773  was  necessary  to
more  accurately  reflect  the  carrying  value  of  its  mineral  properties,  plant  and  equipment.    The
impairment charge was reflected in the Company’s financial statements for the period ended June 30,
2003.
9
Subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2004, the Company obtained an independent appraisal of the
equipment at the Black Canyon mine and at the Glendale processing plant. The appraisal indicated a
net realizable value of approximately $1,701,000. Accordingly, the company recognized an increase to
the reserve for impairment of $4,824,446.
As of June 30, 2004, Azco carried its long-lived assets at the following values:
Land and buildings, net
Idle equipment, net
Total
$     480,552
1,701,000
$  2,181,552
Risk Factors
Mica Reserve Estimations
Although  independent  consultants  have  reviewed  and  concurred  with  the  estimations  of  reserves
presented  in  this  annual  financial  report,  such  estimations  are  necessarily  imprecise  because  they
depend upon the judgment of the individuals who review the geological and engineering information
and  upon  statistical  inferences  drawn  from  only  limited  drilling  and  sampling.    If  the  Black  Canyon
mining  operation  encounters  mineralization  or  geologic  conditions  different  from  those  predicted,
reserve  estimations  might  have  to  be  adjusted  and  mining  plans  altered.    Changes  to  the  planned
operations could adversely affect forecast costs and profitability.
Development and Completion
The  development  of  mineral  deposits  involves  significant  risks  that  even  the  best  evaluation,
experience and knowledge cannot eliminate.  The economic feasibility of the Company’s mining claims
is based upon a number of factors, including reserve estimations, extraction and process recoveries,
engineering, capital and operating costs, future production from the Black Canyon mine and Glendale
processing plant, and future prices of mica and feldspathic sand.
The Black Canyon mica project has no significant operating history upon which to base estimates of
operating costs and capital requirements.  As a result, estimations of resources, mining and process
recoveries and operating costs have been based to a large extent upon the interpretation of geologic
data obtained from drill holes, and upon feasibility estimates that derive forecasts of operating costs
from anticipated tonnages and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore
body, expected recovery rates of minerals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, and
climatic conditions and other factors.  Commonly in new projects, actual construction costs, operating
costs and economic returns differ materially from those initially estimated.  Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the Black Canyon mine can be upgraded or the Glendale processing plant expanded
within the time frame or at the cost anticipated by the Company, or that the forecasted operating results
can  be  achieved.    These  risks  have  been  mitigated  in  that  although  Azco  proposes  to  upgrade  or
expand both of these facilities, in fact both already have been partially completed and have achieved
limited production of marketable products.
Operating
Mining operations generally involve a high degree of risk.  The Company’s operations are subject to all
the hazards and risks normally encountered in the development of open pit mining operations, and in
particular,  production  of  mica  and  feldspathic  sand.    These  risks  include  unexpected  geologic
formations and conditions, rock bursts, cave-ins, flooding and other conditions involved in the open pit
mining  of  material,  any  of  which  could  result  in  damage  to,  or  destruction  of,  producing  facilities,
damage to life or property, environmental damage and possible legal liability.
The Company’s management has taken certain precautions to mitigate these risks.  However, in spite
of these precautions, circumstances could arise that result in a significant increase in operating costs
10
or cause the Company to incur potential liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on its
financial position.
Price
According to USGS information, mica prices recuperated in the past three years after declining over the
prior four years during a period of relatively flat US production.  Irrespective of the apparent recovery in
prices, the outlook for future mica prices is unclear.  Feldspathic sand prices and demand have been on
the  rise  over  the  same  period.    The  robust  housing,  construction,  and  recreational  markets  in  the
Southwest  have  driven  demand  for  sand  products,  and  there  are  indications  that  this  trend  will
continue.    However,  there  are  numerous  factors  beyond  the  Company’s  control  that  could  affect
markets for both mica and feldspathic sand.  No assurance can be given as to future prices or demand
for  Azco’s  products.    Any  decline  in  prices  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company’s
financial position.
Market
Azco’s dual products are mica that it plans to sell nationally into the cosmetics and plastics markets,
and feldspathic sand that it plans to sell locally into the Phoenix, Arizona construction and recreational
markets.    Although  the  Company  anticipates  being  able  to  produce  and  sell  premium  products  into
these markets, it has not yet sold significant quantities of its products and has not entered into sales
contracts.  The profitability of Azco’s operations could be adversely affected if it does not achieve the
selling  prices  or  sales  volumes  currently  targeted  for  its  products.    The  markets  are  affected  by
numerous  factors  beyond  the  Company’s  control.    For  example,  it  is  possible  that  new  sources  of
supply  from  other  domestic  plants  or  imports  could  create  an  imbalance  in  the  markets,  depressing
prices and causing a decrease in demand for the Company’s products.  Another possibility is that the
major mica and feldspathic sand producers could engage in a defensive “price war” against Azco as a
means  of  protecting  their  respective  market  shares.    Any  such  factors  could  adversely  impact  the
Company’s ability to sell its products, the prices it receives for its products and its profitability.
Title
Azco’s property holdings at and around the Black Canyon mine consist of unpatented mining claims
located  on  public  land  and  held  pursuant  to  the  General  Mining  Law  of  1872.    The  validity  of  such
unpatented mining claims may be subject to title defects and may be contested.  Although there can be
no assurance that titles are not defective, the Company has obtained various reports and opinions with
respect to its mining claims and believes its claims are in good standing and held according to industry
practice.
In recent years the United States Congress has considered amendments to the General Mining Law of
1872, some of which would lower the value of unpatented mining claims by restricting activities and
imposing additional user fees or production royalties.  If enacted, these legislative changes could have
an adverse impact on the operation of the Black Canyon mine.
Environmental
Mining is subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment that may
result  from  mineral  exploration  and  production.    Although  Azco’s  initial  mining  and  processing
operation  has  been  approved  and  permitted  by  regulatory  authorities,  the  Company  could  incur
unexpected environmental liability resulting from its mining activity at Black Canyon, or even stemming
from previous activity conducted by others prior to Azco’s ownership.  Insurance against environmental
mining  risks  (including  liability  for  the  disposal  of  waste  products)  generally  is  not  available  at  a
reasonable  price  and  currently  the  Company  does  not  have  and  does  not  intend  to  purchase  such
insurance.  Should Azco be unable to fund a required environmental remedy, the Company might be
forced  to  suspend  operations  or  enter  into  interim  compliance  measures  pending  completion  of  the
remedy.
Laws  and  regulations  involving  the  protection  and  remediation  of  the  environment  are  constantly
changing and generally are becoming more restrictive.  The Company has made, and expects to make
in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations.  Although Azco has
obtained the permits required to commence operations at Black Canyon and has conducted mining and
processing
11
activities under those permits, there can be no assurance that in the future the Company’s operations
will not be subject to more stringent regulations or to unfavorable interpretations of present regulations.
  It  is  possible  that  costs  and  delays  in  complying  with  such  regulations  could  adversely  affect  the
Company’s mining plan or any potential expansion of that plan.  This risk is mitigated at Black Canyon
in  that  no  water  or  chemicals  are  released  into  the  environment  during  the  mining  and  recovery
process.
Mining Legislation and Regulation
Azco is subject to extensive United States federal, state and local laws and regulations related to mine
prospecting,  development,  transportation,  production,  exports,  taxes,  labor  standards,  occupational
health  and  safety,  waste  disposal,  protection  and  remediation  of  the  environment,  mine  safety,
hazardous materials, toxic substances and other matters.  The Company believes that it has complied
with  all  laws  and  regulations  required  for  its  initial  mining  operations.    However,  new  laws  and
regulations  or  more  stringent  enforcement  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company,
causing a delay or reduction in production, increasing costs and preventing an expansion of mining
activities.
Financing Risk
The  Company  has  no  significant  operating  history  nor  generated  any  cash  flow.    To  satisfy  capital
requirements it has relied on the issuance of equity securities, loans from shareholders and sales of
assets.    Azco  believes  that  the  $4.0  million  of  new  financing  it  seeks  would  provide  capital  in  an
amount sufficient for it to upgrade, expand and operate the Black Canyon mica project and to achieve
positive cash flow.  However, there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in arranging
the required financing.
Piedras Verdes Copper Project
Azco owned 30% of the Piedras Verdes copper project after selling 70% of the project to the Phelps
Dodge Corporation in December 1995.  In March 2002, Frontera, a Delaware corporation, purchased
Phelps Dodge’s 70% interest in the project.
In  April  2003,  the  Company  sold  its  remaining  30%  interest  in  Piedres  Verdes  to  Frontera  for
consideration of $250,000.  In addition, Azco was to receive two future contingent payments, to be paid
at the times the Piedras Verdes project commences construction and attains commercial production,
the amounts of the payments depending on the price of copper at those times.
Frontera also agreed to pay Azco a royalty of  $0.02 per pound of copper produced and sold from the
project in any calendar quarter during which the average COMEX price of copper is equal to or greater
than $1.20 per pound, until such time as the aggregate of the contingent payments and the royalty totals
$4,750,000.
In June 2003, the Company assigned all deferred payments and royalties, defined under the terms of
the sale agreement, to Lindsay and Harvey, former officers and directors of the Company, under the
terms of a settlement agreement.
New Planet Property
In  September  2000,  Azco  entered  into  a  lease  and  purchase  option  agreement  with  New  Planet
Copper Mining Company on 31 patented mining claims located in La Paz County, Arizona.  On August
12, 2003 the Company assigned, for the sum of $5,000, its right, title and interest in and to its lease with
New  Planet  Copper  Mining  Company  to  Metallica  Ventures  LLC,  a  corporation  controlled  by  the
Company’s  current  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer.    The  Company  retained  an  option  to
purchase 25% of the New Planet lease for an amount equal to 25% of the expenditures on the property
from the date of assignment through the date of the exercise of the option.
12
On  September  22,  2005,  Metallica  Ventures  LLC  reassigned  to  the  Company,  for  consideration  of
$10,000 and the issue of 2,000,000 unregistered shares of the Company’s common stock, its right, title
and interest in and to the lease with New Planet Copper Mining Company.
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In  July  2002,  Azco  entered  into  a  settlement  agreement  regarding  fees  payable  under  terminated
management  agreements  with  two  of  its  former  officers  and  directors,  Lindsay  and  Harvey.    Azco
agreed to pay each former director the sum of $350,000.  The sum was to be paid in an initial amount of
$20,000 each, due upon the signing of the agreement, and in monthly amounts of $10,000 thereafter,
with the entire balance due within 24 months of the date of the agreement.  In addition, Azco agreed to
pay $24,898 representing one half of the legal fees incurred by the former directors.  The Company
paid $184,906 through March 31, 2003.  Azco also issued Lindsay and Harvey each 150,000 shares of
unrestricted common stock under the terms of the settlement agreement.
In  April  2003,  due  to  the  Company’s  default  status  under  the  settlement  agreement,  Lindsay  and
Harvey filed for and were granted a writ of garnishment against the Company, whereby the court seized
$85,908  of  the  Company’s  funds.    In  June  2003,  the  Company  entered  into  a  second  settlement
agreement with the former directors whereby the Company was fully released under the terms of the
first  settlement  agreement  in  return  for  cash  payments  totaling  $102,257,  the  issuance  of  600,000
shares of the Company’s common stock to each of the former executives and the assignment of all of
the  Company’s  future  rights  under  the  sale  of  its  interest  in  Cobre  del  Mayo.    The  cash  payments
consisted  of  $95,000  to  the  former  executives  plus  $7,257  for  the  reimbursement  of  legal  and  court
costs.  In August 2003, the stock was issued under the terms of the second settlement agreement.  A
restrictive legend was attached to the stock and its sale is reliant upon an exemption from Rule 144 of
the Securities Act of 1934 (“Securities Act”).
The Company’s rights under the agreement with Frontera that were assigned to the former executives
include contingent future payments and production royalties totaling in aggregate $4,750,000.
In June 2002 Azco received a demand for arbitration filed by iCapital Corporation (“iCapital”) seeking
$144,000  in  relief  due  to  failure  to  pay  under  a  June  2001  financial  consulting  agreement.    On
September 18, 2003 the American Arbitration Association awarded iCapital $144,000 plus $5,000 in
attorney’s fees as full settlement of the claim.  Under the terms of the award the Company had 30 days
to remit the amount of the award, after which interest accrues at 5% per annum.  On November 15,
2004, the Company agreed with iCapital to settle the approximately $150,000 amount owed, by the
issue of 500,000 unregistered shares of its common stock to be held by the Company and released to
iCapital  in  six  $25,000  increments  over  a  period  of  six  months  beginning  December  1,  2005,  the
number  of  shares  to  be  released  monthly  to  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  market  price  of  the
Company’s stock at the time released.
In  January  1999  the  trustee  in  bankruptcy  proceedings  against  Eagle  River  International  Limited,
Azco’s  former  partner  in  the  WAG  -  Mali  joint  venture,  served  a  petition  upon  Azco  in  the  Quebec
Superior Court, District of Hull, in order to recuperate from the Company certain subsidiary stock and
other assets alleged to have a value of up to $4,300,000.  Azco considers the trustee’s claims to be
without merit and has engaged counsel who is vigorously disputing the matter.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND SBI
PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES
During  fiscal  2003  the  Company’s  common  stock  was  traded  on  the  American  Stock  Exchange
(“AMEX”) in the United States and on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) in Canada.  In June 2003
the
13
Company  voluntarily  requested  its  common  stock  be  delisted  from  the  AMEX.    In  July  2003  the
Company’s shares began trading on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”).
The Company was delinquent in the filing of its financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2003
with the Security and Exchange Commission in the United States and with the Securities Commissions
of Ontario and British Columbia.  Consequently cease trade orders were issued in November 2003 for
trading of the Company’s common stock on the TSX and in January 2004 for trading on the OTCBB.
 Subsequently the Company has traded over-the-counter on the “Pink Sheets”.  The Company plans to
become  compliant  in  the  filing  of  its  annual  and  quarterly  financial  statements  and  immediately
thereupon to apply for resumption of trading on the OTCBB.
In  May  2004  the  Company  received  notice  that  the  TSX  was  reviewing  the  eligibility  for  continued
listing  on  TSX  of  the  common  shares  of  the  Company  pursuant  to  Part  VII  of  The  Toronto  Stock
Exchange  Company  Manual.    The  Company  fell  below  several  requirements  for  continued  listing,
primarily related to its financial condition and operating results.  In September 2004, the Company’s
shares were suspended from trading on the TSX.  Subsequently, the Company delisted voluntarily from
the TSX.
As of December 20, 2005, there were 63,111,700 common shares outstanding.

officers and directors agreed to accept 2,000,000 and 1,500,000 shares respectively of the Company's
unregistered  common  stock  as  payment  of  accrued  interest  on  notes  payable  and  accrued  salary
valued on each date at $200,000 in the aggregate.
On September 22, 2005, the Company agreed to issue 2,000,000 shares of unregistered common stock
to an officer in connection with reacquisition of a mineral lease.
Subsequent to June 30, 2004, the Company entered into consulting agreements with nine entities that
provide for the issue in the aggregate of 3,555,000 shares of unregistered common stock for services.
Subsequent  to  June  30,  2004,  the  Company  entered  into  debt  conversion  agreements  with  three
entities that provide for the issue in the aggregate of 750,000 shares of unregistered common stock as
payment  for  approximately  $150,000  owed  pursuant  to  an  arbitration  award  and  for  approximately
$80,000 owed for services rendered.
In November 2003, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of unregistered common stock for services
rendered.
In  August  2003,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  a  third  party  ("Finder")  whereby  the
Company will pay a finder's fee for the introduction to the Company of accredited investors with whom
the  Finder  has  a  pre-existing  substantive  relationship  and  who  subscribe  to  private  placement
purchases  of  the  Company's  common  stock.    The  fee  is  one  share  of  common  stock  for  every  five
shares  of  common  stock  investors  introduced  to  the  Company  by  the  Finder,  purchase  from  the
Company.  In fiscal 2005, 312,000 shares were issued to the Finder under the agreement.  In fiscal
2004, 686,000 shares were issued to the Finder under the agreement and for other services performed.
In June 2003, Azco entered into a second settlement agreement with Lindsay and Harvey (see below),
due to the Company’s default under certain of its obligations under the initial settlement agreement.
Under the second settlement agreement, among other terms, the Company agreed to issue 600,000
shares of unregistered common stock to each of the former executives.
In  July  2002,  Azco  entered  into  a  settlement  agreement  regarding  fees  payable  under  terminated
management contracts with two of its former  officers  and  directors,  Lindsay  and  Harvey.    Under  the
terms of the settlement agreement, among other conditions, Azco agreed to issue Lindsay and Harvey
each 150,000 shares of unrestricted common stock.  The shares were issued in July 2002.
15
In  December  2002,  the  Company  issued  10,000  shares  of  unregistered  common  stock  for  legal
services rendered in connection with the issue of stock under the settlement agreement discussed in
the previous paragraph.
In  June  2002  and  September  2002,  Azco  entered  into  an  equity  line  of  credit  agreement  and  a
securities purchase agreement, respectively, with Cornell Capital Partners (“Cornell”).  In fiscal 2003
the  Company  raised  approximately  $1,000,000  by  the  sale  of  securities  to  Cornell  under  these
agreements.  The Company issued the maximum of 6,000,000 shares allowed under the terms of the
agreements.
With respect to the sale of unregistered securities referenced above, all transactions were exempt from
registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”), and Regulation D
promulgated under the 1933 Act.  In each instance, the purchaser had access to sufficient information
regarding  Azco  so  as  to  make  an  informed  investment  decision.    More  specifically,  Azco  had  a
reasonable basis to believe that each purchaser was an “accredited investor” as defined in Regulation
D  of  the  1933  Act  and  otherwise  had  the  requisite  sophistication  to  make  an  investment  in  Azco’s
securities.
ITEM 6.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 reflect under-capitalization of the
Company’s Black Canyon mica project, which project requires additional funding to be able to resume
production and to achieve sustained profitable operation.  Results of operations similar to those in 2004
and  2003  can  be  expected  to  continue  in  the  foreseeable  future,  and  are  not  expected  to  change
significantly until such time as additional capital and/or debt resources are secured and the Company is
able to restructure its debt and lease commitments.  The Company anticipates a need for at least $5.7
million in order to satisfy past commitments, commence mining operations and initiate an exploration
program as discussed in detail under the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report.  If it
fails  to  procure  this  funding,  the  Company  may  be  required  to  eliminate  substantially  all  business
activities and to seek protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.
Results Of Operations
Year Ended June 30, 2004 Compared To Year Ended June 30, 2003
Sales
Sales increased to $167,863 in fiscal 2004 from $55,469 in fiscal 2003 due primarily to increased sales
of mica-filled plastic pellets in fiscal 2004.  The mica sold was sourced from inventory. No revenue was
generated from the sale of feldspathic sand in fiscal 2004, due to the curtailment of operations at the
Company’s crushing and concentrating facilities at the Black Canyon mine in November 2002.  Prior to
the closure of the Black Canyon facilities, the Company generated revenue from the sale of feldspathic
sand, a by-product of the mica concentrator.  The Company continues to process and sell inventoried
mica into the cosmetic and reinforced plastic industries, while it seeks financing to resume production.
If and when financing is procured and production resumes, the Company expects that it will require 12
months or more time in order for it to introduce its mica and feldspathic sand products into the markets
and to build a customer base necessary  for  sustained  sales  and  profitable  operation.    Although  the
Company anticipates being able to sell dual products of mica and feldspathic sand, it has not yet sold
significant quantities of these products and has not entered into sales contracts.  There are numerous
factors beyond the Company’s control that could affect markets for both mica and feldspathic sand.  The
profitability of the Company’s operations could be adversely affected if it does not achieve the selling
prices  or  sales  volumes  currently  targeted  for  its  products.    See  also  “Risk  Factors”  under  the
description of the Black Canyon mica project in this annual financial report.

Expenses
Production costs increased in fiscal 2004 to $318,252 from $36,791 in 2003, an increase of $281,460.
 This increase in fiscal 2004 was due to the cessation of production at the Black Canyon facilities in
November 2002, and continuation of processing operations at the Glendale plant during fiscal 2004.
G&A  and  salaries  combined  decreased  in  fiscal  2004  to  $1,121,287  from  $1,329,372  in  2003,  a
decrease of $208,085. This decrease in fiscal 2004 was due to staff and administrative cutbacks, and
reductions of accounting and legal fees instituted as cost saving measures.
Financing expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 were $32,885 compared to $463,476 in the
previous  year.    The  relatively  high  expenses  in  fiscal  2003  related  to  fees  under  a  2002  financial
agreement, whereby the Company agreed to pay fees in the form of its common stock in the amount of
 $430,000, of which $363,000 was recorded in fiscal 2003.
Settlement  agreement  expenses  of  $257,743  were  recorded  as  recovered  in  fiscal  2003  due  to  the
relinquishment of debt when the Company entered into a second settlement agreement with two former
executives and restructured the terms of the initial settlement agreement.
An impairment charge of $4,287,996 was recorded in fiscal 2003, which reduced the carrying value of
inventory, property, plant and equipment. The amount of impairment was based upon a third party’s
formal indication of willingness to acquire the Company’s mining assets.  It represented management’s
best estimate of the fair value of those assets.
Subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2004, the Company obtained an independent appraisal of the
plant  and  equipment.  The  appraisal  indicated  a  net  realizable  value  of  approximately  $1,701,000.
Accordingly, the company recognized an increase to the reserve for impairment of $4,824,446.  The
Company also recorded an impairment loss on inventory of $965,167, for a total impairment of assets of
$5,789,613.
Other Income and Expenses
Other  income  and  expenses  in  fiscal  2004  were  $(422,405)  as  compared  to  $(139,643)  in  2003.
 Accretion of discounts on notes payable and lease liability decreased in fiscal 2004 to $(278,151) from
$(345,854) in 2003 due to full amortization in 2004 of discounts on notes payable.
Other income of $315,000 in fiscal 2003 consisted of $250,000 received in connection with the sale of
the Company’s interest in the Piedras Verde project and $65,000 for the disposal of mobile equipment.
Liquidity And Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2004, Azco had cash-on-hand of $5,958 as compared to $707 at June 30, 2003.
Azco has continued to seek funding for its mica project. The Company financed these efforts during
fiscal 2004 with the proceeds of the sale of $167,863 of mica-filled plastic pellets and mica powder,
including cosmetic grade mica.  In addition, the Company sold $367,000 of common stock during fiscal
2004 through the offering of stock subscriptions to shareholders and sophisticated investors.
In  an  effort  to  bring  the  mica  project  to  commercial  production,  fund  the  Company’s  corporate
commitments and initiate an exploration program, Azco anticipates the need for at least $5.7 million of
additional financing during the next 36 months, in order to fund the following expected uses:
17
Mica project operating losses
Mica project capital expenditures
Corporate overhead and related
expenses
Exploration program
Total funds needed
$1,200,000
2,800,000  
1,200,000
500,000  
$5,700,000
This  projection  assumes  that  the  Company  will  be  able  to  restructure  its  current  debt  and  lease
commitments  whereby  interest,  principal  and  lease  payments  will  be  paid  from  future  mica  project
revenues or with equity components.
Management has developed a plan to place the Company on an improved financial footing.  Important
elements  of  the  plan  include  becoming  compliant  in  the  filing  of  our  annual  and  quarterly  financial
statements, raising of interim funding to provide for corporate survival, restructuring of debt with secured
creditors and arrangement of funding of $4.0-$6.0 million.  An important priority has been to bring the
financial reports current.  Our auditor currently is conducting the audit for the fiscal year ending June 30,
2005. We expect to be able to file the 2005 annual financial statement together with the 2005 quarterly
financial statements during the first quarter of calendar 2006.  We have provided for interim financing of
the  Company’s  activities  by  selling  mica,  on  a  limited  basis,  to  key  customers  in  the  plastics  and
cosmetic  industries.    In  addition,  the  Company  has  obtained  interim  funding  by  selling  $367,000,
$256,000 and $885,491 of its common stock to accredited investors during fiscal years 2004, 2005 and
2006 through December 20, 2005 respectively.  We have received verbal, non-binding expressions of
interest for a larger project financing once the Company becomes compliant in the filing of its financial
statements  and  its  stock  resumes  trading  on  the  Over  the  Counter  Bulletin  Board.    We  have  begun
discussions with secured creditors concerning restructuring of debt and believe such restructuring may
be possible in conjunction with a major financing if such financing can be arranged.  If we are able to
continue to secure interim financing, restructure debt and in 2006 obtain the additional required project
financing, we believe that the Company could be in a position to begin profitable mining operations.
Azco  will  need  additional  interim  funding  to  meet  its  operating  expenses.    We  plan  to  secure  such
interim  funding  through  sales  of  the  Company’s  common  stock  to  accredited  investors  and  by
continuing  to  sell  mica  from  inventory.    If  we  are  unable  to  procure  such  additional  funding,  the
Company may be required to eliminate substantially all business activities to conserve cash or may
need to seek protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.
In fiscal 2003, Azco raised approximately $1,000,000 through the sale of securities to Cornell Capital
Partners (“Cornell”) under an equity line of credit agreement and a securities purchase agreement. The
Company issued the maximum of 6,000,000 shares allowed under the terms of the agreements.
In  January  2002,  Azco  completed  a  financing  lease  transaction  that  yielded  Azco  net  proceeds  of
$2,842,500.  Under the terms of the transaction, Azco sold a 40% ownership in its mica processing
facility located in Glendale, Arizona.  Subsequently, Azco leased the property back for an initial period
of 10 years, with an option to repurchase the stake for 120% of the original sales price, of $3,000,000,
after the second year.  The repurchase price of the property increases by 10% of the original sales price
each year the option remains unexercised up to a maximum of 150% of the original sales price.  The
lessor maintains a mirror image option to put the property back to the Company.  Payments for the first 6
months under the lease agreement were $30,000, for the second 6 months they increase to $37,500
after which time they are $45,000 per month.  In connection with this transaction, the Company issued a
warrant  to  purchase  2,550,000  shares  of  the  Company’s  common  stock  at  $0.50  per  share.    The
warrant vested in January 2002 and is exercisable through January 16, 2007.  The Company paid the
first 12 lease payments but currently is in default under terms of the agreement.  The Company plans to
restructure the terms of the lease agreement if and when funding can be arranged for the mica project.
As  of  June  30,  2004  the  Company  is  past  due  on  $810,000  of  accrued  rental  payments  under  the
financing lease.  See discussion in the notes to the financial statements.

In December 2001, Azco received a one-year $100,000 loan, bearing interest at 12% per annum, from
a  sophisticated  investor  and  shareholder.    In  connection  with  this  loan,  Azco  issued  a  warrant  to
purchase 125,000 shares of Azco’s common stock at $.40 per share. In December 2002 the loan was
restructured  and  was  payable  in  December  2003.    It  currently  is  in  default.    The  warrant  vested  in
February 2002 and expired in December 2003.  Azco plans to negotiate a restructuring of this loan in
conjunction with the procurement of the mica project financing if and when it becomes available.
In October 2001, Azco received a one-year $100,000 loan, bearing interest at 12% per annum, from the
same shareholder.  In connection with this loan, Azco issued a warrant to purchase 125,000 shares of
Azco’s common stock at $.40 per share.  In October 2002 the loan was restructured and was payable in
October 2003.  It currently is in default.  The warrant vested in December 2001 and expired in October
2003.  Azco plans to negotiate a restructuring of this loan in conjunction with the procurement of the
mica project financing if and when it becomes available.
In September 2001, Azco received a one-year $200,000 loan, bearing interest at 12% per annum, from
the same shareholder.  In connection with this loan, Azco issued a warrant to purchase 250,000 shares
of  Azco’s  common  stock  at  $.40  per  share.    In  December  2002  the  loan  was  restructured  and  was
payable  in  December  2003.    It  currently  is  in  default.    The  warrant  vested  in  November  2001  and
expired in September 2003.  Azco plans to negotiate a restructuring of this loan in conjunction with the
procurement of the mica project financing if and when it becomes available.
In March 2001, Lawrence G. Olson, Azco’s Chairman and former President and CEO, jointly with his
wife, made an unsecured loan to Azco in the amount of $800,000 at an interest rate equal to the prime
rate of interest as reported by Imperial Bank plus one percentage point.  In conjunction with the loan,
Mr. Olson received a warrant to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock for $0.70 per share.  In
October 2001, Azco restructured the $800,000 loan agreement with Mr. Olson.  Mr. Olson agreed to
extend  the  note  payable  an  additional  year  to  March  2003  in  consideration  for  700,000  warrants  to
purchase common stock at an exercise price of $0.40 per share.  The warrants vested in December
2001 and expired in October 2003.  In addition, effective October 1, 2001, the interest rate payable on
the $800,000 Olson loan was adjusted from prime plus 1% to 12% annually.  In June 2002, the loan
was extended an additional year and Azco entered into a security agreement with Mr. Olson, whereby
Azco’s assets secured the loan.  The loan became payable in March 2004 and currently is in default.
 Azco plans to negotiate a restructuring of this loan in conjunction with the procurement of the mica
project financing if and when it becomes available.
The agreements Azco has with the shareholder and Mr. Olson described above are with parties related
to the Company and may not be at arms-length.
If we are unable to procure additional financing, Azco (i) may be forced to further delay or terminate the
development  and  marketing  of  Azco’s  mica  and  sand  by-products,  thereby  hindering  or  eliminating
Azco’s  expected  primary  source  of  future  revenue,  (ii)  may  be  required  to  eliminate  substantially  all
business activities to conserve cash, or (iii) may need to seek protection under the U.S. bankruptcy
laws.
Critical accounting policies and estimates
Our discussion and analysis of Azco’s financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  is  based  on  the
Company’s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amount  of
revenues  and  expenses  for  each  period.    Critical  accounting  policies  are  defined  as  policies  that
management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and
results of operations.  These policies may require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments,
commonly about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
19
Our significant accounting policies are described in the audited consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included in Item 7.  We believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue
recognition,  accounting  for  asset  retirement  obligations,  capitalization  of  mineral  properties  and  ore
reserves, depreciation of plant and equipment, and the carrying value of inventory.
An independent geological engineering firm estimated ore reserves at the Black Canyon mine based
on Azco’s exploration program completed in 1999.  Ore reserve estimates are based upon engineering
evaluations  of  assay  values  from  41  drill  holes  and  59  samples  of  outcropping  surface  exposures.
 These data were analyzed geostatistically and a geologic block model produced.  The model formed
the basis on which the open pits were designed and on which the probable and proven reserves were
calculated.    The  methodology  used  was  rigorous  and  conforms  to  accepted  industry  standards.
  However,  the  distribution  and  spacing  of  data  were  such  that  the  open  pit  analysis  in  the  study
produced  a  geometry  that  approached  the  limits  of  the  model.    Additional  drilling  would  need  to  be
carried out in order to improve confidence in the mica grade and to increase the amount of proven and
probable material.
On July 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (SFAS No. 143).  SFAS No. 143 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets  and  the  associated  asset  retirement  costs  estimated  to  aggregate  approximately  $250,000.
 Specifically, the Statement requires that retirement obligations be recognized when they are incurred
and displayed as liabilities with the initial measurement being at the present value of estimated third
party costs.  In addition, the asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the asset’s carrying value and
subsequently allocated to expense over the asset’s useful life.
The asset retirement costs associated with the Black Canyon mine consist of reclamation of disturbed
property as well as the disposal and dismantling of related property and equipment.  The Company
developed estimations of and accounting for asset retirement costs in conjunction with third parties and
with  the  Company’s  auditors.    The  Company  previously  accounted  for  these  costs  through  periodic
charges  to  earnings  using  the  units-of-production  method.    The  change  in  accounting  resulted  in  a
decrease  to  long-lived  assets  of  $161,746,  a  decrease  to  long-term  liabilities  of  $147,844  and  a
cumulative  effect  charge  to  earnings  of  $13,902  during  the  fiscal  year  ended  June  30,  2003.    The
change in accounting had no impact on the Company’s loss per share in fiscal 2003.
As  of  June  30,  2004,  the  Company,  pursuant  to  regulatory  requirements,  maintained  the  following
restricted assets associated with reclamation costs for the Black Canyon property:  $50,000 held on
deposit  on  behalf  of  the  Arizona  State  Treasurer  in  a  one-year  automatically  renewable  short-term
investment; and $128,658 held on deposit on behalf of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, maturing
October 25, 2004.  Both of the amounts will be held until all conditions of the reclamation agreement
have been fulfilled.
A roll forward of the Company’s asset retirement obligation through June 30, 2004 is as follows:
Initial liability recognition, July 1, 2002
Accretion
Balance, June 30, 2004
$
     45,309
        10,000
$
     55,309
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-
Lived Assets".  SFAS No. 144 replaced certain previously issued accounting guidance, developed a
single accounting model for long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, and
broadened  the  framework  previously  established  for  assets  to  be  disposed  of  by  sale  (whether
previously held or newly acquired).  This Statement was effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. 
The Company considered the guidance in SFAS No. 144 in writing down approximately $3.3 million
and  $4.8  million  of  long-lived  capital  assets  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  June  30,  2003  and  2004
respectively.
The Company recognizes the sale of product when an agreement of sale exists, product delivery has
occurred, title has transferred to the customer and collection is reasonably assured.  The price received
is based upon terms of the contract.
20
Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Cost is determined on a weighted
average basis and includes all costs in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition.  Net
realizable value is the estimated price at which inventory can be sold in the normal course of business
after allowing for the cost of completion and sale.
As of June 30, 2004, the Company’s inventory was reduced to estimated net realizable value.  Results
of  operations  for  the  years  ended  June  30,  2004  and  2003  included  a  corresponding  charge  of
$965,167  and  $996,223,  respectively,  which  represents  the  estimated  excess  of  cost  over  net
realizable value and has been recorded as impairment expense and production costs, respectively.
Land, buildings, plant, equipment and vehicles are carried at cost.  Replacements, maintenance and
repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred.  Major
renewals and improvements are capitalized.  Upon retirement, sale or other disposition, the cost and
accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the gain or loss is included in other income or expense
on the statement of operations.
The Company expenses exploration costs as incurred, but capitalizes costs directly attributable to the
acquisition  of  mineral  properties,  pending  determination  as  to  their  commercial  feasibility.    Mine
development costs that are expected to benefit future production are capitalized and amortized on the
units-of-production method over proven reserves.
Mineral properties (including capitalized development costs), plant and equipment are amortized on the
units-of-production basis based on proven and probable reserves.  Although estimations of proven and
probable  reserves  are  developed  with  the  aid  and  concurrence  of  independent  experts,  such
estimations  are  imprecise  because  they  depend  upon  the  judgment  of  individuals  who  review  the
geological and engineering information and upon statistical inferences drawn from only limited drilling
and  sampling.    Should  Azco’s  future  operations  encounter  mineralization  or  geologic  conditions
different from those predicted, reserves might have to be adjusted and amortization schedules modified.
The  Company  evaluates  its  long-term  assets  for  impairment  when  events  or  changes  in  economic
circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  amount  of  the  assets  may  not  be  recoverable.  For  operating
projects, the Company uses an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset
or  asset  grouping  over  the  remaining  life  to  determine  whether  the  assets  are  recoverable  and
measures  any  impairment  by  reference  to  fair  value.    Fair  value  is  estimated  using  the  Company’s
expectation of discounted net cash flows.
During  the  year  ended  June  30,  2003,  management  determined  that  an  impairment  charge  was
necessary to reduce the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets to the amount that could be
recovered  from  future  operations.    The  amount  of  the  impairment  charge  was  based  upon  a  formal
indication of willingness to acquire the Company’s mining assets received from a third party investor
during the third quarter and represented management’s best estimate of the fair value of these assets.
  An  impairment  charge  of  $3,291,773  reduced  the  carrying  amount  of  mineral  properties,  plant  and
equipment.
For  purposes  of  the  June  30,  2004  audit,  the  Company  obtained  an  independent  appraisal  of  the
equipment. The appraisal indicated a net realizable value of approximately $1,701,000. Accordingly,
the company recognized an increase to the reserve for impairment of $4,824,446.
In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation Number 46-
R  "Consolidation  of  Variable  Interest  Entities."    FIN  46-R,  which  modifies  certain  provisions  and
effective dates of FIN 46, sets forth the criteria to be used in determining whether an investment is a
variable  interest  entity  that  should  be  consolidated.    These  provisions  are  based  on  the  general
premise  that  if  a  company  controls  another  entity  through  interests  other  than  voting  interests,  that
company should consolidate the controlled entity.  The Company believes that currently, it does not
have  any  material  arrangements  that  meet  the  definition  of  a  variable  interest  entity,  which  would
require consolidation.
21
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, “Inventory Costs.” SFAS 151 amends the accounting
for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage)
under  the  guidance  in  ARB  43,  Chapter  4,  “Inventory  Pricing.”  Paragraph  5  of  ARB  43,  Chapter  4,
previously  stated  that  “…under  some  circumstances,  items  such  as  idle  facility  expense,  excessive
spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current
period charges….” This Statement requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges
regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal.” In addition, this Statement requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of
the  production  facilities.    This  statement  is  effective  for  inventory  costs  incurred  during  fiscal  years
beginning after June 15, 2005.  Management does not expect adoption of SFAS 151 to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In  December  2004,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  152,  “Accounting  for  Real  Estate  Time-Sharing
Transactions.”  The  FASB  issued  this  Statement  as  a  result  of  the  guidance  provided  in  AICPA
Statement of Position (SOP) 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions.” SOP 04-2
applies to all real estate time-sharing transactions.  Among other items, the SOP provides guidance on
the  recording  of  credit  losses  and  the  treatment  of  selling  costs,  but  does  not  change  the  revenue
recognition guidance in SFAS 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” for real estate time-sharing
transactions.  SFAS 152 amends Statement 66 to reference the guidance provided in SOP 04-2.  SFAS
152  also  amends  SFAS  67,  “Accounting  for  Costs  and  Initial  Rental  Operations  of  Real  Estate
Projects”, to state that SOP 04-2 provides the relevant guidance on accounting for incidental operations
and costs related to the sale of real estate time-sharing transactions.  SFAS 152 is effective for years
beginning after June 15, 2005, with restatements of previously issued financial statements prohibited.
  Management  does  not  expect  adoption  of  SFAS  152  to  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s
financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,” an amendment
to  Opinion  No.  29,  “Accounting  for  Nonmonetary  Transactions.”  Statement  153  eliminates  certain
differences in the guidance in Opinion No. 29 as compared to the guidance contained in standards
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.  The amendment to Opinion No. 29 eliminates
the fair value exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a
general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance.  Such
an exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
significantly  as  a  result  of  the  exchange.    SFAS  153  is  effective  for  nonmonetary  asset  exchanges
occurring in periods beginning after June 15, 2005.  Earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary
asset  exchanges  occurring  in  periods  beginning  after  December  16,  2004.    Management  does  not
expect adoption of SFAS 153 to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS 123(R) amends
SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and APB Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued  to  Employees.”  SFAS  123(R)  requires  that  the  cost  of  share-based  payment  transactions
(including those with employees and non-employees) be recognized in the financial statements. SFAS
123(R) applies to all share-based payment transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services
by issuing (or offering to issue) its shares, share options, or other equity instruments (except for those
held  by  an  ESOP)  or  by  incurring  liabilities  (1)  in  amounts  based  (even  in  part)  on  the  price  of  the
entity’s  shares  or  other  equity  instruments,  or  (2)  that  require  (or  may  require)  settlement  by  the
issuance  of  an  entity’s  shares  or  other  equity  instruments.    This  statement  is  effective  (1)  for  public
companies  qualifying  as  SEC  small  business  issuers,  as  of  the  first  interim  period  or  fiscal  year
beginning after December 15, 2005, or (2) for all other public companies, as of the first interim period or
fiscal  year  beginning  after  June  15,  2005,  or  (3)  for  all  nonpublic  entities,  as  of  the  first  fiscal  year
beginning after December 15, 2005.  Management is currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 123(R)
on the Company’s financial statements.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that Azco will, as
noted above, continue to operate as a going concern.  Azco has suffered recurring losses from
22
operations, is currently in default of all of its financial obligations, and will require substantial additional
funds to continue and develop operations.
These  matters  raise  substantial  doubt  about  Azco’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  The
accompanying consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-KSB do not include the adjustments
that would be necessary, and could be significant, including a provision of impairment for plant and
equipment should Azco be unable to continue as a going concern.
ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
The response to this item is submitted as a separate section at the end of this report beginning on page
F-1 of this Form 10-KSB.
ITEM 8. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS
On September 5, 2003, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) resigned as the independent registered
public accounting firm for the Company.  In connection with its audits for the fiscal years ending June
30, 2002 and June 30, 2001, and through September 5, 2003, there were no disagreements with PwC
on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or
procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused them to
make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such years.
On October 24, 2003 the Company engaged James E. Raftery, Certified Public Accountant PC (“Mr.
Raftery”), located at 606 North Stapley Drive, Mesa, AZ 85203, as the independent registered public
accounting firm to audit the Company’s financial statements.  However, Mr. Raftery was unable to issue
an audit report for the Company, for the period ended June 30, 2003, and consequently, on February
13,  2004  he  resigned  as  the  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  for  the  Company.    Mr.
Raftery was unable to issue an audit report due to the fact that, as of the date of his resignation, he had
not  received  the  final  approval  expected  from  the  Public  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (“PCAOB”)  to
audit publicly traded companies.  Regulations issued pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provide that
on or after October 22, 2003 only accounting firms approved by the PCAOB may issue audit reports

Based on the closing price of $0.15 of Azco’s common stock as quoted on the “Pink Sheets” on June
30, 2004.
Compensation Of Directors
Azco  pays  to  each  of  its  outside,  non-officer  directors  a  fee  of  $1,500  per  month.    Due  to  financial
constraints, no such fees have been paid since August 2002.  Azco also reimburses its directors for
reasonable  expenses  incurred  in  attending  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors.    During  fiscal  years
2004 and 2003, non-officer directors received no consulting fees separate and distinct from directors’
fees as a result of actual services rendered above and beyond those typical of a non-officer director.  It
is Azco’s policy to grant to directors upon their initial election, options to purchase 100,000 shares of
Azco’s common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock.
Employment Agreements
In  October  2003  the  Company  entered  into  employment  and  change  of  control  agreements  with  its
President and Chief Executive Officer.  The employment agreement describes among other things the
officer’s duties, compensation levels and benefits.  The term of the agreement is from October 16, 2003
through and including October 15, 2006, and then automatically extends through October 15, 2008 and
thereafter year to year unless terminated on 90 days prior notice.  The change of control agreement
provides that if there is a change of control of the Company and the officer leaves the employment of
the  Company,  for  whatever  reason  (other  than  discharge  for  cause,  death,  or  disability)  within  six
months after such change of control, the officer shall receive a lump sum cash payment of 299% of the
base  amount  as  defined  in  IRC  Section  280G  (b)  (3),  subject  to  certain  limitations  of  the  Internal
Revenue Code.  In addition, the officer will continue to be covered by the Company’s medical, health,
life and dental plans for 24 months after such cessation of employment.
26
In December 1999 the Company entered into a change of control agreement with its Chairman.  The
agreement provides for a lump sum cash payment in the amount not to exceed $100,000 in the event of
change in control and resignation from the Board.
Stock Option Plan
Azco has a Stock Option Plan (“the Plan”) dated July 24, 1989, as amended, for the granting of options
to purchase common stock.  The board of directors may grant options to key personnel and others as it
deems  appropriate  provided  the  number  of  options  does  not  exceed  5,950,424.    On  June  30,  2004
there were 4,000,000 options outstanding under the Plan. There are no vesting requirements under the
Plan.  The options are exercisable over a maximum term of five years.

computing  the  percentage  of  ownership  of  such  person,  but  are  not  treated  as  outstanding  for  the
purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.
ITEM 12. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
In  October  2003,  the  Company  entered  into  a  confidential  property  identification  agreement  with  its
current President and Chief Executive Officer.  Under terms of the agreement, the current officer, on the
basis  of  his  prior  knowledge,  provided  a  list  of  24  specific  mineral  properties  with  potential  for
exploration and development that might represent attractive acquisition opportunities for the Company.
 The Company agreed to pay compensation to the current officer in the form of a royalty of 1.0% of the
value of future production, if any, that is derived from identified properties that the Company acquires.
 In the event an identified property is acquired and subsequently sold, the Company agreed to pay the
current officer an amount equal to 10.0% of the value of the sale.  The Ortiz gold property that was
acquired  in  August  2004  is  one  of  the  24  properties  identified  and  is  subject  to  the  property
identification agreement (See “Subsequent Events”, Note 13 to the Financial Statements).
On August 12, 2003 the Company assigned, for the sum of $5,000, its right, title and interest in and to
its lease with New Planet Copper Mining Company to Metallica Ventures, LLC, a corporation controlled
by the Company’s current President and Chief Executive Officer.  The Company retained an option to
purchase 25% of the New Planet lease for an amount equal to 25% of the expenditures on the property
from the date of assignment through the date of the exercise of the option. On September 22, 2005,
Metallica  Ventures  LLC  reassigned  to  the  Company,  for  consideration  of  $10,000  and  the  issue  of
2,000,000 unregistered shares of the Company’s common stock, its right, title and interest in and to the
lease with New Planet Copper Mining Company.
On September 15, 2005, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with an attorney who is the
son  of  the  Company’s  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer.    Terms  of  the  contract  provide  for
compensation of $4,000 per month and payment of certain expenses for an initial three-month period,
after which the contract extends on a month-to-month basis until terminated by either party.
In  July  2002,  Azco  entered  into  a  settlement  agreement  regarding  fees  payable  under  terminated
management  agreements  with  two  of  its  former  officers  and  directors,  Lindsay  and  Harvey.    Azco
agreed  to  pay  each  former  director  the  sum  of  $350,000.    The  amount  was  to  be  paid  in  an  initial
payment of $20,000 each, due upon the signing of the agreement, and in monthly payments of $10,000
thereafter, with the entire balance due within 24 months from the date of the agreement.  In addition,
Azco agreed to pay $24,898 representing one half of the legal fees incurred by the former directors.
 The Company paid $184,906 through March 31, 2003.  In July 2002, under the terms of the settlement
agreement, Azco issued Lindsay and Harvey each 150,000 shares of unrestricted common stock in
Azco Mining Inc.
28
In  April  2003,  due  to  the  Company’s  default  status  under  the  settlement  agreement,  Lindsay  and
Harvey filed for and were granted a writ of garnishment against the Company, whereby the court seized
$85,908  of  the  Company’s  funds.    In  June  2003,  the  Company  entered  into  a  second  settlement
agreement with the former directors whereby the Company was fully released under the terms of the
first settlement agreement for cash payments totaling $102,257, the issuance of 500,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock to each of the former executives and the assignment of all of the Company’s
future rights under the sale of its interest in Cobre del Mayo.  The cash payments consisted of $95,000
to the former executives plus $7,257 for the reimbursement of legal and court costs.  In August 2003,
the stock was issued under the terms of the second settlement agreement.  A restrictive legend was
attached to the stock and its sale is reliant upon an exemption from Rule 144 of the Securities Act.
In March 2001, Lawrence G. Olson, Azco’s Chairman and former President and CEO, jointly with his
wife, made an unsecured loan to Azco in the amount of $800,000 at an interest rate equal to the prime
rate of interest as reported by Imperial Bank plus one percentage point.  In conjunction with the loan Mr.
Olson received a warrant to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.70
per share.  The warrant vested in December 2001 and expires in October 2006.
In October 2001, Azco restructured its $800,000 loan agreement with Mr. Olson.  Mr. Olson agreed to
extend the note payable an additional year to March 2003 in consideration for a warrant to purchase
700,000  shares  of  common  stock  at  an  exercise  price  of  $0.40  per  share.    The  warrant  vested  in
December 2001 and expired in October 2003.  In addition, effective October 1, 2001, the interest rate
payable on the loan was adjusted from prime plus 1% to 12% annually.
In  June  2002,  the  $800,000  Olson  loan  was  extended  an  additional  year,  in  consideration  for  Azco
entering into a security agreement with Mr. Olson, whereby certain of Azco’s assets secured the loan.
 The loan became payable in March 2004.
Compliance With Section 16(a) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, or written representations from
certain reporting persons, Azco believes that, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, its officers,
directors  and  greater  than  ten  percent  beneficial  owners  complied  with  all  applicable  filing
requirements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Shareholders and Board of Directors
AZCO Mining Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of AZCO Mining Inc. as of June 30,
2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' (deficit), and cash flows for
the year then ended.  These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board  (United  States).    Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain
reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  An
audit  includes  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material
respects,  the  financial  position  of  AZCO  Mining  Inc.  as  of  June  30,  2004,  and  the  results  of  its
operations,  and  its  cash  flows  for  the  year  then  ended,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
AZCO Mining, Inc. and Subsidiary
We have audited the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows  of
AZCO Mining, Inc. and Subsidiary for the year ended June 30, 2003. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is
not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, and audit of its internal control over financial
reporting.  Our audits include consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  these  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 
Accordingly,  we  express  no  such  opinion.    An  audit  includes  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material
respects, the results of operations and cash flows of AZCO Mining, Inc. and Subsidiary for the year
ended June 30, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations which raise substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern.  The consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2004
NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, NATURE OF OPERATIONS
AND USE OF ESTIMATES
Azco Mining Inc. (the Company) is a mining company incorporated in Delaware.  Its general business
strategy is to acquire, explore and develop mineral properties.  The Company’s principal asset is the
100% owned Black Canyon Mica Project (the Mica Project) in Arizona.
In  November  2002,  the  Company  ceased  crushing  and  concentration  activities  at  its  Black  Canyon
project  due  to  economic  constraints.    Limited  production,  marketing  and  sales  have  continued  at  its
Glendale mica processing facility using inventoried mica, while the Company looks for a joint-venture
partner to help finance the project.
Principles of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned
subsidiary,  Azco  Mica,  Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation.    All  significant  intercompany  balances  and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents.
Inventory
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined on a weighted
average basis and includes all costs in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition.  Net
realizable  value  is  the  estimated  price  at  which  inventories  can  be  sold  in  the  normal  course  of
business after allowing for the cost of completion and sale.
As of June 30, 2004, the Company’s inventory was reduced to $0, its estimated net realizable value.
 Results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, included a corresponding charge of
$965,167  and  $996,223,  respectively,  which  represents  the  estimated  excess  of  cost  over  net
realizable value and has been recorded as impairment expense.
Property, plant and equipment
Land,  buildings  and  plant  are  carried  at  cost.    Replacements,  maintenance  and  repairs  that  do  not
improve  or  extend  the  life  of  the  respective  assets  are  expense  as  incurred.    Major  renewals  and
improvements are capitalized.  Upon retirement, sale or other disposition, the cost and accumulated
amortization are eliminated and the gain or loss is included in operations.
The  Company  evaluates  its  long-term  assets  for  impairment  when  events  or  changes  in  economic
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company uses
an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset grouping over the
remaining  life  to  measure  whether  the  assets  are  recoverable  and  to  measure  any  impairment  by
reference  to  fair  value.    Fair  value  is  generally  estimated  using  the  Company’s  expectation  of
discounted net cash flows.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2004
During  the  year  ended  June  30,  2003,  management  determined  that  an  impairment  charge  was
necessary to reduce the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets to the amount that could be
recovered  from  future  operations.    The  amount  of  the  impairment  charge  was  based  upon  a  formal
indication of willingness to acquire the Company’s mining assets received from a third party investor
during the third quarter and represented management’s best estimate of the fair value of these assets.
  An  impairment  charge  of  $3,291,773  reduced  the  carrying  amount  of  mineral  properties,  plant  and
equipment.
Subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2004, the Company obtained an independent appraisal of the
equipment. The appraisal indicated a net realizable value of approximately $1,701,000. Accordingly,
the company recognized an increase to the reserve for impairment of $4,824,446.
Reclamation costs
On July 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (SFAS No. 143).  SFAS No. 143 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets and the associated asset retirement costs.  Specifically, the Statement requires that retirement
obligations  be  recognized  when  they  are  incurred  and  displayed  as  liabilities  with  the  initial
measurement being at the present value of estimated third party costs.  In addition, the asset retirement
cost is capitalized as part of the assets’ carrying value and subsequently allocated to expense over the
assets useful life.
The asset retirement obligation associated with the Mica project consists of reclamation of disturbed
property as well as the disposal and dismantling of related property and equipment.  The Company
previously accounted for these costs through periodic charges to earnings using the units-of-production
method.  The change in accounting resulted in a decrease to long-lived assets of $161,746, a decrease
to long-term liabilities of $147,844 and a cumulative effect charge to earnings of $13,902 during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2003.  The change in accounting had no impact on the Company’s loss per
share in fiscal 2003.
The Company’s asset retirement obligation, included with idle equipment in the accompanying balance
sheet, through June 30, 2004, is as follows:

Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes the sale of the product when an agreement of sale exists, product delivery
has occurred, title has transferred to the customer and collectibility is reasonably assured.  The price
received is based upon terms of the contract.

JUNE 30, 2004
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS 109).  SFAS 109 requires the Company to recognize deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized
in  the  Company’s  financial  statements  or  tax  returns.    Under  this  method,  deferred  tax  assets  and
liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements carrying amounts
and  tax  basis  of  assets  and  liabilities  using  enacted  tax  rates  in  effect  in  the  years  in  which  the
differences are expected to reverse.
Net (loss) per common share
The Company calculates net income (loss) per share as required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 128, “Earnings per Share.”  Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by
dividing  net  income  (loss)  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares  outstanding  for  the
period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding.  During the
periods  when  they  are  anti-dilutive,  common  stock  equivalents,  if  any,  are  not  considered  in  the
computation.  The  impact  of  outstanding  stock  options  and  warrants  has  not  been  included  in  the
computation of diluted loss per common share as it would be anti-dilutive.
Stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees for services based on the fair value
of the equity instruments issued and accounts for equity instruments issued to other than employees
based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  or  the  fair  value  of  the  equity  instruments,
whichever is more reliably measurable.
The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based  Compensation."  The  provisions  of  SFAS  123  allow  companies  to  either  expense  the
estimated  fair  value  of  stock  options  or  to  continue  to  follow  the  intrinsic  value  method  set  forth  in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (“APB 25") but
disclose the pro forma effects on net income (loss) had the fair value of the options been expensed. The
Company has elected to continue to apply APB 25 in accounting for its stock option incentive plans.
Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.  The most significant area requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate
to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units-of-production amortization
depreciation.  Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Significant estimates are used when accounting for the Company’s carrying value of inventory, mineral
properties and fixed assets, depreciation, accruals, taxes and contingencies, which are discussed in
the respective notes to the financial statements.

Reclassifications
Certain balances as of June 30, 2003, have been reclassified in the accompanying financial statements
to conform to the current year presentation.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The  carrying  values  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash,  accounts  payable  and  accrued
liabilities,  line  of  credit,  notes  payable  and  financing  lease  liabilities  approximated  their  related  fair
values as of June 30, 2004 due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments.  The carrying
value of the Company’s long-term financing lease approximates the fair value based on the terms at
which the Company could obtain similar financing.
Restricted Cash
As  part  of  the  reclamation  deposit  required  for  the  Black  Canyon  mica  property,  the  Company  has
restricted cash of $178,658, comprising $50,000 held on deposit for the Arizona State Treasurer in a
one-year automatically renewable short-term investment; and $128,658 held as collateral against an
irrevocable letter of credit of the same amount to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Both of
the amounts will be held until all terms and conditions of the reclamation agreement have been fulfilled
or a satisfactory replacement bond has been accepted.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation Number 46-
R  "Consolidation  of  Variable  Interest  Entities."    FIN  46-R,  which  modifies  certain  provisions  and
effective dates of FIN 46, sets forth the criteria to be used in determining whether an investment is a
variable  interest  entity  that  should  be  consolidated.    These  provisions  are  based  on  the  general
premise  that  if  a  company  controls  another  entity  through  interests  other  than  voting  interests,  that
company should consolidate the controlled entity.  The Company believes that currently, it does not
have  any  material  arrangements  that  meet  the  definition  of  a  variable  interest  entity,  which  would
require consolidation.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, “Inventory Costs.” SFAS 151 amends the accounting
for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage)
under the guidance in ARB 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing.”  Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4,
previously  stated  that  “…under  some  circumstances,  items  such  as  idle  facility  expense,  excessive
spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current
period charges….”  This Statement requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges
regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal.” In addition, this Statement requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of
the  production  facilities.  This  statement  is  effective  for  inventory  costs  incurred  during  fiscal  years
beginning after June 15, 2005. Management does not expect adoption of SFAS 151 to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In  December  2004,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  152,  “Accounting  for  Real  Estate  Time-Sharing
Transactions.”  The  FASB  issued  this  Statement  as  a  result  of  the  guidance  provided  in  AICPA
Statement of Position (SOP) 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions.” SOP 04-2
applies to all real estate time-sharing transactions. Among other items, the SOP provides guidance on
the  recording  of  credit  losses  and  the  treatment  of  selling  costs,  but  does  not  change  the  revenue
recognition guidance in SFAS 66, “Accounting for
F-11
AZCO MINING INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2004
Sales  of  Real  Estate,”  for  real  estate  time-sharing  transactions.  SFAS  152  amends  Statement  66  to
reference  the  guidance  provided  in  SOP  04-2.    SFAS  152  also  amends  SFAS  67,  “Accounting  for
Costs  and  Initial  Rental  Operations  of  Real  Estate  Projects”,  to  state  that  SOP  04-2  provides  the
relevant guidance on accounting for incidental operations and costs related to the sale of real estate
time-sharing  transactions.  SFAS  152  is  effective  for  years  beginning  after  June  15,  2005,  with
restatements  of  previously  issued  financial  statements  prohibited.  Management  does  not  expect
adoption of SFAS 152 to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,” an amendment
to  Opinion  No.  29,  “Accounting  for  Nonmonetary  Transactions.”  Statement  153  eliminates  certain
differences in the guidance in Opinion No. 29 as compared to the guidance contained in standards
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The amendment to Opinion No. 29 eliminates
the fair value exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a
general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. Such
an exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
significantly  as  a  result  of  the  exchange.  SFAS  153  is  effective  for  nonmonetary  asset  exchanges
occurring in periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary
asset  exchanges  occurring  in  periods  beginning  after  December  16,  2004.  Management  does  not
expect adoption of SFAS 153 to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS 123(R) amends
SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and APB Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued  to  Employees.”  SFAS  123(R)  requires  that  the  cost  of  share-based  payment  transactions
(including those with employees and non-employees) be recognized in the financial statements. SFAS
123(R) applies to all share-based payment transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services
by issuing (or offering to issue) its shares, share options, or other equity instruments (except for those
held  by  an  ESOP)  or  by  incurring  liabilities  (1)  in  amounts  based  (even  in  part)  on  the  price  of  the
entity’s  shares  or  other  equity  instruments,  or  (2)  that  require  (or  may  require)  settlement  by  the
issuance  of  an  entity’s  shares  or  other  equity  instruments.  This  statement  is  effective  (1)  for  public
companies  qualifying  as  SEC  small  business  issuers,  as  of  the  first  interim  period  or  fiscal  year
beginning after December 15, 2005, or (2) for all other public companies, as of the first interim period or
fiscal  year  beginning  after  June  15,  2005,  or  (3)  for  all  nonpublic  entities,  as  of  the  first  fiscal  year
beginning after December 15, 2005.  Management is currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 123(R)
on the Company’s financial statements.
NOTE 2.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will  continue  to  operate  as  a  going  concern.    The  Company  requires  additional  funds  to  continue
operations, including production and marketing of mica and sand products, exploration commitments
on  mineral  properties,  general  and  administrative  expenses  and  to  meet  other  obligations  as  they
become  due.    The  Company  has  hired  a  new  President  with  extensive  experience  in  the  mining
industry  and  administration  of  public  companies.    The  Company  is  currently  making  efforts  to  raise
interim  financing  and  renegotiate  terms  with  secured  creditors  for  the  purpose  of  making  long-term
capitalization more attractive.  The Company has also retained an investor relations firm to assist in
seeking  additional  financing  and  possible  joint  venture  agreements.    There  is  no  assurance  these
efforts  will  be  successful  or  available  on  terms  acceptable  to  the  Company.    These  matters  raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  These consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments to assets and liabilities that would be necessary,
and which could be significant, should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 4.  FINANCING LEASE LIABILITY
In  January  2002,  the  Company  completed  a  financing  lease  transaction.    Under  the  terms  of  the
transaction,  the  Company  sold  a  40  percent  ownership  in  the  Company’s  mica  processing  facility
located in Glendale, Arizona.  Subsequently, the Company leased the property back for an initial period
of 10 years, with an option to repurchase the 40 percent ownership for 120 percent of the original sales
price after the second year.  The repurchase price of the property increases by 10 percent of the original
sales price each year the option remains unexercised up to a maximum of 150 percent of the original
sales price.  Payments for the first six months under the financing agreement were  $30,000, for the
second six months they increased to $37,450 and thereafter they are $45,000 per month.  For fiscal
2004 and 2003, effectively, these payments represent interest on the total purchase price of $4,500,000
at 12% per year.  The Company is in default under the terms of the financing lease transaction and is in
discussions to resolve the issue.  The Company is currently past due on $810,000 on accrued rental
payments.
In connection with this transaction, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 2,550,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock at $.50 per share.  This warrant vested in January 2002 and is exercisable
through January 16, 2007.  The fair value of the warrant, as determined at the time of issuance, of $
2,593,898 was recorded as a discount on the financing liability and is being accreted annually.  During
the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized accretion of the discount on the
liability of $193,096 and $177,203, respectively.
The components of the long-term liability are as follows as of June 30, 2004:

NOTE 5.  NOTES PAYABLE, RELATED PARTIES
In  December  2001,  the  Company  received  a  one-year  $100,000  loan,  bearing  interest  at  12%  per
annum from a shareholder.  In connection with this loan, the Company issued a warrant to purchase
125,000  shares  of  the  Company’s  common  stock  at  $0.40  per  share.    The  relative  fair  value  of  the
warrant at the time of issuance was $29,895 and was reflected as a discount to the related note.  In
December  2002,  the  terms  of  the  loan  and  the  warrants  were  extended  an  additional  year  through
December  2003.    The  Company’s  policy  is  to  account  for  the  increase  in  the  value  of  the  warrant
(resulting  from  an  extension  of  the  exercise  date)  as  a  dividend  to  a  shareholder.    Accordingly,  an
additional $7,188 was reflected as an increase to accumulated deficit and additional paid-in-capital at
June 30, 2003.
In October 2001, the Company received a one-year $100,000 loan, bearing interest at 12% per annum
from the same shareholder.  In connection with this loan, the Company issued a warrant to purchase
125,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.40 per share.  In October 2002, the loan and the
warrants were extended an additional year through October 2003.  The Company’s policy is to account
for  the  increase  in  the  value  of  the  warrant  (resulting  from  an  extension  of  the  exercise  date)  as  a
dividend  to  a  shareholder.    Accordingly,  an  additional  $11,617  was  reflected  as  an  increase  to
accumulated deficit and additional paid-in-capital at June 30, 2003.
In  September  2001,  the  Company  received  a  one-year  $200,000  loan,  bearing  interest  at  12%  per
annum, from the same shareholder.  In connection with this loan, the Company issued a warrant to
purchase 250,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.40 per share.  In September 2002 the
terms of the loan and the warrants were extended an additional year through September 2003.  The
company’s policy is to account for the increase in value of the warrant (resulting from an extension of
the exercise date) as a dividend to the shareholder.  Accordingly, an additional $16,198 was reflected
as an increase to accumulated deficit and additional paid-in-capital at June 30, 2003.
In August 2001, the Company received a one-year $200,000 loan, bearing interest at 12% per annum,
from a shareholder.  In connection with this loan, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 250,000
shares of the Company’s common stock at $.40 per share.  The relative fair value of the warrant at the
time of issuance was $75,402 and was reflected as a discount to the related note.  This warrant was
exercised in January 2002.  In lieu of payment for the exercise price, the outstanding note payable was
reduced by $100,000.
In March 2001, the Company received an unsecured loan of $800,000 from its former Chief Executive
Officer and current director.  The note bore an interest rate equal to the prime rate plus one percentage
point and was due on March 14, 2002.  In connection with this loan, the Company issued a warrant to
purchase 300,000 shares of its common stock at $.70 per share. The relative fair value of the warrant at
the time of issuance was $119,605.  In October 2001, the Company restructured this note payable.  The
note  was  extended  an  additional  year  to  March  15,  2003  in  consideration  for  700,000  warrants  to
purchase the Company’s stock at an exercise price of $.40.  The warrants vested in December 2001
and expired on October 12, 2003.  The relative fair value of the warrant at the time of issuance was
$330,273 and was recorded as a discount to the related note.  In addition, effective October 1, 2001, the
interest rate payable on
F-14

the note was adjusted from prime plus one percent to 12% annually.  In June 2002, the note was again
extended  through  March  2004  in  return  for  a  security  interest  in  all  of  AZCO's  accounts  receivable,
inventory, equipment and real property.
During the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized accretion of the discounts
on notes payable of $85,055 and $168,651 , respectively.
Notes payable, related parties at June 30, 2004 is summarized as follows:
Various  12.0%  notes  due  to  a  shareholder.    Principal  and  accrued
interest due from September 2003 to December 2003.  The various
notes are unsecured.
12%  note  payable  to  a  director  of  the  Company.    Principal  and
accrued interest due March 2004.  Note is secured by the Company’s
accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real property.

As of June 30, 2004, $265,000 of accrued interest was payable on the notes payable, related parties.
NOTE 6.  LINE OF CREDIT
In December 2002 the Company issued a $250,000 note to Cornell Capital Partners LP (“Cornell”) in
conjunction with the Equity Line of Credit.  A 5% discount was deducted resulting in net proceeds to the
Company  of  $237,500.    The  note  was  paid  off  before  the  due  date  of  February  2003  by  issuing

of the note was converted into 2,781,750 shares of the Company’s stock during the second and third
fiscal quarters of 2003 based upon the contractual conversion price of the average of the three lowest
closing  prices  of  the  Company’s  common  stock  for  the  five  trading  days  immediately  preceding  the
respective conversion date.  The Company’s results of operations for fiscal 2003 reflect expenses of
$163,543  for  the  excess  of  the  market  price  over  the  conversion  price  (beneficial  conversion)  and
$5,871 for the recognition and subsequent mark to market adjustments for the conversion option as a
derivative  in  accordance  with  SFAS  No.  133,  “Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging
Activities."

NOTE 10.  CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
Termination of Management Agreements
In October 2000, the Company notified two of its officers of its intention not to renew the contracts with
each  of  their  personal  management  companies  pursuant  to  which  they  were  employed  as  Chief
Executive Officer and President, and as Executive Vice President and Secretary.  These contracts were
scheduled to expire in February 2001.  Both officers demanded payment of termination fees pursuant to
their personal management company contracts.  In July 2002, Azco entered into a settlement with the
officers whereby the Company agreed to pay each former officer the sum of $350,000, plus certain legal
fees  and  issue  each  150,000  shares  of  unrestricted  common  stock  in  the  Company.    The  cash
settlement amount was to be paid in monthly installments of $10,000, with the entire balance due within
24 months.  The Company paid $184,906 through March 31, 2003.  In April 2003, due to default under
the  settlement  agreement,  the  officers  filed  for  and  were  granted  a  writ  of  garnishment  against  the
Company, whereby the court seized $85,908 of Company funds.  In June 2003, the Company entered
into a second settlement agreement with the former directors whereby the Company was fully released
under the terms of the first settlement agreement for cash payments totaling $102,257, the issuance of
600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to each of the former executives and the assignment
of all the Company’s future rights under the sale of its interest in Cobre del Mayo as described in the
following paragraph.
Under the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement (“the Agreement”) dated April 10, 2003, the Company
sold  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  shares  of  stock  of  Cobre  del  Mayo  S.A.  de  D.V.,  a  Mexican
corporation (“Cobre del Mayo”) to Frontera Cobre del Mayo, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Frontera”).
  Azco  received  $200,000  upon  closing  and  $50,000  three  months  after  closing.    In  addition,  the
Company  was  to  receive  an  initial  deferred  payment  of  $250,000,  upon  the  date  of  construction
commencement of the Piedras Verdes copper project, if the COMEX price of copper is less than $1.00
per  pound  or  $500,000  if  the  COMEX  price  is  greater  than  $1.00  per  pound.    Upon  the  date  of
commercial production, the Company was to receive an additional payment of $500,000, if the COMEX
price  is  less  than  $1.00  per  pound  or  $1,000,000  if  the  COMEX  price  is  above  $1.00  per  pound.
  Frontera  also  agreed  to  pay  Azco  a  royalty  of  $0.02  per  pound  of  copper  produced  and  sold  from
Piedras Verdes during any calendar quarter the average COMEX price is equal to or greater than $1.20
per pound, until such time as the initial deferred payment, the subsequent deferred payment and the
royalty aggregate in total $4,750,000.  Under the terms of the June 14, 2003 settlement agreement with
the former officers of the Company, all future deferred payments and royalties under the Agreement
were assigned to the former officers.
iCapital Corporation
On  June  25,  2002  Azco  received  a  demand  for  arbitration  filed  by  iCapital  Corporation  seeking
$144,000  in  relief  due  to  failure  to  pay  under  a  June  26,  2001  Financial  Consulting  Agreement.    In
September  2003,  the  American  Arbitration  Association  awarded  iCapital  Corporation  $144,000  in
addition to $6,000 in attorney’s fees and costs as full settlement of the claims submitted for arbitration.
 Under the terms of the award the Company had 30 days to remit the amount of the award after which
interest accrues at 5% per annum.  On November 15, 2004, the Company agreed with iCapital to settle
the approximately $150,000 amount owed, by the issue of 500,000 unregistered shares of its common
stock to be held by the Company and released to iCapital in six $25,000 increments over a period of six

Canada, upon the Company in order to recuperate certain subsidiary stock and other assets from the
Company.  The jurisdiction of the courts of Quebec is being currently contested before the Supreme
Court  of  Canada.    It  is  the  understanding  of  the  Company  and  its  Canadian  legal  counsel  that  the
Petitioner alleges that, through the Company’s involvement with Eagle River in the Mali Project, the
Company is guilty of contractual breaches in excess of $4,300,000.  In management’s opinion, based
on  information  to  date,  this  claim  is  unfounded  and  management  intends  to  vigorously  defend  its
position.

that  if  there  is  a  change  of  control  of  the  Company  and  the  officer  leaves  the  employment  of  the
Company, for reason other than discharge for cause, death, or disability, within six months after such
change of control, the officer shall receive a lump sum cash payment of 299% of the base amount as

the Board of Directors.  The agreement provides for a lump sum cash payment in the amount not to
exceed $100,000 in the event of change in control and resignation of the Chairman from the Board.
Property Identification Agreement
On October 6, 2003 the Company entered into a confidential property identification agreement with its
current President and Chief Executive Officer.  Under terms of the agreement, the current officer, on the
basis  of  his  prior  knowledge,  provided  a  list  of  24  specific  mineral  properties  with  potential  for
exploration and development that might represent attractive acquisition opportunities for the Company.
 The Company agreed to pay compensation to the current officer in the form of a royalty of 1.0% of the
value of future production, if any, that is derived from identified properties that the Company acquires.
 In the event an identified property is acquired and subsequently sold, the Company agreed to pay the
current officer an amount equal to 10.0% of the value of the sale.  The Ortiz gold property that was
acquired  in  August  2004  is  one  of  the  24  properties  identified  and  is  subject  to  the  property
identification agreement.  (See Note 13).
