<p><i>Summary 
</i> On 23 and 24 May 2013, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, convened a consultation aimed at 
discussing ways to strengthen partnerships with national rapporteurs and equivalent 
mechanisms on trafficking in persons. The present report presents background information 
on the thematic of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms, a summary of the 
discussions held and the recommendations made by participants, and some concluding 
observations. The consultation brought together national rapporteurs and representatives of 
equivalent mechanisms from 17 countries. The discussion revolved around the main 
function of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms, including data collection and 
analysis, monitoring, evaluating and reporting on the impact of anti-trafficking policies, 
and fostering partnerships and coordination at the national, regional and international 
levels. The participants unanimously emphasized the importance of the independence of 
such mechanisms if they are to be effective and stressed that global and regional exchanges 
were extremely useful. They expressed their interest in the issue and their readiness to 
continue to engage with each other, with the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, with the 
United Nations system in general and with other relevant stakeholders, and further 
suggested that a second meeting be held to deepen the discussion.

<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Context 
</b>1. On 23 and 24 May 2013, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, convened a consultative meeting on strengthening 
partnerships with national rapporteurs on trafficking in persons and equivalent mechanisms 
in Berlin to provide an opportunity to share experiences and lessons learned among national 
rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms, and further strengthen the partnership between her 
mandate and such mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>2. This consultation, which brought together 40 participants,1 including national 
rapporteurs and representatives of equivalent mechanisms from 19 countries from different 
regions of the world and representatives of relevant United Nations, international and 
regional organizations, was the first global consultation of national rapporteurs and 
representatives of equivalent mechanisms aimed at holding an in-depth discussion on 
possible means of cooperation between such mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>3. In its resolutions 67/145, 65/190, 63/156, 61/144 and 59/166 on trafficking in 
women and girls, the General Assembly called on Governments to  consider setting up or 
strengthening a national coordinating mechanism, for example, a national rapporteur or an 
inter-agency body to encourage the exchange of information and to report on data, root 
causes, factors and trends in violence against women and in trafficking, especially of 
women and girls. Moreover, in its Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human 
Rights and Human Trafficking (E/2002/68/Add.1),  the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recommended that States and, where 
applicable, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), consider 
establishing mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the human rights impact of anti-
trafficking laws, policies, programmes and interventions. 
</p>
<p>4. Establishing a national rapporteur or equivalent mechanism is also seen as an 
important step towards the implementation of data collection and research into and analysis 
of the trafficking situation in the countries concerned. In the United Nations Global Plan of 
Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, research and collecting suitably disaggregated 
data are identified as key factors, enabling the proper analysis of the nature and extent of 
trafficking in persons.2 
</p>
<p>5. In the exercise of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur has consistently advocated 
for the importance of having national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms, which can 
help in coordinating, monitoring and evaluating anti-trafficking policies. In particular, the 
analysis and data provided by national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms are 
instrumental in measuring the effectiveness of the steps taken to prevent human trafficking, 
prosecute alleged perpetrators and protect victims. 
</p>
<p>6. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur also includes, among other things, 
identifying and sharing best practices, proposing adequate responses to challenges and 
obstacles in order to uphold and protect the human rights of victims, and putting particular 
emphasis on the identification of concrete areas for international cooperation to tackle the 
issue of trafficking in persons. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur has emphasized 
that cooperation and exchange of expertise and good practices among countries would 
contribute to raising the effectiveness of anti-trafficking efforts. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur has long maintained that in order to address effectively the 
serious challenge to humanity posed by the phenomenon of trafficking in persons, better 
cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination is required. In this regard, she

 General Assembly resolution 64/293, para. 16. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 
</b></p>
<p>has stressed her conviction that regional and subregional mechanisms &#8220;play a key role in 
providing a response that is both multilateral and sufficiently close to countries&#8217; realities 
and specificities within a certain region&#8221; (A/HRC/14/32, para. 2). 
</p><p>8. Concerning the existing regional frameworks and initiatives relating to this topic, 
directive 2011/36/EU of 5 April 2011 of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting 
its victims, clearly defines the scope and mandate of national rapporteurs or equivalent 
mechanisms. Furthermore, article 29 of the Council of Europe Convention on Action 
against Trafficking in Human Beings encourages States parties to consider appointing 
national rapporteurs or other mechanisms to monitor the anti-trafficking activities of State 
institutions and the implementation of national legislation. 
</p>
<p>9. In October 2010, the Special Rapporteur convened a consultation in Dakar on the 
role of regional and subregional mechanisms in international efforts to counter trafficking 
in persons, especially women and children. The participants of this meeting emphasized 
that a prerequisite to effective and wider cooperation was effective coordination at the 
national and regional levels through structures such as focal points, coordinators or 
rapporteurs. In February 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in a meeting of the 
informal network of European Union national rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms, 
organized by the European Commission and the European Union Anti-Trafficking 
Coordinator, at which the participants shared information on their work and activities and 
held discussions on the challenges of, and good practices for, implementing the existing 
national referral mechanisms; the advantages of having transnational referral mechanisms; 
and the issues of victim identification and safe return to prevent retrafficking. 
</p>
<p>10. As a follow-up to the discussions and initiatives mentioned above and in the 
framework of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur convened the consultative meeting in 
Berlin with the objective of promoting the exchange of information on current trends, good 
practices and lessons learned from the activities of various national rapporteurs and 
equivalent mechanisms; considering and discussing possible ways of promoting 
partnerships and cooperation between national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms 
from various regions of the world; and providing an opportunity for participants to meet 
one another and create and enhance networking opportunities between national rapporteurs 
and equivalent mechanisms from countries in different regions. 
</p>
<p>11. The expected outcome of the consultation was a set of recommendations, based on 
the observations and conclusions of the participants, for fostering cooperation and the 
sharing of expertise and good practices between national rapporteurs and equivalent 
mechanisms from different regions of the world. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Introduction 
</b>12. The consultation was opened by Otto Lampe, Deputy Director General for United 
Nations Affairs, Federal Foreign Office, Germany, and the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children. Mr. Lampe underlined the timely 
nature of the consultation and the long-standing commitment to the fight against human 
trafficking and the efforts made by Germany in this regard, at both the regional and 
international levels, including its role in initiating the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in 2004; its collaboration in the 
promotion of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking; and its active participation in the drafting of the Council of Europe Convention 
on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. The Special Rapporteur explained the 
objectives, structure and modalities of the consultation. 
13. The agenda of the consultative meeting was divided into five sessions, covering 
different aspects of strengthening the role of national rapporteurs on trafficking in persons </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>and equivalent mechanisms and the potential for cooperation and coordination between 
them and with other actors.3  
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of the discussions held during the consultative 
meeting 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The role of national rapporteurs on trafficking in persons and 
equivalent mechanisms in addressing trafficking in persons within the 
national institutional anti-trafficking framework: lessons learned, good 
practices and remaining challenges 
</b></p>
<p>14. At this session, presentations were made by national rapporteurs and representatives 
of equivalent mechanisms from several countries, including Belarus, the Netherlands, 
Nepal, Nigeria and Sweden on the roles and activities of their institutions. 
</p>
<p>15. With regard to the role and functions of national rapporteurs and equivalent 
mechanisms, a number of factors were cited that necessitated enhancing the effectiveness of 
national monitoring and evaluating mechanisms, such as the inadequate implementation of 
anti-trafficking legislation, the insidious nature of trafficking and its organization, the 
constant increase in the scale of trafficking, the lack of complete and objective data and 
information, the absence of data collection mechanisms in most countries, the inadequacy 
of national and international counter-trafficking measures and the insufficient funding 
available for anti-trafficking efforts. 
</p>
<p>16. It was noted that monitoring and reporting mechanisms were usually less developed 
and effective than coordinating mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>17. Although there is no unique model, speakers and participants noted that the key 
features of national rapporteur mechanisms should be independence and objectivity, being 
accessible to everyone and the ability to monitor all institutions and maintain a constant 
exchange with civil society and other relevant stakeholders. It was recommended that 
Member States should appoint such independent monitoring mechanisms to collect and 
analyse reliable data on trafficking in persons, monitor and evaluate national anti-
trafficking responses and legislation, identify gaps and make recommendations for 
improving anti-trafficking efforts. It was noted that national rapporteurs and equivalent 
mechanisms should have a clear legally-defined mandate to be able to conduct their 
activities in an independent and objective manner. 
</p><p>18. During the discussion, questions were raised as to what the core of the mandate of 
national rapporteurs should be and what the key advantages of being independent were. A 
variety of models of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms emerged and their 
possible advantages and disadvantages were discussed. It was proposed that the real 
functioning of national rapporteurs be looked at and existing advantages built upon, without 
losing sight of the objectives of having such mechanisms. A proposal was made to develop 
minimum standards on the roles and functions of the mechanisms and formulate a clear 
definition of the role and responsibilities of national rapporteurs and equivalent 
mechanisms in international law. Moreover, it was emphasized by some participants that 
the independence of national rapporteurs enabled them to evaluate objectively the 
implementation of anti-human trafficking legislation, strategies and activities, point out 
existing drawbacks and make comprehensive legal and policy recommendations. Their 
independence also increased the authority of, and gave credibility to, their activities.

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>19. It was also stressed that there was a need for a common framework for monitoring 
anti-trafficking actions, which required an agreement or consensus on the following 
questions:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; What, when and how to collect and evaluate data?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Should there be specific guidelines for national rapporteurs and equivalent 
mechanisms on how to operate?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; What would be the expected impact of the monitoring and reporting functions 
of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; What would be the objectives of recommendations made by national 
rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms? 
</p>
<p>20. The participants also highlighted the indirect role of monitoring and reporting 
mechanisms in raising public awareness, contributing to the prevention of trafficking and in 
policymaking. In source countries, trafficking was still seen by many potential victims as a 
means of seeking socioeconomic opportunity owing to increased demand for cheap labour 
in recipient countries and increasing poverty in source countries. It was recommended that 
advocacy be stepped up on preventing discrimination against women, which cannot be 
addressed merely by enacting laws. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Collection and analysis of information and data on trafficking  
in persons 
</b></p>
<p>21. At this session, representatives of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms 
from Argentina and Myanmar made presentations on the activities of the relevant national 
actors concerning the collection and analysis of information and data on trafficking in 
persons. 
</p>
<p>22. The absence of reliable data and data collection mechanisms was cited as one of the 
most pressing issues faced by national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms. In some 
countries, the police were the primary source of information. In this regard, participants 
discussed whether law enforcement agencies should be the only source of information. It 
was suggested that civil society organizations involved in the fight against trafficking and 
in victim assistance could also be an important source of information. 
</p>
<p>23. The representative of Argentina reported that her Government had created an 
integrated system of information relating to trafficking in persons, which included data on 
judicial cases, actions taken by the police, victims who had been rescued, perpetrators who 
had been identified and objects that had been seized. She noted that such a database 
allowed for, among other things, the identification of trends and patterns in trafficking, 
trafficking routes and locations and the sectors in which human trafficking mostly occurred. 
</p>
<p>24. In the case of Myanmar, a new software programme was installed in 2010, with the 
support of the United Nations Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking, into which the 
data on trafficking cases covering the period from January 2006 to the present had been 
entered. The database includes information such as the number of cases, the forms, patterns 
and routes of trafficking, the origins of the victims and the perpetrators and the modus 
operandi of the traffickers. The experience of Sweden was also mentioned, where the fact 
that the National Police Board had been appointed to act as the national rapporteur offered 
certain advantages in terms of data gathering by allowing the national rapporteur to monitor 
the situation of human trafficking closely, through regular updates from the national and 
regional police, the prosecution authorities and other actors. 
</p>
<p>25. Data collection and analysis and the dissemination of information are crucial for 
identifying victims and the modus operandi of traffickers. It was suggested that countries 
should use all possible sources of data and information. Some participants emphasized that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>the research into disaggregated data on human trafficking had helped in obtaining a useful 
insight into the factors that reinforced vulnerability to human trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Monitoring, evaluating and reporting on the implementation of  
anti-trafficking legislation and policies 
</b></p>
<p>26. Presentations were made by national rapporteurs and representatives of equivalent 
mechanisms from several countries, including Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Finland and the United 
States of America, as well as by the European Union Anti-Trafficking Coordinator. 
</p>
<p>27. There was general agreement among participants that monitoring, evaluating and 
reporting should be the main functions of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms. 
Some participants noted that the monitoring function should not focus solely on anti-
trafficking legislation and prosecution, but should also evaluate the effectiveness of 
prevention measures and the impact of regional and international anti-trafficking efforts. It 
should also assess the impact and adequacy of legal and policy measures on the human 
rights of victims, namely on their protection and on assistance, rehabilitation, reintegration 
and compensation for them. The participants also considered it important to evaluate the 
implementation of anti-human trafficking actions from a gender perspective. 
</p>
<p>28. Access to relevant information was cited as one of the most important enabling 
factors for monitoring and evaluating anti-trafficking actions and issuing evidence-based 
reports and recommendations. In this regard, it was suggested that national rapporteurs 
should be given a legal mandate to receive all the information they needed from the 
authorities, including classified information, and also from NGOs involved in activities 
against trafficking. 
</p>
<p>29. As the phenomenon of trafficking in persons is evolving rapidly, it was suggested 
that anti-trafficking legislation should be regularly assessed. For countries that have not 
established a national rapporteur or equivalent mechanism, or would not be able to establish 
one, it was suggested that they look at other institutions, such as national human rights 
institutions, which might be able carry out monitoring functions in relation to trafficking. 
</p>
<p>30. It was also argued that the national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms should 
not report only on trafficking in persons for sexual exploitation, as is the case in many 
countries, but should also cover forced marriage, forced labour and trafficking of people for 
the removal of organs. It was recommended that, in order to carry out their monitoring, 
evaluating and reporting functions effectively, national rapporteurs and equivalent 
mechanisms should be given full access to all relevant information, materials and data, 
including police investigations, statements of victims and witnesses and the findings of 
studies and data collection activities undertaken by other relevant institutions. 
</p>
<p>31. The importance of independent reporting has been emphasized as an essential 
element of the work of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms and of the regional 
monitoring mechanisms. In this context, it was suggested that reporting undertaken by  
national rapporteurs and equivalent and regional mechanisms should be complementary and 
consistent, and that skills and expertise in reporting should be shared and further developed. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Coordinating anti-trafficking responses and cooperation of national 
rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms with State and non-State 
actors, including civil society and the business community 
</b></p>
<p>32. During this session, presentations were made by the representatives of relevant anti-
trafficking coordinating bodies from Croatia, Germany, Israel and Uzbekistan. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 
</b></p>
<p>33. It was emphasized that anti-trafficking coordinating mechanisms constituted a solid 
basis for building on and implementing anti-trafficking policies. It was noted that 
coordination of anti-trafficking responses was imperative and that Governments placed a 
high priority on the establishment of coordinating mechanisms which were more 
widespread than monitoring mechanisms. It was recommended that coordination 
mechanisms be strong and accessible to non-State actors, including civil society 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>34. In practice, in many countries the coordination and monitoring roles are assigned to 
the same institution or authority. In this regard, participants noted that national rapporteurs 
and equivalent mechanisms should not be tasked with coordinating the implementation of 
anti-trafficking measures. Concern was expressed that when national coordinating 
mechanisms played the role of national rapporteurs, the independence of their monitoring 
and evaluating functions might be jeopardized. Another argument in favour of separating 
the coordinating and monitoring functions was that it would increase the effectiveness of 
the monitoring function. However, it was also noted that, especially in the case of small 
countries, it would be helpful if independent national coordinators also acted as an 
equivalent rapporteur mechanism. This was mainly because they were usually in a close 
working relationship at operational level with all the relevant actors working on the fight 
against trafficking, which made it easy for national coordinators to gather information about 
existing problems and the progress made. It was suggested, therefore, that in such cases 
national coordinators should be equipped with the relevant legal provisions, which would 
allow them to carry out both the monitoring and reporting functions. 
</p>
<p>35. It was noted by several participants that coordination mechanisms should be more 
neutral and able to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to human trafficking, for instance to 
avoid addressing issues related to trafficking by focusing exclusively on migration control 
policies when dealing with cases of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>36. With regard to cooperation with non-State actors, it was noted that civil society 
organizations could be an important source of data and information, particularly through 
exchanging hands-on knowledge and information on the complexity of trafficking 
situations and anti-trafficking efforts. The participants shared their experiences of 
cooperating with civil society organizations. In this context, different forms of State 
cooperation with civil society actors were mentioned, such as cooperation through a 
coalition of NGOs working in this field; establishing more formal cooperation agreements 
with civil society organizations; collaborating with, and providing State funding to, NGOs 
working on awareness-raising, training, victim rehabilitation and reintegration; setting up 
discussion forums to discuss issues relating to human trafficking with all the relevant 
actors, including civil society, to cross-check information and to deepen understanding of 
the current trends and manifestations of trafficking; and involving NGOs in the victim 
assistance and identification efforts of the relevant State bodies. 
</p>
<p>37. It was recommended that Governments should work more closely with civil society 
organizations involved in combating trafficking and in protection and assistance for 
victims, for instance through a coalition of NGOs following the same modalities as the 
existing system of cooperation. Given the low level of engagement with the business 
community, the participants recommended further exploration of the opportunities for 
engagement and collaboration with the business community, which could be an important 
partner in policy implementation and coordination. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
informed the participants about her work, including her report on the issue of trafficking in 
global supply chains. The Special Rapporteur also suggested that national rapporteurs and 
equivalent mechanisms should enhance their cooperation with research institutes and 
scholars, given the importance of independent research and studies. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> E. Fostering cooperation between national rapporteurs and equivalent 
mechanisms around the globe and partnerships and cooperation with 
international and regional organizations and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>38. During the session, presentations were made by the representatives of Belgium, the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the President of the Council of Europe Group of 
Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, the representative of the 
Commission of the Economic Community of West African States and the Special 
Representative and Coordinator for Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</p>
<p>39. The importance of promoting and strengthening cooperation between global, 
regional and national actors in establishing and consolidating national rapporteurs and 
equivalent mechanisms was highlighted by many participants. In particular, it was 
recommended that national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms should exchange 
information and expertise and assist each other on a regular basis in discussing possible 
solutions to remaining challenges at the national level. In this context, the representatives 
made a number of suggestions, such as establishing cooperation agreements and 
exchanging visits between national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms in different 
countries; organizing meetings through informal regional or global networks; and 
collaborating with other national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms and regional and 
international organizations through contributing to their reports and activities. Furthermore, 
capacity-building was cited as one of the most important areas in which the national 
rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms could cooperate. The informal network set up in 
2009 by the European Union, which meets twice a year and has developed its own 
cooperation strategy, was considered by the participants as a useful model that could be 
replicated in other regions. 
</p>
<p>40. The participants stated that, despite differing legal systems and institutional 
structures at the national level, there was a similarity of experience among the national 
rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms. They found global and regional exchanges 
extremely useful and expressed their readiness to work with the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur to continue such collaboration. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
also expressed its interest in being a partner in the organization of such meetings. 
</p>
<p>41. Participants also discussed the possibility of holding the second consultative meeting 
of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms either in Africa or Latin America. It was 
recommended that future consultative meetings address specific issues of common interest, 
for example how national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms and international and 
regional organizations could work together on improving reporting and data collection, or 
the implementation of the provision on the non-punishment of victims of trafficking for 
offences committed in the course of their trafficking. 
</p>
<p>42. In her closing remarks, the Special Rapporteur emphasized the usefulness and 
importance of such gatherings. While noting the existing political will to continue and 
enhance the cooperation between national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms and their 
regional and international mechanisms, she recommended that the next meeting should 
focus on a specific issue relating to the key activities of national rapporteurs and equivalent 
mechanisms. </p>
