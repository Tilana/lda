Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: UPL) today announced the pricing of its private placement
of $850.0
million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior unsecured notes due 2024 at 
par. The size of the offering was increased from the previously announced $700.0
million aggregate principal amount. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;). 
The
offering is expected to close into escrow on September&nbsp;18, 2014, subject to
customary closing conditions, and is subject to release from escrow upon the 
closing of Ultra&#146;s previously-announced Pinedale field acquisition. Ultra 
intends to
use the net proceeds of the offering to fund a portion of the purchase price of 
its recently announced Pinedale field acquisition. If the Pinedale field 
acquisition is not completed within sixty days of the issue date of the 
securities or the
purchase and sale agreement for the Pinedale field acquisition is terminated 
earlier, the company will be required to redeem all of the securities at a 
redemption price of 100% of the issue price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the redemption
date. The securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any 
state securities laws; and, unless so registered, the securities may not be 
offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in
a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any 
other applicable state securities laws. The securities may be resold by the
initial purchasers pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities 
Act. </P>
