</p>
<p>Austria welcomes the recommendations made in the course of its Universal Periodic 
Review on 26 January 2011. After broad consultations and careful evaluation of the 
recommendations, Austria is pleased to provide the following responses: 
</p>
<p><b>93.1 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights are being examined by Austria as 
a long-term project.  In doing so, further developments on the international 
and European levels, such as future experiences of the Council of Europe 
Member States with the European Social Charter collective complaints 
procedure and especially the position of other EU Member States, are being 
closely watched. 
</p>
<p><b>93.2 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.1. 
</p>
<p><b>93.3 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> The question of a withdrawal of reservations is being examined by Austria 
at regular intervals. In doing so, no gaps or shortcomings in legal protection 
have been identified so far.  The Austrian reservations serve to clarify the 
relationship of certain obligations according to international law to other 
international obligations in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p> With the exception of the prohibition of occupations hazardous to health, 
the withdrawal of which would represent a change for the worse in specific 
areas of the protection of safety and health at the workplace and is therefore 
not envisaged, all reservations with respect to the UN Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) 
have already been withdrawn. 
</p>
<p><b>93.4 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.3. 
</p>
<p><b>93.5 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.3. 
</p>
<p><b>93.6 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Austria accepts this recommendation assuming that it refers to the ILO 
recommendations on the application of Convention No. 111 on Non-
discrimination in Employment and Occupation according to paragraph 8 of 
the document &#8220;Compilation prepared by the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) of 
the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 &#8211; Austria&#8221; 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/AUT/2) of 11 November 2010. 
</p>
<p><b>93.7 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> The incorporation of a catalogue of social rights into the Federal 
Constitution has long been a matter of intensive constitutional debate in 
Austria which however has not yet finished. Though Austrian federal 
constitutional law indeed comprises only a limited number of explicit 
fundamental social rights, the Austrian legal system in general provides for 
a dense network of social rights. Moreover, in implementing European 
Union law Austria is bound to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, 
which explicitly provides for numerous social rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/8/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b>93.8 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>A long-term harmonisation of the protection level is intended. Equal 
treatment legislation is subject to continuous evaluation; with an 
amendment which entered into force on 1 March 2011, the remit of the 
Equal Treatment Commission, which is responsible for the private sector, 
was extended. A consolidation of all relevant regulations in one law and 
under one institution is, however, not possible, amongst others because of 
the requirement of differentiated provisions for certain groups and for 
reasons of the federal structure of the State.  In the framework of the 
European Union Austria supports an extension of anti-discrimination 
provisions. 
</p>
<p><b>93.9 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>A government bill on this matter was transmitted to Parliament. 
</p>
<p><b>93.10 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.8. 
</p>
<p><b>93.11 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.9. 
</p>
<p><b>93.12 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> See 93.3. Austria has not entered a reservation to article 18 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b>93.13 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Austria implements all its international legal obligations either through 
direct application of the international treaties or through corresponding 
laws. 
</p>
<p><b>93.14 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Besides the courts, which have the primary responsibility for human rights 
protection, the Austrian Ombudsman Board, whose independence is 
guaranteed by constitutional law, substantially contributes to the 
implementation and protection of human rights. It is intended to enlarge its 
mandate, extending it to the review of human rights violations in general. 
The Ombudsman Board will thus assume substantial responsibilities of a 
national human rights institution. In addition, further strengthening of court 
structures is planned, e.g. through the intended establishment of 
administrative courts of first instance. 
</p>
<p><b>93.15 </b>Austria <b>does not accept </b>the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> The specialisation of different Ombudsman institutions in Austria has 
proven effective. An application for re-accreditation of the Austrian 
Ombudsman Board is currently being examined by the ICC Sub-Committee 
on Accreditation. 
</p>
<p><b>93.16 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>93.17 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.14. 
</p>
<p><b>93.18 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/8/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.14. 
</p>
<p><b>93.19 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> For budgetary reasons, an increase in the resources of the Office of the 
Ombudsperson for Equal Treatment is currently not being considered. 
</p>
<p><b>93.20 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Separate national action plans on specific topics, as they currently exist in 
Austria, are more effective than a general action plan on human rights; 
drafting of such a plan is therefore currently not envisaged. A national 
action plan against racism is also not envisaged since Austria is already 
taking a number of concrete measures in this area which are inter alia 
provided for in the National Action Plan on Integration. 
</p>
<p><b>93.21 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.20. 
</p>
<p><b>93.22 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>93.23 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>93.24 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>93.25 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.9. 
</p>
<p><b>93.26 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>In the framework of legal provisions, steps to further strengthen social, 
economic and educational support to school children from immigrant 
minorities in Austria are continuously being taken. 
</p>
<p><b>93.27 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Austria continuously takes a series of measures to enhance awareness 
raising and education on the principles of non-discrimination and tolerance. 
The provision of (additional) education in the mother tongue is dependent 
on sufficient demand and in particular on existing personnel and budgetary 
resources. With regard to these circumstances, a considerable expansion of 
existing educational programmes is not envisaged for the time being. 
</p>
<p><b>93.28 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>93.29 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>Taking into account the freedom of each member of an autochthonous 
minority to declare his or her ethnicity, data are being comprehensively 
collected in Austria as far as this is useful to take targeted measures to 
improve the situation of the groups concerned and as far as it in accordance 
with data protection provisions. In doing so, international developments are 
being taken into account. 
</p>
<p><b>93.30 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Austria takes appropriate measures to counter discrimination against 
minority groups. In addition, see 93.29. 
</p>
<p><b>93.31 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/8/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p> Such a data collection only takes place in the context of law enforcement 
activities but not for the purpose of evaluating the situation of minorities. 
</p>
<p><b>93.32 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.9. 
</p>
<p><b>93.33 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Austria is committed to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals 
aimed at combating poverty, hunger and illness worldwide. Austria strives 
to reach the goal of 0.7% of GDP for ODA until 2015. In view of the 
necessary austerity policy the required financial means can however not be 
made available to an appropriate extent in the budgetary years 2011 to 
</p><p>2014. The necessary financial steps to attain the United Nations 
development goals will be taken in the future within the scope of budgetary 
possibilities. 
</p>
<p><b>93.34 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> The recommendation is being accepted with the understanding that the 
question of a withdrawal of reservations is being examined by Austria at 
regular intervals. In addition, see 93.3 and 93.13. 
</p>
<p><b>93.35 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation.

</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.8. 
</p>
<p><b>93.39 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Austria is continuously striving to further implement measures for the 
equality of women and men on the labour market. It is noted that the 55 
measures are proposals presented by the Federal Minister for Women&#8217;s 
Affairs and Public Service to the Federal Government.

<p><b>93.43 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>The Federal Act on Public Funding for Political Education &#8211; Publicity 
Funding Act 1984 provides for the funding of civic education performed by 
political parties. Envisaged amendments should provide for the possibility 
of reducing funds under certain circumstances, in which the recipient has </p>

<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>committed an act punishable by criminal law such as religious vilification, 
defamation and incitement to hatred. 
</p>
<p><b>93.44 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>See 93.8. 
</p>
<p><b>93.45 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Detention practices are continuously being evaluated, with data being 
collected and disaggregated inter alia on the origin of defendants. In 
addition, appropriate training arrangements for judges and prosecutors as 
well as in the area of prison administration are provided to prevent direct or 
indirect discrimination. Therefore a study concerning this matter would not 
bring any additional value. 
</p>
<p><b>93.46 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> In Austria, children under 14 are never placed under detention. Children of 
14 years and older can only be placed under detention under strict 
preconditions. 
</p>
<p><b>93.47 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> The option of performing the military service starting at the age of 17 is 
based solely on the voluntary enlistment of the person concerned and 
requires the consent of his legal guardian. Neither the direct participation in 
combat nor the voluntary enlistment for military service in international 
operations is admissible. Under these provisions, full respect of the entire 
Convention on the Rights of the Child including its Optional Protocol is 
guaranteed. 
</p>
<p><b>93.48 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Austria complies with this recommendation in the framework of Directive 
2008/115/EG of the European Parliament and of the Council on common 
standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying 
third-country nationals (article 13 para 3 and 4). Austria intends to extend 
its system of stand-by legal counselling service (Rechtsanwaltlicher 
Journaldienst) for criminal proceedings in accordance with developments 
on the European level, in particular in the context of the expected proposal 
for a directive on legal aid. 
</p>
<p><b>93.49 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>A case is currently pending before the European Court of Human Rights on 
this matter, the outcome of which will have to be taken into account. 
</p>
<p><b>93.50 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>In accordance with the Minority Language School Law for the Federal 
Province of Burgenland, language courses in Burgenland Romani are 
offered in the Burgenland school system. Outside of Burgenland, 
(additional) mother tongue education is also offered in different Romani 
variants and depending on demand and resources. Moreover, NGO projects 
for additional out-of-school learning assistance as well as language and 
cultural projects are continuously being sponsored. An extension of these 
offers, in particular also in the direction of a bilingual school system is 
currently not planned. 
</p>
<p><b>93.51 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/8/Add.1

<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p> Austria complies with this recommendation in the framework of Council 
Directive 2005/85/EC on minimum standards on procedures in Member 
States for granting and withdrawing refugee status as well as Directive 
2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on common 
standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying 
third-country nationals (article 13 para 3 and 4). 
</p>
<p><b>93.52 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> The Austrian legal system provides for police custody to secure transfer 
abroad. In the framework of detention pending repatriation, increased use 
of open models is being extended. Special consideration for minors and 
victims of human trafficking is guaranteed by law. 
</p>
<p><b>93.53 </b>Austria <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> During the last few years, financial support for intercultural projects of the 
six autochthonous minorities was increased, supporting amongst others also 
projects of the Slovenian minority. For budgetary reasons, further 
expansion of the support is currently not possible. 
</p>
<p><b>93.54 </b>Austria <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> The financing of the Slovenian-language music school in the province of 
Carinthia is being secured by the Federal Government and the Federal 
Province of Carinthia. Additionally, a systemic solution for future financing 
and concerning organisational structures is intended.
