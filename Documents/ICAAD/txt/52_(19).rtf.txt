Issue 

11.     
Whether there is no case to answer for accused person?

Law/Analysis

12.     
Section 178 of the Criminal Procedure Decree states that "if at the close of the evidence in support of the charge it appears to the court that a case is not made out against the accused person sufficiently to require him or her to make a defence, the court shall dismiss the case and shall acquit the accused."

13.     
In the case of State v Mahend Prasad HAA 019 of 2008, at paragraph 17, the Court had this to say when dealing with the issue of case to answer "&The test to be applied in the Magistrates Court, was explained in Abdul Ghani Sahib v The State [2005] FJHC 95; HAA 0022 of 2005; 28 April 2005, as:

'In the Magistrates Court, both tests apply. So the Magistrate must ask himself firstly whether there is relevant and admissible evidence implicating the accused in respect of each element of the offence, and second whether the prosecution evidence, taken at it's highest, a reasonable tribunal could convict. In considering the prosecution at its highest, a reasonable tribunal could convict. In considering the prosecution case, taken at its highest, there can be no doubt at all that where the evidence is entirely discredited, from no matter which angle one looks at it, a court can uphold a submission on no case. However, where a possible view of the evidence might lead the court to convict, the case should proceed to the defence case.' 

14.     
I also bear in mind the principles established in the common law case of Galbraith (1981) 2 All ER 1060 with regard to the two pronged test applicable in the Magistrates Court i.e.

"        
Whether there was no evidence in respect of each element of the offence;
"        
Whether the evidence was of such a tenuous nature that a jury properly directed could not convict on it.

15.     
When considering the elements of the offence charged they are as follows:

i.      
The accused (Arun Kumar);
ii.     
Was unlawfully cultivating;
iii.    
Cannabis Sativa or Indian Hemp;
iv.     
An illicit drug.

16.     
When considering the evidence there is no dispute that accused is a farmer and resides at Yasiyasi Tavua. There is no dispute that some plants believed to be illicit drugs were planted in accused garden at Yasiyasi Tavua and were uprooted and seized by police. Pot plants containing plants believed to be illicit drugs were seized from accused garden too. The plants growing from the soil and those growing from the pot plants were taken to Tavua Police Station before it was sent over to Koronivia for analysis. The said plants, pot plants and reports were then returned to Tavua Police Station after tests. 

17.     
According to the evidence so far 11 plants were uprooted from accused farm. The number of pot plants seized from accused farm cannot be confirmed by witnesses. It is further undisputed that only 4 plants were produced or exhibited. The remaining 7 plants including the pot plants were not exhibited.

18.     
Notwithstanding the chain of custody as to the alleged exhibits, the issue to resolve is whether there is relevant and admissible evidence establishing that the alleged plants are cannabis sativa an illicit drug.

19.     
On that note it is apparent that no analyst report was adduced as evidence to establish prima facie that the alleged plants seized from accused garden were cannabis sativa an illicit drug according to the Act.

20.     
Further in the absence of any government analyst report it cannot be said that accused was unlawfully cultivating an illicit drug in his garden.

21.     
When assessing the evidence objectively there is a break in the chain of custody of the alleged plants. I say that because PC Kamenieli was not called to testify as he was mentioned as having received the alleged plants at various stages of the investigative process. Also the exhibits according to PC Nasova were handed over to one Wise at Koronivia. This person named Wise was not called to give evidence. I further note that 4 cut plants were tendered as exhibits when evidence shows that 11 plants were uprooted from the garden. Not to mention the number of plants adduced as evidence, no one knows as to how the 4 plants were cut. Moreover no pot plants were adduced as exhibits. All these evidence taken together goes to show that the plants were highly likely to be tampered with and whether they are the same plants seized from accused garden as alleged is highly questionable. 

22.     
At a no case to answer stage I bear in mind that the duty of the court is to assess the evidence using the objective as opposed to the subjective test. That means that witness credibility, reliability and weight to be placed on material evidence is not a matter to be considered at this stage. The court will only consider these matters once all the evidence, both for prosecution and the defence are adduced before the court.

23.     
That being the position, when considering the evidence of prosecution at its highest, the Court is of the opinion that on the evidence so far adduced, a reasonable tribunal could not convict.

Conclusion

24.     
On the basis of the evidence so far adduced by prosecution, the court finds that there is no case to answer for the accused.

25.     
Therefore accused should not be put to his defence.

26.     
Accused is acquitted and to be set at liberty forthwith.
