Forward looking statements
 These  materials  prepared  by  Evolution  Mining  Limited  (or  “the  Company”)  include  forward  looking  statements.  Often,  but  not  always,  forward 
looking  statements  can  generally  be  identified  by  the  use  of  forward  looking  words  such  as  “may”,  “will”,  “expect”,  “intend”,  “plan”,  “estimate”, 
“anticipate”,  “continue”,  and  “guidance”,  or  other  similar  words  and  may  include,  without  limitation,  statements  regarding  plans,  strategies  and 
objectives of management, anticipated production or construction commencement dates and expected costs or production outputs.
 Forward  looking  statements  inherently  involve  known  and  unknown  risks,  uncertainties  and  other  factors  that  may  cause  the  Company’s  actual 
results, performance and achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements. Relevant factors may include, 
but are not limited to, changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange fluctuations and general economic conditions, increased costs and demand 
for  production  inputs,  the  speculative  nature  of  exploration  and  project  development,  including  the  risks  of  obtaining  necessary  licenses  and 
permits and diminishing quantities or grades of reserves, political and social risks, changes to the regulatory framework within which the Company 
operates  or  may  in  the  future  operate,  environmental  conditions  including  extreme  weather  conditions,  recruitment  and  retention  of  personnel, 
industrial relations issues and litigation.
 Forward looking statements are based on the Company and its management’s good faith assumptions relating to the financial, market, regulatory 
and other relevant environments that will exist and affect the Company’s business and operations in the future.  The Company does not give any 
assurance  that  the  assumptions  on  which  forward  looking  statements  are  based  will  prove  to  be  correct,  or  that  the  Company’s  business  or 
operations will not be affected in any material manner by these or other factors not foreseen or foreseeable by the Company or management or 
beyond the Company’s control.
 Although the Company attempts and has attempted to identify factors that would  cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from 
those disclosed in forward looking statements, there may be other factors that could cause actual results, performance, achievements or events 
not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended, and many events are beyond the reasonable control of the Company.  Accordingly, readers are 
cautioned  not  to  place  undue  reliance  on  forward  looking  statements.    Forward  looking  statements  in  these  materials  speak  only  at  the  date  of 
issue.  Subject  to  any  continuing  obligations  under  applicable  law  or  any  relevant  stock  exchange  listing  rules,  in  providing  this  information  the 
Company  does  not  undertake  any  obligation  to  publicly  update  or  revise  any  of  the  forward  looking  statements  or  to  advise  of  any  change  in 
events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

Competent Persons Statement
The  estimated  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore  Reserves  underpinning  the  production  target  have  been  prepared  by  Competent  Persons  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  in  Appendix  5A 
(JORC  Code).  The  Company  confirms  that  the  form  and  context  in  which  the  Competent  Persons  findings  are  presented  have  not  been  materially  modified  from  the  original  market 
announcement
Cautionary statement concerning the proportion of Inferred Mineral Resources
There  is  a  low  level  of  geological  confidence  associated  with  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  and  there  is  no  certainty  that  further  exploration  work  will  result in  the  determination  of  Indicated 
Mineral Resources or that the production target itself will be realised
Cautionary statement concerning the proportion of Exploration Target
The Company believes there are reasonable grounds for reporting a proportion of the production target as an exploration target (Cracow) as historically unclassified material at Cracow has 
been converted and mined and is not formally reported in the annual Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves
The potential quantity and  grade of an exploration target is conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to determine a Mineral Resource and there is no certainty that 
further exploration work will result in the determination of Mineral Resources or that the production target itself will be realised
Relevant proportions of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves underpinning the production target
The production target comprises 86% Probable Ore Reserves, 12% Inferred Mineral Resources and 2% Exploration Targets

Sportspeople, entrepreneurs and leaders are all lauded for their actions.
‘Watching and waiting’ are rarely considered valuable. However, there are times
when the most valuable thing you can do is to wait for the right opportunity. In the
face of the relentless pressure to do something, waiting patiently is often
extremely difficult to do.

Mungari Regional Mineral Resources: Evolution has updated Castle Hill Stage 1 only. Norton Gold  has the right  to mine Castle Hill Stage 1 and Evolution to receive 50% of the profits. Full details of the Phoenix Gold Limited Mineral Resources that have not materially changed since last reported and now included 
at Mungari Regional are provided in the report entitled “Phoenix’s Mineral Resources grow beyond 4 million ounces” released to ASX on 14 January 2015, and “Further information on updated total Resource” released on 19 January 2015 by Phoenix Gold Limited (“Phoenix”) and are available to view on 
www.evolutionmining.com.au. The Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in this presentation and that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates continue to apply and have not materially changed.

Data is reported to significant figures to reflect appropriate precision and may not sum precisely due to rounding 
Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Ore Reserves   
1Includes stockpiles      + Twin Hills has not changed as it is being reported as 2004 JORC Code  
Due to depletion of A39 at Mt Carlton and lower grade Ag, Cu for remaining resource at Mt Carlton, the 2015 Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves statement has been reported in gold ounces
