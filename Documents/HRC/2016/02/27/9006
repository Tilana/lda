<p><b> VI.  UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW 
</b></p>
<p>217. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251, Council resolution 5/1 and the 
President&#8217;s statements on modalities and practices for the universal periodic review process 
(A/HRC/PRST/8/1 and A/HRC/PRST/9/2), the Council considered the outcome of the reviews 
conducted during the third session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review held 
from 1 to 15 December 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Consideration of the universal periodic review outcomes 
</b></p>
<p>218. According to paragraph 4.3 of the President&#8217;s statement 8/1, the following section contains 
a summary of the views expressed on the outcome by States under review, Member and 
Observer States of the Council, as well as general comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary. 
</p>
<p><b>Botswana 
</b></p>
<p>219. The review of Botswana was held on 1 December 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Botswana in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BWA/1); the compilation prepared by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BWA/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BWA/3). 
</p>
<p>220. At its 27th meeting, on 18 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Botswana (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>221. The outcome of the review on Botswana is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/69), together with the views of Botswana 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/10/69/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions 
as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>222. Botswana stated that it approached the review process with an open and transparent spirit 
and that it undertook to consider all the recommendations put to them at a later stage with a view 
to carefully and constructively reflect on all of them. To this end, Botswana was able to engage 
all relevant stakeholders. Botswana noted the circulation of the detailed responses during the 
meeting. It noted that most of the recommendations were currently being implemented by the 
Government and that the acceptance to some of these recommendations was on this basis.  
</p>
<p>223. The Delegation informed that consultations for the establishment of an independent 
national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles have been concluded 
and that the relevant recommendations will be submitted to Cabinet for consideration. In </p>

 <p> 
addition, Botswana noted that, as previously mentioned, it currently has several institutions that 
directly address human rights issues, including the Department of Social Services for Children&#8217;s 
Welfare; the Department of Women Affairs for Gender issues and the Independent Electoral 
Commission for Universal Suffrage.  
</p>
<p>224. Botswana confirmed that the Children&#8217;s Act is still under review and in its final stages 
before Parliament. The Delegation noted that corporal punishment is still lawful and that the 
Customary Courts, the Penal Code and the Education Act and Regulations govern its 
administration and contains restrictions on its application. It indicated that corporal punishment 
is not intended to be degrading but is viewed as a legitimate and acceptable form of punishment.  
</p>
<p>225. The Delegation noted that all indigenous groups in Botswana are accorded opportunities 
guaranteed to every Motswana.  
</p>
<p>226. As regards to the recommendations to adopt measures to address all forms of 
discrimination, including based on  sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, colour, and political 
opinion, Botswana indicated that the Government maintains that Section 15 (3) of the 
Constitution of Botswana prohibits discrimination against any person on the grounds of race, 
tribe, place of origin, political opinions, colour, creed or sex, and as such any person who is of 
the view that their rights have been violated can at anytime seek redress before the High Court of 
Botswana. While it acknowledged that Botswana criminalises same sex sexual activity and 
practices, a reflection of the moral and religious norms of the society, it noted that there is no 
known case of discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>227. Botswana emphasized that since its ratification of CEDAW, it has undertaken various 
initiatives with a view to promoting and protecting the rights of women. It has continued to 
undertake progressive legislative reforms to this end, including the enactment of the Domestic 
Violence Act and the Abolition of Marital Powers Act. The Government continues to educate 
Batswana through seminars and meetings with stakeholders, including Kgotla meetings, 
publications and media. 
</p>
<p>228. Botswana drew the Human Rights Council&#8217;s attention to the fact that the Marriage Act 
forbids marriage of persons under the age of 18 years without the consent of the parents or 
guardians. The Delegation noted that Botswana does not accept the recommendations implying 
the existence of harmful practices to women, especially alleging the persistence of early contract 
marriages and the existence of polygamy. It indicated that there are no practices which are 
harmful to women and that the law in Botswana forbids polygamy. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the Council 
on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>229. Algeria thanked the delegation of Botswana for the comments and complete replies to the 
recommendations made during the Working Group.  Algeria was encouraged by Botswana&#8217;s 
determination to comply with its human rights obligations, despite the challenges it faced 
notably in terms of development.  Algeria noted that the number of recommendations accepted 
by the country was an excellent example.  Algeria shared and understood Botswana&#8217;s concern 
regarding the need to have necessary resources to meet the obligations under the international 
instruments.  Algeria noted this was a decisive element in the decision by a sovereign </p>

 <p> 
government to accede to an international instrument.  Algeria praised Botswana&#8217;s efforts to 
extend the benefits of its pilot project to fight against HIV/AIDS to refugees and migrants as 
well as the efforts aimed at reinforcing actions for women.  Algeria welcomed the decision to 
accept the recommendations made by Algeria in this respect. Algeria stated that the international 
community had a responsibility to provide support to Botswana through provision of sustainable, 
appropriate technical and financial assistance on the basis of the needs expressed by Botswana, 
with a view to enabling Botswana to fulfil its human rights commitments and to improve its 
performance in seeking to achieve this objective in line with its national priorities. 
</p>
<p>230. Senegal thanked the Head of the delegation for his clear and detailed presentation on his 
country&#8217;s position on the recommendations formulated during the interactive dialogue. Senegal 
welcomed the fact that Botswana has accepted most of the recommendations and encouraged 
Botswana to put them into practice in order to make the progress already achieved irreversible. 
Senegal invited Botswana to pay particular attention to issues relating to the rights of the child 
and of women as well as to those concerning the eradication of poverty and the promotion of 
education and health. Senegal wished the authorities of Botswana every success in their efforts to 
ensure the continuing improvement of the human rights situation in their country.  
</p>
<p>231. The United States commended Botswana for its commitment to democratic principles and 
appreciated its leadership in promoting similar progress in the Southern African Development 
Community region and the continent as a whole. The United States recognized Botswana&#8217;s 
investment in improving health care, access to primary education and the increased enrolment 
rates for children, particularly for girls.  It also praised women&#8217;s role in government and society, 
and welcomed the implementation of the new domestic violence law, noting that increasing the 
access of women to development assistance and provision of better legal protections for women, 
including for rape, would help consolidate the gains for women.  It also noted the recent opening 
of dialogue with the San, expressing hope that further discussions with the San and other 
minority groups be made in order to better address land, education and development assistance 
issues. The United States further commended Botswana for its intent to improve the national 
capacity to promote and monitor human rights, including efforts to address judicial delays. The 
United States stated that it supported Botswana&#8217;s efforts to promote professionalization and 
human rights training for its security forces and the seeking of assistance in this area. 
</p>
<p>232. Djibouti noted that, like all other countries in the sub-region, Botswana faced enormous 
difficulties in effectively implementing its policy to eradicate poverty. Noting that Botswana had 
been severely affected by HIV/AIDS in the past years, Djibouti praised the Government for 
setting up a policy to monitor HIV/AIDS, and indicated that this should be shared with other 
countries affected by this pandemic. Djibouti expressed the view that the recommendations 
emanating from the UPR would help improve the general human rights situation in the country. 
However, the implementation of these recommendations would require an internal and external 
symbiosis to meet the challenges faced by Botswana. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>233. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network commended the delegation for its acceptance of 
Recommendation 24 dealing with measures to address HIV/AIDS but expressed its 
disappointment at the rejection of Recommendations 18 and 23 dealing with non-discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and the decriminalization of same-sex activity. It urged the </p>

 <p> 
Government to consider repealing the provisions of its Penal Code which criminalise same-sex 
conduct between consenting adults. It was noted that the United Nations Human Rights 
Committee had found that such provisions violated established international human rights law, in 
particular the rights to non-discrimination and privacy. Noting the comments made by the 
delegation that there was no known case of discrimination on those grounds, he referred to the 
Human Rights Committee which had found that even when the laws are not actively enforced 
they stigmatise and marginalise vulnerable groups within society. The struggle against 
HIV/AIDS was also undermined by such provisions. The United Nations Human Rights 
Committee and UNAIDS had repeatedly emphasised that they run counter to efforts to address 
HIV and AIDS by driving marginalized communities underground. Last December sixty-six 
States from all regional groups, including 6 from the African region called for an end to laws 
criminalizing homosexuality. This call was supported by the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights who stated that &#8220;No human being, simply because of their perceived sexual orientation or 
gender identity, may be subject to discrimination, violence, criminal sanctions or abuse&#8221;. 
Appreciation was expressed over the statement of the Government that no people should be 
subject to discrimination and its expressed willingness to remain open on these grounds.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>234. In conclusion Botswana expressed its appreciation for the constructive dialogue and 
interaction with all delegations that took the floor, including members of the non-governmental 
organizations. Botswana indicated that it appreciated the suggestions made in December 2008 
and at the present meeting, while noting the short, medium and long-term implications of 
implementing the recommendations. Noting the challenges Botswana will face in terms of 
financial and human resources, it expressed its views that with the support of the international 
community Botswana would succeed. 
</p>
<p>235. Botswana thanked the President of the Human Rights Council for his professionalism and 
for the able manner in which the review was conducted, as well as the members of the Troika 
and the Secretariat. It indicated that it looked forward to the implementation and follow-up 
phase.  
</p>
<p><b>The Bahamas 
</b></p>
<p>236. The review of the Bahamas was held on 1 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by the Bahamas in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BHS/1); the compilation prepared by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BHS/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BHS/3). 
</p>
<p>237. At its 27th meeting, on 18 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on the Bahamas (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>238. The outcome of the universal periodic review on the Bahamas is constituted of the report 
of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/70 and 
A/HRC/10/70/Corr.1), together with the views of the Bahamas concerning the recommendations </p>

 <p> 
and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies presented before the 
adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed 
during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also A/HRC/10/70/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>239. H.E. Joshua Sears, Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas, 
stated that the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, when it joined the international community some 
thirty-five years ago, had given its solemn undertaking to respect sovereignty and territorial 
integrity, human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. The delegation noted that 
the Bahamas has at every important moment of international significance reaffirmed its 
commitment to these principles; principles and values which have played an indispensable role 
in the institutionalization and consolidation of democracy, political stability and economic and 
social progress and development of the Bahamas. 
</p>
<p>240. The delegation stated that the Bahamas, the second oldest parliamentary democracy in the 
western hemisphere, has a well-established record of democracy, respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. The Government fully understands and appreciates 
that respect for and the promotion and protection of human rights requires eternal vigilance and 
actions to ensure that these rights are effectively enjoyed by all members of society. The 
Bahamas also acknowledged the vital role civil society must play in this whole process. 
</p>
<p>241. During the UPR review of the Bahamas, which took place at the third working session of 
the Working Group in December 2008, the Bahamas had committed to further review the 
recommendations contained in the report of the Working Group, in document A/HRC/10/70, and 
to report on the status of the recommendations at the plenary session of the Human Rights 
Council. The delegation drew the Council&#8217;s attention to the document which had been submitted 
by the Bahamas as a formal follow-up report (A/HRC/10/70/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>242. The delegation informed that since its review in December 2008, the Bahamas had signed 
and ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (4 December 
2008) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (23 December 2008). Both 
Covenants will enter into force for the Bahamas on 23 March 2009. In addition, the Bahamas 
had on 16 December 2008 signed the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and Punishment. The Bahamas intends to ratify this 
Convention following the necessary review of the legislative requirements.  
</p>
<p>243. The Bahamas also highlighted the Police Amendment Act 2009 which permits civilian 
oversight of the complaints process. 
</p>
<p>244. With respect to the Carmichael Road Detention Centre, the delegation informed that the 
Government continued to implement recommendations designed to enhance the environment and 
management of the facility and continued to maintain close collaboration and cooperation with 
UNHCR in this regard.  
</p>
<p>245. The delegation indicated that during the review, the Bahamas expected to submit 
outstanding reports due under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial </p>

 <p> 
Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women by 31 December 2008. It informed that the Bahamas was unfortunately unable to meet 
this self-imposed deadline, but that the consultative process is almost complete, paving the way 
for the submission of these reports in due course.  The delegation also informed that the 
preparatory process is also underway for the report due under the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. 
</p>
<p>246. The delegation reaffirmed the commitment of the Bahamas to continue to work with the 
human rights treaty bodies and the Human Rights Council to ensure that there is constructive 
dialogue and to enhance the capacity of the Bahamas to carry out its reporting obligations under 
international human rights instruments. The delegation emphasized the recognition of the 
Bahamas that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms requires 
constant action on the part of Government and civil society and that the Bahamas is committed 
to this task. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>247. Egypt welcomed the presence of the delegation of the Bahamas, which was a testimony of 
the Bahamas commitment for the protection and promotion of human rights. On behalf of the 
African group, Egypt expressed the importance the African Group is always attaching to the 
relations with the Bahamas and CARICOM at large. Egypt stressed that the fact that the 
Bahamas came to Geneva twice (first to present its UPR report and then to attend the adoption of 
the report), show that the Government was seriously committed to the issue of human rights and 
that something serious has to be done to assist countries that are not represented in Geneva in 
following the work in the council. Egypt further expressed, on behalf of the African group, its 
outmost support to the choices that the Bahamas has been making in regard to human rights and 
regarding the recommendations that the Bahamas has accepted the African group acknowledged 
the Bahamas sovereign right to follow the path convenient to its own society and its own values.  
</p>
<p>248. Cuba expressed its appreciation for the presence of the director general of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas, and endorsed the statement of Egypt. The Bahamas,  a small 
country of the Caribbean and a member of the non aligned group, enjoys friendly relations with 
Cuba, and is facing a serious economic situation because of, inter alia, lack of resources. Cuba 
acknowledged the Bahamas&#8217; efforts and achievements. Cuba thanked the delegation of the 
Bahamas for its presence, expressed its support and urged the Bahamas to carry on all necessary 
measures to protect all human rights of its people. 
</p>
<p>249. France welcomed the announcement by the Bahamas to bring national legislation in line 
with major international human rights instruments, the efforts in this regard and the reference to 
the police and detention centres. France encouraged the government of the Bahamas regarding 
the action to be taken on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. France congratulated the Government of the Bahamas on its approach and on the fact 
that it has committed to accept the recommendations made by the UPR Working Group.  
</p>
<p>250. On behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean states, Chile welcomed the presence of the 
delegation of the Bahamas and thanked it for the information on the efforts underway to comply </p>

 <p> 
with the recommendations made in the UPR Working Group. Chile also thanked the Bahamas 
for its presence which was the illustration of the Bahamas&#8217; firm commitment to the promotion 
and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>251. Barbados welcomed the delegation of the Bahamas, which came to Geneva to present its 
response to the recommendations made in UPR Working Group. Barbados stated that in doing 
so, the Bahamas demonstrated its firm commitment to the protection of human rights, and 
towards an acceptance and consideration of a number of recommendations made. Barbados 
urged the international community to recognize, and ensure full support to small developing 
states like the Bahamas and to assist them in their efforts towards implementation of their 
obligations. Finally, Barbados conveyed the Bahamas its full support and wished it every success 
in its continuing human rights achievements.  
</p>
<p>252. Algeria warmly welcomed the delegation of the Bahamas and was encouraged by the 
resolve shown by the Government of the Bahamas to meet its human rights commitments, 
despite the challenges the country is facing particularly in the field of development. It noted that 
the international community had the duty to support the Bahamas and to provide financial and 
technical assistance, sustainable and appropriate to the needs of the country. 
</p>
<p>253. Pakistan stated that the Bahamas should be encouraged in its efforts to comply with its 
human rights obligations in a comprehensive manner and was glad that the Bahamas has 
accepted a number of recommendations made during its review. Pakistan believed that all 
stakeholders should make their technical expertise and other resources available to deepen 
cooperation with small developing states on improvement and protection of their human rights. 
Pakistan stated that it will continue to deepen its bilateral cooperation with the Bahamas to 
explore possibilities of exchanging technical expertise and knowledge concerning human rights. 
</p>
<p>254. Botswana congratulated the delegation of the Bahamas for the comprehensive presentation 
providing additional information on the outcome of the review on the country&#8217;s human rights 
situation. Botswana noted with satisfaction and admiration the fact that most of the 
recommendations to the Bahamas were accepted. The commitment to the continued promotion 
and protection of human rights was clear from the open and inclusive preparation of the review, 
and from the interactive dialogue in December. Botswana welcomed the involvement of the civil 
society in the follow-up. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>255. Amnesty International (AI) welcomed the Bahamas&#8217; prompt ratification of the two 
Covenants following the announcement in the UPR Working Group of its intention to do so. AI 
was disappointed that the Bahamas rejected recommendations relating to the death penalty, 
including the establishment of a moratorium on executions, the ratification of the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights. AI reiterated its call 
to the Bahamas to repeal all provisions allowing for the death penalty and to declare a 
moratorium on executions. AI welcomed the endorsement by the Bahamas of recommendations 
to ensure full and effective implementation of the Domestic Violence (Protection Order) Act and 
to address the problem of rape. AI remained concerned that recommendations to criminalize 
marital rape were rejected. AI urged the Bahamas to act swiftly and conduct an independent </p>

 <p> 
investigation into recent allegations of ill-treatment as recent reports indicate that abuses 
continue to take place at the Carmichael Road detention Centre. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>256. The delegation of the Bahamas thanked the delegations for their constructive comments 
and was pleased by the level of support from the international community. It particularly 
commended the members of the troika -Djibouti, Malaysia and the Netherlands- for their support 
during the review process.  
</p>
<p>257. With the respect to the issue of the Carmichael Road detention Centre, the delegation said 
that the addendum to the report addressed a number of issues raised by the Amnesty 
International as well as by other delegations. 
</p>
<p>258. The delegation reaffirmed its commitment to implement its human rights obligations and to 
continue to work closely with the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Burundi 
</b></p>
<p>259. The review of Burundi was held on 2 December 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Burundi in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BDI/1); the compilation prepared by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BDI/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BDI/3). 
</p>
<p>260. At its 27th meeting, on 18 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Burundi (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>261. The outcome of the review on Burundi is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/71), together with the views of Burundi 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>262. Ms. Rose Nduwayo, Minister for Human Rights and Gender, provided replies to various 
issues raised during the review of Burundi. She indicated that Burundi seriously envisaged the 
ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearances while, in the meantime, all measures had been taken to prevent and punish 
related crimes. Regarding the protection of discrimination based on sexual orientation, the 
amendment proposed by the Lower Chamber of the Parliament on this issue was rejected by the 
Higher Chamber and a mixed commission will be set up in order to determine the final position 
to be adopted. With regard to the training of law enforcement officers on sexual violence, she 
indicated that an ongoing education programme was underway and carried out by the state and 
civil society. In that regard the new draft penal code criminalises sexual violence. The </p>

 <p> 
transitional justice mechanism composed of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a 
Special Tribunal was agreed upon between the Government and the United Nations. The national 
consultations, which are a prerequisite to these mechanisms are ongoing and will be soon 
concluded. 
</p>
<p>263. The delegation of Burundi further stressed that replies to issues contained in paragraph 81 
(1), (3), (6), (8) and (10) of the report of the Working Group were already included in paragraphs 
80, 82 and 83 of this report. During the review, in relation to paragraph 81 (1), Burundi had 
indicated that the new draft penal code, which shall soon be promulgated, abolishes the death 
penalty as foreseen in the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. Regarding paragraph 81 (3) and discrimination between boys and girls in 
accessing education, Burundi recalled that such discrimination had been eliminated and that a 
cultural education programme was underway in order to eliminate any remaining parental 
reticence. Referring to paragraphs 81 (6) and 81 (8), Burundi indicated that acts of torture, as 
well as rape, were criminalised in the new draft penal code. Finally, in relation to paragraph 81 
(10), it was indicated previously that the Ministerial Order of 6 October 2008 restricting public 
meetings had been revoked. 
</p>
<p>264. The delegation also presented new developments in Burundi since December 2008. The 
new draft penal code, which criminalizes war crimes, crimes against humanity and crime of 
genocide, torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, rape and sexual violence and 
which guarantees various children&#8217;s rights had been recently adopted by the Parliament. The 
network of criminals who killed Albino people was being dismantled as seven persons had been 
arrested and two others sentenced. 
</p>
<p>265. A national strategy to fight against sexual violence had just been adopted by the 
Government, which will, among others, provide for a harmonised mechanism to collect data and 
establish financial resources dedicated to fight this type of violence. 
</p>
<p>266. Regarding the establishment of a national human rights commission in line with the Paris 
Principles, there was a growing public opinion in favour of the Government commitment in that 
respect. 
</p>
<p>267. The delegation stressed that new civil and political associations had been created, and that 
the judiciary was protecting civil and political freedoms, as demonstrated by the recent release of 
some prisoners. A National Independent Electoral Commission was recently set up, with the 
support of all political partners and civil society, which is a guarantee to free and democratic 
elections in 2010. One should underline that the President and Vice-President of this commission 
are representatives of the civil society. 
</p>
<p>268. Finally, Burundi was recently granted an external debt relief, a measure which will 
contribute to raise its resources to protect and guarantee human rights, in particular, economic, 
social and cultural rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>269. Algeria thanked Burundi for the comprehensive comments on recommendations made 
during the review, as well as for the update on measures taken since then. Algeria once again 
paid tribute to Burundi&#8217;s determination to work for peace through national reconciliation among 
the different components of the society. The number of recommendations accepted by Burundi 
demonstrates its firm commitment to engage seriously in the UPR. A number of obligations arise 
from recommendations that Burundi has accepted. Therefore, Algeria reiterated its appeal, 
together with many other countries, for the international community to increase its support to 
Burundi so as to enable it to meet its commitment to promote and protect human rights in all 
circumstances and in accordance with its national priorities. 
</p>
<p>270. Senegal reiterated that it had welcomed, in December, Burundi&#8217;s efforts to promote and 
protect human rights, highlighting in particular measures taken for women and children. Senegal 
stressed that acceptance by Burundi of recommendations concerning vulnerable groups 
demonstrates its willingness to improve the situation of these groups and to allow them to fully 
enjoy their rights. It further encouraged Burundi to effectively implement these 
recommendations and  request technical assistance for this purpose where needed. 
</p>
<p>271. The United States of America deeply respected the determination of the people of Burundi 
to escape the devastating remnants of civil war, and build a peaceful, prosperous and inclusive 
society for future generations. In this regard, it supported the recommendation that Burundi 
increase its efforts to disarm, demobilise and reintegrate children involved in armed conflict. The 
Government&#8217;s commitment to promote education was evident in the 69 percent increase in 
enrolment in primary education in the country from 2005 to 2008. With respect to 
recommendations on concerns about recent increases in sexual violence and rape in Burundi, the 
United States appreciated that some 500 individuals, including government officials, are serving 
sentences for rape or assault, and hoped that impunity for sexual violence, including spousal 
rape, will continue to be addressed. Other recommendations expressed concern about freedoms 
of association, expression, opinion and peaceful assembly. While noting that Burundi has an 
active civil society, the United States emphasised the important role of independent journalists, 
political parties and civil society organisations in ensuring free and fair elections in 2010. It 
looked forward to the establishment of an independent national human rights commission and 
offered its support to Burundi in efforts to promote human rights and democracy. 
</p>
<p>272. Nigeria thanked Burundi for its presentation and was glad to note that Burundi has 
accepted most of the recommendations made, including that of Nigeria to intensify efforts to 
uphold the respect of the rule of law and reform the judicial system. Nigeria hoped that Burundi 
would have improved greatly its human rights record, with the support and cooperation of the 
international community, at the second cycle of the UPR.  
</p>
<p>273. Djibouti noted that following a deep institutional and political crisis in recent years, 
Burundi was now in transition and was making efforts to establish and build a viable and 
sustainable democratic society. Djibouti welcomed the efforts made by Burundi to work with the 
UPR mechanism and appealed to the Human Rights Council to help Burundi in the peace and 
reconstruction process. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>274. Burkina Faso congratulated Burundi for the acceptance of recommendations made under 
the UPR. It noted with satisfaction the continuing improvement in the human rights situation in 
Burundi despite the country&#8217;s crisis. It noted in particular initiatives taken in the field of primary 
education and healthcare for children under the age of five as well as progress in promoting and 
protecting women&#8217;s rights. It also noted the exemplary cooperation of Burundi with the 
international community, and particularly with United Nations human rights mechanisms. 
Burkina Faso reiterated its support for appeals to the international community to support 
Burundi&#8217;s efforts in implementing the recommendations arising from the UPR.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>275. Amnesty International welcomed Burundi&#8217;s support of recommendations to establish an 
independent national human rights commission, compliant with the Paris Principles. It was 
concerned however that the draft bill, drawn up on 27 November 2008 by the Council of 
Ministers, would create a commission which would fall far short of the Paris Principles by 
severely restricting its mandate, powers of inquiry, jurisdiction and independence. It urged the 
government to re-consider the preceding version of the draft bill, which provided a superior level 
of independence and capacity for the commission. Amnesty International strongly urged the 
Government to support the recommendations calling on Burundi to ensure that no one is subject 
to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and to reconsider the inclusion of provisions 
criminalizing same-sex sexual relations in the draft criminal code.  It regretted that Burundi did 
not expressly support recommendations to respect freedoms of expression, association and 
assembly, and indicated that several prisoners of conscience remained in detention, among them 
Juv&#233;nal Rududura, Vice-President of the trade union of non-magistrate staff at the Department of 
Justice, and the journalist Jean-Claude Kavumbagu. It called on Burundi to immediately and 
unconditionally release those arrested solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>276. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and Action Canada for Population and 
Development, in a joint statement, welcomed recent steps taken to integrate fundamental human 
rights norms into the penal code, in particular the abolition of the death penalty. However, they 
remained concerned that although the Senate rejected the provision that would have criminalized 
consensual homosexual conduct, the National Assembly has recently voted to restore such 
provision. They urged legislators to eliminate the new provision or the President to veto it. They 
added that such provision would place Burundi at odds with the overwhelming movement across 
the world that has seen progress towards decriminalization and violate the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It 
would severely hamper Burundi&#8217;s efforts to combat HIV/AIDS pandemic and force a part of 
Burundi&#8217;s population into silence and invisibility. 
</p>
<p>277. Human Rights Watch welcomed the UPR report on Burundi. It noted with concern the 
recent National Assembly&#8217;s decision to advance an amendment to the penal code that would 
criminalize homosexuality, contrary to the recommendations made by Belgium, Chile and 
Slovenia. It encouraged the joint committee to eliminate criminalization of homosexuality, and if 
needed the President to veto such law. Human Rights Watch was deeply concerned about the 
prevalence of illegal and arbitrary arrests, many of which are politically motivated, and 
considered that Burundi should accept France&#8217;s recommendation to ban all secret places of 
detention. It deeply regretted that Burundi rejected the recommendations of Italy, Switzerland 
and others to take all measures to guarantee freedoms of expression and association. It added that </p>

 <p> 
the judicial system had been abused for prosecutions of opposition leaders and others who speak 
out against the government, noting in particular the arbitrary detention of Juv&#233;nal Rududura, 
Pasteur Mpawenayo, G&#233;rard Nkurunziza and Jean-Claude Kavumbagu. This called into question 
the independence of the judiciary, a subject of concern for Azerbaijan, the Netherlands and the 
United Kingdom. Human Rights Watch was concerned that in the lead-up to the 2010 elections, 
members of the opposition have been intimidated. Burundi should act immediately to put an end 
to such activities, thereby implementing Japan&#8217;s recommendation supported by Burundi to do its 
utmost to ensure that political parties are safeguarded in the elections. 
</p>
<p>278. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues requested the reintroduction in the 
Bill relating to the national commission on human rights of provisions to guarantee its 
independence, in particular provisions associating with the government other actors and 
institutions in choosing, appointing and replacing members of the commission; to enable the 
commission to directly approach the judicial system; to make compulsory appearance before the 
commission and punishable the refusal to cooperate; to grant members of the commission 
immunity from reprisals and sanctions for action undertaken in the course of their official 
activities; and to facilitate access to relevant documents. It urged the Government to take firm 
action against administrative staff whose negligence or complicity guarantee a de facto impunity 
for authors of sexual violence; and to draft and implement a law guaranteeing women&#8217;s rights to 
inheritance. Regarding the establishment of transitional justice mechanisms, it called on the 
Government to publicly reiterate its commitment to ensure that consultations will not be used to 
justify decisions or acts contrary to international law; and to accept initiatives by the United 
Nations, the international community and civil society to ensure an independent monitoring of 
these consultations. It also called for the adoption of a national policy and specific legislation on 
the protection of the rights of the child, in particular orphans and other vulnerable children; and 
to adopt a juvenile justice system. 
</p>
<p>279. The Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine congratulated 
the delegation of Burundi for the quality of its presentation before the Working Group. It 
endorsed the appeal made to countries to show solidarity with Burundi and to help it to meet 
challenges relating to a culture of peace, tolerance and respect for human rights. The 
organization sought the support of Burundi to its draft universal declaration on the duties of the 
person. It noted with regret that the report of Burundi as well as recommendations made by 
States do not refer to violence against men, and sought the cooperation of Burundi to carry out a 
study on such matter. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>280. Burundi thanked all those who have contributed in the drafting of the national report and 
civil society for its support. It thanked all delegations who made recommendations and praised 
the Human Rights Council for establishing the UPR, which has enabled Burundi to assess its 
progress in protecting and promoting human rights. Burundi undertook to gather all relevant 
stakeholders in the country to study how to implement recommendations made. Further steps 
will have been taken for the protection and promotion of human rights in Burundi by the next 
session of the Human Rights Council. Finally, Burundi reiterated its continued appreciation for 
the support provided by the international community. </p>

 <p> 
<b>Luxembourg 
</b></p>
<p>281. The review of Luxembourg was held on 2 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by Luxembourg in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LUX/1); the compilation prepared by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LUX/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LUX/3). 
</p>
<p>282. At its 28th meeting, on 18 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Luxembourg (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>283. The outcome of the review on Luxembourg is constituted of the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/72), together with the views of 
Luxembourg concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary 
commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the 
Working Group (see also A/HRC/10/72/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions 
as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>284. The Permanent Representative of Luxembourg to the United Nations Office in Geneva 
stated that it was a privilege for Luxembourg to be one of the first 48 countries to go through the 
UPR process. Luxembourg supported the idea of this innovative mechanism, during the 
negotiations that resulted to the creation of the Human Rights Council, because it wanted a 
greater discipline and efficiency in the United Nations system for protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>285. The Permanent Representative gave a summary of Luxembourg&#8217;s responses to 
recommendations addressed in the course of the interactive dialogue on 2 December 2008. He 
informed that a more comprehensive response to the recommendations had been provided in 
writing and was available as an addendum to the report of the working group (see 
A/HRC/10/72/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>286. Turning to Luxembourg international obligations, the country committed itself to take into 
account recommendations and to complete the various processes of ratification as soon as 
possible. However, it should be noted that for the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW), there were major 
legal obstacles because of European community competence on migrant worker issues which did 
not allow the completion of the ratification of this convention, at this stage. Luxembourg 
expressed its hope that a study could be carried within the European Union in order to determine 
possible ways and means of finding a solution with the view to the ratification of the convention. 
Like other European Union partners, Luxembourg will continue to participate actively in the 
international community reflection on the issue of migrants. 
</p>
<p>287. The UPR led to a dynamic process of consultation of independent institutions monitoring 
compliance of human rights in Luxembourg. This consultation process also involved civil </p>

 <p> 
society organisations engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights. It was a 
beneficial exercise for the country. Luxembourg committed itself to continue this consultation on 
a regular basis in order to ensure an appropriate follow up to the UPR report and outcome. 
</p>
<p>288. Luxembourg was aware of the challenges in human rights of persons with mental 
disabilities. The country was about to undertake a legislative reform in order to strengthen the 
fundamental rights of persons who were interned for psychiatric treatment without their consent. 
A law modifying the current regime for persons with mental disabilities had to be adopted very 
soon. This law would amend and update the current provisions in order to take into account the 
most recent international recommendations made on this issue and will make the involuntary 
placement of persons with mental disturbances the subject of a court decision, which can be 
appealed in any moment of the procedure. The use of involuntary treatment as well as isolation 
detention measures will be used in very specific circumstances and at a last resort. On child 
psychiatry, Luxembourg had undertaken to increase the number and quality of its infrastructures 
for the therapeutic treatment of children with behaviour or mental disturbances. These efforts 
will be continued in order to guarantee high quality child psychiatry reflecting the latest 
developments of medical progress. 
</p>
<p>289. Regarding the recommendation to develop legislation on immigration and international 
protection in keeping with the principle of non refoulement, Luxembourg believed that its new 
legislation was in compliance with the principle of non refoulement both in terms of immigration 
legislation and also on the rights of asylum. Concerning the recommendation to halt the practice 
of freeing minors at borders, this practice did not exist in Luxembourg. Concerning 
recommendation on detention measures, Luxembourg will transpose very soon the return 
directives of the European Union into the national legislation. Concerning the recommendation 
on the placing and detention of international protection seekers, discussions were ongoing at the 
European level. 
</p>
<p>290. Concerning the recommendation related to the elimination of racial discrimination, 
Luxembourg committed itself to submit the report required by CERD as soon as possible. The 
country will follow various provisions of the Civil Code and the Criminal Code which 
criminalised and punished various forms of discrimination in Luxembourg. As part of ongoing 
training, human rights courses were provided to prisons officials. 
</p>
<p>291. Regarding the recommendation to develop coherent strategies and plan of action to prevent 
and eliminate all forms of violence against women, particularly women from the immigrant 
community, as well as recommendation concerning prostitution and trafficking in human beings, 
they will be incorporated into the second national action plan for equality between men and 
women 2009-2013.  In order to make the best use of human and financial resources, the 
Government intended to produce a single plan for the implementation of the CEDAW and the 
Beijing platform, in order to have a greater coherence of the political action to promote gender 
equality. The family in its various forms played a vital role in Luxembourg&#8217;s society. 
</p>
<p>292. Luxembourg committed itself to respect recommendations related to new measures in 
order to improve the rights of women and children and to implement the CEDAW 
recommendation to elaborate strategies and programmes to combat prostitution and to continue 
the Government&#8217;s efforts to combat sexual exploitation of children. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>293. On the recommendation dealing with trafficking in human beings, Luxembourg recalled 
the three specific initiatives it referred to in its national report in paragraphs 34 to 40. 
</p>
<p>294. Canada recommended that the terminology used in French reflected the shared values for 
gender equality and equality between men, women and children. In this connection, the 
Permanent Representative stated that Luxembourg was totally in line with the terminology used 
in all international conventions to which it was a party.  Luxembourg indicated that it was aware 
of the ongoing discussion on this terminology issue and was prepared, when appropriate, to align 
on the universally recognized terminology in keeping with the principle of non discrimination. 
</p>
<p>295. Luxembourg committed itself to include the gender dimensions into the UPR follow-up. 
That could be included as measures under chapter 9 &#8220;fundamental rights&#8221; of the national plan of 
action for gender equality 2009-2013 which was to be adopted after the election this year. 
</p>
<p>296. On freedom of religion or belief, Luxembourg stated that all religious communities or 
philosophical beliefs were treated equally. All beliefs were recognised ex officio and without 
discrimination by the Constitution and also in pursuance of the European Convention on human 
rights. Recognition of a particular religion did not give any additional rights to the congregation 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>297. The ban of corporal punishment in the family was effective in Luxembourg and the 
Addendum to the report gave the legal reference in this regard. 
</p>
<p>298. The Government had noted recommendations made in the penal sector. Luxembourg did 
not underestimate the difficulties which it faced, and was undertaking a policy to improve the 
conditions for the detention of juveniles in compliance with international standards. The placing 
of juvenile in the security units could only be done by the judicial authorities. Given the 
particular sensitive nature of infrastructures in the security units, the need to guarantee security 
and ensure the necessary educational and therapeutic treatment they needed, the number of 
young people placed in such security units could not exceed 12.  In principle, the placement of 
children in security units should only be temporary and preventive, since extended stays in these 
units, despite the quality services, may jeopardize their family, social, school, professional and 
cultural reinsertion.  
</p>
<p>299. .  With regard to the situation of children of prisoners, Luxembourg had not specific 
legislation and those situations were treated on a case by case basis by the penitential (in the time 
being only one case) in order to determine and ensure respect of the best interest of  the child . 
Any new legislation would be seen as imposing new constraints and might force all parties to a 
very strict framework. 
</p>
<p>300. The recommendations concerning the hosting conditions for foreigners referred to the 
Welcome and Integration Office in Luxembourg established by a law in December 2008. This 
office was responsible, in coordination with the inter-ministerial committee on integration, for 
the elaboration of a draft national plan of action for integration, and for combating discrimination 
by identifying the main strategic areas for action by the Government and identifying the policy 
measures that needed to be implemented. This draft was submitted to the Government for 
approval. The Government will present a comprehensive strategy and determine targeted 
measures for the integration of aliens and to combat discrimination. Regarding equal treatment </p>

 <p> 
on education, any child on mandatory school age living in Luxembourg should be registered in 
the school regardless of nationality or status. A child could not therefore be refused access to  
school on a racial, sex, language or religion basis. Because of the specific language situation in 
Luxembourg, the Ministry of national education had increased the number of measures in order 
to ensure that newly arrived children have access to school and are taught the three 
administrative languages of Luxembourg.  
</p>
<p>301. On the working conditions of migrants, there were no particular problems for migrants, 
either men or women. Luxembourg&#8217;s legislation on labour issues applies in an equal and non 
discriminatory manner to all workers in the territory. Equal pay for men and women was also 
guaranteed by the Labour Code. Neither the Government nor the Courts had any particular 
information concerning difficulties in this area. Luxembourg did not see any particular reason for 
introducing positive discrimination in working conditions since all workers were treated on an 
equal footing. 
</p>
<p>302. Luxembourg committed itself to achieve the human rights voluntary goals enshrined in the 
Human Rights Council&#8217;s resolution 9/12. 
</p>
<p>303. Finally, given the recommendation to continue its commitment regarding ODA, 
Luxembourg confirmed that it will continue to strengthen its development cooperation policy 
with the objective of combating poverty and helping the developing countries to achieve the 
MDG. This year Luxembourg will reach a rate of 0.92 per cent of GNP allocated to ODA. 
Luxembourg will continue its efforts to achieve a rate of 1 per cent in coming years. It will also 
continue to encourage its partners within the European Union and the Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development to respect the commitment they had made on ODA in the United 
Nations or in the European Union. Luxembourg felt particular responsibility in this connection 
since it was under its presidency of the European Council in May 2005 that the members States 
of the European Union undertook an historical commitment to set up a new common and strong 
objective of bringing ODA to 0.56 per cent by 2010, and to get to 0.7 per cent by 2015. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>304. No views were expressed by States members and observers of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>305. The<b> </b>Consultative Committee for Human Rights of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg<b> 
</b>(CCDH) welcomed the fact that some of the recommendations made to Luxembourg in the WG 
coincided with  recommendations put forward by the CCDH in its written contribution to the 
UPR summary report, as well  recommendations by regional bodies. This proved that there were 
still shortcomings in human rights in Luxembourg in a number of areas. For example, on the 
question of minors in prison, CCDH continues to be of the view that prison was fundamentally 
an inappropriate institution for juveniles. That was also being emphasized by the bodies at the 
Council of Europe. Regarding immigration and international protection, Luxembourg had a 
Grand-Duchy regulation concerning the modalities for implementing decisions for removal from 
the territory under constraint. The CCDH noted that the measures Luxembourg took were not 
appropriate to the subject at hand and that a law should cover this kind of matter. CCDH made </p>

 <p> 
an urgent appeal to Luxembourg&#8217;s authorities to ratify the relevant international conventions, in 
particular the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the OP-CAT and the 
ICRMW. The CCDH encouraged the Government of Luxembourg to follow up on the 
recommendations made by the Council under the UPR framework. The CCDH will monitor their 
implementation as part of its mandate.  
</p>
<p>306. The Arab Commission for Human Rights welcomed the transparent way in which the 
delegation of Luxembourg responded to the recommendations of the UPR Working Group. It 
recommended that Luxembourg establish an institutional framework and a time frame for the 
implementation of recommendations and report back to the Council on the results of this follow-
up within one year. It stressed that the participation of non-governmental organizations in the 
UPR process was important. It noted that Luxembourg chaired the United Nations Economic and 
Social Council and hoped that Luxembourg will play an increasing role in defending the right of 
civil society to participate in United Nations deliberations.  
</p>
<p>307. Research Society on the Rights and Duties of Mankind (CRED) welcomed the report on 
Luxembourg and commented on paragraph 53 of the report citing the recommendation on the 
adoption of a comprehensive strategy for the elimination of violence against women with a 
preventive component. In this regard, CRED asked if there was already a comprehensive United 
Nations strategy concerning violence against women and suggested that if existed, it could be 
adopted by Member States. It also asked if such a strategy would be exclusively for 
Luxembourg. In the same line, CRED noted that the question of violence approached solely from 
the standpoint of violence against women will constitute discrimination since violence against 
men was also a reality around the world. Therefore, it would be desirable for Luxembourg and 
all countries to elaborate a comprehensive strategy against violence in general with the 3 
components: men, women and children. CRED mentioned that it was ready to bring its expertise 
to assist Luxembourg in the development of such a comprehensive strategy.  CRED also 
associated with the recommendation made to Luxembourg to cooperate with the adoption of the 
Universal Declaration on the Duties of the Person. 
</p>
<p>308. The International Federation of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture 
(FIACAT) and ACAT Luxembourg said that they took note of the date of 2010 for the 
construction of a closed centre for minors in Luxembourg. They saluted remarks made in the 
UPR Working Group on the detention conditions of minors and requested Luxembourg to take 
into account concerns regarding children abandoned at borders. They welcomed comments made 
by Luxembourg on alternatives to detention but were concerned about possible discriminatory 
implementation of such measures. They advocated alternatives to detention for parents of 
children affected by these measures, in particular for pregnant women and mothers, including 
when these are foreigners or aliens in irregular administrative status. They shared concerns on 
allegations of xenophobic or discriminatory behaviour of prison personnel towards foreign 
detainees. They welcomed the recommendation that holding measures of persons awaiting 
expulsion be restricted to cases of risk to national security or threat to public order. The two 
Organizations stated that the possibility of placing minors in detention was a regressive step and 
hoped that Luxembourg will respect its international obligations in the planning of the new 
detention centre.With respect to the lack of provisions in Luxembourg&#8217;s legislation guaranteeing 
the principle of non refoulement, FIACAT- ACAT regretted that the response of Luxembourg 
was not followed by a commitment in this regard. They joined with the recommendation that </p>

Luxembourg ratifies the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>309. In his concluding remarks, the Permanent Representative expressed thanks to all the 
speakers Luxembourg attached considerable importance to the activities carried out by the 
various commissions and organizations and would take into account the various comments made. 
Concerning the follow-up process, Luxembourg would conduct it in cooperation with civil 
society, and report regularly to the Council on the progress made in this regard. Regarding 
detention conditions, Luxembourg reiterated what was during the review in December and 
mentioned in the national report. Regarding violence against women, measures had already been 
put in place to address this issue t in legislation and the national plan for 2009-2013. 
</p>
<p>310. The Representative also said that he took to heart the active participation by everyone in 
the UPR and thanked the Secretariat of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
for its support, the members of the troika who played a helpful part in the process, all Member 
States for their recommendations and civil society. The promotion and protection of human 
rights remained a continuing challenge for all States and the entire international community. 
Luxembourg was not above criticism and its endeavours for the universal respect of human 
rights should not dispense from national efforts it would expect from others. Luxembourg would 
continue to endeavour to maintain its efforts overcoming difficulties where they existed, and the 
UPR established to that end an important roadmap to those goals. In cooperation with the 
international community and civil society, the Government of Luxembourg would tirelessly 
continue to ensure progress in a system which should always be ready to take on new challenges, 
and would continue to work towards improving human rights in the country.

<p><b>Barbados 
</b></p>
<p>311. The review of Barbados was held on 3 December 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Barbados in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BRB/1); the compilation prepared by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BRB/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BRB/3). 
</p>
<p>312. At its 28th meeting, on 18 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Barbados (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>313. The outcome of the review on Barbados is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/73), together with the views of Barbados 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/10/73/Add.1). </p>

 <p> 
<b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>314. The delegation of Barbados in its statement recognised the efforts of the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in providing member states, especially small delegations like 
itself, with information and guidance in preparing for the UPR follow-up process. It 
acknowledged the work of the troika of Japan, the United Kingdom and South Africa, which it 
said provided Barbados with a clear sense of the recommendations proposed by delegations. 
</p>
<p>315. The delegation said the Government and people of Barbados have always been cognizant 
of the need to ensure, at the minimum, the basic level of human rights protection for all citizens 
of the world. The preparation of the report and the consideration of the recommendations for the 
present session reinforced this view and proved to be a valuable tool for Barbados to collectively 
examine its domestic system for the protection of human rights and its international obligations. 
This assessment exercise provided opportunities, where necessary and practicable, to enhance 
and improve certain areas of its human rights architecture. 
</p>
<p>316. It was clear, the delegation added, that Barbados would require international financial 
support and technical assistance from the OHCHR, other international institutions and the 
member states of the United Nations to establish and maintain certain aspects listed in the 
recommendations. It called on the international community to support Barbados and other 
developing countries in this regard. 
</p>
<p>317. As a small island developing country with all the associated economic, security and 
environmental vulnerabilities, Barbados must approach this process realistically and commit 
only to those actions which are within its ability to undertake and maintain, it said. Consequent 
to this, the Government of Barbados could not commit, in the short-term, to signing new treaties 
without undertaking a thorough assessment of the nature of the responsibilities involved. 
Barbados will however continue to give thoughtful consideration to signing and ratifying those 
treaties and optional protocols that are within the limits of its capability and where the reporting 
obligations are not excessively onerous. 
</p>
<p>318. The delegation gave its assurance that Barbados intends to improve on its human rights 
reporting record and accepts the recommendation to do so. It conceded however, that human 
resources constraints remain the major impediment to timely reporting and said it would 
continue to support any capacity building initiatives developed by the OHCHR to assist 
developing countries in this regard. It added that Barbados was attempting to establish a human 
rights unit within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade and it looked to 
organizations and member states with expertise in this area, for guidance and assistance. 
</p>
<p>319. It said the Government has undertaken a thorough analysis of the recommendations 
emanating from the UPR and the Cabinet of Barbados took a number of important decisions 
relating to human rights. The Cabinet of Ministers agreed to the abolition of the mandatory 
application of the death penalty and is in the process of amending the relevant laws to reflect 
this. The death penalty, however, remains as a sentencing option. Barbados is unable to accept 
the recommendation of its total abolition at this time. It noted that opinion polls and surveys 
taken in the country show that public sentiment strongly favours retention of the death penalty. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>320. As reflected in the formal responses to UPR recommendations in the addendum to the 
Working Group report, Barbados is actively looking at further revising its Constitution and 
updating its legislation to conform to its treaty obligations. As this exercise unfolds it will 
endeavour to keep the Council updated on progress and of any assistance required with regards 
to legislative drafting. 
</p>
<p>321. The Cabinet of Ministers of Barbados has recently considered a number of proposals to 
further enhance its human rights profile. These include a proposal to evaluate for 
implementation, the recommendations of the Constitutional Review Commission, especially in 
those areas that will enhance the country&#8217;s profile as a staunch defender of human rights. The 
Cabinet was also asked to consider drafting legislation on discrimination and torture, and further 
legislation on sexual harassment in accordance with Barbados&#8217; treaty obligations. In addition, the 
Cabinet has been requested to consider a method for the establishment of an independent 
National Human Rights Commission and to consider providing the Bureau of Gender Affairs 
with an increased level of human and financial resources, within Government&#8217;s limitations, to 
enable it to contribute efficiently to the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s rights. The Cabinet 
subsequently referred all of these matters for further consideration to the Governance Committee 
chaired by the Attorney General. 
</p>
<p>322. Further consideration will also be given to the topic of migration and movement of persons 
and the rights of such persons, since the Government has already established a Cabinet Sub-
Committee on immigration and hopes to have in 2009, a fully revised and comprehensive 
migration policy. This will involve the drafting of relevant legislation and the ratification of 
appropriate treaties. 
</p>
<p>323. The delegation noted that Barbados had received a number of recommendations from 
member states which they considered could enhance the domestic architecture of human rights 
protection. Given the impact of the global economic challenges on all economies, especially the 
smallest and most vulnerable, it asked that the Government&#8217;s efforts to adopt these 
recommendations, where possible, be taken into account. There are some recommendations 
which the Government of Barbados was not, at this time, prepared to accept but that it had taken 
serious note of. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>324. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland said it was pleased to be on the 
troika during the review of Barbados during which it was able to closely observe the serious 
manner in which Barbados approached the review. It was impressed by Barbados&#8217; conduct 
during the review and its high-level delegation. It thanked the State for the serious consideration 
given to all of the recommendations made, including those by the United Kingdom. It was 
pleased that Barbados was able to accept a significant number of recommendations and looked 
forward to its ongoing engagement with the UPR process through their implementation. 
</p>
<p>325. The Bahamas commended Barbados for its commitment to the promotion and protection of 
human rights and for the progress made, particularly with respect to social and economic 
indicators. It congratulated Barbados for its constructive approach to the UPR process and the 
work of the Council, as demonstrated by its full and frank participation in the Working Group </p>

 <p> 
session and the presentation of its response to the report thereof. As a fellow small island 
developing state, the Bahamas understood well the constraints faced by Barbados in its 
continuing efforts to implement its obligations under international human rights instruments. The 
Bahamas encouraged the international community to heed Barbados&#8217; request and provide the 
necessary support and assistance for enhancing national capacity and to assist Barbados in 
continuing to implement its human rights obligations and the recommendations emanating from 
the UPR process which it has committed to implement. 
</p>
<p>326. Mexico acknowledged Barbados&#8217; high level of acceptance of the recommendations made 
in the Working Group. It highlighted the serious consideration given to those recommendations 
that it could not accept immediately and trusted that Barbados would progressively advance in 
the consideration and acceptance of these recommendations. It appreciated the commitment 
demonstrated by Barbados to the UPR and its objective evaluation and openness during the 
review process. It commended Barbados&#8217; acknowledgment of the challenges as well as 
achievements in advancing human rights, and its commitment to confronting them. Mexico 
considered Barbados to be an outstanding example within the Caribbean region and appreciated 
its sharing of experience during various regional seminars. Mexico encouraged efforts made 
concerning the implementation of the recommendations, and hoped Barbados would be 
supported by the international community in this regard. Mexico congratulated the Government 
for the steps that it had already taken in implementing these recommendations, including 
institutional and legislative measures. Finally, Mexico recalled the importance of the role of the 
Council and the international community as a whole, in supporting the efforts being made by 
Barbados to improve the human rights situation in the country. 
</p>
<p>327. Cuba acknowledged Barbados&#8217; high level of acceptance of the recommendations made in 
the framework of the UPR and its efforts to follow up on them.  Cuba commended the efforts 
made by the Government of Barbados, notwithstanding the challenges it faces, as a developing 
country, due to material and financial constraints. Despite these challenges, Barbados continues 
with its firm intention to cooperate with the human rights system of the United Nations and the 
UPR in particular. Cuba called on the international community to positively consider the request 
made by Barbados for technical support. 
</p>
<p>328. Japan, as a member of the troika for Barbados, congratulated it on its constructiveness in 
preparing for and conducting the review. It said the Government of Barbados had shown its firm 
commitment to improving its human rights situation. It expected that the recommendations 
which enjoyed the support of the Government would be fully implemented and it encouraged the 
Government to continue its maximum efforts to improve the human rights situation, taking into 
account the concerns of the international community. It expressed its belief that the serious 
stance of the Government would lead to concrete implementation of the recommendations and 
improve the country&#8217;s human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>329. Algeria reiterated its appreciation for the high quality of the Barbados national report on 
the human rights situation in the country. It said it was highly encouraged by efforts to protect 
and promote human rights and good governance. It noted the challenges facing this small island 
developing state and it strongly supported the appeal by Barbados to the international community 
for technical and financial assistance to support its efforts to implement its human rights 
commitments.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>330. On behalf of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and the International Gay and 
Lesbian Human Rights Commission, the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network expressed 
appreciation for the constructive approach of the delegation and the consideration given to all 
recommendations. With reference to the recommendation on the decriminalisation of consensual 
adult same-sex conduct, it noted Barbados&#8217; comments in relation to social pressure against such 
decriminalization, but emphasised, that human rights must never become a popularity contest, 
and indeed international guarantees of non-discrimination are designed precisely to protect the 
rights of unpopular minorities. Stating that the UPR is based upon relevant international legal 
standards, it noted that in May, 2007, the United Nations Human Rights Committee in its 
concluding observations specifically stated that Barbados should decriminalize sexual acts 
between adults of the same sex and take all necessary actions to protect homosexuals from 
harassment, discrimination and violence. It urged the delegation to act upon the Committee&#8217;s 
recommendations as soon as possible, citing also comments by the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in this regard. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed Barbados&#8217; 
commitment in its response to &#8220;protecting all members of society from harassment, 
discrimination and violence regardless of sexual orientation&#8221;, and indicated it would appreciate 
hearing from the delegation what measures it proposes to ensure such protection. It also 
welcomed the government&#8217;s support for the historic OAS resolution in 2008 on &#8220;human rights, 
sexual orientation and gender identity&#8221; and hoped that this commitment will ensure a better 
future for the whole of the community in Barbados. 
</p>
<p>331. The Cercle de Recherche sur les Droits et les Devoirs de la Personne Humaine (CRED) 
congratulated Barbados, a small island developing state, for achievements in the promotion and 
protection of human rights which could stand as an example. CRED welcomed Barbados 
initiatives to adopt new legislation on integrity. It said this initiative should set an example for 
other nations and wished Barbados success. It hoped Barbados would be at the forefront of 
States in favour of adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>332. In closing, Barbados thanked delegations and other stakeholders for their constructive 
comments and expressions of support, adding that it took careful note of all concerns and 
comments expressed. Barbados reiterated that it had approached the review and 
recommendations in a serious and realistic manner and considered that a number of short-term, 
medium-term and long-term objectives were to be undertaken.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>333. The delegation stated that Barbados was taking the necessary steps within available means 
towards fulfilling these commitments, which it considered would further enhance and reinforce 
the promotion and protection of the human rights of its citizens. It reiterated the Government&#8217;s 
continued commitment towards the review process and expressed confidence that, with the 
support and encouragement of the international community, Barbados would be able to further 
honour its international obligations and continue to contribute to the strengthening of the 
international human rights system. 
</p>
<p><b>Montenegro </b></p>

 <p> 
</p><p>334. The review of Montenegro was held on 3 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by Montenegro in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/MNE/1); the compilation prepared by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/MNE/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/MNE/3). 
</p>
<p>335. At its 28th meeting, on 18 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Montenegro (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>336. The outcome of the review on Montenegro is constituted of the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/74), together with the views of Montenegro 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/10/74/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions 
as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>337. H.E. Miras Radovic, Minister of Justice of Montenegro stated that it was a great honour to 
be again in the United Nations and to take part in the debate regarding the human rights situation 
in Montenegro within the Universal Periodic Review.  
</p>
<p>338. He recalled that Montenegro had achieved enormous progress in the field of human rights 
since its independence was restored on 21st May 2006 and that it had the pleasure to receive the 
recommendations of the States at the Working Group involved in the review process. It had 
taken these recommendations as well-meaning.  
</p>
<p>339. In compliance with the procedure, Montenegro responded to the recommendations from 
the Draft Report of the Working Group. Montenegro proceeded to draw attention to the overview 
of the most important activities undertaken in the period since the presentation of the National 
Report, which are in line with the given recommendations. 
</p>
<p>340. The Parliament ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and in the required time framework it 
will establish the effective national mechanism for prevention of torture. The Government 
adopted the Proposal of the Law on Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities.   
</p>
<p>341. The Government appointed the Agent to represent Montenegro in the European Court of 
Human Rights in Strasbourg and thus fulfilled another important international obligation in the 
field of the protection of human rights and freedoms.  
</p>
<p>342. In the field of combating corruption, Montenegro has undertaken significant activities, 
including the passing of the new Law on Preventing Conflict of Interests. During 2008 judicial 
bodies made obvious progress in solving corruption cases. The latest examples of cases </p>

 <p> 
processed involved persons of high official rank, some of them even holding offices in the 
judiciary, and the intensification of the courts&#8217; work in dealing with cases of corruption, clearly 
reflected the intention of the judiciary to be a determined factor in fighting this damaging social 
phenomenon.    
</p>
<p>343. The Law on Protection of Personal Data has been adopted and an independent supervisory 
body will be established with the task of controlling the implementation of this Law.  
</p>
<p>344. The Parliament adopted the Law on Foreigners thereby creating the preconditions for the 
establishment of an efficient system for visas, and migration.  
</p>
<p>345. The Working group for monitoring the implementation of the National strategy for fighting 
trafficking in human beings adopted the Action plan for 2009. This strategic document 
incorporated the recommendations of all international organizations. The Judiciary also attached 
adequate importance to the criminal cases of trafficking in human beings and imposed 
punishments proportionate to their gravity. 
</p>
<p>346. The Bureau for the Care of Refugees is preparing for the re-registration of internally 
displaced persons residing in Montenegro, which is to be conducted in the first half of 2009. 
Several municipalities would allocate land for the construction of housing units for displaced 
persons. The process of repatriation of 29 families displaced from Kosovo has started. 
Montenegro accepted the recommendation to invite the international community to provide 
technical assistance and financial support in the implementation of the Strategy leading to a 
sustainable solution of the issue of refugees and internally displaced persons. This was a 
confirmation that the international community has not forgotten that in the 90s Montenegro 
opened its doors to a large number of persons from war stricken areas.    
</p>
<p>347. Montenegro was satisfied with the permanent progress in the implementation of the 
Strategy for inclusion of Roma population in Montenegrin society. The building of 50 flats has 
already started in two municipalities. In one Municipality the housing issue of this population 
will be completely solved in this way. It also mentioned that this was the municipality where all 
Roma children go to school. We are also satisfied with the preliminary results of the project of 
the education of the Roma, Ashkalia and Egyptian (RAE) population implemented with the Red 
Cross and UNHCR. 
</p>
<p>348. The Draft Law on Prohibition of Discrimination has been prepared and would soon be 
submitted to the Government for adoption. Montenegro also referred to the conclusions of the 
Committee for Elimination of Racial Discrimination adopted on 16th February 2009, which, 
inter alia, welcomed the fact that Montenegro adopted numerous legislative and administrative 
measures aimed at establishing the framework for promotion and protection of human rights.    
</p>
<p>349. Montenegro provided information on the Action plan for achieving gender equality 2008-
2012, which envisaged preparation of the Forum for dialogue with the civil sector to be 
organized three times a year with the view to establishing dialogue and the transfer and exchange 
of information and views between the Government and the non-governmental sector. In March 
this year, one of Montenegro&#8217;s private universities will start enrolling the first generation of 
students in the &#8222;Gender Studies School&#8220;. The campaign &#8222;16 Days of Activism against Domestic 
Violence&#8220;, started in cooperation with international organizations in late November 2008 and </p>

 <p> 
continued in 2009. Drafting of the Initial Report on the Implementation of the Convention on 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, coordinated by the Ministry for the 
protection of human and minority rights, was in progress. 
</p>
<p>350. Conditions for exercising the freedom of the media a good environment for freedom of 
expression have been created in Montenegro. The Parliament adopted the new Law on Public 
Broadcasting Services after the implementation of the old law showed that certain issues 
important for the work of public broadcasting services had not been regulated or regulated in an 
adequate manner.  
</p>
<p>351. Regarding the recommendation of several states to undertake effective measures to 
investigate attacks on journalists and protectors of human rights, Montenegro stated that in the 
case of the criminal offence of homicide of the Director and Editor-in-Chief of the daily &#8222;Dan&#8220; 
the trial was in progress and in three cases of assaults on journalists the criminal procedures had 
been completed. In two of the cases, there were final judgments and prison sentences imposed, 
while in the third case the trial had finished and the judgment will soon be announced.  
</p>
<p>352. Judicial authorities were also conducting criminal procedures in four war crime cases. In 
three of them indictments had been brought, while the fourth one was at the investigation stage 
aimed at supplementing the request for conducting the investigation proposed by the competent 
state prosecutor. Work on these cases had intensified. In the first of the cases the trial was in 
progress, in the second it was scheduled and would start this month, while the third case was at 
the stage of deciding on the objections to the indictment. In all of those three cases it was 
decided that the defendants be held in detention.  
</p>
<p>353. Court proceedings for the damages in 42 litigations initiated in relation to the event of 
&#8222;Deportation of Muslims&#8220; from 1992 had been finalized through a settlement between the 
plaintiffs and the Government of Montenegro. The plaintiffs settled for an amount of &#8364;4,135,000. 
Montenegro stated that this example of the treatment of the victims from the time of war events 
in the Region could serve as an example for solving the open issues that burdened bilateral 
relations.  
</p>
<p>354. Montenegro fully accepted the recommendation to work more intensively on passing the 
Law on Protection from Domestic Violence and to establish close cooperation with non-
governmental organizations in the procedure of passing this law. According to the Government&#8217;s 
agenda, the Draft of this Law would soon be put forward for public consultation. Montenegro 
stressed that in this field judicial bodies have been committed to solving the cases involving the 
criminal offence of domestic violence. Courts had already decided on several hundreds of such 
cases. 
</p>
<p>355. Montenegro referred to the richness of activities in implementing the Action plan for the 
implementation of the Strategy for the Reform of Judiciary with the Report on the 
Implementation of measures from the Action Plan for the second half of 2008 currently under 
consideration and the high level of measures completed, particularly in the field of strengthening 
the independence and efficiency of the judiciary. Montenegro was working on improving the 
capacities of the Judicial Council, the body defined in the Constitution, to ensure independence 
and autonomy of judiciary. A similar situation existed with the Council of Prosecutors, the basic 
function of which is to guarantee independence of the organization of state prosecutors.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>356. Montenegro attached the highest importance to the efficiency of judicial bodies. The 
Proposal of the Criminal Procedural Code had been adopted by the Government. It created 
preconditions for the efficient work of judicial bodies in the criminal procedure by transferring 
the investigation from the courts to the prosecutors and introducing an alternative dispute 
resolution system. Last year the courts increased their efficiency in solving the issue of backlog 
of cases and the clear trend was to continue with such an approach.  
</p>
<p>357. The delegation regretted that time did not permit for an elaboration of a number of other 
activities undertaken in the field of the judiciary, and reforms in other sectors.  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>358. The United States of America welcomed Montenegro&#8217;s efforts to incorporate human rights 
into its Constitution and the recent creation of an ombudsman institution for the protection of 
human rights and a Judicial Council to strengthen judicial bodies and ensure their independence. 
It noted the concern documented in the Working Group report by a number of delegations about 
attacks and threats against journalists and appreciated Montenegro&#8217;s expressed commitments to 
protect media freedoms and its continuing efforts to investigate these attacks and prosecute them. 
The delegation noted that trafficking in persons is a problem in Montenegro, and welcomed the 
Action Plan for the Fight against Human Trafficking adopted in December 2008 as a positive 
step to improve protection of victims and prosecution of perpetrators. It also appreciated 
Montenegro&#8217;s efforts to coordinate its anti-trafficking efforts with other countries in the region. 
It supported the recommendations in the Working Group report with respect to minorities, 
including the Roma, and the need for full protection of their rights under the law and in practice.  
</p>
<p>359. Albania emphasized that Montenegro is a functioning democracy, a factor in regional 
stability and a trustworthy partner. It noted that Montenegro&#8217;s report was testimony to its 
immense progress in the promotion and protection of human rights and the modernization of its 
society. It also noted Montenegro&#8217;s clear replies, its genuine commitment to bring the country 
into line with the recommendations made and, in particular, the clear objectives set for the future 
of the country. Albanian and Montenegrin police and justice institutions  work closely together, 
with the support of European colleagues, in combating trafficking and organized crime in both 
countries. It noted that the Albanian minority in Montenegro was a bridge of friendship between 
them and enjoyed all the freedoms of a democratic society. In the Balkans, an area which has 
often suffered ethnic problems, this fact represented a giant step towards peace and prosperity. 
Albania noted with satisfaction that Montenegro has provided guarantees for fundamental rights 
and freedoms and has embarked on the right path towards a brighter future for its citizens. 
</p>
<p>360. China appreciated Montenegro&#8217;s sincere and responsible attitude during the UPR and 
thanked them for their cooperation throughout the whole process. China noted with appreciation 
that Montenegro has overcome all the difficulties that emerged during the initial stage of the 
establishment of the country and has achieved a lot of progress in protecting and promoting 
human rights. Montenegro has a fairly complete constitutional and legal framework, has 
established a Unit in charge of protecting minority rights and an ombudsman and has 
implemented various national strategic plans on gender equality, protection of persons with 
disabilities and of minorities. It noted that Montenegro had already launched new measures on 
the prohibition of torture, combating of human trafficking, and protecting vulnerable minority </p>

 <p> 
rights. China believed that Montenegro will continue these efforts and continue to implement in 
all sincerity the feasible measures put forward by member states during the UPR, and with 
assistance and support of the international community, achieve greater progress in human rights&#8217; 
area.   
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>361. Amnesty International (AI) welcomed many of the recommendations, including calls for 
the protection of minorities. In referring to Montenegro&#8217;s obligations under the ICESCR, AI 
urged the Government to prioritise fulfilment for all members of the RAE communities, without 
discrimination, for the rights to free and compulsory primary education, access to employment 
and essential primary health care, and to basic shelter and housing. When allocating resources, 
AI stated that the Government should prioritise the most vulnerable and should seek international 
cooperation and assistance where necessary to meet these basic obligations. It welcomed 
recommendations relating to the clarification of the legal status of refugees and &#8220;internally 
displaced persons&#8221; (IDPs). It noted that persons originating from Kosovo continue to be defined 
as IDPs rather than refugees, and that many of those who arrived after 2003 have not been 
granted access to a process whereby they may be registered as IDPs. It noted that as a result, they 
remain in danger of statelessness. AI noted that the authorities have been negotiating with the 
authorities of Kosovo the return of RAE persons to Kosovo. It urged the authorities to ensure 
that such individuals be allowed to challenge the decision to apply a cessation of protection in 
their case, and expressed the view that they should also be allowed access to a process to assess 
their continued protection needs in order for non-refoulement obligations to be met. While 
welcoming the addendum to the report of the Working Group in which Montenegro provides 
further information on the 20 recommendations made by States, AI encouraged Montenegro to 
indicate clearly which of these recommendations it supports, as required by paragraph 32 of the 
institution-building package. 
</p>
<p>362. Circle of Research into Rights and Duties of the Individual, (CRED) appreciated 
Montenegro&#8217;s replies to the recommendations made within the framework of the Working Group 
of the Universal Periodic Review. CRED noted with great interest the replies to recommendation 
6, including the initiative taken by the Government to approve draft legislation prohibiting 
discrimination, in the first quarter of 2009. CRED drew the Government&#8217;s attention to the fact 
that the draft law addresses 12 precise grounds for discrimination, but it does not include the case 
of discrimination linked to political choices and associations of the individual. It also noted that 
some human rights&#8217; violations are committed against members of political parties or the 
opposition and unions. CRED recommended to Montenegro to include these forms of 
discrimination in the draft law and ensure that these rights are properly promoted. It also 
encouraged Montenegro to take part in the promulgation of a universal declaration of duties of 
the individual.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>363. Montenegro thanked delegations and expressed the significance of the UPR process for 
Montenegro. Responding to some of the recommendations made it referred also to responses 
previously provided.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>364. Montenegro referred to activities undertaken with regard to the protection of Roma 
populations and emphasized the strategy for social inclusion of Roma and expressed a readiness 
to ensure all the rights of the Roma. Montenegro noted progress especially in terms of education 
because a significantly larger number of children attend school than five years ago. Montenegro 
stated the future need to take all possible activities to eliminate barriers and to enable, inter alia, 
the social inclusion of the Roma population.  
</p>
<p>365. With regard to refugees, Montenegro indicated, inter alia, that it did not consider that it 
would reach  a situation of having stateless persons in the country. 
</p>
<p>366. Montenegro stressed that several institutions have had an opportunity to conclude that 
trafficking in persons is not a problem at the present and that the judicial bodies of Montenegro 
dealt with cases of trafficking of persons appropriately and pronounced sentences that were 
adequate to the severity of the committed offenses.  
</p>
<p>367. In response to a statement by Amnesty International regarding which recommendations 
Montenegro accepted and not, Montenegro noted that it did not reject any of the 
recommendations. Montenegro had given its responses and noted the goal of developing and 
strengthening human rights in the country. It considered the recommendations well intended and 
would be of decisive significance for the development of the legal system. It believed that in four 
years time we would be very satisfied with the situation of human rights in the country and in the 
region.  
</p>
<p><b>United Arab Emirates  
</b></p>
<p>368. The review of United Arab Emirates was held on 4 December 2008 in conformity with all 
the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by United Arab Emirates in accordance with the annex 
to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/ARE/1); the compilation prepared 
by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/ARE/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/ARE/3). 
</p>
<p>369. At its 29th meeting, on 19 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on United Arab Emirates (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>370. The outcome of the review on United Arab Emirates is constituted of the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/75), together with the views of 
United Arab Emirates concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its 
voluntary commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the 
plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue 
in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions 
as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>371. The head of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates, Dr Anwar Mohammad Gargash, 
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, reiterated the UAE&#8217;s belief in the UPR process, and its </p>

 <p> 
determination about improving its own human rights record and contributing effectively at the 
global level. This aspiration stems from its cultural heritage and religious values, which enshrine 
justice, equality and tolerance.  
</p>
<p>372. He presented  the &quot;UAE's Action Plan to Implement Voluntary Commitments and 
Accepted UPR Recommendations on Human Rights Issues&quot;, which was designed, through a 
dialogue involving federal and local governments, and civil society organizations (CSOs), to 
determine the scope of work, take follow-up action on the implementation process and submit 
periodic status reports.  
</p>
<p>373. In addition to nine voluntary commitments made by the UAE, the Working Group on the 
UPR, in its report A/HRC/10/75, made 74 recommendations, at its third session in December 
</p><p>2008. While 36 were accepted and 17 considered for detailed study, the rest did not enjoy the 
country's support because of several social, cultural and legal factors. 
</p>
<p>374. Steps taken to realize, since December 2008, voluntary commitments and 
recommendations, include: a) ratification of the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children (known as the Palermo 
Protocol), in February; b) Preparation of a study, by a government committee, which has been 
presented to the Cabinet to consider acceding to the United Nations Convention against Torture 
and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as well as protocols of the 
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; c) Signature of the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the additional protocol, which are in 
the process of being ratified; d) Starting of a series of human rights-related workshops to benefit 
from international best practices:  A workshop was held in February in cooperation with the 
International Organization for Migration to improve the knowledge of human trafficking by law 
enforcement officials. The UAE tackles concerns related to temporary contractual workers with 
the International Labour Organization through, inter alia, the initiative &#8220;Decent Work Country 
Program&#8221;; e) The government has initiated a study of human rights commissions in various 
countries to help formulate its own national institution, in line with the Paris Principles; f) A 
national media campaign to enhance public awareness about human trafficking is being worked 
out; g) Two new related institutions have recently been set up: the Human Rights Department 
under the Ministry of Interior and the Dubai Community Development Authority. 
</p>
<p>375. In relation to recommendations 2, 3, 6, 25, 32, and 36, mentioned under paragraph 91 of 
document A/HRC/10/75 and dealing with strengthening human rights mechanisms, the UPR 
Committee (a multidisciplinary body chaired by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs 
described at page 4 of document A/HRC/WG.6/ARE/1) is studying various measures in line with 
UAE beliefs and traditions, particularly Islamic Sharia, and in coordination with relevant 
authorities. The Federal National Council, the country&#8217;s parliament, will review these measures. 
For instance, workshops and training sessions would be conducted to draw up a national strategy 
to spread a human rights culture. An action plan to raise awareness on human rights-related 
labour issues was outlined by the Ministry of Labour in January 2009, in coordination with 17 
government departments and the private sector. Furthermore, official invitations have been sent 
to Special Rapporteurs on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The 
visits are expected to take place in 2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>376. On recommendations 4, 8, 19 and 34, the UAE is actively considering introducing human 
rights education for students in Grades 1 to 12. Further, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Higher Colleges of Technology is organizing a 
series of lectures.  
</p>
<p>377. With regard to recommendations 10 and 31, the UPR Committee has encouraged CSOs&#8217; 
participation in both the build-up and compilation of the UPR national report, as well as the 
Action Plan. The Ministry of Social Affairs will establish a standing forum with CSOs to 
facilitate dialogue and understanding.  In February 2009, Du, the country's integrated telecom 
operator and the Ministry of Social Affairs jointly launched Musahama, a comprehensive Web 
portal for CSOs in the country.  
</p>
<p>378. Regarding the rights of temporary contractual workers mentioned in recommendations 7, 
9, 14, 18, 21, 22, 27,  28 and 35, the Ministries of Labour and Interior continue to strengthen 
laws on the working and living conditions of expatriate workers. A domestic workers law, which 
will positively impact women, is in a very advanced stage. Other measures will include the 
signature of memoranda of understanding and the reinforcement of the cooperation with labour-
exporting countries, and the launch of a pilot project focussing on the difficulties faced by 
expatriate workers. The Government also created an agency to monitor complaints about unpaid 
wages and regulate wage-related conflicts involving expatriate workers.  
</p>
<p>379. On recommendations 16 and 23, the UPR Committee, in coordination with the National 
Committee to Combat Human Trafficking, will strengthen Federal Law 51 and be part of 
bilateral and international efforts to combat this crime. Other steps include: 1) In January 2009, 
the Cabinet issued orders to increase the number of prosecutors to the National Committee to 
Combat Human Trafficking. 2) Still in January, 80 police and judicial officials held a 
brainstorming session to discuss the national strategy on human trafficking. 3) Training of 15 
law enforcement officials was received abroad. These efforts are making a difference: at least 15 
cases, with a minimum of six convictions, were registered last year as opposed to 10 cases in 
2007. 4) The &quot;Global Report on Trafficking Persons&quot; &#8211; released in February 2009 by the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime &#8211; was funded through a donation from Sheikh Mohammed 
bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. 5) On child camel jockeys, a matter that the 
UAE considers as closed, the Ministries of Social Affairs and Interior, in coordination with the 
country's Special Committee for Rehabilitation of Camel Jockeys and UNICEF, continue the 
follow-up with concerned countries. 6) The UAE will invite the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons<b>, </b>especially women and children, to visit the country. 
</p>
<p>380. On recommendations 13 and 30, the UAE will study ways of further protecting women's 
rights, in coordination with relevant authorities, especially the General Women's Union. The 
Ministry of Social Affairs is also taking steps to ensure that women-related human rights issues 
are respected, particularly by launching awareness programmes. Furthermore, resources for the 
Dubai Foundation for Women and Children and the Abu Dhabi Shelter, established in 2007 and 
2008 respectively, have increasingly been made available and utilized as well.  
</p>
<p>381. With regard to recommendations 11 and 12 pertaining to children's rights, the Ministry of 
Social Affairs, in consultation with the concerned departments and CSOs, is studying a draft law 
to guarantee better protection for children, including the creation of juvenile justice courts. In </p>

 <p> 
addition, an initiative to create the first local CSO to protect children rights was announced 
recently, and a department for the welfare of orphans has already been set up.  
</p>
<p>382. With regard to recommendations 1, 17 and 20, a new draft law on media freedom, 
approved in February 2009 by the Federal National Council, protects journalists from being 
imprisoned. The 45-article draft law, which is awaiting constitutional clearance, replaces the 
1980 law and specifically refers in Article 2 to the freedom of expression and opinion, whether 
written, verbal or by other means and, in Article 3, to the fact that there is no prior censorship of 
licensed media. The law does not make it mandatory for journalists to reveal their sources, and 
media offences will be dealt with as civil cases, not criminal.  
</p>
<p>383. On the development of remote regions mentioned in recommendations 15, 26 and 33, the 
Government has implemented a number of vital projects. A committee, set up in 2005, continues 
to study infrastructure needs for remote areas, including projects related to construction of 
houses, roads, health centres and schools.  
</p>
<p>384. On recommendation 24 related to knowledge exchange, the UPR Committee is working on 
the modalities of organizing workshops and seminars with interested countries.  
</p>
<p>385. Among 17 recommendations that were categorized as being 'under study',  the UAE 
identified recommendations 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 17 mentioned under paragraph 92 of 
document A/HRC/10/75, as being in direct contradiction with the UAE&#8217;s Constitution, religious 
code, traditional values and national interest, hence not enjoying the country&#8217;s support. The 
remaining eight recommendations &#8211; 2, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 &#8211; continue to be under study.  
</p>

Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>386. Algeria expressed appreciation regarding the positive response by the United Arab 
Emirates to the Algerian recommendation on the organisation of trainings and seminars on 
human rights for law enforcement authorities in charge of combating terrorism. The UAE have 
voluntarily accepted UPR recommendations, which is a proof of their commitment to ensure 
equality and social justice for all, to spread a culture of human rights, to improve the situation of 
women and migrant workers and to combat human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>387. Bahrain commended the positive steps taken by the UAE to implement a number of UPR 
recommendations and welcomed UAE&#8217;s accession to the Palermo Protocol. Bahrain commended

2009, of the world report on trafficking in persons. Bahrain expressed appreciation for the 
invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children to visit the country in 2009. 
</p>
<p>388. Cuba congratulated the UAE for its commitment to the UPR.  A country of peace and 
solidarity and a member of the Non-Aligned movement, the UAE demonstrated commitment for 
the implementation of economic and social rights. Cuba added that at the WG on UPR in 
December 2008, the UAE provided detailed information and exchanged opinions with all 
countries. Cuba emphasized the improvement of the living conditions of migrant workers, 
especially with regard to health, housing rights and dispute settlement. Finally, Cuba welcomed 
the decision of the UAE to accept its recommendation.                   </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>389. Pakistan thanked the delegation for presenting a comprehensive National Action Plan, 
which seeks to implement UAE&#8217;s voluntary commitments and UPR accepted recommendations. 
Specific steps were taken such as the ratification of the Palermo Protocol, the commitment to 
sign the Convention against Torture and the protocols to the Convention on the rights of the 
child, and early ratification of the Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities. 
Regarding expatriate workers, Pakistan was encouraged to see appropriate responses that seek to 
ensure improvement of working hours and accommodation facilities, new procedures of labour 
disputes as well as introduction of comprehensive compulsory insurance policy. 
</p>
<p>390. The Syrian Arab Republic appreciated the cooperation that the UAE have extended to the 
UPR mechanism and to all other United Nations human rights mechanisms. The UAE presented 
a comprehensive national report and participated professionally to the review. The UAE have 
made great efforts to comply with the recommendations, in particular by extending an invitation 
to the Special Rapporteurs on contemporary forms of racism, and on the sale of children, and by 
acceding to the Palermo Protocol.   
</p>
<p>391. Egypt said that the accepted recommendations demonstrate the efforts deployed in the 
promotion of human rights. Egypt emphasized the climate of religious tolerance, where all 
religious and cultural particularities are respected. The UAE have ensured a climate of freedom 
to all religions allowing the communities to practice their faiths and traditions and to follow their 
own education systems. The Government has offered free lands allowing schools and cemeteries 
for other religions.  
</p>
<p>392. Saudi Arabia indicated that the UAE accepted the majority of recommendations, 
demonstrating their commitment for human rights, especially women&#8217;s rights. The UAE ratified 
the CEDAW and developed the legal basis to eradicate the problem of violence against women. 
Saudi Arabia noted that the UAE have taken a number of steps to ensure social services, 
including education and health, and commended their efforts to protect these rights. 
</p>
<p>393. Morocco commended the UAE&#8217;s national action plan for the implementation of UPR 
recommendations. The UAE accepted most of the recommendations, including the one made by 
Morocco, aiming at putting in place a national strategy to disseminate a culture of human rights 
and to ensure the long-term protection of rights. Women issues have a central role in 
development strategies and the General Women Union plays an active role in promoting the 
rights of women. The UAE have taken initiatives to harmonise national laws with international 
commitments, and have acceded to the CEDAW and the Palermo Protocol. 
</p>
<p>394. Oman thanked the United Arab Emirates for their constructive cooperation with the UPR 
and their positive engagement with the recommendations. It paid tribute to the UAE for the

which proves that the UAE are interested in cooperating with international mechanisms, in 
particular the Human Rights Council. The UAE largely accepted the recommendations, notably 
as regards religious freedoms, education and health systems, strategies to promote sustainable 
development and comprehensive reforms aiming at the improvement of labour conditions and 
the promotion of workers rights. Kuwait commended the national action plan, which aims at </p>

 <p> 
implementing the UPR commitments and recommendations with the participation of the civil 
society. 
</p>
<p>396. Yemen thanked the UAE for accepting its recommendation on the enactment of a national 
law for the protection of children and commended it for the ratification of the Palermo Protocol.

country. 
</p>
<p>397. Qatar welcomed the UAE&#8217;s action in tackling the vast majority of recommendations, in 
particular regarding the improvement of working and living conditions of contractual workers, 
the spreading of a culture of human rights and the inclusion of the perspective of equality 
between men and women. Qatar appreciated that, regarding the recommendation it has made on 
the reform of the 1980 law on publications and all other related laws to take into account the 
evolution of freedom of expression, a press and information law was adopted by the UAE and is 
soon to be promulgated by the Head of State. Qatar invited all relevant human rights 
mechanisms to provide the UAE with the necessary assistance. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>398. Geneva Infant Feeding Association (GIFA) said that the UAE has not yet adopted a 
national law on the marketing of breast-milk substitutes. GIFA said adopting a strong national 
law is necessary, as the UAE is a lucrative market for the baby food industry. It acknowledged 
improvements in maternity protection at work, but said paid leave is only 8 weeks; the UAE 
should ensure foreign workers are granted the same length, also harmonizing legislation 
throughout the Emirates. GIFA recommended all maternity hospitals, public and private, be 
certified baby-friendly as a condition for being allowed to function. It reminded the UAE that its 
report to the CRC is due since 2004, and that it has not yet ratified ICESCR. 
</p>
<p>399. Action Internationale pour la Paix et le Developpement dans la Region des Grands Lacs 
(AIPD) noted the positive response to numerous recommendations made, and welcomed the 
country&#8217;s efforts on trafficking and related crimes. Significant progress had been made by the 
UAE in combating violence against women, the protection of workers&#8217; rights, and freedom of 
religion. The UAE&#8217;s determination to promote the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights is demonstrated through the civil society and Emirati associations, such as the 
Emirati Red Crescent or the Muhammad bin Rashed Al-Maktoum Foundation, particularly in the 
area of education and health for children in several African countries. It invited the international 
community to support the UAE in ratifying the Palermo Protocol.  
</p>
<p>400. World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) thanked the Government for the efforts made 
to improve the rights of workers, as well as the measures taken to protect migrant and domestic 
workers. It welcomed the fact that among the many recommendations adopted by the 
Government, there is a commitment to continue strengthening its labour law, improve the 
working conditions and the lives of workers, and in particular migrant and domestic workers, 
including a mechanism to deal with reports and complaints on discriminatory treatment. It 
requested the Government to examine the recommendations made to ratify the ICCPR and 
ICESCR, and to reconsider its decision not to accept the recommendations regarding the </p>

 <p> 
unionizing of workers, collective bargaining, and the right to strike, as well as to consider 
ratifying ILO Conventions 87 and 98. 
</p>
<p>401. Arab Commission for Human Rights (ACHR) welcomed the fact that the UAE is looking 
into setting up an independent human rights commission pursuant to the Paris Principles, but 
asked for more information with regards to the timeframe envisaged, as well as level of 
participation of civil society in this process. It also welcomed the cancellation of jail sentences 
on press crimes, and recommended that this be extended to electronic media. Regarding political 
participation, it recommended the adoption of recommendation 78 of the report. It recommended 
the reform of the justice system to ensure its independence and welcomed the adoption of a 
mechanism to follow up on UPR recommendations. It also recommended that UAE supports 
OHCHR financially. 
</p>
<p>402. Hawa Society for Women (HSW) said it had been involved in all preparations of the 
review process, having submitted remarks and comments. It noted the question of the 
establishment of refuge centres to victims of trafficking, protection of women's rights, the 
promulgation of a national law to protect children and the creation of the institutional mechanism 
to provide attention to domestic workers victims of violence. HSW suggested using all available 
resources to develop a culture of respect, including the internet, and setting up a user-friendly 
reliable database. 
</p>
<p>403. Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS) endorsed the pledges to reform the 
1980 Law on Publications and all other related laws in the country, calling upon the UAE to lift 
the governmental control over press freedoms and to limit legal restrictions on the right to 
freedom of expression, including the right to political dissent and the right to receive 
information. It invited the UAE to ratify in a timely manner the ICCPR, ICESCR and CAT, to 
ensure the enjoyment of citizens to all civil and political rights, and to guarantee their active 
participation in public affairs. It said the UAE should ensure the creation of independent trade 
unions and political parties; restrictions on the establishment and work of all associations, 
including human rights NGOs should be lifted; the rights of internet bloggers, journalists and 
human rights defenders to express freely their views on public affairs should be ensured. CIHRS 
was concerned about discrimination against women, the right of children to a nationality without 
discrimination based on the parent&#8217;s gender, and invited the UAE to amend its laws in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>404. Interfaith International said the large influx of foreign workers and the achievement of 
certain goals related to economic rights, favoured a degree of tolerance among the population, 
the opening of temples, churches and other places of religious veneration. The UAE is one of the 
rare countries in the region that authorizes the construction of cemeteries for Christians and 
crematories for Sikh and Hindu minorities. It congratulated the UAE for the establishment of a 
standing forum and website for civil society; it encouraged the UAE to continue elaborating a 
program of compensation, rehabilitation and professional insertion of victims of trafficking, and 
to create a national strategy promoting a proper economic citizenship for migrant workers and 
members of their families.  
</p>
<p>405. Comit&#233; International pour le Respect et l&#8217;Application de la Charte Africaine des Droits de 
l&#8217;Homme et des Peuples (CIRAC) said they had been involved in the preparation of the UAE 
national UPR report, and provided remarks that were included. CIRAC also provided comments </p>

 <p> 
on the recommendations made, and expressed its intention to cooperate in implementing the 
recommendations accepted by the UAE, in particular those related to ensuring good conditions 
for workers. CIRAC said it would participate in the dialogue on the follow-up to 
recommendations, especially on foreign workers, victims of trafficking, and persons released 
from prisons.  
</p>
<p>406. Indian Council of South America (CISA) commended the UAE for enacting Federal Law 
51 in 2006, and for the establishment of a National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking. 
The UAE&#8217;s contribution of USD 15 million to the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight 
Trafficking and its sponsoring of trafficking conferences in Vienna and New York were 
commendable. It called on the UAE to continue efforts to advance women in all levels of 
Government, to continue to protect foreign workers and provide human rights training in 
combating terrorism. It considered the UAE&#8217;s commitment to accede to the CAT and to 
establishing a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles positive 
steps forward, urging the UAE to ratify other instruments and to continue to include civil society, 
journalists, and other sectors in the follow-up to the UPR process. 
</p>
<p>407. African-American Society for Humanitarian Aid and Development (ASHAD) emphasized 
the positive role played at regional and international levels by the UAE saying it had noted 
constant progress in the achievement of rights in the UAE, including women&#8217;s rights. It noted 
that the UAE is at the top of the list of countries providing aid to others in cases of humanitarian 
disasters, and it paid tribute to the Red Crescent Society and all other associations for the tireless 
efforts made in this connection. 
</p>
<p>408. Cercle de Recherche sur les Droits et les Devoirs de la Personne Humaine (CRED) noted 
the UAE&#8217;s rapid modernization and welcoming the Government&#8217;s commitment to improving the 
human rights situation by sharing its experiences and seeking to draw on the best practices of the 
international community. It supported Canada&#8217;s recommendation to uphold the freedom of 
expression of non-governmental organizations by amending the laws limiting it and repealing 
punitive sanctions.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>409. The delegation of the UAE thanked the members of the Council for their appreciation and 
for their criticism also: all comments will help the UAE to further improve their human rights 
record, which has been commended by many speakers.  Through this review, the UAE gained 
more awareness about the importance of capacity building and the involvement of the civil 
society. With regard to the UPR, the UAE noted that it is essential to build a credible and 
constructive process without merging human rights with pure political matters.   
</p>
<p><b>Israel  
</b></p>
<p>410. The review of Israel was held on 4 December 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Israel in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1,

system, despite their reservations about some aspects of the Council's work.  
</p>
<p>414.  Israel thanked all delegations who engaged in the dialogue in good faith and have 
shared constructive comments, providing concrete suggestions and ideas. Israel indicated it has 
also appreciated the positive and supportive response received from numerous states throughout 
this process.

decided to adopt Recommendation 28 ensuring full protection to the rights of minorities. 
</p>
<p>417. Israel has also taken upon itself to promote the following items from the Council's 
recommendations:  
</p>
<p>(a) the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; 
</p>
<p>(b)  ensuring best protection of human rights and follow-up to the implementation of 
international instruments;  
</p>
<p>(c) considering strengthening dialogue with the Council and its special procedures, and the 
cooperation with all relevant United Nations special procedures and mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>(d) redoubling efforts to increase women&#8217;s representation in society;  </p>

 <p> 
(e) continuing and strengthening its efforts to achieve gender equality in Government and 
public services at all levels. To this end, the newly elected Parliament &#8211; the Knesset, has 21 
women, among the largest number of women members in Israel's history, and three more than in 
the previous Knesset;  
</p>
<p>(f) ensuring prompt and impartial investigations of allegations of ill treatment, in accordance 
with its obligations under the Convention against Torture;  
</p>
<p>(g) ensuring all cases are reviewed by a court in accordance with fair procedures; 
</p>
<p>(h) granting the right to those who object to serve in the army on conscientious grounds to 
serve instead with a civilian body independent of the military, such as in the form of the newly 
established and strengthened Public Commission for National-Civil Service; 
</p>
<p>(i) further addressing the remaining gaps between the various populations in the Israeli 
society;  
</p>
<p>(j) Regarding minorities, Israel has the intentions to strengthen efforts to ensure equality in the 
application of the law, to counter discrimination against persons belonging to all minorities, to 
promote their active participation in public life, such as through additional Government 
Resolutions to raise the percentage of the Arab minority in the Civil Service;  
</p>
<p>(k) Following the Universal Periodic Review Process, several measures are currently being 
implemented towards further promoting children's rights through several preliminary means: a 
draft bill on the establishment of a new youth court has been prepared and is currently under 
review and additional issues such as necessary adaptations to probation officers reports are 
evaluated.  
</p>
<p>418. While Israel also appreciates the spirit of the recommendation to protect the children and 
families of migrants, it does not consider that accession to the Convention on the Rights of 
Migrant Workers and their Families is required in order to achieve this goal, as under Israeli 
legislation, the rights of children and family members of migrants are already protected. 
</p>
<p>419. With respect to the recommendation calling for the acceleration of the process of bringing 
Israel's national legislation in compliance with the provisions of the main international 
instruments to which it is a party, Israel noted that while international treaties are not directly 
incorporated into Israeli legislation, given its dualistic system of law, it remains committed to 
ensuring that domestic legislation, policies and practice comply with its international 
commitments. Therefore, since treaties are not self-executing and require legislative 
implementation, Israel conducts careful consideration of whether, and to what extent the relevant 
international obligations are already met by existing legislation and case-law, and whether 
passing implementing legislation is needed prior to becoming a party to an international treaty. 
This process involves extensive and meticulous governmental work in order to assess the 
compatibility of new treaties with domestic law, and where necessary &#8211; to introduce relevant 
amendments to the law. Furthermore, Israeli courts recognize and apply a presumption of 
compatibility as an interpretive tool, assuming that the Knesset, when enacting new legislation, 
has no intention of derogating or deviating from international obligations, and therefore Israeli 
legislation should be interpreted in conformity with international law, unless an explicit intention </p>

 <p> 
to the opposite exists. In addition, certain laws integrate some of the human rights treaties into 
Israeli legislation. It also noted that customary law, in contrast to treaty law, is considered part of 
the domestic law. It is binding without the need of transformation by a statute, unless it explicitly 
conflicts with an existing statute. 
</p>
<p>420. With regard to the recommendation to evaluate the possibility of ratifying the second 
optional protocol to the ICCPR on the abolition of the death penalty, Israel reiterated what was 
indicated in its national report, that while it is not in a position to ratify the Protocol, Israel has 
applied a de-facto moratorium on executions, and the only exception that has ever been 
implemented since Israel's establishment was in the case of the Nazi war criminal Adolph 
Eichmann in 1962, who was convicted by the Supreme Court of committing genocide under the 
1950 punishment of Nazi and Nazi Collaborators Law. The death penalty has not been applied 
since. This policy complies with Israel's obligations as a state party under UN human rights 
treaties and it's sponsorship of UN resolutions in support of a moratorium on the imposition of 
the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>421. Israel also takes note of the recommendation to intensify its efforts to ensure that human 
rights are respected in the fight against terrorism. This remains an ongoing challenge for Israel as 
it continues to confront the threat of terrorism. Israel is keenly aware of the need to find the 
complex balance between competing rights and other considerations in this regard, and remains 
ready and willing to share with other countries its experience and challenges. 
</p>
<p>422. Israel indicated it will make a concerted effort to incorporate civil society groups when 
considering how to further implement the recommendations received, and will continue to 
explore ways to engage with the members of civil society in the protection of human rights in 
Israel. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>423. Palestine noted that none of the 12 recommendations it made on the basis of the principles 
of international humanitarian law and international human rights law had been taken into account 
by Israel. Palestine reminded that  Israel was the occupying power of Palestinian and other Arab 
territories and had recently unleashed a savage attack against Gaza strip leading to  thousands of 
deaths, destruction of homes, places of worship, hospitals and even United Nations buildings. 
Israel has been imposing a blockade on Gaza for two years, and has already started to demolish 
80 other houses and displace more than 1500 Palestinians living in east Jerusalem. Due 
consideration should be given to  the numerous appeals by the Secretary-General, the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, by special rapporteurs, particularly the Special Rapporteur on 
human rights in Palestine, and  the Presidents of the International Committee for the Red Cross 
and of the Federation of the Red Cross and Crescent, the head of UNRWA, the Undersecretary-
General for humanitarian affairs, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the Non Aligned 
Movement, the Arab League, and international and Israeli organizations condemning practices of 
the occupying power and its violations of human rights. It highlighted calls for inquiry into war 
crimes committed by Israel against the Palestinian people and stated that Israel must comply </p>

 <p> 
with its international humanitarian and human rights commitments which are applicable to the 
Palestinian territories including East Jerusalem. It added that the international community must 
uphold its moral and legal obligations and seek cessation of this occupation  
</p>
<p>424. Cuba indicated that during the review of Israel almost all delegations raised concerns about 
the situation of the Palestinian and Syrian Golan occupied territories, in particular regarding the 
human rights and humanitarian situation. Many recommendations were made to Israel, including 
by Cuba, in a spirit of cooperation. Cuba stated that Israel must recognize that the concept of 
democracy is not compatible with the situation of being an occupying power, negating the 
human rights of Palestinian people in the occupied territories and that the review must include 
the human rights situation in the territories. It noted that few days after the review, Israel 
unleashed military action against the Gaza strip. Cuba re-emphasized its recommendations and 
expressed hope that the requests of the international community be met with a view to achieving 
fair and lasting peace that would allow to build a better future of the people in the Middle East, 
guaranteeing the rights of the Palestinian people to live in a free, independent and sovereign 
State fully exercising their human rights.  
</p>
<p>425. The Syrian Arab Republic said Israel continues to pursue its violations of the most 
fundamental principles of humanitarian law in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and in the 
Occupied Syrian Golan. It highlighted that while it was presenting its national report to the 
Working Group, Israel was preparing its attacks on the Gaza strip, which took place few days 
after the review. It said the campaign of disinformation continued at the present session. It noted 
that Israel claimed not to have executed individuals, but said it has been responsible for the 
deaths on a daily basis of thousands of men, women and children. Israel has broken the record 
when it comes to violations of international resolutions, especially Council resolutions. 
</p>
<p>426. Egypt indicated that Israel&#8217;s review shows that Israel chooses to ignore its commitments 
under international human rights and humanitarian law. Israel&#8217;s national report ignored that it 
remains the occupying power of lands of three Arab countries, that since 1967 more than 20 
percent of the Palestinian population has been detained by Israel and that it is currently engaged 
in building a wall of racial separation on Palestinian territories. Regarding the Syrian Golan, 
Egypt stated that Israel continues with the confiscation of lands and with imposing its citizenship 
on Syrian people. . Egypt repeated some of the obligations which it indicates that Israel is trying 
to avoid, in particular that: Israel should end its occupation of all Palestinian and Arab territories 
occupied since 1067, including Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan; respect the right of the 
Palestinians to self-determination and to the establishment of their independent state with 
Jerusalem as its capital; respect the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homelands 
and to be compensated for losses and damage incurred and to retrieve their properties; annul its 
illegitimate decision to annex the occupied Syrian Golan; end all settlement activities in the 
occupied Arab Territories, in particular and around occupied Jerusalem and in the Syrian Golan.  
</p>
<p>427. The Islamic Republic of Iran said the UPR could not appropriately address this specific 
situation, and the gross and systematic human rights violations over 60 years required the 
particular attention of the international community. It cited human rights and humanitarian 
violations such as racist laws and practices, extrajudicial killings, demolition of houses, 
imprisonment of innocent people, racist and discriminatory policies and practices, torture, 
expansion of settlements, increasing checkpoints, closure of crossings and military incursions, 
the illegal construction of a racist Apartheid wall, targeted killings, the use of Palestinians as </p>

 <p> 
human shields and  heinous aggressions against the Gaza strip in flagrant breach of international 
law, especially those constituting genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Iran urged 
the international community to take measures to end all forms and manifestations of occupation, 
aggression, racism and human rights violations perpetuated by the occupying power. 
</p>
<p>428. Yemen recalled the recent Israeli attack against the Gaza strip and indicated that Israel has 
ignored recommendations since 1948 and so it is not surprising that it will ignore the largest 
number of UPR recommendations, specially those related to putting an end to the occupation in 
all occupied Palestinian and Arab territories and to recognizing the right of Palestinian people to 
self-determination, to an independent sovereign state with Jerusalem as a capital, and to the right 
of return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland and their right to compensation and restitution 
of their properties. Yemen also noted the recommendation to fully implement their obligations 
under international humanitarian law and all Human Rights Council decisions relating to human 
rights in the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories.  
</p>
<p>429. Malaysia appreciated the opportunity through UPR for delegations to engage in peaceful, 
constructive and non-confrontational dialogue to better understand, assess and ultimately effect 
tangible improvements to the human rights situation on the ground. It regretted that Israel&#8217;s 
presentation did not address most of the pertinent issues and recommendations raised in the 
Working Group. Noting that Israel has accepted only a small number of recommendations, it 
said the human rights of Palestinian people remained unfulfilled and the humanitarian situation 
on the ground in the Occupied Palestinian Territories remained dire. Malaysia remained 
convinced that the occupation of the Palestinian territories was the root cause of human rights 
violations and called on the immediate end to all forms of occupation and aggression against 
Palestinians. Malaysia emphasized the importance of distinguishing between terrorists and 
legitimate resistance against occupation. The only means of achieving lasting peace, security and 
stability between Palestine and Israel is through peaceful non-discriminatory and transparent 
negotiations and dialogue. It reaffirmed its support for the constructive role of the Council in 
monitoring and deliberating the human rights and humanitarian situation in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territories. 
</p>
<p>430. The United States of America noted Israel&#8217;s energetic civil society and independent media 
and urged Israel to continue to conduct consultations in the follow-up to the UPR outcome. The 
United States of America noted the visits by special rapporteurs hosted by Israel demonstrating 
its commitment to UN human rights mechanisms. It commended Israel&#8217;s efforts to increase 
opportunities for inclusion of minority communities as well as its determination to improve the 
status of women within all sectors of Israeli society.  It noted the serious and constructive 
approach that many in the Council took towards Israel&#8217;s UPR although it regretted the politicized 
nature of many of the recommendations. The Unites States of America stated that it is actively 
engaged in the international effort to establish peace in the region, including the establishment of 
a Palestinian state that will exist side by side with Israel in peace and security.    
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>431. Amnesty International shared  many of the recommendations made during the review and 
looked forward to learning which recommendations did or did not enjoy Israel&#8217;s support. AI </p>

 <p> 
suggested the recommendations be strengthened as follows: to recognize the applicability to the 
occupied territories of Israel&#8217;s responsibility under international human rights and humanitarian 
law and to investigate war crimes and other violations of international law, hold the perpetrators 
accountable and provide reparation to victims; to lift the blockade of the Gaza Strip and allow 
the unhindered passage of people and goods; to halt the expansion of Israeli settlements, the 
destruction of Palestinian homes and the construction of the wall/fence in the West Bank; and to 
remove the more than 500 checkpoints and barriers which impede the movement of Palestinians; 
to reverse policies and practices which undermine the rights to health, education, housing, work 
and an adequate standard of living in the occupied territories, as well as for the Bedouin 
communities in Israel. It said many of the recommendations made have taken on an additional 
urgency in the wake of the recent conflict in the Gaza Strip and southern Israel and it urged their 
full and prompt implementation. 
</p>
<p>432. The Arab Commission for Human Rights stated that the lack of cooperation reduced the 
opportunity for a dialogue and the UPR effectiveness. It suggested the Council not to adopt the 
report. It noted that countries from various regions expressed their concerns and made realistic 
and measureable requests to end to the human rights violations against the Palestinian. It 
indicated that the behaviour of the Hebrew State as an occupying power is in contradiction with 
its international obligations. The Commission stated that the separation wall, the segregation, the 
fragmentation of the Palestinians territories and the expulsion of Palestinians compromises the 
establishment of peace and the right of future generations to solve the problem. The Commission 
concluded by expressing hope that the Palestinians will have one day an independent and 
sovereign State.  
</p>
<p>433. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims said the implications of Israeli air 
strikes and ground invasions go beyond the destruction of infrastructure to the loss of innocent 
people&#8217;s lives, including women, children and the elderly. It indicated that Palestinians have 
experienced oppression and continuous traumatic experiences and massive destruction, including 
internal displacement. It said more than two-thirds of Palestinian women and children suffer 
from trauma. It emphasized the necessity of respecting international humanitarian law and 
formation of an independent fact-finding delegation, as part of the responsibilities of the Council 
with regard to Palestine. It called upon the Council to deliver an independent report on the 
psychological and mental trauma of Palestinian women and children, especially in the Gaza strip. 
</p>
<p>434. The World Federation of United Nations, speaking on behalf of the United Nations 
Association of Iran, noted the continued neglect of civilian&#8217;s rights as human rights violations, in 
particular in the Gaza Strip. The Federation stated that Israel violated all international human 
rights and humanitarian instruments. It indicated that children in Gaza are facing health 
epidemics and that according to the World Health Organization trapped Palestinian children are 
at risk due to the lack of vaccination. The Federation referred to the likelihood of a health crisis 
and to the inflicted health trauma caused by the three-week offensive in Gaza.    
</p>
<p>435. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies commended Israel&#8217;s engagement with the 
UPR process. It noted that international bodies and United Nations mechanisms, including the 
Council, have concluded that confiscation and settlement of Occupied Palestinian lands by Israel 
constitute illegal acts under international law. It noted that the process of settlement continues 
unabated.. It said Israel&#8217;s illegal policy of settlement and territorial confiscation has led to the 
violation of the fundamental rights of Palestinians and the endangerment of security and basic </p>

 <p> 
rights of all Israeli citizens. It asked about steps taken or to be taken by the Government to end 
this policy and dismantle settlements. It said Israel&#8217;s acknowledgement of the suffering of the 
Palestinian people caused by the occupation and policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territories 
would constitute an important first step in addressing the current political impasse. Israel&#8217;s 
unwillingness to adequately address the human rights violations committed by Israeli forces 
within its UPR report is an ominous sign. 
</p>
<p>436. The Conscience and Peace Tax International regretted that Israel&#8217;s response to the 
recommendations were not available in advance. It expressed its interest in the recommendation 
in paragraph 100, sub-paragraph 22. The Organization welcomed Israel&#8217;s indication in its 
introductory remarks that it is planning to introduce an alternative civilian service for 
conscientious objectors to military service. The Organization encouraged Israel to bring in 
legislation consistent with the internationals standards as set out in Commission on Human 
Rights Resolution 1998/77 and in the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee. The 
Organization commended to Israel in particular that arrangements be firmly under civilian 
control, compatible with the nature of the objections, not punitive in nature by comparison with 
military service and that it should accept declarations of conscientious without inquiry. The 
Organization stated that it will follow with interest the progress of bringing forward relevant 
legislation.  
</p>
<p>437. The Women&#8217;s International Zionist Organization while noting the steps taken to promote 
human and women&#8217;s rights stated that barriers remained to the full realization of human and civil 
rights. It noted the establishment of the Commission on Equal Employment Opportunities and 
the Commission of Equal Rights for Persons with Disabilities and that the Commissions ensure 
active participation of NGOs. It called upon Israel to continue in this positive direction and to 
remove or narrow down its reservations to CEDAW, particularly on equality in public 
representation and on gender equality in family life. It noted as unjustified the reservation to 
article 16 and urged to provide for civil marriage and divorce. It said more than 300,000 Israeli 
citizens with no religious affiliation cannot marry in Israel. The introduction of civil marriage 
would provide them with one of the most basic civil rights. It will also introduce an egalitarian 
divorce law, replacing the existing discriminatory religious laws that currently hold exclusive 
jurisdiction over marriage and divorce in Israel. 
</p>
<p>438. The Organization for Defending Victims of Violence referred to the Israeli military 
operation launched against the Gaza Strip and to the death, injuries and displacement of 
Palestinians and the blockaded population. The Organization noted the destruction of 
government and other buildings as well as the UN aid distribution to refugee centres. The 
Organization indicated that Israel committed genocide according to the Geneva Conventions and 
Protocols; war crimes according to the Charter of the Nuremberg International Military Court 
Tribunal; crimes against humanity according to the Rome Statute and Charter of the Nuremberg 
International Military Court Tribunal; and crime of aggression according to the General 
Assembly Resolution 3314.  
</p>
<p>439. The Society Studies Centre expressed concern that the outcome of the review only 
addressed the rights of Israeli people, ignoring the gross violations of human rights in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israel has tried to avoid its responsibility as an occupying state 
towards the violations that are committed in Gaza and the West Bank and other occupied lands 
in Syria and Lebanon. The Centre stated that the most prominent violation that is committed by </p>

 <p> 
the state is to deny the self-determination of a nation by occupying the Palestinian lands, which 
has caused atrocities against civilian population. It noted that 10 thousands Palestinians are 
imprisoned, including members of parliament and that few days after the review, Israel 
committed a massacre in Gaza. The Centre stated that Israel must be reminded and made 
accountable for what it has committed in Gaza and other parts of Palestine and that it is unfair 
for Israel to destroy facilities and have European Nations and other donors pay for rebuilding 
them.  
</p>
<p>440. The African American Society for Humanitarian Aid and Development said it followed 
with alarm the tragedy of Palestinian people as the Israeli occupation committed the worst 
human rights violations, ignoring all international laws and international humanitarian law. It 
appealed to the Council to show itself responsible by stopping immediately all violations 
contrary to all international laws and by obliging the occupying power to comply with 
international resolutions in this regard. It said that the lack of respect for these resolutions by 
Israel demonstrates its disdain for the international community. It appealed to the Council to 
ensure the protection of the Palestinian people and to oblige Israel to put an end to the ethnic 
purification and massacres in which it is engaged in the Palestinian territories. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>441. In closing, Israel indicated that while the questions and recommendations were 
challenging, they hoped these will ultimately serve a constructive purpose for all Israeli citizens. 
Israel is committed to implementing practical measures that &#8212; over time &#8212; will lead to the 
successful realization of the recommendations that they have accepted.  
</p>
<p>442. Israel noted the remarks of the President of the Council who, citing paragraph 32 of 
Council resolution 5/1, reminded that recommendations that enjoy the support of the state 
concerned will be identified as such, while other recommendations, together with the comments 
of the state concerned thereon, will be noted. The President emphasized how important it was for 
the State under Review to indicate whether the recommendations which have not been referred 
to by the delegation are supported or noted.   
</p>
<p>443. In view of these remarks and of the Council resolution, Israel indicated that it had already 
referred to the recommendations that enjoyed its support, and that all other recommendations 
were also noted. 
</p>
<p>444. Israel indicated it will continue to consult with representatives of civil society and non-
governmental organizations to ensure the full realization of human rights in Israel. Israel believes 
that strong civil society involvement in the follow-up to this UPR will make their vibrant 
democracy stronger, more resilient, and more secure.  
</p>
<p>445. Israel is aware that their human rights record is not perfect, yet they have not lost sight of 
the founding ideals in their declaration of independence and look forward to ensuring the 
continued growth of a society based upon the rule of law and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>446. Before the adoption of the outcome of the review on Israel, the following statements were 
made. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>447. Palestine  reiterated its support to the universal periodic review process and noted that  the 
applicability of international law, international human rights law and international humanitarian 
law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention on the occupied Palestinian territory, including 
East Jerusalem make it incumbent upon the occupying authority to submit a detailed report on 
the human rights situation in the territories under its occupation, in addition to its report of the 
human rights situation within its own territory.  Palestine questioned Israel&#8217;s commitment to the 
principles of the United Nations Charter, international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law, in view of the fact that it occupies Palestinian territories in a clear violation of 
United Nations principles and threatens international peace and security. Out of respect for 
international law or resolutions in general, and of the Human Rights Council in particular, Israel 
must be obliged to apply all resolutions and recommendations adopted by the Council. Israel 
must respect all human rights mechanisms within the Council, in particular special procedures 
and fact-finding missions. Palestine indicated that the fact that Israel, as occupying power, 
rejected a number of recommendations threatens the whole UPR mechanism and undermines the 
work of the Council and thus expressed its reservations.  It noted that, in accordance with 
paragraph 32 of Council resolution 5/1, all recommendations form part of the outcome.   
</p>
<p>448. Pakistan, on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), noted that the 
UPR is among the most important mechanisms established by the Council that seek to address 
human rights situations in the country under review in a comprehensive manner. It noted that the 
Council should bear in mind that Israel, as an occupying power, has a different status and has 
obligations flowing from international human rights and international humanitarian law, 
particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention. Under humanitarian law, the Palestinians are 
protected people and Israel has an obligation to ensure their enjoyment of all human rights. 
During its review in December 2008, many  States reminded Israel of this fact and recommended 
implementation of its human rights and humanitarian obligations, which Israel  has chosen to 
ignore.  It should be held accountable for persistent violations of all fundamental rights of the 
people it currently occupies and should respond to all the recommendations made. This Council 
should ensure that there be will no impunity for those who are violating the rights of the 
occupied people. The OIC believed the Israeli policy of ignoring some fundamental concerns 
related to its human rights obligations has seriously undermined the objective of the UPR 
exercise. It thus stated its reservations on this approach.  
</p>
<p>449. The United States of America noted that it has reengaged with the Council and seeks to 
ensure fairness and that no one country be singled out and treated differently than others. It noted 
that during the consideration of the outcome of the review of Israel, certain procedural questions 
were raised, which were not raised with regard to any other States. They considered efforts to 
treat one country, any country, differently from all others, unacceptable. The United States of 
America noted with appreciation the remarks from Palestine, in its commitment to sticking with 
procedure and proceeding in a fair way. They appreciated the work of the Secretariat and the 
Council President in keeping the Council on the right path. The founding principles of the 
Council: universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, were not intended to shield 
countries from criticism but to create an environment in which all will be treated fairly, and 
ultimately make the Council more effective. It noted that all should rededicate themselves to the 
goals and founding principles of the Council.   
</p>
<p>450. Australia expressed its deep concern that during the consideration of the outcome of the 
review of Israel, procedural questions were raised which were not raised during the review of the </p>

 <p> 
other 30 States that have undergone this process. Australia indicated that the singling out of one 
country was unacceptable and regrettable, given the generally positive operation of the UPR 
process and its contribution to human rights promotion in many countries. Australia expressed 
appreciation for the President&#8217;s efforts to find a way through and to ensure the decorum of this 
chamber.  
</p>
<p>451. Cuba indicated its support for the UPR as an effective tool to make progress in human 
rights promotion and protection. Cuba indicated it had hoped that Israel would have followed 
common practice, which has been respected by all, to react to all the recommendations on which 
their position had not yet been set out during the Working Group review. Cuba would not object 
to the adoption of the report, but wished to place on record their hope that Israel would 
understand the appeals from the international community and would endeavour to respect all 
human rights including of the Palestinian people living in the occupied Palestine territories, as is 
their obligation as the occupying power. 
</p>
<p><b>Liechtenstein 
</b></p>
<p>452. The review of Liechtenstein was held on 5 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by Liechtenstein in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LIE/1); the compilation prepared by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LIE/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LIE/3). 
</p>
<p>453. At its 29th meeting, on 19 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Liechtenstein (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>454. The outcome of the review on Liechtenstein is constituted of the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/77), together with the views of 
Liechtenstein concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary 
commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the 
Working Group (see also A/HRC/10/77/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions 
as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>455. The delegation of Liechtenstein provided an update on relevant developments that 
occurred since the adoption of the UPR report on Liechtenstein by the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>456. In December 2008, Parliament approved the accession of Liechtenstein to the 1993 Hague 
Convention on Inter-country Adoption. As a State party to that convention, Liechtenstein will be 
able to also ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale 
of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.  
</p>
<p>457. On 1 February 2009, the new Children and Youth Act entered into force. Article 3 of that 
act stipulates, inter alia, that children and youth have the right to education free of violence, </p>

 <p> 
mentioning explicitly that any form of corporal punishment, emotional harm and other degrading 
measures are not tolerable. Liechtenstein stressed that this provision complemented the existing 
prohibition of corporal punishment at school and in public childcare institutions, extending it to 
all settings, including the family.  
</p>
<p>458. The delegation further stressed that, also in February, the Government established an 
interdisciplinary working group with the specific mandate to examine any legislative and other 
measures required for the domestic implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. In the same month, the Government approved a 
concept paper entitled &#8220;Persons with Disabilities in the Working Process&#8221;, which had been 
prepared by a working group set up to analyse the current situation in Liechtenstein with regard 
to this more specific area. On the basis of this development, the delegation announced the 
voluntary commitment that Liechtenstein will intensify its examination of the necessary 
implementation measures with a view to a possible accession to that Convention and its Protocol. 
This commitment was made against the background of Liechtenstein&#8217;s general policy with 
regard to international treaties, which consists in adapting the relevant national legislation before 
ratification in order to allow for immediate implementation thereafter. 
</p>
<p>459. Still in February, parliamentary elections took place in Liechtenstein. Among the 25 newly 
elected members of Parliament were six women, corresponding to about 24 per cent. This result 
corresponded to the one achieved in the parliamentary elections four years ago, and constituted a 
firm basis for Liechtenstein&#8217;s continued commitment to pay particular attention to the promotion 
of women&#8217;s participation at all levels and in all areas of public life. In this context, the delegation 
added that the new Government to be sworn in very soon would have a proportion of 40 per cent 
of female ministers. Liechtenstein made this commitment regarding women&#8217;s participation also 
as a reaction to the recommendations submitted during the session of the Working Group with 
regard to women&#8217;s rights. The delegation announced that Liechtenstein can accept all of the 
recommendations in this area, partly by converting them into voluntary commitments.  
</p>
<p>460. The only recommendation with relevance to the situation of women that Liechtenstein 
could not accept concerned the call for an ex-officio prosecution in respect of all forms of 
domestic violence. In this regard, the delegation explained that in 2007 the introduction of a new 
explicit criminal provision on stalking was approved by Parliament. It is a criminal offence to 
harass a person persistently and for a prolonged period in a way that is likely to seriously disrupt 
her or his way of life. This new provision makes an important contribution to the prevention of 
violence against women since it enables the police to intervene already at a very early stage and 
to prevent the threatening behaviour from resulting in an act of violence. This criminal offence 
requires a complaint to be made by the victim for the prosecution to be initiated. The same is true 
for rape in marriage and partnership as well as other forms of domestic violence penalized under 
the Criminal Code. Since a procedural distinction between stalking and comparable forms of 
domestic violence would undermine the effectiveness of this new provision of the Criminal 
Code, the Liechtenstein authorities do not intend to establish ex-officio prosecution for all acts of 
domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>461. Therefore, Liechtenstein cannot support this recommendation, as one of 8 
recommendations which Liechtenstein cannot accept. As underlined by the delegation, 32 of the 
recommendations could, however, be accepted or were converted into voluntary commitments, 
which corresponds to a ratio between accepted and rejected recommendations of 4 to 1.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>462. The delegation stressed that Liechtenstein continued to follow up on its commitment in 
respect of international cooperation despite the financial and economic crisis. In particular, it 
mentioned that since December 2008, the United Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East was supported with 100&#8217;000 Swiss francs for its emergency relief in 
Gaza. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was supported with 200&#8217;000 Swiss 
francs for its activities in Uganda and the Philippines. Another support of 100&#8217;000 Swiss francs 
went to a basic health programme in Zimbabwe, and 100&#8217;000 Swiss francs were contributed to 
the Common Humanitarian Action Plan for Sri Lanka. Moreover, 100&#8217;000 Swiss francs went to 
the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre and 50&#8217;000 Swiss francs to the ICRC fund for mine 
victims. 
</p>
<p>463. In conclusion, the delegation referred to the written replies to the recommendations 
provided by Liechtenstein several days before the meeting, which it did not intend to read out to 
save time for the dialogue.  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>464. Germany thanked Liechtenstein for its outstanding constructive approach to the 
recommendations. Lichtenstein has set a benchmark on how to deal with recommendations, by 
accepting and supporting many of them, by converting others in voluntary commitments, and 
mostly by giving detailed reasoning for those recommendations that could not be supported. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>465. Amnesty International welcomed many of the recommendations made by States during the 
review, especially to continue efforts aimed at eliminating all forms of discrimination, to draft a 
law establishing registered partnership for same-sex couples, and to ensure the full 
implementation of the national plan of action against racism. It further welcomed Liechtenstein&#8217;s 
support of these recommendations. It regretted however that Liechtenstein rejected the 
recommendation made by several States to establish an ombudsman or national human rights 
institution in accordance with the Paris Principles.  Notwithstanding the comments by 
Liechtenstein in the Addendum, Amnesty International considered that such an institution would 
be an important step towards improving the coordination on human rights policy between the 
different institutional levels in Liechtenstein. Referring to the call made by several States for 
measures to strengthen the integration of foreigners, Amnesty International urged Liechtenstein 
to amend the new Foreign National Act to avoid the creation of additional groups of non-citizens 
and to ensure that non-citizens are not discriminated against, especially with regard to their right 
to family reunification. It welcomed assurances by Liechtenstein that it has honoured all its 
reporting obligations under the United Nations treaty body system, and called on Liechtenstein 
to ensure that regular follow-up is undertaken to the concluding observations and 
recommendations of the treaty bodies. This should include regular human rights training for 
public servants, especially those working with foreign nationals and asylum seekers. 
</p>
<p>466. The Circle for Research on the Rights and Duties of the Human Person welcomed the fact 
that human rights are defined as one of the priorities of the foreign policy of Liechtenstein. It 
welcomed the setting up of a Commission on protection against violence in Liechtenstein, and 
indicated that it would like to cooperate with this Commission within the framework of the </p>

 <p> 
sociological survey under way concerning violence. It suggested that the results of this survey be 
submitted to the Human Rights Council, as very often the question of violence is dealt with only 
in connection with violence against women. In the view of the Circle for Research on the Rights 
and Duties of the Human Person, this survey provided an opportunity to discuss the fact that 
violence is a social scourge and should be dealt with as such. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>467. Liechtenstein indicated that it took good note of comments made and that the report would 
be taken back home. Referring again to the written comments submitted in advance by 
Liechtenstein, the delegation stressed that the dialogue did not end at the plenary of the Human 
Rights Council, and would be continued in the future. Liechtenstein will concentrate on the 
follow-up to the UPR and implementation of commitments in practice. The delegation indicated 
that Liechtenstein has decided to pursue the dialogue at the national level and that meetings with 
all stakeholders that contributed to the national report are planned in regular intervals. It thanked 
all delegations, including the members of the troika, for their interest taken in the review, their 
comments and numerous questions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Serbia 
</b></p>
<p>468. The review of Serbia was held on 5 December 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Serbia in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/SRB/1); the compilation prepared by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/SRB/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/SRB/3). 
</p>
<p>469. At its 30th meeting, on 19 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Serbia (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>470. The outcome of the review on Serbia is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/78), together with the views of Serbia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/10/78/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>471. Mr. Marko Karadzic, State Secretary in the Ministry of Human and Minority Rights of the 
Republic of Serbia, presented the reply of Serbia concerning conclusions and recommendations 
contended in the UPR Working Group report on the review of the country on 5 December 2008. 
He informed the Council that the Republic of Serbia, upon careful consideration of the 
mentioned report, accepted most of the conclusions and recommendations in whole or in part. </p>

 <p> 
Detailed explanation of the Government&#8217;s position has been provided regarding all the 
recommendations (see A/HRC/10/78/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>472. The delegate stated that, aware of its responsibility to promote and protect human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, the Republic of Serbia was ready and willing to implement the 
accepted recommendations and responsibilities, although implementation efforts often face 
pressing challenges, and sometimes increase of public expenditure. The delegate highlighted the 
fact that Serbia has already begun, in the short period from the interactive dialogue till the 
adoption of the final report, to fulfil certain obligations. Namely, preparations for the ratification 
of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol are well 
underway, as well as development of the initial report to CERD. Furthermore, the Government 
of Serbia elaborated a Draft Law on Prohibiting Discrimination and a National Strategy for 
Improvement of the Status of Women and Gender Equality was adopted. 
</p>
<p>473. The recommendation regarding the adoption of a separate anti-discrimination law is 
accepted. The recommendations for the advancement of the position of persons with disabilities 
are also accepted. In 2006, the Government adopted the National Strategy for the Advancement 
of the Position of Persons with Disabilities. The same year the law on the Prevention of 
Discrimination of Persons with Disabilities was adopted, while the Law on the Employment and 
Professional Rehabilitation of Persons with Disabilities will be adopted soon. 
</p>
<p>474. Recommendations regarding State&#8217;s commitment to human rights protection and raising 
public awareness regarding human rights are accepted. The Ministry for Human and Minority 
Rights signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with  more than 150 NGOs, by which both sides 
obliged themselves to ensure regular future exchange of information on activities connected with 
the preparation, adoption and implementation of laws and strategies in the area of respect for 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, in connection with the production of reports on the 
implementation of accepted international obligations, as well as in connection with other 
activities falling under the competency of the Ministry. In the future, the Ministry of Education 
will also take part in raising public awareness on the possibilities of using existing legal 
provisions and institutional mechanisms for the protection of human rights. The Republic of 
Serbia shall continue to undertake all necessary measures of strengthening national mechanisms 
for the implementation of the views of contracting bodies in connection with individual 
applications or petitions. 
</p>
<p>475. The recommendation regarding the report on the implementation of the Convention on the 
Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination is accepted as the Ministry for Human and 
Minority Rights has already begun to prepare the initial report on the implementation of the 
Convention. Serbia accepted recommendations regarding the role of women in high-level 
decision-making process. The country is undertaking activities towards changing the Family 
Law by introducing norms that clearly prohibit corporal punishment and protect children from all 
forms of physical punishment, including physical punishment in the family environment, 
therefore recommendations regarding prohibition of corporal punishment, including in the 
family, in line with the recent recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child are 
accepted. 
</p>
<p>476. Recommendations regarding implementation of a comprehensive national strategy to 
prevent trafficking and sexual exploitation of children and to take effective measures to combat </p>

 <p> 
trafficking in women and children in cooperation with countries in the trafficking network are 
accepted. Serbia also accepted the recommendations to develop a legal system in line with 
international standards, in order to strengthen the rule of law. Recommendations regarding 
necessary measures in order to ensure that allegations of human rights violations are 
systematically subjected to inquiries and punished where appropriate, as well as to strengthen 
measures for the development of effective mechanism to help combat impunity, including 
strengthening of the judiciary, are accepted. 
</p>
<p>477. The recommendations to ensure investigations of cases of violence against journalists and 
for creating a climate in which journalists will be able to freely report on sensitive issues are 
accepted, as well as the recommendation to undertake measures to improve socio-economic 
conditions for refugees and IDPs. Serbia also accepted the recommendation to reach the human 
rights goals set up by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 9/12. 
</p>
<p>478. Serbia expressed its support to the work of the Council and the UPR process based on 
interactive dialogue, which promotes universal human rights and their interconnection and 
contributions to the best practices exchanges among States and other interested parties. On 
behalf of the Government of Serbia, the delegate expressed heartfelt gratitude to all States that 
have recognised fields which enable more efficient action for improvement of human rights in 
Serbia, as well as representatives of the &#8220;troika&#8221; (Ghana, Pakistan and Ukraine) for their 
contribution to the preparation of the report. Serbia also thanked numerous NGOs and relevant 
United Nations bodies that have contributed during the UPR process to determining status of 
human rights in the country. Finally Serbia pointed out that it believes that the next cycle of UPR 
process to be carried out in four years will be a real test that will show the extent of fulfilment of 
commitments undertaken by the country in this process for improvement of the status of human 
rights and freedoms in the society. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>479. Cuba thanked Serbian authorities for their efforts in presenting their national report and for 
the extensive and clear information given to the Working Group. It expressed its satisfaction 
with the replies provided by Serbia during the interactive dialogue and for sharing its 
experiences, achievements and challenges in the promotion and protection of human rights and 
for informing the Working Group its priorities. It commended Serbia&#8217;s efforts to promote and 
protect human rights, especially the prohibition of all forms of discrimination, the promotion of 
tolerance and intercultural dialogue among  the various ethnic, linguistic and religious groups in 
the country. Cuba stated that it was useful to learn about national measures adopted by the 
Serbian Government in order to reach MDGs, particularly on the poverty reduction strategy and 
the national employment strategy. It congratulated Serbia for the progress made in promoting 
and protecting human rights and encouraged Serbia to continue its efforts to honour 
commitments made.  
</p>
<p>480. The Russian Federation welcomed the UPR of Serbia, a country with which it was linked 
by many years of closed and friendly relations. In particular, the Russian Federation welcomed 
the additional information provided by the representative of Serbia. The Russian Federation 
noted Serbia&#8217;s  openness and constructive approach as well as the focus on dialogue during the 
review. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>481. Algeria thanked the Serbian delegation for the additional information it provided on the 
human rights situation in the country. The national report was very exhaustive and showed the 
determination of this country to protect and promote human rights. Algeria encouraged the 
authorities in Serbia to continue along this course and to accept the recommendations made last 
December. The delegate underlined that Algeria and Serbia had a common attachment to peace, 
justice and international legality and to the principles of international law, which were the only 
way to preserve international stability. Algeria recommended the adoption of the UPR report on 
Serbia. 
</p>
<p>482. Ukraine welcomed and thanked the delegation of Serbia for the comments and additional 
information provided on recommendations and the activities of the Government of Serbia aiming 
at their implementation. Serbia was commended for the efforts made in recent years aimed at 
protecting and promoting human rights and the progress achieved. As a member of the &#8220;troika&#8221;, 
Ukraine expressed appreciation to Serbia for its openness in the UPR process and to the 
members of its delegation for the cooperation and constructive role they played in the 
preparation of the report. Ukraine noted with satisfaction that Serbia has adopted the majority of 
recommendations made during the review and welcomed its intention to ensure their full and 
effective implementation as well as measures already taken and expressed its conviction that 
Serbia will make further progress.  
</p>
<p>483. The United States of America expressed appreciation that the Serbian Constitution bans 
direct and indirect discrimination and urged the Government to intensify its efforts to enforce 
this provision and hoped that Serbia&#8217;s establishment of a Protector of Citizens as an independent 
public authority will prove to be an important step in that direction. The United States of 
America expressed its continuing concern over the discrimination against minorities in 
education, employment, housing and health, and appreciated Serbia&#8217;s commitment to continue 
current positive steps to promote equality and non-discrimination. The United States of America 
noted that corruption remained a serious problem in Serbia and recognised the Serbian 
Government&#8217;s efforts to bring to justice several judges and prosecutors charged with corruption. 
It noted as a positive development Serbia&#8217;s engagement of representatives of civil society in the 
reform of the judiciary and in legislative policy. It further noted that trafficking remained a 
significant problem in Serbia and encouraged adoption of the draft amendment of the Criminal 
Code that introduces harsher punishment for traffickers. The United States of America shared the 
concerns of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression and opinion regarding limitations 
on the independence of the media. It hoped Serbia will adopt the recommendation of the 
Working Group to ensure journalists were able to report on sensitive issues without fear of 
harassment or reprisals. Finally, the United States was of the view that Kosovo was independent 
and that Serbia did not exercise any governing authority over this territory which should remain 
outside the focus of future Serbia&#8217;s UPR reports.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>484. The representative of COC Netherlands and Labris-lesbian human rights organisation from 
Serbia indicated that according to the Serbian Constitution, every person has the right to equal 
legal protection and non-discrimination but that. Serbia still did not yet have an anti-
discrimination law which, like the gender equality law, was still pending. The representative 
recommended their early adoption, and recommended that discrimination based on sexual 
orientation be specifically prohibited in the Serbian Constitution, Criminal Code and other laws. </p>

 <p> 
The representative commended Serbia for joining the statement delivered at the 63rd General 
Assembly session on sexual orientation and gender identity and suggested that Serbia continued 
adopting and implementing policies in the spirit of this statement. The representative indicated 
that attacks and physical threats to LGBT persons and human rights defenders occurred on a 
daily basis. According to the Serbian Criminal Code, racial and other discriminations were 
criminal offence, but sexual orientation was not specifically mentioned and hate crimes were not 
legally recognised.  
</p>
<p>485. Interfaith International (I I) appreciated Serbian good responses to recommendations and 
questions resulting from the UPR process. Nevertheless, the representative drew the attention of 
the Human Rights Council to the precarious situation in which some retirees from Kosovo who 
contributed until 1999 in former Yugoslavia found themselves. According to I I representative, 
since the end of the war, those retirees have been deprived from their pensions for which they 
have paid during their labour life on a period of 15 to 40 years in the hope to ensure a retirement 
in dignity. Since 2000, many initiatives and steps have been taken with all the parties concerned. 
Also large scale demonstrations have been held. The representative added that so far MINUK 
has provided only promises without a follow up. Consequently, in the follow up of UPR 
recommendations and the commitments of Serbia to improve the human rights, I I called upon 
the international community and the Human Rights Council to set up a commission which will 
be tasked to take measures in cooperation with the Governments and institutions responsible for 
the recovery and payment of pension to those retirees, facilitating administrative procedures for 
them. 
</p>
<p>486. The representative of the Research Society on the Rights and Duties of Mankind (CRED) 
stated that it emerged of their reading of the UPR report on Serbia that peaceful coexistence 
among various national entities, which appear to have different aspirations in the area of human 
rights, remained a major challenge for this multinational State.. In this regard, CRED welcomed 
the recommendation made regarding the promotion of equality and non-discrimination against 
national minorities in the country. CRED also referred to the recommendation on combating 
neo-Nazi and other groups which promoted racial hate and violence within the framework of 
Serbia&#8217;s legislation. It felt that current measures were insufficient to ensure  internal stability and 
requested Serbia to provide the Human Rights Council with data on the composition of national 
ethnic groups in political, administrative and legal bodies. The experiences of countries in 
similar situations showed that unity within diversity was possible if all social groups were 
represented at the national level. CRED stated that it hoped that Serbia would be able to achieve  
the commitments enshrined in the Constitution of November 2006.  
</p>
<p>487. Amnesty International (AI) welcomed many of the recommendations made by States to 
Serbia, including calls to ensure full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
former Yugoslavia. AI also welcomed calls to ensure that allegations of human rights violations 
were investigated, prosecuted and the perpetrators brought to justice. AI noted that since the 
establishment of the Special War Crimes Chamber at Belgrade District Court, Serbia has made 
real progress in addressing impunity for the war crimes which took place during the wars in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo. However, the number of trials completed 
remained low, and the current capacity and resources of the Court were inadequate. AI urged that 
additional resources be allocated to the Court and the Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor. 
Measures should be taken to strengthen the authority and capacity of the War Crimes 
Investigative Services, or it should be re-established as an independent agency or as a unit of the </p>

 <p> 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. AI also called upon Serbia to carry out effective, independent and impartial 
investigations into incidents where the actions of the State agents, including police and prison 
officers, may have led to violations of human rights. While acknowledging the decline in number 
of reported incidents, AI expressed its concerns at the long-standing failure of Serbia to address 
impunity in cases of torture and other ill-treatments, and at the continued inclusion in the 
Criminal Code of a status of limitations on prosecutions for such human rights violations. It 
urged the Government of Serbia to establish a genuinely independent and transparent mechanism 
to investigate all allegations of torture and other ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>488. Serbia reiterated its commitment to the UPR process and its dedication for the promotion 
and protection of human rights. It stated that it will intensify its efforts for the fulfilment of 
commitment undertaken in the course of this important process for the improvement of human 
rights and freedoms in its society. Serbia thanked for all the comments and recommendations 
coming from different sides but also mentioned that the intervention of the representative of the 
United States of America regarding the status of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and 
Metohija was not in accordance with the basic documents and what is being done in the United 
Nations. This is a United Nations forum and the Republic of Serbia as a sovereign State is a 
member of the United Nations with all its territory, which means that Kosovo and Metohija is a 
part of the Republic of Serbia. Therefore Serbia requested not to use this forum to negotiate and 
discuss the status of the Autonomous Province of Serbia and the unilateral declaration of 
independence. Serbia expressed its appreciation to all the delegations that took an active role in 
the process before the Council as well as the civil society representatives. It addressed special 
thanks to the members of the troika, composed of Ghana, Pakistan and Ukraine, who facilitated 
the process. Finally, it thanked the President for the professional conduct of the process.

<p>489. The review of  Turkmenistan was held on 9 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by Turkmenistan in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TKM/1); the compilation prepared by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TKM/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TKM/3). 
</p>
<p>490. At its 30th meeting, on 19 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Turkmenistan (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>491. The outcome of the review on Turkmenistan is constituted of the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/79), together with the views of 
Turkmenistan concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary 
commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the 
Working Group (see also A/HRC/10/79/Add.1). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>492. H.E. Dr. Shirin AHMEDOVA, Director of the Institute for Human Rights and Democracy 
under the President of Turkmenistan, and head of delegation, expressed gratitude to the States 
and international organizations which put forward their recommendations under the UPR. 
Turkmenistan intended to bear in mind the comments made in order to carry out further reforms 
in the country and to prepare national reports, including under the ICCPR and CAT. 
Turkmenistan had closely followed up on its international obligations and reformed its national 
human rights system.  
</p>
<p>493. On 14 December 2008 Turkmenistan held elections to the Mejlis (Parliament), with 
international observers. On 9 January 2009, in conformity with the new Constitution, the 
Parliament held its first session and elected its chairperson by secret ballot. From 125 
representatives of the Mejlis, 21 are women (17 per cent), including the Chair of the Parliament, 
and the Chairpersons of  two of the five Parliamentary committees. The President, in his 
statement at the opening of the Parliament, focused on further developing the process of 
democratization, civil society, the need to reform national legislation to bring it in line with the 
new Constitution and the provisions of the international instruments ratified by Turkmenistan. 
</p>
<p>494. In January, the Inter-ministerial Committee submitted its report for 2008. The role of this 
Committee is to monitor national legislation regarding human rights and to prepare proposals on 
the implementation of international human rights law and on institutional transformation. It 
addressed proposals to the Parliament: on the need to reform the penitentiary system and the 
system of juvenile justice; mechanisms of legal protection; the creation of  a government body 
on family, maternal and child protection, work on legislation regulating religious organizations 
and civil society organizations,  and on the regulation of media. 
</p>
<p>495. In 2008, Turkmenistan, inter alia, prepared its report under the Covenant on Economic 
Social and Cultural Rights and its core document. In accordance with recommendations from the 
Human Rights Council, Committee on the Rights of the Child and UNICEF, Turkmenistan 
undertook to examine adhesion to ILO Convention 182 on Child Labour. 
</p>
<p>496. Turkmenistan proceeded to respond to recommendations forthcoming from the UPR.  
</p>
<p>497. Turkmenistan was currently examining the Rome Statute and mechanisms of adhesion to 
it. Cooperation was planned with UNODC and EU/Tacis on this matter as well as for 
parliamentarians and relevant Government bodies. 
</p>
<p>498. With respect to the ratification of OP-CAT, Turkmenistan planned to present its national 
report to the Committee against Torture in  December 2009. In the framework of the preparation 
of that report, Turkmenistan was planning to conduct seminars and round tables, together with 
United Nations agencies, to learn about the OP-CAT. Those activities, as well as consultations 
for members of the Inter &#8211;ministerial Commission on the mechanisms of adhesion to optional 
international instruments will be undertaken in the framework of a joint project 
OHCHR/European Commission/UNDP on &#8220;strengthening Turkmenistan&#8217;s national capacity to 
promote and protect human rights&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>499. The Inter-ministerial Commission, having consulted with relevant government bodies and 
civil society organizations on the effectiveness of adhering to the OP-CEDAW, transmitted to 
the Government the necessary materials for the Parliament. The President wrote to the Mejlis on 
21 Jan 2009 about the need to ratify the OP-CEDAW. 
</p>
<p>500. Turkmenistan proceeded to respond to the recommendation to establish an independent 
National Human Rights Institution in line with the Paris Principles. In the framework of 
cooperation between the relevant Government bodies and the United Kingdom Embassy, a cycle 
of seminars was started in January 2009 for parliamentarians and government bodies to examine 
the experience in other countries of ombudsman systems. Turkmenistan was planning to broaden 
cooperation on gathering knowledge on ombudsmen systems, to complete the legislation and 
further the activities of Governmental bodies and of the Institute for Human Rights and 
Democracy under the President of Turkmenistan. The Institute also planned to undertake joint 
activities including an assessment of the complaints system, in the framework of projects with 
OSCE and UNDP. Turkmenistan also planned to hold ongoing consultations with OHCHR on 
complaints procedures. 
</p>
<p>501. On the recommendation of issuing a standing invitation to special procedures, 
Turkmenistan indicated that the relevant Government bodies were currently examining the 
recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief, who visited 
the country in September 2008, in order to further improve the system of registration of religious 
organizations and relevant legislation. Currently, Turkmenistan requested a list of the special 
procedures in order to examine the question of issuing them with invitations. 
</p>
<p>502. The question of torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment in 
places of deprivation of liberty was being examined by the Government Commission on 
complaints about law enforcement bodies, and the Inter-ministerial Commission on the national 
reports. Implementation has started on a joint project with the United Kingdom Embassy, the 
International Centre for Prison Studies and the German Development Programme (GTZ) aimed 
at improving the penitentiary system. Support to the penitentiary system is foreseen in the 
programme of projects to be conducted together with the OSCE-Ashkabad in 2009. Within that 
framework, seminars are planned for prison staff on the 1955 United Nations Minimum 
Standards, follow-up consultations and the development of learning materials on that issue.  
</p>
<p>503. Regarding the recommendation to allow access of ICRC representatives to detainees, in 
conformity with their mandate, Turkmenistan has stepped up its cooperation with all recognized 
international organizations including with the ICRC. At present, Government representatives 
take part in ICRC trainings and seminars organized by ICRC in the country and abroad. The 
question of visiting penitentiary facilities was being permanently discussed by representatives of 
the Government and ICRC. Turkmenistan has proposed a gradual implementation of the ICRC 
mandate in the country. As a first step, it has been proposed to broadly raise awareness among 
the staff of the relevant government bodies about the international rules and the practice and 
activities of the ICRC in this area. 
</p>
<p>504. On 27 Nov 2008, the regional representation of ICRC in Central Asia made a presentation 
on its activities in relation to imprisoned and detained persons. From Turkmenistan, this 
presentation was attended by: representatives from government bodies in charge of administering 
and controlling penitentiaries; from the Ministry of Interior, the general procuracy, the Supreme </p>

 <p> 
Court, the Ministry of justice, and the Institute for Human Rights and Democracy under the 
President of Turkmenistan. 
</p>
<p>505. On 7 March 2009, the regional representative of ICRC in Central Asia visited 
Turkmenistan, during which the proposal on a gradual introduction of the ICRC mandate on 
prison visits was discussed, and this proposal was taken into account. 
</p>
<p>506. On the recommendation to defend the human rights of journalists and human rights 
defenders, to let them peacefully carry out their activities without threat of being detained or 
imprisoned, the delegation stated that the human rights of journalists and human rights  
defenders are fully guaranteed and protected by Turkmenistan&#8217;s  fundamental law and by 
existing legislation.  In accordance with the new Constitution citizens have to right to freedom of 
thought and freedom of expression, as well as to receive information, if this information is not a 
State secret or otherwise secret information (art 28 of Constitution). Moreover, the delegation 
provided information, inter alia, that written press and other public media are free in 
Turkmenistan. 
</p>
<p>507. With respect to the recommendation to establish a constitutional court and ombudsman 
system, Turkmenistan provided information, inter alia, that the UNDAF 2010-2015 and the 
EU/OHCHR/UNDP projects included activities aimed at learning about the experience with 
constitutional courts and constitutional councils in other countries. There were also plans to 
undertake a monitoring of the human rights system in Turkmenistan, from which relevant 
proposals will be formulated regarding institutions and legislation. 
</p>
<p>508. On the recommendation of excluding impunity for torture and other unlawful treatment of 
prisoners and undertake independent investigations of such cases, information was provided on 
the relevant legal provisions, including part 2, article 23 of the Constitution, which stated that no 
citizen can be subject to torture, cruel or inhuman or humiliating treatment or punishment, nor 
subject without consent to medical or medicinal experiments (part 2, art 23). The delegation also 
stated that more detailed information on this issue will be presented in the national reports of 
Turkmenistan to the Human Rights Committee and to the Committee against Torture. Further 
information was also provided on study visits to penitentiary systems, proposals for reforms and 
plans for identifying international cooperation partners in this area.  At the end of 2008, work 
had also started on a new Code of Criminal Procedure in line with international standards, 
including the 1955 United Nations Minimum Standards. A joint project was also being 
implemented with UNICEF on reforming the system of juvenile justice, including on places of 
detention for minors.  
</p>
<p>509. A further recommendation requested Turkmenistan to take measures to liberalize and 
pluralize media and to remove all restrictions on criticizing the Government, without fear of 
retaliation and to end the practice of government appointment of editors and managers of media. 
Turkmenistan provided information on a special cabinet of ministers&#8217; meeting on 26 January 
2009 which was devoted to reforming the activities of the media, and in that context the need to 
improve media legislation and the question of specialist training were identified as important 
issues to address at present. Information was also provided on other recent developments, such 
as the invitation of an   expert from the BBC in 2008, plans for a series of activities including 
trainings, seminars, round-tables for representatives of the media, as well as practice abroad for 
specialists. Support to the media was also among the projects planned in the framework of joint </p>

 <p> 
cooperation between the Government and OSCE Center in Ashgabat. Information was provided, 
inter alia, on a training course that is taking place, from 30 March &#8211; 3 April, on activities of the 
media, for journalists, editors and staff of television and radio. The training will be given by 
journalists from Hungary, and the representative of OSCE on freedom of the media will 
intervene in this course. Together with USAID in Turkmenistan and Internews in Central Asia, 
cooperation is being planned regarding the improvement of laws regulating the media. A cycle of 
seminars in this context is starting in May. 
</p>
<p>510. On the recommendation related to remove restrictions on civil society organizations and 
human rights defenders, the delegation stated that civil society plays an important role in 
political life in Turkmenistan. Non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, 
professional and creative unions actively take part in determining the economic, social and 
cultural policies of organs of the Government.  Work is ongoing regarding the improvement of 
existing legislation on civil society organizations and its implementation in practice, and learning 
about international standards and experience form other countries in this field. International 
cooperation between Turkmenistan specialists and International Centre for Not-For-Profit Law 
(ICNL) is taking place, with the support of USAID, aimed at preparing recommendations 
thereon. 
</p>
<p>511. Concerning the recommendation to recognize conscientious objection to military service 
and with respect to recognizing the right of persons renouncing from military service on 
religious grounds, Turkmenistan provided information that conditions exist which allow for 
guaranteeing the right to freedom of religion and fulfil military duty by serving in non-military 
structures of the Ministry of Defense, such as medical and construction units. Turkmenistan also 
indicated that the process of improving the legislation on religious organizations is ongoing. 
Experts from ICNL are currently examining the existing legislation regulating the functioning of 
religious organizations with regard to its conformity with international norms. An agreement has 
been reached with the ICNL and USAID to hold a number of seminars and organize a 
presentation on the assessment which is currently being made.  These seminars should bring 
together international experts and representatives form the Parliament, the Ministry of Justice 
and other relevant bodies of Turkmenistan. Recommendations for legislative changes will be 
made based on: the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur, a review of international 
standards, foreign legislation, and the monitoring by the ICNL experts. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>512. The Russian Federation welcomed the successful Universal Periodic Review of 
Turkmenistan, a country with which it was linked by many years of close and friendly relations 
and thanked the delegation, inter alia, for its very detailed statement and its openness and 
willingness to engage in dialogue during the review of human rights in Turkmenistan. Russian 
Federation noted that most of the recommendations had been accepted  inter alia, thanks to 
progress in the sphere of human rights achieved by Turkmenistan in recent years.  It was 
confident that the efforts of the Turkmen Government to carry out broad reforms, designed to 
improve its educational health and social systems, and also to enhance the wellbeing of its 
people will be continued.   </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>513. Algeria reiterated its appreciation for the efforts made by the Government in order to 
promote human rights, inter alia, by the establishment of an inter-ministerial commission to 
follow-up and implement Turkmenistan&#8217;s human rights commitments, as well as the review of 
its domestic legislation. Algeria congratulated Turkmenistan for the progress made particularly 
in the field of education and encouraged the Government to step up its efforts in order to achieve 
the goals set for the promotion of human rights.    
</p>
<p>514. The United States of America welcomed Turkmenistan&#8217;s new Constitution and referred to 
several of its provisions. However, it noted that the judicial system, in practice, still lacks 
procedures to ensure fair trials, such as the right for defendants to call witnesses to testify on 
their behalf, the right to a defence attorney or a court-appointed attorney if the defendant cannot 
afford one, or the presumption of innocence. Turkmenistan was encouraged to adopt the 
recommendation on its conducting a review of all potentially political cases with a view to 
releasing all individuals incarcerated on politically motivated charges. The United States of 
America also urged Turkmenistan to accept the recommendations addressing restrictions on 
freedom of media, assembly, association, and religion.. The United States of America noted that, 
with its one-party rule, Turkmenistan remains politically monolithic, however the 
implementation of the recommendations aiming at increasing emphasis on education and access 
to the media will permit the realization of the reforms envisioned by  the new Constitution.  
</p>
<p>515. Azerbaijan referred to the adoption of a new Constitution and the successful parliamentary 
elections in 2008, which it believed are a clear testimony of Turkmenistan&#8217;s determination to 
ensure fundamental freedoms. Azerbaijan also highlighted the establishment of the State 
Commission on citizen&#8217;s complaints and Turkmenistan&#8217;s efforts to implement better its 
international obligations and to bring its domestic legislation into compliance with international 
human rights standards. Azerbaijan noted that Turkmenistan was in the process of acceding to 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. It 
also noted with satisfaction that the issuance of a standing invitation to Special Procedures&#8217; 
mandate holders in the near future is being envisaged by the relevant authorities, and that the 
Government is conducting active discussions on the issue of cooperation with the ICRC. 
Azerbaijan encouraged Turkmenistan to continue its efforts aimed at fully engaging in dialogue 
with the international human rights system and measures directed at speeding up the country&#8217;s 
democratic development. Azerbaijan called on the international community to give full support 
to the Turkmen Government in its endeavours, including through technical assistance.  
</p>
<p>516. Pakistan welcomed the inauguration of a new era of democratic rule in Turkmenistan and 
commended the steps taken by the Government to promote and protect human rights of all, 
including the adoption of the new Constitution, which guarantees fundamental freedoms and 
civil and political rights. It hoped that the further follow up of legal and administrative measures 
will be taken by the Government. Pakistan also mentioned as noteworthy the fact that 
Turkmenistan has accepted most of the recommendations made at the Working Group and was 
confident that concrete measures would be taken to implement them. Pakistan also noted the 
initiation of the process to accede to the OP-CEDAW. Pakistan noted the commitment by 
Turkmenistan to intensify its cooperation with several special procedures and that the recent visit 
of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief was noteworthy.  
</p>
<p> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>517. Action Canada for Population and Development (ACPD) commended the Government on 
changes in its political system and the new Constitution. Noting Turkmenistan&#8217;s commitment to 
cooperate with United Nations agencies and international organizations, it urged the 
Government, inter alia, to report publicly, accurately and comprehensively all health-related 
data, specifically, to disclose information about the HIV situation in the country and provide 
access to treatment for people living with HIV and adequate prevention services and information 
to the general public. With reference to recommendation 29 of the report, ACPD, called on the 
Turkmen Government to review the official policy on infectious diseases and allow for an 
objective assessment of the country&#8217;s situation, with the view of designing policies that will 
effectively guarantee the right of all Turkmen to the highest attainable level of health. It also 
requested the Government to clarify its position on recommendations contained in paragraphs 36 
(b) and 40 (e) and called on the Government to repeal article 135 of Turkmen Criminal Code to 
de-criminalize consensual same-sex behaviour among adults as, according to the Human Rights 
Committee, the criminalization of such acts constitutes a violation of Article 2 of the ICCPR, to 
which Turkmenistan is a Party. It requested that the Government ensure that non-governmental 
organizations, including those in the health sector and those supporting vulnerable groups, are 
able to freely register and operate without state interference or fear of reprisals.  
</p>
<p>518. Cercle de Recherche sur les Droits et les Devoirs de la Personne Humaine (CRED) noted 
the adoption of the new Constitution in September 2008, which establishes the primacy of 
international treaties over national Turkmen legislation. In this connection, it inquired about the 
measures taken by the Government to ensure that knowledge of international law is disseminated 
amongst magistrates and judges. 
</p>
<p>519. Human Rights Watch (HRW) welcomed the review of Turkmenistan as an opportunity to 
foster positive change in the policies of one of the most repressive governments in the world. It 
was encouraged by the acceptance of a number of recommendations, including against the 
harassment of journalists, religious communities, NGO registration and urged the 
implementation of these recommendations, as a matter of priority. HRW urged the Government 
to promptly implement the recommendation on cooperation with  United Nations special 
procedures who have requested an invitation. It also welcomed the commitment to cooperate 
with the ICRC and called for the clear acceptance of the recommendation to allow the ICRC to 
access places of detention; and to prevent torture. Another area of concern raised during the UPR 
is the severe repression of civil society, with independent activists and journalists facing a 
constant threat of government reprisal. HRW urged the Government to fully implement the 
recommendations to actually protect human rights defenders from persecution and end 
restrictions of the media. HRW deeply regretted the decision of Turkmenistan to reject a number 
of recommendations. It commented on the unknown numbers of people languishing in Turkmen 
prisons following unfair trials, with at least two having taken place during President 
Berdymukhamedov&#8217;s rule. It added that some of the cases were well-known, such as those of 
Mukhmetkuli Aymuradov, Annakurban Amanklychev, Sapardurdy Khajiev and Gulgeldy 
Annaniazov, and were raised during the working group session.  HRW stated that, while some 
individuals previously prevented from travelling abroad have now been able to travel, the system 
of restrictions de facto remained in place. It urged the Government to reconsider its position on 
rejected recommendations and also urged Turkmenistan&#8217;s partners to help ensure adequate 
follow up and implementation of the recommendations. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>520. Amnesty International (AI) welcomed Turkmenistan&#8217;s express support of 
recommendations to guarantee the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly; to 
seek, receive and impart information; to allow independent non-governmental organizations to 
register and work freely; and to end harassment and intimidation of journalists.  AI was deeply 
concerned about serious violations against human rights defenders, journalists and dissidents in 
Turkmenistan.  It had received reports that the two members of the Turkmen Helsinki 
Foundation had their appeal for pardon rejected by the President in 2008 and that both had been 
tortured while in custody. AI considered them as prisoners of conscience and urged their 
immediate release, as recommended during the review. AI was also very concerned that there 
appeared to have been no independent investigation into the unexplained death in custody of 
their co-defendant Ogulsapar Muradova in September 2006. AI urged Turkmenistan to 
reconsider the recommendation, made during the review (para 29 (d) of the report), to hold an 
independent inquiry into her death. AI also noted that recommendations made during the review 
were to be examined by Turkmenistan, including calls to protect human rights defenders, to 
eradicate impunity for torture and other ill-treatment, and to guarantee freedom of the press.  AI 
urged the Government to clearly indicate its full support of these key recommendations and 
ensure their prompt and full implementation.  AI further stated that earlier commitments of the 
new Government to carry out reform to strengthen the protection of human rights had still to be 
fully realized and called on the Government to use the opportunity of its review under the UPR 
to live up to those promises.  
</p>
<p>521. With reference to recommendations contained in paragraph 70 (12) of the report of the 
working group, Conscience and Peace Tax International (CPTI) noted, as a first step the 
preparation of the legislation allowing conscientious objectors to perform unarmed military 
service. CPTI encouraged Turkmenistan to make a careful study of international related- 
standards, including the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee, and to bring 
Turkmenistan&#8217;s legislation into line with them. It drew attention to Commission on Human 
Rights resolution 1998/77 which called for instituting alternative service that was compatible 
with the reasons for the objection. CPTI indicated that while unarmed military service meets the 
needs of those whose only objection is to personally bear arms, there are many whose conscience 
would not permit them to act in support of those who do. CPTI stated that Turkmenistan should 
bear in mind the recommendation not to imprison conscientious objectors and that any repeated 
punishment constitutes repeated punishment for the same offence.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>522. Turkmenistan expressed thanks for the recommendations, critical comments and 
constructive dialogue, and to the Troika. Turkmenistan&#8217;s policy was to further pursue the 
development and democratization of all aspects of civil society and the progressive strengthening 
of its system to protect human rights. With that aim, and with the support of international efforts 
and together with international organizations, activities and consultations were being undertaken 
to monitor existing legislation and to bring it in line with international instruments to which 
Turkmenistan is a party. Within the framework of activities of the Inter-ministerial Commission, 
Turkmenistan planned to establish a permanent monitoring of the human rights situation and to 
develop a national programme on human rights.  
</p>
<p>523. Replying to Action Canada for Population and Development, the delegation pointed out 
that concerning health care, under the new Constitution, as it also was under the old one, all </p>

 <p> 
citizens of Turkmenistan without exception have access to health-care services, and that more 
detailed information on that could be found in the national report to the CESCR.  
</p>
<p>524. Turkmenistan stated that all recommendations submitted by the delegations and 
international organizations under the UPR of Turkmenistan would be borne in mind in 
Turkmenistan&#8217;s future work aimed at progressively developing a human rights system. 
</p>
<p><b>Burkina Faso 
</b></p>
<p>525. The review of Burkina Faso was held on 9 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by Burkina Faso in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BFA/1); the compilation prepared by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BFA/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BFA/3). 
</p>
<p>526. At its 30th plenary meeting, on 19 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review on Burkina Faso (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>527. The outcome of the review on Burkina Faso is constituted of the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/80 and A/HRC/10/80/Corr.1), together 
with the views of Burkina Faso concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as 
its voluntary commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the 
plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue 
in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>528. Burkina Faso thanked States for their participation in the interactive dialogue with the 
President of the Council, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, members of the troika and 
the Secretariat of the Council. Burkina Faso noted that during the interactive dialogue, most of 
the recommendations had been accepted and that replies were given to the concerns expressed, 
although some issues would require further clarification.   
</p>
<p>529. With respect to adopting legislation to bring its national human rights institution in line 
with the Paris Principle, Burkina Faso indicated that there was currently a draft law being 
reviewed by the Council of Minister before its introduction before the Parliament.  
</p>
<p>530. Numerous recommendations asked for the abolition of death penalty and for the 
ratification of the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights abolishing the death penalty. Agreeing to the need to abolish the death penalty and 
reminding that Burkina Faso is a de facto abolitionist country, it noted that it currently favours 
the sensitisation of the elected representatives in order to guarantee the adoption of the draft law. 
</p>
<p>531. As to the concerns with respect of the extrajudicial executions in Balpor&#233; and Pi&#233;la, 
Burkina Faso explained that legal procedures had been initiated and were underway and that </p>

 <p> 
some people, including policemen, had been indicted.  It wished however to avoid confusing the 
normal course of justice and impunity which is when there is no action by the State. 
</p>
<p>532. Concerning the recommendations on legislatives, administrative and other measures to be 
taken to combat violence against women and girls, Burkina Faso highlighted that they already 
exist and were implemented. Burkina Faso intended to strengthen these measures and step up its 
awareness-raising programme in order to root out harmful traditional practices which still 
impede the full development of women of Burkina Faso.  
</p>
<p>533. Regarding polygamy, Burkina Faso noted that polygamist marriage was optional whereas 
monogamy was the rule. It added that, as one of the secular aspect of the culture of Burkina 
Faso, its elimination would require awareness-raising campaign otherwise it would force people 
to practice it illegally.   
</p>
<p>534. As regards women&#8217;s participation in decision-making bodies, Burkina Faso indicated that 
it had adopted a draft law on quota taking into account a representation level of 30 percent of 
either gender for local and legislative elections.  
</p>
<p>535. As to the concerns devoted to the rights of indigenous peoples in Burkina Faso, the 
delegation noted that the Government was not discriminating or marginalizing any ethnic group 
on a political, economic, social or cultural level. It indicated that there was no ethnic group 
historically marginalized in the country. Burkina Faso stated that it was devoted to promoting all 
cultures, to ensuring that, despite the shortage of resources, all regions of the country would 
benefit from a balanced socio-economic development. It underscored that the difficulties linked 
to health, education, and women and children&#8217;s condition were not specific to any ethnic group.  
</p>
<p>536. Burkina Faso indicated that, despite the numerous social and economic constraints and the 
adversity of nature, the weight of certain traditions and culture that were not always in line with 
human rights, the promotion and protection of human rights were an ongoing and irreversibly 
struggle. The challenges were still numerous and Burkina Faso indicated that it would therefore 
appreciate any support designed to help it implement the recommendations made in the 
framework of the Universal Periodic Review from the international community and thanked in 
particular Argentina and Brazil in that regard as they had already expressed their willingness to 
assist Burkina Faso. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>537. Algeria warmly thanked the delegation of Burkina Faso and its head for the presentation of 
the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review.  Algeria noted that the good quality of the 
national report of Burkina Faso enabled Algeria to assess the significant progress made in 
various aspects of human rights since its independence despite numerous challenges. Algeria 
encouraged Burkina Faso, as a developing country with limited resources, to continue its efforts 
designed to implement the commitments mentioned in its national report.  It called on the 
international community to support Burkina Faso in meeting its challenges.   
</p>
<p>538. The United States of America appreciated the comprehensive approach taken by Burkina 
Faso in the preparation of its national report.  It noted that Burkina Faso had arrested and </p>

 <p> 
sentenced several female genital mutilation practitioners and accomplices and welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to fully eradicate female genital mutilation and to share best 
practices with other countries.  The United States viewed the Government&#8217;s new anti-trafficking 
law as a positive development.  It noted the work of the Ministry of Human Rights, especially in 
regards to its educational campaigns.  It supported Burkina Faso&#8217;s request for appropriate 
international community and Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights technical 
assistance in consolidating human rights advancement on the ground.  
</p>
<p>539. Senegal praised the commitments of Burkina Faso to the promotion and protection of 
human rights, and welcomed with great satisfaction the acceptance of most of the 
recommendations made during the Universal Periodic Review Working Group.  Senegal did not 
doubt about Burkina Faso&#8217;s willingness to implement them, and was convinced this would 
contribute to further guarantee the full enjoyment of human rights in the country, particularly in 
relation to the rights to health and to education.  Senegal appreciated the efforts already made by 
Burkina Faso in the national context to take on board the concerns expressed during the Working 
Group. Senegal wished the Government of Burkina Faso every success in implementing those 
recommendations and called on the international community to provide any assistance Burkina 
Faso would need in this regard.     
</p>
<p>540. Nigeria welcomed the acceptance by Burkina Faso of most of the recommendations made 
to it and Burkina Faso&#8217;s pledge to implement them.  Nigeria recalled that during the review of 
Burkina Faso, it had commended the laudable achievements made by the country in the 
promotion and protection of human rights, particularly in the areas of primary education of the 
girl-child and the fight against female genital mutilation.  Nigeria looked forward to the 
improvement of human rights records in Burkina Faso in the second cycle of the review and 
called on the international community to assist Burkina Faso in its efforts to fulfil its human 
rights obligations.   
</p>
<p>541. Cameroon welcomed the presence at the adoption meeting of the Minister for the 
Promotion of Human Rights of Burkina Faso, whose devotion to human rights had been 
constant. Cameroon stated that Burkina Faso&#8217;s commitment to establish a real culture of human 
rights had been shown at the Universal Periodic Review in December 2008. It indicated that 
numerous challenges had still to be met but had no doubt as to the success to come and called on 
the international community to help Burkina Faso to meet its objectives in the field of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>542. Brazil welcomed the presence of the Minister for the Promotion of Human Rights of 
Burkina Faso whose speech confirmed the will of Burkina Faso expressed during the interactive 
dialogue of the Universal Periodic Review Working Group to the full promotion and protection 
of human rights in the country. Brazil noted however the challenges ahead as acknowledged in 
the national report of Burkina Faso (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BFA/1, paragraph 95). Brazil noted that the 
international community was responsible for demonstrating its will to give the necessary support 
to help Burkina Faso in implementing the recommendations presented during the Working 
Group. On the basis of its capacity and good practice, Brazil expressed its commitment to assist 
Burkina Faso to that end.     
</p>
<p>543. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire thanked the delegation of Burkina Faso for the presentation which reflected 
the importance given by the country to human rights in general and to the Universal Periodic </p>

 <p> 
Review in particular. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire noted with satisfaction that Burkina Faso had agreed to most 
of the recommendations made in the Working Group in December 2008. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire stressed 
the need to give the necessary support to Burkina Faso, helping it in the tremendous amount of 
reform it needed to carry out to ensure the rule of law in a modern democracy. 
</p>
<p>544. Djibouti welcomed the presence of the Minister at the adoption session and appreciated the 
open approach and the constructive attitude, which prevailed during the Universal Periodic 
Review process of Burkina Faso. Djibouti praised the commitments expressed by Burkina Faso 
for the promotion and protection of human rights. It noted that most concerns and 
recommendations formulated during the interactive dialogue of 9 December 2008 had received 
appropriate responses and stated that financial resources and technical assistance would be 
appropriate to follow-up on certain recommendations.  Djibouti expressed hope that attention 
would be made to Burkina Faso&#8217;s appeal for assistance.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>545. Action Canada for Population and Development (ACPD) congratulated Burkina Faso for 
the efforts made in promoting human rights and for the consultations held in the framework of 
the Universal Periodic Review. Under paragraph 44 of the Working Group report, ACPD 
reminded Burkina Faso of the need to expedite the building of new reform centres in order to 
improve detention conditions of detainees, as well as to improving education and social 
reintegration of children in conflict with the law. ACPD recalled paragraph 49 of the Working 
Group report concerning the need to mobilize further civil society stakeholders and involve them 
in activities to combat female genital mutilation as well as HIV/AIDS. Such mobilization helped 
reduce the number of HIV/AIDS infections. ACPD stressed the importance of disseminating 
information on the law to combat excision in rural areas and to have this law translated into the 
various local languages. In reference to the Working Group report, ACPD reminded Burkina 
Faso to step up its efforts to include information on human rights in school programmes and to 
provide youth workers with human rights education and training material in order to promote 
human rights education through youth centres.  
</p>
<p>546. Franciscans International (FI) welcomed the recommendations concerning trafficking in 
persons accepted by Burkina Faso. It noted Burkina Faso&#8217;s commitment to intensify its efforts in 
combating trafficking in women and girls for the purposes of sexual exploitation. FI stated that 
trafficking in persons in Burkina Faso also took place for the purposes of forced labour, mainly 
involving children. It indicated that an overall approach to trafficking was required, and should 
be based on the effective implementation of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime ratified by Burkina Faso. FI further noted 
that Burkina Faso was a country of origin, transit, and destination for trafficking in persons in 
rural and urban areas. In addition to stepping up the National Action Plan, as recommended 
during the Universal Periodic Review, FI highlighted the need to apply a regional strategy for 
combating trafficking in human beings, particularly through the effective implementation of the 
agreements reached on 6 July 2006 in Abuja. FI encouraged Burkina Faso to invite the Special 
Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons and urged it to reconsider rejecting the recommendations 
calling for extending a standing invitation to all Special Procedures mandate holders. FI noted 
that the mismanagement of the agricultural sector was one of the reasons for the severe impact of 
the food crisis on Burkina Faso in 2008. Recalling Burkina Faso&#8217;s commitment to continue its </p>

efforts to consolidate economic, social and cultural rights, it encouraged the Government to pay 
particular attention to the right to food and recommended that it set up a national body to analyse 
the causes and consequences of the food crisis and to develop guidelines that would constitute a 
framework programme.  
</p>
<p>547. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) noted the numerous 
commitments taken by Burkina Faso in the Working Group report, in particular in paragraphs 7 
to 33. FIDH deplored, nonetheless, the fact that most of the recommendations not accepted by 
Burkina Faso were areas of serious concern to the people of Burkina Faso. FIDH noted in 
particular that the recommendation as to the independence of the justice mentioned in paragraph 
58 (a) was rejected whereas the impediments to the independence and good functioning of the 
judiciary remained considerable, leading to a crisis of confidence in this connection. It further 
noted that the recommendations on the freedom of the press had not been accepted by Burkina 
Faso either. FIDH stressed that, at the beginning of 2009, a number of journalists had been 
threatened due to their investigations on the financial dealings of certain public officials. FIDH 
called on Burkina Faso to take into account all of the recommendations made during the 
Universal Periodic Review, and in particular to guarantee the independence of the judiciary, the 
freedom of expression through a free and independent press, to ratify the Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to adopt a law abolishing the death 
penalty and commuting all death sentences already pronounced to alternative penalties and to 
allow Special Procedures mandate holders to visit the country. 
</p>
<p>548. The Cercle de Recherche sur les Droits et les Devoirs de la Personne Humaine (CRED) 
stated that the people of Burkina Faso were known to be free and honest and that the government 
had made the promotion of human rights the focus of its national policy and its legal and 
normative approach. CRED noted that the Constitution of Burkina Faso proclaims peoples&#8217; 
rights and duties, and congratulated Burkina Faso for being at the forefront of positions defended 
by it, namely that human rights and duties are indivisible and must be promoted conjointly. 
CRED indicated that, for a long time, the concept of human duty was forgotten by the Human 
Rights Council and requested Burkina Faso to assist in the adoption of a draft universal 
declaration on the duties of the human being. It expressed the hope that Burkina Faso would 
spare no effort in implementing the conclusions and recommendations formulated during the 
course of the dialogue. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>549. Burkina Faso reiterated its thanks to the members of the troika - Madagascar, Qatar and 
Switzerland - and to all States and stakeholders that participated in the discussion. It reaffirmed 
the will of Burkina Faso to implement the recommendations it accepted mentioned in the 
Working Group report. 
</p>
<p>550. Due to time constraints, Burkina Faso referred some States and stakeholders to its national 
report (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BFA/1) and to the Universal Periodic Review Working Group Report 
(A/HRC/10/80 and A/HRC/10/80/Corr.1). As to the recommendation of issuing a standing 
invitation to Special Procedures mandate holders, Burkina Faso indicated that it had always 
cooperated with the United Nations Special Procedures and the African Special mechanisms and 
would always carefully consider such invitations. As to mismanagement of the agricultural 
campaign, Burkina Faso indicated that the crop season was excellent and managed to the full </p>

 <p> 
satisfaction of rural workers and farmers. As to freedom of the press, Burkina Faso reaffirmed 
that the freedom of the press was recognized and respected. Regarding death threats to 
journalists and reporters issued on the internet, Burkina Faso indicated that it was doing its best 
to find the culprits and that it would appreciate any information in this regard. As to abolishing 
the death penalty, Burkina Faso indicated that it was currently under study and believed  that at 
the next Universal Periodic Review, it would have become a de jure abolitionist State.  
</p>
<p>551. Burkina Faso stated that the Universal Periodic Review was an important stage in the 
ongoing and irreversible human rights process. It underscored that Burkina Faso is ready to hold 
discussion with all stakeholders to make progress human rights and is open to all criticism and 
all constructive proposals.  
</p>
<p>552. Finally, Burkina Faso reiterated its commitment to permanently and irreversibly promote 
and protect human rights. Together with the support of the international community and the civil 
society, Burkina Faso was convinced that human rights would progressively develop in their 
effectiveness.  Therefore, it expressively asked for technical assistance to the Human Rights 
Council, in particular regarding the implementation of the following rights: 
</p>
<p> (a) Education, including human rights education; 
</p>
<p> (b) Health and sanitation;  
</p>
<p> (c) Housing;  
</p>
<p> (d) Information to rural populations; 
</p>
<p> (e) Capacity strengthening of the Ministry of Justice in order to improve prisons&#8217; 
conditions-even though enormous efforts have already been made to make the judiciary 
independent;  
</p>
<p> (f) Rights of women and children; 
</p>
<p> (g) Rights of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>553. Burkina Faso added that it was already cooperating with other countries in the region to 
combat trafficking and sexual exploitation of children and that concrete measures were 
implemented in the ground to fight this scourge. Burkina Faso noted that it had ratified various 
international human rights instruments in that regard and that its national law already sanctions 
trafficking in children. 
</p>
<p><b>Cape Verde 
</b></p>
<p>554. The review of Cape Verde was held on 10 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/CPV/2); and 
the summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/3/CPV/3). </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>555. At its 31st meeting, on 20 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Cape Verde (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>556. The outcome of the review on Cape Verde is constituted of the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/81), together with the views of Cape Verde 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions 
as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>557. The representative of the Republic of Cape Verde reiterated the resolve of the Government 
to pursue the process of the Universal Periodic Review. He thanked all delegations that 
intervened in the inter-active dialogue in December 2008, making relevant comments and 
recommendations, which allowed an in-depth analysis of the human rights situation in the 
country.   
</p>
<p>558. Cape Verde stated that, as underlined in December, the Constitution enshrined the absolute 
character of the dignity of the human being and ensures that all Cape-Verdean citizens enjoy 
rights and freedoms, including the right to life and to integrity, the right to participate in the 
political life and to exercise rights inherent to citizenship.  Furthermore, the Constitution 
recognizes the rights of foreign residents and of foreigners temporarily living in the country, 
protects the right to work and the right not to be the subject of discrimination, as well as 
economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>559. Cape Verde acceded to the main international human rights instruments such as the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination; The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 
Women; the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment; the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols on the Sale of 
Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and on the involvement of Children in 
Armed Conflict; the Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. 
</p>
<p>560. With regard to the recommendations contained in the Working Group&#8217;s report 
A/HRC/10/81, the representative for Cape Verde stated that recommendations 11, 12, 15, 24, 38, 
40, 41, 45, 47, 49 and 50 were accepted and measures for their implementation will be taken as 
soon as possible.  
</p>
<p>561. Regarding recommendations 1, 13, 18 and 22, he noted that Cape Verde&#8217;s domestic 
legislation already prohibits all forms of violence by law enforcement officials, and that the 
monitoring and follow-up of relevant provisions will continue.  
</p>
<p>562. As far as recommendations 2, 16, 19, 21, 28 and 48 were concerned, Cape Verde&#8217;s judicial 
system already adopted a number of instruments for the protection the right of the child and </p>

 <p> 
minors, in particular the new Criminal Code, adopted in 2004, which notably represses violence 
within the family circle. 
</p>
<p>563. With regard to recommendations 3, 8, 14, 42 and 43, the Government of Cape Verde is in 
the process of implementing the National Plan of Action against Gender Violence for the period 
2009-2011. This plan foresees provisions for the integration of foreign women, and against all 
forms of violence, including trafficking.   
</p>
<p>564. The Government will also commence or finalize the process of accession or ratification of 
international instruments as mentioned in recommendations 6, 7, 25, 26, 27, 31 and 39.  
</p>
<p>565. As regards recommendations 9 and 29, the Government already adopted Decree-Law n&#176; 
2/2006, on 27 November 2006, on protection measures in the social and education fields, with a 
view to educating minors, for their dignified and responsible insertion into the society. A status 
law on children and adolescents is being elaborated.  
</p>
<p>566. The Government will pursue its efforts in relation to the implementation of 
recommendations 10, 18, 22 and 35.  A vast reform programme on the penitentiary system, 
which includes training for prisons officers and the inauguration of two new detention centres, 
will solve prisons overcrowding problems.   
</p>
<p>567. With regard to recommendations 20, 23, 30, 31, 33, 37 and 44,the representative of Cape 
Verde reiterated that, all instruments of the domestic legislation guarantee equality between men 
and women and prohibit all forms of discrimination.          
</p>
<p>568. Concerning recommendation 34, he noted that the action of the government was guided by 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the relevant ILO conventions and the African Charter 
on the Rights and Welfare of the . Indeed, the most recent legislation on labour set the minimum 
age for admission to work at 15 years.  
</p>
<p>569. The Government of Cape Verde did not record any allegation of discrimination against the 
groups mentioned in recommendation 36. Domestic legislation neither forbids nor represses 
individual behaviours unless minors are involved.  
</p>
<p>570. The Government had already taken action with regard to the contents of recommendations 
4, 17 and 46.  In conclusion, all recommendations made in the report of the Working Group were 
accepted, with the exception of recommendations 5 and 32, which will continue to be examined 
by the Government.   
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>571. Algeria thanked Cape Verde for the information provided in addition to presentation made 
at the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review in December 2008.  Algeria expressed 
appreciation for the efforts made by the authorities to promote human rights domestically and 
encouraged them to persist in this effort.  
</p>
<p>572. Senegal thanked Cape Verde for its clear presentation and for accepting several 
recommendations made during the review. Senegal stated that the efforts made by Cape Verde </p>

 <p> 
for the consolidation of its achievements and for the improvement of the rights of its citizens, 
deserved Senegal&#8217;s laud and encouragement. Senegal wished the authorities of Cape Verde full 
success in their resolute efforts to ensure that effective consideration is given to the rights of the 
child and women, as well as to the elimination of poverty, promotion of education and health. 
Senegal expressed hope that the international community will provide Cape Verde with support 
in its efforts to continuously improve the human rights situation.  
</p>
<p>573. Brazil welcomed the openness and the constructive spirit of Cape Verde during the review 
process, and its commitment to the full realization of all human rights. Brazil highlighted the 
steps taken and aims of Cape Verde, as stated in the report of the Working Group, in the fight 
against sexual exploitation and ill treatment of children, as well as juvenile justice. Brazil 
commended Cape Verde for the enactment of the new Penal Process Code and the new Labour 
Code. Brazil stated its confidence that Cape Verde will continue to overcome its main challenges 
in the field of human rights, along with the objective to reach sustainable development and 
combat poverty. In a constructive and cooperative spirit, Brazil reiterated its recommendations 
and highlighted that it is ready to cooperate with Cape Verde in the areas the country deemed as 
most necessary and appropriate. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>574. Conectas Direitos Humanos (with the support of the Cape Verdean Women Jurists&#8217; 
Association) expressed regret that Cape Verde failed to submit a written report and to engage in 
a broad consultation process during the Universal Periodic Review interactive dialogue. It 
conveyed its hope that for the next cycle these aspects will be improved.  Despite this regret, 
Conectas stressed its appreciation for the efforts to strengthen democracy and human rights, and 
decrease illiteracy and child mortality rates.  Conectas urged Cape Verde to continue 
improvements in women&#8217;s rights especially in the area of law reform, to accept the Universal 
Periodic Review recommendations made by France and Slovenia with regards to violence 
against women, and reflect such changes in the Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>575. Cercle de Recherche sur les Droits et les Devoirs de la Personne Humaine (CRED) stated 
its appreciation for the fact that life expectancy in Cape Verde has risen, but it questioned the 
disparities between life expectancy for men and women.  CRED recommended that Cape Verde 
undertake a global study to explain such disparity and also address the connection between life 
expectancy and the effective enjoyment of human rights.  CRED invited all States members of 
the Council to cooperate in the realization of this study. 
</p>
<p>576. Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network congratulated the country for accepting 
recommendations dealing with programs to combat HIV/AIDS and promoting greater tolerance 
for the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgendered community.      
</p>
<p><b>4. Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>577. The representative of Cape Verde stated that the Government was committed to continue 
its cooperation and constructive dialogue with all national and international institutions for the 
reinforcement of human rights in the country.  The lack of financial resources was the main 
obstacle that prevented further action in the implementation of recommendations, such as human 
rights education.  This obstacle was also affecting the struggle for the eradication of poverty, </p>

 <p> 
access to water, improving health and satisfying other basic needs of the population. The States 
that made recommendations had good mutual relationships with Cape Verde and the 
Government was relying on them, since without their support, it will be difficult to achieve 
additional results. 
</p>
<p><b>Colombia 
</b></p>
<p>578. The review of Colombia was held on 10 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by Colombia in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/COL/1); the compilation prepared by the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/COL/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/COL/3). 
</p>
<p>579. At its 31st meeting, on 20 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Colombia (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>580. The outcome of the review on Colombia is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/82), together with the views of Colombia 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/10/82/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions 
as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>581. The delegation of Colombia thanked member states and troika members for their active 
part in its review. Colombia recalled its involvement in the institution-building process of the 
United Nations human rights system, saying it had great faith in multilateralism, which reflects 
the democratic values on which the structures of the Colombian State were founded. 
</p>
<p>582. It said the UPR process had led the country&#8217;s institutions to reflect deeply on finding better 
ways to coordinate efforts to guarantee the rights of all in the country. The process of reporting 
had given Colombia an opportunity to hear the voices of social organisations and local 
authorities, to strengthen coordination between institutions, review practices, identify 
achievements and shortcomings and plan for the immediate future. It noted the concerns and 
recommendations made by States and reminded delegates that Colombia had accepted most of 
the recommendations. Over the past three months, the Government undertook a detailed review 
of the voluntary commitments made by Colombia and the recommendations accepted, enabling it 
to assign responsibilities and set targets. From 10 June 2009, the webpage of the Presidential 
Human Rights Programme will carry a report on follow-up to the implementation of 
recommendations and commitments. This webpage will be updated every four months. 
</p>
<p>583. The efforts undertaken by Colombia over the last quarter since the review included 
extending official invitations in January to the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial executions; 
the rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples; the independence of judges and </p>

 <p> 
lawyers; and the Secretary-General&#8217;s Special Representative on human rights defenders. 
Colombia also voluntarily accepted implementation of the Mechanism to Supervise and Present 
Reports contained in Security Council Resolution 1612 on Children in Armed Conflicts. The 
High Level Inter-sectoral Commission that defines the Government&#8217;s public policy on 
preventing the recruitment of children has produced a report of its first-year activities for the 
United Nations taskforce on this mechanism. Colombia also continues to work with the 
international community in following up on the implementation of the recommendations made 
by the OHCHR in 2008. 
</p>
<p>584. The delegation said Colombia had strengthened its fight against crime and all forms of 
violence; that new legislation has been enacted and new practices to prevent violations by law 
enforcement officials have been developed, including public accountability for complaints 
received. Strict measures had been taken with regards to the repeated complaints on murders by 
such officials, it said, and no further complaints had been received since October 2008.  
</p>
<p>585. Progress has also been made in eliminating anti-personnel mines, through humanitarian 
demining operations. Work continues in strengthening the justice system and eliminating 
impunity. In recent weeks, the President approved a new law on intelligence gathering, 
establishing mechanisms to ensure transparency. Efforts to guarantee economic social and 
cultural rights continue, particularly in the spheres of health and education. 
</p>
<p>586. The report of the Inter-American Press Society for 2008 acknowledged progress made in 
providing guarantees for the exercise of journalism in Colombia. The delegation cited the 
decision by the Constitutional Court, as a result of complaints by civil society, to grant equal 
treatment, in terms of rights and responsibilities before the law, to same sex unions. It said the 
decision represents significant progress towards overcoming discrimination. 
</p>
<p>587. Such progress did not mean that the State was unaware of the enormous challenges that 
still existed. The Government shared the Council&#8217;s concerns on the persistence of the 
phenomenon of internal displacement in Colombia. The efforts of national institutions were 
focused on reviewing prevention and protection strategies to resolve this difficult situation. The 
Constitutional Court has introduced important developments, addressing vulnerable sectors such 
as indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities, children, persons with disabilities, and 
displaced women. It assured the Council that no resources were being spared in tackling this 
issue but challenges remained. 
</p>
<p>588. On indigenous communities and their right to life, physical integrity and their territory, 
Colombia noted the massacre last February of 80 members of the Awa indigenous community by 
the FARC, who wanted to keep the coca plantations in the Awa territory. In recovering one of 
the bodies, 50 anti-personnel mines had to be deactivated. 
</p>
<p>589. Colombia was also concerned about complaints relating to threats and harassment of 
human rights defenders. The Government has asked the Prosecutor-General&#8217;s Office to do its 
best to establish the facts, and to identify and punish those responsible. It hoped that dialogue 
with civil society would help identify effective measures to work together towards establishing 
the right climate for the work of human rights defenders. The Government reiterated its 
conviction that dialogue with and participation of civil society strengthen the enjoyment of 
human rights in Colombia. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>590. Colombia said it has faced grave threats against its institutions and population with a 
security policy that is compatible with human rights. The UPR has allowed Colombia to share its 
achievements and challenges. Its achievements are the results of the efforts of Colombia&#8217;s 
people, civil society organizations, institutions, and the international community, which they also 
count on in overcoming the remaining challenges in putting an end to violence and organized 
crime. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>591. The Russian Federation thanked Colombia for its exhaustive and focused approach to 
issues raised by Russia during the review, adding that this attentive and respectful attitude could 
serve as an example. It noted that Colombia&#8217;s major efforts to combat poverty were especially 
significant during the present economic crisis. Colombia&#8217;s voluntary commitments in human 
rights protection led it to establish a national control mechanism for their implementation, a fact 
which testifies to the state&#8217;s firm intention to meet high standards of human rights promotion and 
protection. It expressed respect for Colombia&#8217;s great desire to combat the challenges it faced and 
was convinced of the Government&#8217;s efforts to ensure human rights protection and the well-being 
of its people. 
</p>
<p>592. Brazil welcomed Colombia&#8217;s transparency and constructive spirit in participating in the 
UPR, a sign of its resolve to engage in dialogue and cooperation with the United Nations in the 
field of human rights, which should serve as an example. It was also a clear signal of Colombia&#8217;s 
desire to overcome outstanding challenges. Brazil supported Colombia&#8217;s efforts to implement 
UPR recommendations by identifying the challenges and noted it was time for United Nations 
members to demonstrate their desire to help others in overcoming such challenges. 
</p>
<p>593. The Netherlands commended Colombia&#8217;s strong commitment to the UPR process, 
including its written responses to questions. It welcomed the acknowledgement that security 
forces are responsible for unlawfully killing civilians and that steps are being taken by the 
Government to address these extrajudicial executions. It encouraged the Government to ensure 
that all cases of human rights violations implicating the security forces are investigated by the 
civilian justice system. Noting that Colombia&#8217;s voluntary commitments include addressing 
impunity and guaranteeing access for justice, especially in remote and rural areas, it wished to 
learn more about progress made in this regard. It appreciated the Government&#8217;s willingness 
towards constructive dialogue with human rights NGOs, highlighting the recommendations made 
in this regard. It commended the establishment of a follow-up procedure by the Government, 
suggesting that it give midterm updates to the Council. 
</p>
<p>594. Spain commended Colombia&#8217;s special interest in the UPR, its acceptance of more than 60 
recommendations, its individual replies to questions put during the review process, its high-level 
commitment and particularly for the many important voluntary commitments. Spain expressed 
concern about threats to human rights defenders, particularly against the Colombian Commission 
of Jurists, and commended the Government for voluntary commitments undertaken relative to 
paragraph 91 of the Working Group report. 
</p>
<p>595. The United States of America welcomed Colombia&#8217;s constructive dialogue with NGOs. It 
joined the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders in strongly supporting civil society </p>

 <p> 
efforts to use the UPR as a tool for advocacy and accountability. It appreciated Colombia&#8217;s 
voluntary commitment to improve protection for the rights of reporters, trade unionists and 
human rights defenders, adding that prosecution of crimes against them and establishment of a 
rule of law environment for their operation would strengthen security and peace in Colombia. It 
acknowledged the challenges Colombia faced, particularly violence by illegally armed groups. It 
called on Colombia to continue confronting violence and abuses in conformity with its human 
rights and international humanitarian obligations. Welcoming efforts to battle impunity and seek 
remedies for victims, it encouraged the Government&#8217;s commitment towards transparent 
investigations and due process for all accused perpetrators. It recommended that Colombia work 
to prevent and fully prosecute extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances and forced 
displacements and supported efforts to strengthen the national plan for the search for missing 
persons. 
</p>
<p>596. Switzerland thanked the Government for its commitment and noted how important it was 
that the Colombian parliament adopts a law on victims complying with international standards to 
provide guaranteed access to justice and adequate reparations for all victims, including victims 
of actions by state representatives. While recognizing efforts to combat murder of civilians by 
members of law enforcement authorities, it supported OHCHR recommendations for greater 
operational control and for effective, impartial investigations to ensure those responsible be 
brought to justice. It called for a full investigation of the murder of Edwin Legarda, husband of 
the indigenous representative Aida Quilque, who had, a few days prior to the murder, 
participated in the UPR of Colombia in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>597. Belgium said Colombia participated constructively in its UPR and hoped the 
implementation of recommendations accepted by the Government would help improve the 
human rights situation. It welcomed the decision to accept visits from various special rapporteurs 
and the commitment to continue cooperating with the OHCHR, including in the implementation 
of recommendations. It acknowledged steps taken to put an end to human rights violations, but 
noted that considerable challenges remained. It encouraged the Government to guarantee, in the 
framework of ongoing legislative proposals, access to justice and the right to reparations in a 
non-discriminatory manner in conformity with international norms. 
</p>
<p>598. France welcomed Colombia&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendation to ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, encouraging further 
efforts to enable it to enter into force soon. It regretted that Colombia did not intend to recognize 
the jurisdiction of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances, since this key innovative element 
would have an important preventive effect. It asked Colombia to reconsider and accept its 
jurisdiction. It also noted that the fight against impunity should be prioritized and invited 
Colombia to reconsider its refusal to accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court 
for war crimes. It urged the Government to reconsider its refusal to ratify OP-CAT. 
</p>
<p>599. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the Government&#8217;s 
positive engagement on the UPR, but added that concerns have continued to emerge in its 
aftermath. It noted the killing of Mr. Legarda, extending its condolences to Mrs. Quilque and 
calling on Colombia to ensure justice and accountability for those responsible. It strongly 
condemned the massacre in February of 27 members of the vulnerable Awa indigenous 
community by the FARC. Noting with concern continuing threats against trade unionists and 
others, it said those responsible must be vigorously pursued and brought to justice. It urged </p>

 <p> 
authorities to do their utmost to promote and protect the roles of human rights defenders, 
journalists, civil society organizations, trade unionists and those who represent the most 
vulnerable, including the indigenous population. Defenders should not be stigmatized, officially 
or otherwise. The United Kingdom would continue working with international partners and civil 
society to maintain the positive momentum of the UPR process in helping Colombia address the 
threat of illegal armed groups and to bring lasting and robust improvements in human rights. 
</p>
<p>600. Guatemala commended Colombia&#8217;s positive attitude to the recommendations made. It 
noted the constant challenges that existed for Colombia, and for itself, and welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to improving the human rights of its citizens and the openness and 
cooperation shown to treaty bodies, mandate-holders and to the Council and its various bodies 
generally. It also welcomed the detailed replies it received to the questions and suggestions 
made. 
</p>
<p>601. China thanked Colombia for its frank, open and constructive attitude to the UPR in the 
presentation of its efforts, achievements and challenges in human rights promotion and 
protection. It welcomed Colombia&#8217;s serious answers and written replies to questions raised by 
states, including China, and the establishment of follow-up mechanisms to implement the 
accepted recommendations. It was convinced that, in light of specific conditions in the country, 
the Government would overcome difficulties and make new achievements in human rights. 
</p>
<p>602. Panama welcomed Colombia&#8217;s replies to questions and recommendations, congratulating 
the Government and civil society for the high quality review, which was open, with dialogue, 
responsibility and great commitment. Panama highlighted Colombia&#8217;s establishment of a 
procedure for follow up of recommendations accepted and the voluntary commitments 
undertaken. Panama was convinced that the UPR would become a practical instrument, serving 
to continually improve and inspire states like Colombia to design and implement mechanisms, 
enabling progress on the basis of the recommendations and by assessing national policies. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>603. The Colombian Commission of Jurists and the World Organization Against Torture 
dedicated their statement, on behalf of 1,200 Colombian organisations, to Mr. Legarda, who was 
murdered after his wife participated in the UPR working group in December. It highlighted both 
the violations of humanitarian law and human rights committed by the guerrilla, and the 
Colombian state&#8217;s lack of compliance with its human rights obligations and commitments. It 
noted the human rights issues raised during the review which are persisting in Colombia, 
including extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, torture, sexual violence, recruitment 
of children and forced displacement, violations that particularly affect indigenous peoples and 
Afro-Colombian communities, women and children. It stressed that paramilitaries linked to the 
authorities were not dismantled and were benefiting from impunity; the executive meddles in the 
judicial branch; victims have not received compensation due to the many failures in the 
implementation of the &#8220;justice and peace&#8221; law; increased harassment of human rights defenders, 
unionists and journalists by high-ranking officials; that inequalities have not decreased; and there 
are no guarantees to health, education, food and adequate housing for many. It hoped the 
Government&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations would result in serious measures and called for 
acceptance of all the recommendations. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>604. The World Organisation Against Torture, on behalf of Human Rights First, Front Line and 
the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, said the treatment of human 
rights defenders emerged as a key theme of the review, demonstrating their precarious situation 
in Colombia. It welcomed Colombia&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations in this regard and its 
commitment to provide guarantees and protection measures for human rights defenders to carry 
out their work. But it said defenders continued to pay a heavy price, condemning the 
assassination of Mr. Legarda. It urged Colombia&#8217;s adoption of the many recommendations to 
acknowledge the legitimacy of human rights advocacy, but said senior officials continued to 
falsely label defenders as terrorists. It called on the President to issue and enforce a directive 
prohibiting public officials from making false imputations that compromise the security or 
reputation of defenders. It expressed grave concern on the numerous threats and attacks against 
defenders, such as the recent death threats against a member of the Colombian Commission of 
Jurists. It urged Colombia to address the serious problem of baseless criminal prosecutions of 
defenders, saying the Prosecutor-General should pass a resolution enabling his Human Rights 
Unit to review all criminal investigations against human rights defenders in line with 
fundamental due process standards. It urged Colombia to immediately release from prison 
defenders who remain unjustly detained. 
</p>
<p>605. The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) welcomed statements recommending that 
Colombia protect unionists, human rights defenders, women, displaced persons, journalists, 
children, indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants. It welcomed Colombia&#8217;s acceptance of 
many recommendations but expressed concern at the increasing number of crimes against 
unionists: from 37 in 2007, to 45 in 2008. Seven workers have been murdered so far in 2009 and 
two have disappeared. The WFTU added that indigenous communities continue to be threatened, 
citing a number of threats of social cleansing at the entrance of the Wayuu communities at the 
Guajira department. It noted that establishment of unions can entail serious reprisals, citing the 
sacking of 22 workers in Cartagena in February for considering unionizing.  
</p>
<p>606. The Social Service Agency of the Protestant Church in Germany, also on behalf of 
OIDHACO, said interventions during Colombia&#8217;s review reflected the gravity of the situation. It 
hoped the Council would create effective mechanisms to follow up on recommendations beyond 
the voluntary submissions by reviewed states and without waiting four years. It added that the 
armed conflict has led to disturbing levels of degradation caused by all the armed stakeholders, 
citing the massacre by the FARC of 18 indigenous Awa in Nari&#241;o in February. It highlighted the 
high number of extrajudicial executions by armed forces and was disturbed by the Government&#8217;s 
underestimation of the seriousness of the situation. It noted the telephone tapping by Colombian 
information services against magistrates of the Supreme Court, and against members of the 
opposition, human rights defenders and journalists. It also cited the extradition of 17 paramilitary 
commanders as a serious obstacle to justice, preventing important revelations from emerging if 
they had been questioned in Colombia. It added that high-ranking officials&#8217; declarations against 
journalists, rights defenders and unionists resulted in serious threats against them. 
</p>
<p>607. International PEN and World Press Freedom Committee welcomed Colombia&#8217;s 
commitments in relation to journalists, including: improving guarantees of their rights; 
encouraging investigations of crimes against them; and fostering a culture in which it is easier 
for journalists to work. They noted with satisfaction that there were no deadly attacks on print 
journalists in Colombia in 2008, unlike the preceding two years, but were alarmed by the high 
number of those who continue to be threatened and intimidated in relation to their work. They </p>

 <p> 
asked that Colombia provide journalists who are threatened and attacked with adequate 
guarantees of their safety, urging the Government to take measures ensuring that such journalists 
are not further endangered by comments made by public officials that could exacerbate threats 
and violence against them. They said the state must not only encourage investigations of such 
crimes but ensure that such prompt, independent, thorough and impartial investigations take 
place. The pertinent institutions must speed up outstanding investigations and bring to justice 
those who have committed crimes against journalists. 
</p>
<p>608. Conscience and Peace Tax International (CPTI) noted that Colombia rejected the 
recommendation to recognize the right of conscientious objection to military service. CPTI 
reminded Colombia that no domestic legislation or constitutional provisions can override its 
international treaty obligations, and that article 93 of the constitution states that such obligations 
take priority over domestic law. It cited the Human Rights Committee decision in 2006 that 
conscientious objection to military service is a protected manifestation of religious belief within 
article 18 of the ICCPR. With specific reference to Colombia, in a 2008 opinion concerning 
cases of forcible recruitment, the Working Group on arbitrary detention found all three cases to 
constitute arbitrary detention. With regard to two conscientious objectors, CPTI was of the view 
that their recruitment was in breach of article 18 of the ICCPR and a clear violation of their 
affirmation of conscience. CPTI called on Colombia to urgently reconsider its position on this 
issue. 
</p>
<p>609. Action Canada for Population and Development (ACPD) said that the Colombian court 
decision giving homosexual couples the same rights as heterosexual couples remained dead 
letter. It noted also the non-implementation of a Human Rights Committee decision that a 
homosexual man should be allowed to receive his partner&#8217;s pension. Regarding police abuses, 
ACPD supported OHCHR comments on the murders of transvestites and supported statements 
by the World Organization Against Torture on crimes against transvestites. It called on the 
Fiscalia General de la Nacion to create a specific unit for hate crimes. APCD also raised 
concerns about intersex children, who are dismissed from school and even sent away by their 
families. It called on Colombia to accept the recommendation by the Czech Republic to provide 
funds to implement court decisions, establish a follow-up plan for the implementation of human 
rights, and develop policies ensuring equality for gays and lesbians. 
</p>
<p>610. Amnesty International noted that many interventions during Colombia&#8217;s review reflected 
concerns repeatedly expressed by Colombian and international human rights organizations, the 
OHCHR and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. It also noted the widely shared 
acknowledgement that the human rights and humanitarian situation in Colombia remains serious, 
as it remains in the midst of an armed conflict, and paramilitary groups continue to operate 
despite the Government&#8217;s stated efforts to demobilise them. It welcomed the acceptance of most 
recommendations, but regretted the rejection of key recommendations and asked the 
Government to reconsider its position, such as to accept the jurisdiction of the Committee on 
Enforced Disappearance, to ratify the OP-CAT, to withdraw the declaration on article 124 of the 
Rome Statute, and to end the &#8220;soldiers for a day&#8221; programme, which threatens to drag civilians 
further into the conflict. Amnesty welcomed the Government&#8217;s commitment to urgently 
implement in full OHCHR recommendations, but noted the failure of successive Colombian 
governments to do so. It recommended that the Council adopt measures to ensure effective 
monitoring of progress in this regard, in cooperation with civil society. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>611. International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) expressed concern that 
negotiations with paramilitaries did not result in effectively dismantling the structures and that 
the Government denies this fact. It noted OHCHR concerns that describing these structures as 
gangs does not reflect the complexity, variety, plurality and risk of the phenomenon. It said there 
were at least 76 paramilitary groups with some 9,000 active members. Extraditions of 17 
paramilitary leaders for drug trafficking were frustrating for victims, it said. FIDH welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to generating policies to avoid impunity of crimes against humanity 
but was concerned that the Government continues to deny that the demobilization process has 
allowed a de facto amnesty for most paramilitaries, including those who might have taken part in 
such crimes. Of the more than 30,000 paramilitaries demobilized, only one was convicted the 
day before the present meeting. By May 2008, only 245 have agreed to submit to the legal 
process according to the justice and peace law. FIDH noted that Colombia, in its comments, 
avoided recommendations relating to grave attacks against the Supreme Court of Justice, 
including from the President of the Republic, in the context of investigations of Government and 
Congress members for supposed links with paramilitaries. It said the Government must stop 
persecuting judiciary members and must provide them with protection.  
</p>
<p>612. SOS Kinderdorf International, also on behalf of World Vision International, Plan 
International and the International Save the Children Alliance welcomed Colombia&#8217;s acceptance 
of many child right recommendations. Noting recommendation 65, it added that limited state 
presence in rural areas minimises identification and reporting of child sexual and physical abuse, 
leading many cases to go unrecorded and unpunished. On recommendation 22, it called for 
increased efforts to ensure effective data collection and adequate reporting, policing and juridical 
measures for such offences. It called for continued action on recommendation 19, requesting 
measures on demobilization through to reintegration of child soldiers, and measures to address 
the underlying exclusion which make rural, indigenous and other minority children vulnerable to 
recruitment. Welcoming Government commitments to the MDGs on the health and education of 
children, and acceptance of recommendations on education, it called for measures to ensure 
access to healthcare and education in rural areas. On recommendation 62, it further 
recommended that birth registration fees be waived, it be made possible to register children in 
areas other than those of their birth, and that communities be educated on the importance of birth 
registration. It requested clarification on the rejection of the recommendation in paragraph 37 (c) 
of the report, referring to the soldiers for a day program and to CRC recommendations calling for 
an end to the children&#8217;s participation in military training activities. Considering the 
complementary relationship between UPR and treaty bodies, it questioned this rejection. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>613. On the situation of trade unionists, Colombia explained that a special unit was established 
and resulted in 184 trials where those responsible for the murder of unionists were convicted. 
Whereas only one conviction was achieved in 2007, last year this number increased to 76, and 
there have already been 14 convictions so far this year.  It noted that 216 cases of murder of 
trade unionists have been revealed in the Justice and Peace process. Some of these have occurred 
in 2009, such as the murder of the President of the Fishermen&#8217;s Union, and three perpetrators 
have been arrested, including the mastermind. 
</p>
<p>614. The delegation said the Government acknowledged the discussion on the Law on Victims. 
It noted that a programme for compensation through administrative means was established by the </p>

 <p> 
Government, at a cost of approximately US$7 billion. About 180,000 persons have made claims 
under the law, and progress has been made in strengthening the protection programme. A 
decision by the Supreme Court had impeded the Executive from handing out partial charges 
through the Justice and Peace process, but once the restriction was lifted, 62 partial charges were 
brought against perpetrators. The first conviction occurred the day prior to the present meeting, 
and 15 cases were awaiting trial. 
</p>
<p>615. On the murders presumably committed by law enforcement officials, the delegation said 
the Government had discretionally retired 3,500 law enforcement officials on its own initiative. 
It said that despite the fact that 75,000 tactical missions have been undertaken since 2002, only 
938 complaints are being investigated with 1,117 persons involved. All cases are being remitted 
to the ordinary court. 
</p>
<p>616. The delegation said that the Government has repeatedly expressed regret for the death of 
Mr. Legarda and the investigation is in the hands of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. The events having 
occurred at 5 a.m. on a highway created a confusing situation and the Government is asking the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to establish the facts. The State has provided information to Ambassadors in 
Colombia on progress, and a new directive was issued by the Secretary of Defence on how 
military roadblocks should be established, learning from this regrettable experience. The 
Constitutional Court has ordered 34 ethnic safeguard plans for 34 indigenous communities, 
developing a comprehensive policy to provide care for these communities. 
</p>
<p>617. On the relationship between the Government and NGOs, the delegation said differences 
existed in that the Government believes it has done its best to address human rights violations, 
overcome impunity, and protect the population, but NGOs may not share this view. Their view is 
respected.  It added, however that, for example, a few years ago paramilitaries were responsible 
for 250 massacres a year without reaction from the State authorities, but now all paramilitary 
leaders are held in maximum security prisons and are being tried for their crimes, and their 
demobilization requires strict commitments to reveal truth, to provide reparations to victims and 
to carry out prison sentences. It said Colombia refuses to consider the groups that have emerged 
to take over the control of 500 metric tons of coca, in many areas linked to the guerrilla, as 
paramilitary groups. These groups want to be qualified as paramilitaries to be subject to 
negotiation. 
</p>
<p>618. Colombia regretted the situation regarding journalist Hollman Morris, but added that the 
statements made by the Government questioning Mr. Morris were made following the claims of 
two persons who had been kidnapped and had questioned the behaviour of the journalist. The 
delegation said that a pluralistic press exists in Colombia, and a great range of opinion can be 
found in the media.  
</p>
<p>619. Responding to concerns on the cost of education, Colombia reported on the establishment 
of a free subsidy for the poorest children which will benefit 4.5 million children. 
</p>
<p>620. It said Colombia was aware that legislation needed to be enacted to ensure the 
Constitutional Court decision of January on same-sex couples does not remain dead letter on 
paper. </p>

 <p> 
621. Colombia also affirmed that all the challenges can be met if work continues with the 
international community, human rights organisations and civil society in a constructive spirit, 
rejecting all forms of violence and strengthening the institutions.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Uzbekistan 
</b></p>
<p>622. The review of Uzbekistan was held on 11 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by Uzbekistan in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/UZB/1); the compilation prepared by the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/UZB/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/UZB/3). 
</p>
<p>623. At its 31st meeting, on 20 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Uzbekistan (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>624. The outcome of the review on Uzbekistan is constituted of the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/77), together with the views of Uzbekistan 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/10/77/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions 
as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>625. Uzbekistan was grateful to the members of the Council and the member states of the 
United Nations for their attention to the situation of human rights in Uzbekistan as reflected in 
their recommendations and comments. Uzbekistan gave an overview of the steps and obligations 
it undertook during short period since the 3rd session of the UPR Working Group in December 
</p><p>2008. Uzbekistan's consideration under the UPR coincided with the end of the 60th anniversary 
year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was marked by the implementation of 
a thorough programme of measures adopted by a presidential decree in Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan 
noted that in 2008 it ratified eight very important international human rights documents. In 
February 2009, the Government of Uzbekistan also signed the United Nations Convention on the 
rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>626. In 2008, Uzbekistan implemented a wide ranging educational and awareness campaign to 
monitor the implementation of the most important human rights laws in conformity with the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Uzbekistan took the opportunity to dwell on three of the 
most recent trends in state policy with respect to human rights. 
</p>
<p>627. First with regard to the global financial crisis and human rights, the Government launched  
a policy to avoid any reduction in people&#8217;s living standards, by protecting them from the 
negative consequences of the financial crisis and by ensuring that normal life proceeds as a 
foundation for their human rights. Uzbekistan stated that the budget allocation in the social 
sphere has amounted to more than 50 per cent, the majority of which was given to education. </p>

 <p> 
Uzbekistan also has a continuing tradition for the adoption of integrated state programmes 
intended to resolve specific problems relating to socio-economic development as the basis of the 
whole set of human rights enshrined in the fundamental United Nations documents. Uzbekistan 
recalled that 2008 was declared the Year of Youth, and specific measures were taken to improve 
education, health, housing and credits for young people and young families while 2009 had been 
declared the Year of Development and Improvement of Countryside. Uzbekistan intends to bring 
a qualitative improvement in the living conditions and wellbeing of the rural population since 
almost half of the Uzbek people live in rural areas and as paying attention to life in rural areas 
was in line with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>628. Secondly, Uzbekistan noted that education was a priority in state policy and it had been 
successfully implementing systemic educational reforms at all levels. The whole educational 
system is interrelated to the national programme to enhance culture of legal awareness among 
the broad masses about newly adopted legislation and also laying the foundations for human 
rights education programmes. With technical assistance from various United Nations agencies 
Uzbekistan is continuing the publication of international human rights documents. At the 
beginning of February 2009, an Uzbek language publication was issued with the help of 
UNICEF of the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which 
Uzbekistan ratified in December 2008. 
</p>
<p>629. Thirdly, Uzbekistan noted that as a result of a consistent development in the area of 
judicial and legal reform, it started seeing concrete results in the application of habeas corpus. 
This institution came into force on 1 January 2008 and has served to strengthen the procedural 
guarantees for the protection of constitutional rights and freedoms for Uzbekistan's citizens 
during criminal proceedings. As of 2008, Uzbekistan has been implementing a whole set of legal 
and organisational reforms related to the legal profession. Uzbekistan has established bar 
association, a chamber of lawyers, an independent professional association, which carries out a 
broad range of tasks, including the social protection and support for lawyers, educational 
activities and representation and defence at matters related to the state. The guarantee of the legal 
status of lawyers was achieved with the introduction of administrative responsibility on the part 
of public officials for hampering activities of lawyers. The Government has taken a decision to 
support such national institutions for human rights as the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the 
National Human Rights Centre, established in accordance with the Paris principles, and the 
Vienna Declaration and the Vienna Programme of Action. The institution of habeas corpus, the 
improvement of the status and institution of the legal profession and the national human rights 
institutions should all be seen as consistent steps being taken by Uzbekistan to implement 
judicial and legal reforms and to carry out international obligations in the human rights area.  
</p>
<p>630. Uzbekistan has also submitted a document with its answers and commentaries to the 
recommendations of the UPR Working Group. Uzbekistan has carefully studied all the 
recommendations made by the member states. Uzbekistan was pleased to inform that work to 
implement the recommendations Uzbekistan accepted following the UPR had already begun. In 
keeping with the spirit and the principles of the Human Rights Council, Uzbekistan intends to 
undertake and implement a National Plan of Action to accomplish the recommendations.  
Uzbekistan intends to continue consistently and actively to work together with the United 
Nations Treaty Bodies by submitting periodic reports and with the Special Procedures and 
mechanisms of the Council. In December 2008 and January 2009, Uzbekistan provided its 
replies to the questionnaires from the Special Rapporteurs on education and on violence against </p>

 <p> 
women, and in March from the Council&#8217;s Advisory Committee on draft declaration on human 
rights education and training.   
</p>
<p>631. The UPR mechanism has made it possible for Uzbekistan to thoroughly analyze and 
evaluate state policy on the realization of various human rights and to strengthen coordination 
and interaction among various state bodies and civil society structures. In keeping this important 
principle in mind, the state institutions together with civil society bodies will be working on the 
National Action Plan to implement the recommendations of the UPR to Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan 
hopes for the understanding of the Members and Observers of the Human Rights Council and 
also for their constructive and fruitful cooperation as Uzbekistan implements the common goals 
of promoting, realizing and protecting human rights both at the national and international levels.  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>632. Azerbaijan noted that a significant step had been made to uphold the role of the Parliament, 
the political parties as well as the civil society. Azerbaijan made reference to the growing 
number of NGOs, the establishment of the Human Rights Commissioner of the Parliament and 
of the National Centre for Human Rights, the abolition of death penalty, introduction of habeas 
corpus, adoption of several national action plans on various human rights fields, which 
demonstrate the will of Uzbekistan to further improve the human rights situation in the country. 
Azerbaijan noted that Uzbekistan would benefit from the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), 
inter alia, by the successful implementation of the recommendations.  
</p>
<p>633. Russian Federation was grateful to the delegation of Uzbekistan for the submission of 
exhaustive information on the recommendations made. It noted the creation of a full system of 
national human rights institutions in keeping with the Paris principles; the Ombudsman, the 
National Centre on human rights and the Institute for monitoring legislation. The national human 
rights protection system in Uzbekistan has been improved and this was quite clearly shown 
during the UPR and the Russian delegation wished the Government of Uzbekistan every success 
on that path. 
</p>
<p>634. Indonesia commended Uzbekistan for embracing the recommendations made during the 
UPR Working Group, and applauded forthcoming strategies to mobilize national resources to 
accelerate poverty alleviation and eliminate forced child labour and trafficking.  Indonesia stated 
that by working together with concerned stakeholders, including NGOs and members of civil 
society, Uzbekistan would be further enabled in its efforts to advance human rights causes. 
Indonesia expressed hope that Uzbekistan will be further enabled to apply a balanced and fair 
application of human rights norms in the country, especially regarding the education and the 
eradication of discrimination against women and female children.   
</p>
<p>635. Ukraine expressed appreciation for the detailed responses to the recommendations made. 
Ukraine noted in particular the positive tendencies in the interaction between Uzbekistan and the 
Special Rapporteurs, as well as its intention to continue comprehensive cooperation with all the 
Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council and encouraged Uzbekistan to continue its 
efforts. Ukraine hoped to hear in the future, before the next round of the UPR, about their 
achievements. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>636. Kazakhstan recognized the positive engagement by Uzbekistan with the Human Rights 
Council in the UPR process. Kazakhstan noted with great satisfaction that the UPR 
recommendations had already been taken into account and measures had been taken to carry 
them out. In this regard, Kazakhstan welcomed the recent positive steps by Uzbekistan, 
including the signature of the Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities in February 
2009. Kazakhstan welcomed the gender specific steps taken, including the adoption of the Draft 
law &#8220;On guarantees of equal rights and opportunities for women and men&#8221;. Kazakhstan strongly 
encouraged Uzbekistan to continue its cooperation with Special Procedures and Treaty Bodies. 
Kazakhstan welcomed Uzbekistan's firm commitments and close cooperation in the follow-up 
process of the UPR. 
</p>
<p>637. Cuba congratulated Uzbekistan for its detailed presentation on on-going efforts as part of 
the follow-up to the recommendations made during the UPR. Cuba noted that despite obstacles 
confronted, Uzbekistan had made important progress, both in civil and political rights and in 
economic, social and cultural rights. Cuba made special acknowledgement of progress in the 
areas of education, health, employment, the promotion and protection of the rights of children, 
the rights of persons with disabilities and of low income and its fight against any type of 
discrimination. Cuba also wished to commend the on-going bill in the 2009 Legislation Plan for 
equal opportunities and rights for men and women, to enable them the equal enjoyment of their 
rights and freedoms, as recognized in the national legislation of Uzbekistan.  
</p>
<p>638. Belarus noted the serious work done by Uzbekistan in the preparation of the UPR.  Belarus 
noted that Uzbekistan had established the necessary structural conditions for the promotion of 
human rights, including the Ombudsman, the National Centre for Human Rights and the State 
Human Rights Programmes.  Belarus stated that Uzbekistan was actively promoting legal and 
procedural practice noting the recent introduction of habeas corpus.  Belarus welcomed the 
adoption of the law to combat trafficking in persons in 2008.  Belarus also noted the 
establishment of national rehabilitation centres for victims of trafficking.  Belarus invited the 
representative of the relevant authorities to take part in training on trafficking in persons, which 
is conducted regularly by the International Migration Training Centre to Combat Trafficking 
based in Minsk.  Belarus stated that it would appreciate the steps to be undertaken by Uzbekistan 
to implement the recommendations made during the UPR Working Group, noting the 
development of a National Action Plan.    
</p>
<p>639. Malaysia was pleased to note that Uzbekistan accepted a large number of 
recommendations put forward by Member States, including those that focus on the promotion 
and protection of economic, social and cultural rights. This was particularly important in the 
light of the current global financial crisis that has affected the socio- economic conditions of 
many developing countries. Malaysia viewed this as a positive and constructive approach on the 
part of Uzbekistan and they encouraged the Uzbek Government to take the necessary measures 
to implement the recommendations effectively.  
</p>
<p>640. The Philippines welcomed the responses of Uzbekistan, particularly its readiness to 
continue its comprehensive cooperation with all Special Procedures of the Human Rights 
Council.  The Philippines noted the draft law &#8220;On guarantees of equal rights and opportunities 
for women and men&#8221; had been included in the plan of legislative activities of the Government 
for 2009.   The Philippines welcomed the steps undertaken by the Government with regard to the 
promotion and protection of the rights of children by noting Uzbekistan&#8217;s ratification of the two </p>

 <p> 
Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography and on the involvement of children in armed conflict, as well 
as ILO Conventions Nos. 138 and 182 with respect to the minimum age of labour and the worst 
form of child labour.   
</p>
<p>641. Bahrain noted that Uzbekistan had drawn up a National Plan and had also taken measures 
to guarantee the rights of the child through legislation by tackling trafficking in persons. They 
have ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on trafficking in 
children and on children in armed conflict. Uzbekistan has signed two ILO Conventions to put 
an end to child labour and to set a national programme directed at eliminating the worst forms of 
child labour, while imposing serious penalties on parents and others who force children to work. 
Bahrain indicated that Uzbekistan like other countries, signed the Millennium Declaration on an 
ideal world for children and the government is committed to improving the situation of children 
and is endeavouring to establish a programme to this end from 2009 to 2011. 
</p>
<p>642. Algeria congratulated the Uzbek Government for their progress in promoting and 
implementing human rights standards. The constructive participation of Uzbekistan in the UPR 
and their voluntary acceptance of a large number of the recommendations was a testimony to this 
commitment. Algeria welcomed the measures adopted to implement some of the 
recommendations and encouraged the Government to continue its efforts to enshrine human 
rights standards. Algeria called upon the United Nations agencies concerned to cooperate closely 
with the country to allow it to meet these challenges. 
</p>
<p>643. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland sought clarification and 
requested correction on paragraph 48 (c), which does not exist but was referred to in paragraph 
107 of the report of the working group as one of the recommendations not accepted by the 
Government of Uzbekistan.  The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
expressed its ongoing concern over the number of imprisoned human rights defenders.  It further 
expressed disappointment that certain paragraphs referred to in paragraph 107 were dismissed by 
Uzbekistan as factually wrong without due consideration. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>644. Civicus -<b> </b>World Alliance For Citizen Participation<b> </b>welcomed new laws adopted on non-
governmental and  non-profit organizations asking the Government to report publicly, accurately 
and comprehensively how these laws had been implemented and what had been done in relation 
to various recommendations to improve the protection of civil society space, namely to ensure 
freedom of expression, assembly, association and the right to participate in public and political 
life, to adopt a National Plans of Action to improve the human rights situation and to implement 
some of the recommendations of the Treaty Bodies on freedom of peaceful assembly, to 
investigate all reports of assaults on human rights defenders and bring to justice those 
responsible. Civicus requested that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights 
defenders&#8217; visit be facilitated at the earliest possible time. 
</p>
<p>645. Action Canada for Population and Development (ACPD) urged Uzbekistan to provide a 
friendly environment without state interference or fear of reprisal for NGOs working on the 
issues of sexual rights, women&#8217;s rights, reproductive health and rights, and HIV/AIDS. ACPD 
further called on the Government to conduct proper investigation of NGO closures, punishing </p>

 <p> 
those responsible for unjustified closures and restoring their legal personhood to the 
organizations affected, specifically crisis centres for women.  ACPD supported the 
recommendation to invite the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders 
stressing the importance to examine the situation of defenders working on women&#8217;s rights and 
sexual and reproductive rights.      ACPD called on the Government to repeal article 120 of the 
Uzbek Criminal Code to de-criminalize consensual same-sex behaviour among adults.   
</p>
<p>646. Amnesty International welcomed Uzbekistan&#8217;s support of recommendations to establish a 
national independent mechanism to monitor all places of detention and to consider complaints. 
AI expressed dismay that Uzbekistan considers as inconsistent with its obligations under 
international human rights standards to establish an independent international investigation into 
the events of May 2005 in Andijan.  AI noted that during the interactive dialogue, Uzbekistan 
rejected as &#8216;unfounded&#8217; reports that excessive and disproportionate force had been used during 
these events. AI also  urged Uzbekistan to reconsider its rejection of recommendations to release 
all detained human rights defenders and to ensure that everyone, including human rights 
defenders, peacefully exercise their right to freedom of expression in conformity with 
Uzbekistan&#8217;s obligations under the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>647. International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) expressed concern that Uzbekistan accepted only 
very general and sometimes vague recommendations, and made reservations or eventually 
refused those that were specific and measurable. The ICJ urged the Government particularly: to 
permit an effective investigation into the Andijan events through an independent international 
commission of inquiry; to refrain from the prosecution of dissenting political and religious 
activists, journalists and human rights defenders for the exercise of fundamental freedoms on 
vaguely defined charges related to terrorism, extremism, separatism or religious practise; to 
narrow down the definition of what constitutes &#8220;terrorist acts&#8221; in accordance with the principle 
of legality of offences; to ensure that its legislation on criminal procedure complies with all due 
process guarantees; to ensure the absolute prohibition of torture and to adopt the definition of 
torture that complies with Article 1 of the Convention against Torture; to provide for an effective 
access by the public to criminal trials,; to provide unhindered access to the Special Procedures, 
which have outstanding requests for visits. 
</p>
<p>648. Human Rights Watch (HRW) lamented the Government&#8217;s decision to reject the 
recommendations to urge the release of human rights defenders and civil society activists.  HRW 
noted that at least 11 human rights defenders continued to be held in prison.  HRW stated that it 
was forced to suspend its activities in Uzbekistan in July last year after the Government&#8217;s denial 
for work accreditation and an outright ban on its research  HRW expressed regret on the 
Government&#8217;s continued refusal to accept responsibility for the May 2005 massacre in Andijan. 
HRW also expressed regret on the Government&#8217;s decision to reject the recommendation to stop 
pursing the forcible return of Uzbek asylum seekers from neighbouring countries.  HRW urged 
the Government to reserve its approach and to accept and genuinely implement all 
recommendations addressed to it during the UPR.  
</p>
<p>649. Canada HIV/AIDS Legal Aid Network encouraged Uzbekistan to reconsider its position in 
paragraph 105 of the report of the UPR Working Group where Uzbekistan indicated it would 
study the conformity of 12 recommendations to its national legislation in light of international 
human rights standards. It requested if Uzbekistan could indicate which recommendations of 
those 12 would be accepted. It also raised Uzbekistan&#8217;s rejection to decriminalize consensual </p>

 <p> 
same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults noting that the laws criminalizing consensual 
same-sex sexual conduct are not in conformity with international obligations of privacy and non-
discrimination under the ICCPR urging Uzbekistan to reconsider its position and to repeal the 
offending provisions.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>650. In its concluding remarks Uzbekistan stressed that it upholds its international obligations in 
the fields of human rights and freedoms on the basis of the principles of equality, 
constructiveness, objectivity and transparency.  UPR has made it possible for Uzbekistan to have 
a thorough look at its national policy on human rights, including civil, political, economic, social 
and cultural rights. Uzbekistan has instituted cooperation with civil society and has established a 
non-state system for the protection of human rights. These institutions provide an enormous 
support to the development of civil society and the rule of law in areas such as the education and 
care of women, children and people with disabilities and vulnerable people. Uzbekistan has 
created a National Association of NGOs, a Social Fund for support for NGOs and a 
Parliamentary Commission. The Government firmly intends to conduct a broad based discussion 
with all concerned state bodies and NGOs as well as with other civil society institutions and the 
media, to look at the recommendations emerging from the UPR Report on Uzbekistan and to 
develop and implement the appropriate National Plan of Action. 
</p>
<p><b>Tuvalu 
</b></p>
<p>651. The review of Tuvalu was held on 11 December 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Tuvalu in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TUV/1); the compilation prepared by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TUV/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TUV/3). 
</p>
<p>652. At its 32nd meeting, on 20 March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review on Tuvalu (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>653. The outcome of the review on Tuvalu is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/84), together with the views of Tuvalu concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions 
as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>654. Ms. Filiga Niko, Crown Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General of Tuvalu, 
presented the final remarks and conclusions of the Government on its first reporting under the 
Universal Periodic Review process. She re-affirmed Tuvalu&#8217;s commitment to the UPR 
mechanism and to the upholding of human rights principles.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>655. Tuvalu expressed a deep appreciation to those having provided the much needed support 
from the preparation phase of its national report to the reporting session in December 2008, and 
also for facilitating the presence of Tuvalu to the consideration of the outcome. In this regard, the 
delegation referred to the support of the Regional Office for the Pacific of the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team, the Social 
Division of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the Permanent Missions of New 
Zealand and Australia in Geneva. Tuvalu extended its warm thanks also to the Human Rights 
Council, the UPR Working Group and Member States of the troika for the honest reflections and 
the assistance provided to the delegation of Tuvalu. As being amongst one of the first small 
island states to undertake the UPR process, Tuvalu noted that it had encountered the challenges 
of under-resources in terms of technical expertise in this new process. With the assistance of the 
human rights related offices in the region, Tuvalu had been able to fully participate in the review.  
</p>
<p>656. Tuvalu stated that the UPR process had given an opportunity not only to inform the 
international community of the state of Tuvalu&#8217;s compliance and realization of human rights at 
the ground level, but also to know where Tuvalu stands in the fulfilment of its obligation as a 
United Nations Member State in the area of human rights. It considered the process as truly 
universal and reaffirmed the commitment of Tuvalu to the success and continuity of this human 
rights review mechanism. 
</p>
<p>657. With regard to the ten recommendations left in December 2008 to be considered by the 
Government, the delegation expressed that Tuvalu supported all those ten recommendations 
(A/HRC/10/84, para. 68). With regard to recommendation 2, to fully incorporate the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, and recommendation 6, on the elimination of discrimination against 
women and to fully incorporate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, Tuvalu stated that careful consideration and broad consultation 
were required at the national level with relevant stakeholders in the incorporation of these two 
Conventions. Tuvalu further commented that some of the ten recommendations raised, such as 
regarding children with no parental care and asylum, are not relevant in the meantime to Tuvalu, 
but the delegation confirmed the support of Tuvalu and that it stands ready to consider these 
recommendations. Lastly, Tuvalu stated that it required financial and technical support of the 
international community in the fulfilment of these recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>658. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland congratulated Tuvalu on the 
adoption of the report of their Universal Periodic Review. It recognized the capacity constraints 
that the Government of Tuvalu encountered when preparing for the review. The United Kingdom 
stated as it was commendable that despite these constraints the Government of Tuvalu was 
represented in Geneva in December 2008 and was in Geneva on 20 March 2009 for the 
consideration of the outcome. 
</p>
<p>659. New Zealand noted that Tuvalu was the second country in the South Pacific region to go 
through the Universal Periodic Review process of the Human Rights Council. It warmly 
welcomed the presence of a Tuvalu delegate in Geneva to take part in this adoption phase of the 
review process. It noted that Tuvalu has given the UPR high priority, with the preparation of a 
comprehensive State report and the input of a number of non-government organisations. New </p>

 <p> 
Zealand stated that the quality of Tuvalu&#8217;s preparation for the review resulted in a wide-ranging 
discussion in December 2008, in which a number of delegations participated fully. New Zealand 
commended Tuvalu for its acceptance of a very large number of the recommendations 
formulated in December 2008. It noted that for the Small Island States of the Pacific, 
participation in the review is a major undertaking, and that Tuvalu was undoubtedly among the 
smallest countries to have gone through the UPR process so far. New Zealand recognised the 
practical difficulties faced by the smallest island States in meeting their UPR obligations. For 
that reason, New Zealand noted it had convened in February 2009 in Auckland a seminar to 
assist officials of Pacific Islands Governments in working through the UPR process. New 
Zealand informed that, at the seminar, Tuvalu representatives who had already gone through the 
UPR in December 2008 were able to provide valuable insights for their colleagues from other 
Pacific countries and had contributed greatly to making the seminar a success. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>660. Amnesty International welcomed many of the recommendations made by States to Tuvalu, 
including on cooperating with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
strengthen legislation related to family, land and sexual offences against children, and to 
establish a national human rights commission based on the Paris Principles. It also welcomed 
recommendations to develop a comprehensive strategy to reduce domestic violence in Tuvalu, 
including through raising public awareness and encouraging greater involvement by government 
agencies and civil society in efforts to address domestic violence and gender discrimination. 
Amnesty International reiterated its call to Tuvalu to develop and enact legislation to protect 
women and children from violence, in particular domestic violence. It indicated that prevailing 
cultural notions of women&#8217;s status continued to be a key factor in perpetuating violence against 
women in Tuvalu. Amnesty International therefore urged Tuvalu to support recommendations to 
eliminate legislation that has a discriminatory effect against women, and to amend the 
Constitution to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex and gender. It considered that gender 
violence cannot be eradicated without addressing the underlying factors that cause or contribute 
to gender discrimination. Amnesty International welcomed Tuvalu&#8217;s support for 
recommendations to ratify, with assistance of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, a wide range of human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>661. Earthjustice welcomed and encouraged the positive response of Tuvalu concerning its 
efforts to ratify all major human rights treaties and to establish a national human rights institution 
respecting the Paris Principles in order to strengthen human rights in the country. It stated that 
Tuvalu illustrates unfortunately how human rights are affected by climate change such as the 
right to food, the right to water or the right to adequate housing. Earthjustice encouraged Tuvalu 
to promote a strong access to information, education and public participation in environmental 
and climate change matters. It noted that the situation of Tuvalu also shows that the right to an 
ecologically sustainable environment cannot be protected by national measures alone. It 
considered that the right to assistance in emergency situation and possible refugee rights can 
only be granted by the active involvement of the international community, but that the 
responsibility of the international community is not limited to assistance measures. Furthermore, 
it noted that the fate of Tuvalu exemplifies how climate change mitigation measures are also a 
direct contribution to the prevention of human rights violations. Earthjustice called on the 
Council to consider the whole range of measures needed to make it possible for Tuvalu to protect </p>

 <p> 
the human rights of its people. It called on Tuvalu to actively participate in the future discussions 
on this issue at the Council as well as to the negotiations of the post-Kyoto regime, where the 
human rights implications of the struggle against climate change will have to be taken into 
consideration.  
</p>
<p>662. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network noted, with reference to paragraph 14 of the 
Working Group report, that during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group, the head of 
delegation of Tuvalu stated that his country respected the rights of persons of all sexual 
orientations, but that the question of legal protection in the Constitution would need to be 
carefully considered.. In this regard, the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network appreciated the 
openness of the delegation to discussion and relevant actions of Tuvalu in relation to promoting 
equality for all people including on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. However, 
it noted that Tuvalu does maintain some criminal laws which penalize consensual same sex adult 
behaviour, and the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network encouraged the delegation to remain 
open to revision of these laws in order to promote equality and compliance with international 
obligations of privacy and non-discrimination. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network would 
welcome an indication from the delegation whether there is an openness to consider these 
matters.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under Review 
</b></p>
<p>663. Tuvalu thanked the President, States and stakeholders for their valuable contributions. It 
noted that comments and explanations to a number of issues raised by States and stakeholders 
had already been provided by the delegation of Tuvalu in December 2008. Tuvalu expressed its 
commitment to the success and continuity of the review, not only in the reporting element of the 
process but more importantly in the implementation of these recommendations at the ground 
level. Tuvalu stated that it therefore sought the support and assistance of the international 
community in the implementation of the recommendations. In closing, Tuvalu expressed that it 
was looking forward to present its next report to the Human Rights Council.
