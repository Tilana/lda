Forward looking statements
 These  materials  prepared  by  Evolution  Mining  Limited  (or  “the  Company”)  include  forward  looking  statements.  Often,  but  not  always,  forward 
looking  statements  can generally  be  identified  by  the  use  of forward  looking  words  such  as  “may”,  “will”,  “expect”,  “intend”,  “plan”,  “estimate”, 
“anticipate”,  “continue”,  and  “guidance”,  or  other  similar  words  and  may  include,  without  limitation,  statements  regarding  plans,  strategies  and 
objectives of management, anticipated production or construction commencement dates and expected costs or production outputs.
 Forward looking statements inherently involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Company’s actual 
results, performance and achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements. Relevant factors may include, 
but are not limited to, changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange fluctuations and general economic conditions, increased costs and demand 
for  production  inputs,  the  speculative  nature  of  exploration  and  project  development,  including  the  risks  of  obtaining  necessary  licenses  and 
permits and diminishing quantities or grades of reserves, political and social risks, changes to the regulatory framework within which the Company 
operates or may  in the future operate, environmental conditions including extreme weather conditions, recruitment and retention of personnel, 
industrial relations issues and litigation.
 Forward looking statements are based on the Company and its management’s good faith assumptions relating to the financial, market, regulatory 
and other relevant environments that will exist and affect the Company’s business and operations in the future.  The Company does not give any 
assurance  that  the  assumptions  on  which  forward  looking  statements  are  based  will  prove  to  be  correct,  or  that  the  Company’s  business  or 
operations will not be affected in any material manner by these or other factors not foreseen or foreseeable by the Company or management or 
beyond the Company’s control.
 Although the Company attempts and has attempted to identify factors that would cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from 
those disclosed in forward looking statements, there may be other factors that could cause actual results, performance, achievements or events 
not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended, and many events are beyond the reasonable control of the Company.  Accordingly, readers are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements.  Forward looking statements in these materials speak only at the date of 
issue. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable  law or any relevant stock exchange listing rules, in providing this information the 
Company  does  not  undertake  any  obligation  to  publicly  update  or  revise  any  of  the forward  looking  statements or  to  advise  of  any  change  in 
events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

Mungari – a strategic gold province
Growth 
 Significant potential to expand production and extend mine life 
 ~880 km2 land position in a world-class terrane located
between the Zuleika and Kunanalling shear zones with historic 
production of >10Moz gold
 Potential for the discovery of new high-grade underground
Mineral Resources
 Recent resource definition drilling has extended mineralisation
at Frog’s Leg and White Foil beyond December 2015 Ore 
Reserve limits
Future business improvements 
 Frog’s Leg and White Foil resource/reserve growth 
 Optimising White Foil pit design and larger trucks 
 Further opportunity to improve recovery and optimise plant

Mine geology  
 Frog’s Leg is a classic quartz vein hosted deposit located on 
the lithological contact between the Victorious Basalt and the 
Black Flag Volcanics
 Mineralised widths range from 0.2m up to 20m (in the
central flexure zone)
 Mineral Resource is open down-plunge and drill testing
is ongoing
 White Foil mineralisation is quartz hosted fracture infill within
a structurally deformed quartz gabbro
 Vein density and higher grades are strongly influenced
by early stage structures visible as high-grade shoots

Long-term outlook 
 Mungari Ore Reserve 665koz1 
 Current mine life extends to FY22 which includes:
 Frog’s Leg (underground) Ore Reserve 
 White Foil (open-pit) Ore Reserve 
 Potential near term extensions:
 Frog’s Leg, White Foil, Cutters Ridge (open-pit), Red Dam (open-pit), Burgundy
(open-pit)
 Growth potential:
 Brownfields Frog’s Leg & White Foil areas 
 Brownfields Mungari Regional Mineral Resources (previously Phoenix Gold)
 Castle Hill Stage 2 plus other resources to be developed
 Greenfields regional tenements – finding the next high-grade underground resource

25
Summary - unlocking the potential 
 Aspiring to develop a 10-year mine life based 
on tenement package, regional resources and 
key strategic infrastructure
 Mungari process plant –  a strategic asset in
the Kundana area
 Focus on developing a pipeline by unlocking 
the large regional resource base of  >2Moz 
gold
 Significant resource definition and discovery
expenditure planned
 Highly skilled and motivated workforce and
close proximity to Kalgoorlie
 Early near mine and regional exploration
success under Evolution ownership – Frog’s 
Leg and Johnson’s Rest
