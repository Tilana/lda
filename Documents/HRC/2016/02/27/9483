<p> Section I provides a brief overview of main activities of the United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
related to economic, social and cultural rights during the year 2006. 
</p>
<p> Section II elaborates upon the realization of economic, social and cultural rights in 
conflict and post-conflict societies.  The report discusses how, in spite of the constant 
reaffirmation of the interdependence of all human rights, the protection and realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights in many areas of law and practice, including in conflict and 
post-conflict settings, still appear weaker than for other rights.  Against this backdrop, the report 
underlines that, for reasons of law and effectiveness, measures must be taken to protect 
economic, social and cultural rights.  The non-fulfilment of these rights is often the root cause of 
conflict, and in the aftermath of a conflict specific strategies for the realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights are crucial to the preservation and maintenance of peace. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, by decision 2/102 of 6 October 2006, requested the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in 
accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to 
update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;.  On the current issue of the &#8220;Question of the realization 
of economic, social and cultural rights&#8221;, a comprehensive annual report (E/CN.4/2006/38) 
was submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-second session pursuant to 
resolution 2005/22.  The information in that report remains relevant.  The Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) understands decision 2/102 to 
preserve the previous annual reporting cycle in respect of this issue until otherwise decided by 
the Council.  The current report to the Council accordingly addresses developments in respect of 
the question of the realization of economic, social and cultural rights over the last year. 
</p>
<p>2. The report provides a brief overview of the activities of the United Nations human rights 
system in relation to economic, social and cultural rights during the year 2006.  In addition, the 
main section of the report elaborates upon the realization of economic, social and cultural rights 
in conflict and post-conflict societies.  The international community has a particularly important 
role to play in the protection and realization of all human rights in such contexts.  Economic, 
social and cultural rights have been comparatively neglected in strategies aimed at restoring 
peace and ensuring accountability in conflict and post-conflict settings.  It seems therefore timely 
to explore the relevance of these rights to situations of conflict or post-conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>II. ACTIVITIES OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM - 
SELECTED DEVELOPMENTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Intergovernmental bodies 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was adopted by the 
General Assembly on 13 December 2006 (resolution 61/106).  The Convention is a 
comprehensive instrument covering the full range of rights - civil, political, economic, social 
and cultural - of persons with disabilities, thereby reaffirming the indivisibility of all rights. 
</p>
<p>4. The open-ended working group on an optional protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) held its third session in February 2006.  On the 
basis of a report prepared by the Chairperson-Rapporteur (E/CN.4/2006/WG.23/2), the working 
group held focused discussions on the main elements of a possible communications procedure 
under ICESCR.  In June, the Chairperson-Rapporteur, Ms. Catarina de Albuquerque, presented 
the report of the working group (E/CN.4/2006/47) to the first session of the Human Rights 
Council.  The Council, in its resolution 1/3, extended the mandate of the working group for a 
period of two years, giving it a mandate to start drafting an optional protocol and requesting the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur to prepare a first draft to be used as a basis for the forthcoming 
negotiations.  The Chairperson-Rapporteur will submit the draft to the fourth session of the 
working group, to be held in July 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>5. As of 6 December 2006, 155 States had ratified or acceded to ICESCR, with 4 new 
ratifications during the present reporting period.  At its thirty-sixth session in May 2006, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) held a day of general discussion 
on article 9 of the Covenant (the right to social security).  On the basis of this discussion, 
CESCR began a first reading of a draft general comment at its thirty-seventh session in 
November 2006.  At the same session CESCR also continued its consideration of its draft 
general comment on article 2, paragraph 2, of the Covenant (non-discrimination). 
</p>
<p>6. In May and November 2006, the Joint Expert Group of UNESCO (CR) [Committee on 
Recommendations]/ECOSOC (CESCR) on the Monitoring of the Right to Education held 
meetings to discuss and clarify the right to compulsory primary education available free to all.  
In November 2006, Committee members participated in a colloquium organized by the ILO 
Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to review 
progress made in protecting labour rights through international supervision.  Also in November, 
CESCR held an informal consultation on the impact of international trade on the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights with experts in the field of trade and human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. In the process of considering States parties&#8217; reports in 2006, the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child continued to emphasize the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by 
children.  The Committee in particular referred to the use of the &#8220;maximum extent of available 
resources&#8221; and States&#8217; responsibility to take steps towards the progressive realization of these 
rights; discrimination in enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights including in access to 
services; as well as disproportionately vulnerable or disadvantaged groups or regional disparities.  
Given the importance of the topic, the Committee decided, at its forty-third session in 
September 2006, to devote its next day of general discussion, scheduled for 21 September 2007, 
to article 4 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  At the same session, the Committee 
adopted a general comment on the rights of children with disabilities (CRC/C/GC/9), in which it 
provides guidance and assistance to States parties in a comprehensive manner that covers all the 
provisions of the Convention, including in particular with regard to the rights to education and 
health. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>8. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur on the right to housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, Miloon Kothari, carried out missions 
to Australia and Spain.  In September, he took part in the joint mission of special procedures 
mandate holders to Lebanon and Israel (see A/HRC/2/7).  The Special Rapporteur continued 
to actively engage with States on housing rights, whether through direct talks with State 
representatives or through communications, the majority of which related to cases of forced 
evictions.  In this respect, he presented a set of &#8220;Basic principles and guidelines on 
development-based evictions and displacement&#8221; at the second session of the Human Rights 
Council (see E/CN.4/2006/41).  The Special Rapporteur also presented a study on women and 
adequate housing, based on regional consultations (E/CN.4/2006/118). 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health (&#8220;right to health&#8221;), Paul Hunt, undertook </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>a mission to Sweden and participated in the joint mission to Lebanon and Israel.  In 
February 2006, together with other special procedures mandate holders, he submitted a report 
to the Human Rights Council on the human rights situation of detainees at the United States 
of America base at Guant&#225;namo Bay.  The Special Rapporteur submitted a report to the 
General Assembly (see A/61/338) on the relationship between the right to health and the 
reduction of maternal mortality and access to medicines, and a report to the Human Rights 
Council (E/CN.4/2006/48 and Corr.1) on health indicators and health systems. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Jean Ziegler, participated in conferences and 
seminars on topics such as migration, the national implementation of the right to food, food 
insecurity, and indicators.  The Special Rapporteur further cooperated with WFP and FAO.  He 
collaborated closely with the Secretariat of the Convention to Combat Desertification, 2006 
being the International Year of Deserts and Desertification, to analyse the linkages between 
desertification, hunger and the right to food, and participated in an international conference on 
this topic.  The Special Rapporteur also undertook a mission to Lebanon in the aftermath of the 
Israeli-Lebanon conflict (see A/HRC/2/8 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos, undertook 
country visits to Germany and Morocco.  He issued press statements expressing concern over, 
among other things, the<b> </b>attacks by anti-Government groups on schools and the education system 
in Afghanistan.  To assist the preparation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on the right to 
education of persons with disabilities, OHCHR organized a seminar on this topic in 
November 2006. 
</p>
<p>12. In his report to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects 
of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the 
enjoyment of human rights, Okechukwu Ibeanu, focused on the human rights impact and 
dimensions of the widespread exposure of individuals and communities to toxic chemicals from 
everyday household goods and food, including concerns in relation to the right to health.  The 
Special Rapporteur expressed concern in response to the dumping of toxic waste in Abidjan. 
</p><p>13. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights of internally 
displaced persons (IDPs), Walter K&#228;lin, has paid close attention to the protection of IDPs&#8217; 
economic, social and cultural rights.  In the reports on his missions to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
(A/HRC/4/38/Add.2) and Colombia (A/HRC/4/38/Add.3), for instance, he raises issues faced by 
IDPs in relation to their access to health care, education, food and adequate standard of living. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous peoples, Rodolfo Stavenhagen, assessed how economic, social and cultural rights 
were protected in national legislation in his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its 
sixty-second session (E/CN.4/2006/78) and raised issues pertaining to economic, social and 
cultural rights in the report on his mission to New Zealand (E/CN.4/2006/78/Add.3). 
</p>
<p>15. Country rapporteurs have often addressed economic, social and cultural rights.  
For instance, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar addressed 
issues concerning land, housing and property rights, among others, in his report to the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>General Assembly (see A/61/369 and Corr.1).  The Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Human Rights in Cambodia addressed issues related to land and housing 
rights (in particular the impact of government land and natural resources policies, and forced 
evictions) during his mission in March and in his statement to the Human Rights Council in 
September.  The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories 
occupied since 1967 examined right to health and education issues during his mission to the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory in June 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>16. Many OHCHR field presences worked on economic, social and cultural rights in 2006.  
For example, in Uganda, OHCHR organized, together with WHO and the Ministry of Health, 
a workshop on health and human rights; in Angola, the Office conducted with FAO an 
international forum on the right to food; and in Guatemala, the Office has been assisting the 
Government in the follow-up to the mission of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food.  
Moreover, the High Commissioner&#8217;s annual report to the Commission on Colombia incorporated 
an analysis of economic, social and cultural rights (E/CN.4/2006/9).  A subregional judicial 
workshop on &#8220;Justiciability of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Pacific&#8221; was 
organized in Fiji in June 2006. 
</p><p>17. National human rights institutions (NHRIs) are increasingly involved in economic, social 
and cultural rights.  The NHRI Unit at OHCHR supported or co-organized with NHRIs several 
related workshops and conferences, such as a training workshop in the Philippines for NHRIs in 
the Asian-Pacific region (January 2006), the Second Regional Conference on NHRIs in the Arab 
region (March 2006), the First Regional Conference on Building Networks to Strengthen 
ASEAN Human Rights Cooperation (April 2006), and a seminar in Ecuador, organized jointly 
with the Network of NHRIs of the Americas and UNESCO, on the right to education and NHRIs 
(May 2006). 
</p>
<p>18. Two OHCHR publications issued in 2006, <i>Frequently Asked Questions on a Human 
Rights-based Approach to Development Cooperation </i>and <i>Principles and Guidelines on a  
Human Rights Approach to Poverty Reduction Strategies</i>, provide guidance on how development 
programming could be aligned with human rights, linking international standards on economic, 
social and cultural rights to operational principles and processes for poverty reduction strategies 
at the national level.  OHCHR continues to lead the Action 2 inter-agency programme which 
supports a number of United Nations country teams in integrating human rights into their 
operational activities, including a particularly strong focus on supporting State efforts to 
implement economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>19. Finally, the High Commissioner continued her advocacy on economic, social and cultural 
rights.  She submitted a report to the Economic and Social Council on the legal protection of 
economic, social and cultural rights (E/2006/86), which elaborates upon legal protection as  
an essential element in any strategy to promote and protect these rights.  In October, the  
High Commissioner gave a lecture on &#8220;Economic and social justice for societies in transition&#8221; at 
the New York University School of Law, in which she examined the comparatively limited 
protection afforded to economic, social and cultural rights within transitional justice 
mechanisms. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN  
CONFLICT AND POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES 
</b></p>
<p>20. The present section discusses the relevance of economic, social and cultural rights to 
conflict and post-conflict contexts.  It examines how these rights can be protected and realized in 
conflict and post-conflict settings more systematically and comprehensively than has previously 
been the case. 
</p>
<p>21. This section does not purport to provide a comprehensive view of post-conflict justice 
and development.  Rather, it considers selected instruments and strategies that appear crucial to 
the protection and realization of economic, social and cultural rights in those contexts.  While the 
following discussion focuses on conflict and post-conflict societies, much of it would equally 
apply to societies undergoing political and economic transition from regimes that may have 
committed gross human rights violations in contexts other than a conflict, and which would 
require similar types of intervention and measures. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The importance of economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>22. The comparative neglect of economic, social and cultural rights in the context of 
post-conflict development and justice is symptomatic of the weaker attention that the 
international community has traditionally devoted to these rights.  The reasons for this 
comparative neglect of economic, social and cultural rights are not the focus of this report; 
however, it is relevant to note that the categorization of human rights into civil and political 
rights on the one hand and economic, social and cultural rights on the other has exacerbated the 
different emphasis placed on different rights, while in fact the breach of a civil or political right 
will often be related to a breach of an economic, social or cultural right.  The converse is equally 
the case.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>23. Partly as a consequence of the formal divisions between the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, there has been a tendency to underestimate the similarities and differences between 
rights.  Such oversimplification has too easily considered civil and political rights as freedoms 
from the abuse of State power, in relation to which violations can be found, and economic, social 
and cultural rights as aspirational goals or &#8220;luxury goods&#8221;, which may only be reached or 
provided in countries with a certain level of economic development.  Those arguments assume 
that protection of economic, social and cultural rights is by definition expensive and 
burdensome, while the realization of other rights is resource free. 
</p>
<p>24. In fact, while the realization of many aspects of economic, social and cultural rights 
requires sustained commitment of resources, a number of civil and political rights require similar 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

transitional justice, see High Commissioner for Human Rights, &#8220;Economic and social justice for 
societies in transition&#8221;, Second Annual Transitional Justice Lecture, Center for Human Rights 
and Global Justice, New York University School of Law, and International Center for 
Transitional Justice, 25 October 2006, New York. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>investment, such as ensuring legal guarantees to a fair trial through the establishment of effective 
justice systems.  National and international experiences alike demonstrate the resource-intensive 
nature of the endeavour.  The establishment of international and hybrid criminal tribunals, for 
instance, has proven extremely costly.<b>2</b>  Conversely, the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
has emphasized that &#8220;[m]any aspects of economic, social and cultural rights are clearly as 
immediately realizable as many civil and political rights.  &#8216;Forced&#8217; eviction (that is, eviction that 
is arbitrary or does not respect minimum guarantees), for example, requires the same type of 
immediate action and redress as does the prohibition of torture&#8221;.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>25. The division of human rights into two separate groups of rights runs contrary to the 
integral vision of human rights that is at the historical origins of human rights law, as indicated 
in United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#8217;s articulation of the &#8220;four freedoms&#8221;<b>4</b> 
indispensable for a just and secure world in a post-conflict setting, and further reflected in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Today, the international community has moved away 
from any strict categorization of rights to reaffirm repeatedly the indivisibility and 
interdependence of all human rights.  The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the new 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provide clear illustrations of that 
acknowledgement.  Economic, social and cultural rights have now the status of binding law in 
international and regional human rights treaties and in numerous constitutions. 
</p>
<p>26. Accordingly, while implementation strategies may vary from right to right, there is no 
basis for their categorical separation and for denying the full protection and realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights.  State obligations in this context include ensuring the legal 
protection of these rights and providing remedies for their violation.  These two aspects are of 
particular relevance to conflict and post-conflict societies. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Economic, social and cultural rights in conflict 
</b></p>
<p>27. The idea that economic, social and cultural rights are only programmatic or aspirational 
objectives reinforces the misconception that these rights are not really susceptible to violations.  
It can further result in reluctance to consider that violations of economic, social and cultural 
rights may be as egregious as violations of the prohibition of torture or breaches of the right to 
life.  The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressed concern in this respect 
in its often quoted report to the World Conference on Human Rights:  &#8220;States and the 
international community as a whole continue to tolerate all too often breaches of economic, 
social and cultural rights which, if they occurred in relation to civil and political rights, would 
provoke expressions of horror and outrage and would lead to concerted calls for immediate 
remedial action&#8221; (A/CONF.157/PC/62/Add.5, para. 5).

</p>
<p>28. In conflict situations, the systematic destruction of civilian objects, or the forced 
displacement of the population, is often deliberately used alongside other gross human rights 
violations (such as mass rape or murder) as political or military objectives.<b>5</b>  A further example is 
the intentional actions that can lead to starvation, notably through the raiding of food, the 
destruction of harvests or wilfully impeding the distribution of relief supplies.  Studies have 
shown that starvation or famines are not only due to economic and institutional failures, but can 
arise directly from deliberate policy choices by ruling elites or warring factions against another 
group of people.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>29. Some violations of economic, social and cultural rights are already prohibited under 
humanitarian law and considered international crimes, such as the denial of medical attention,<b>7</b> 
the destruction and appropriation of property<b>8</b> or the deliberate starvation of civilians as a 
method of warfare.<b>9</b>  In addition, violations of these rights have been increasingly documented 
by truth commissions set up to examine gross human rights violations by past regimes, even 
though their primary focus is generally on a few selected civil and political rights.<b>10</b>  The

 <p> 
</p>
<p>attention paid by international law and truth commissions to violations of economic, social and 
cultural rights confirms that these often serve as instruments of war and are a common feature of 
conflicts. 
</p>
<p>30. Violations of economic, social and cultural rights, or indeed any rights, do not take place 
in a vacuum.  Such violations often result from, as well as are the cause of violations of civil and 
political rights.  The different types of violations interact and mutually reinforce each other, 
often with devastating effects.  Systematic discrimination and inequalities in access to health 
care or housing, sometimes in the context of competition over scarce or dwindling resources, 
may lead to, or exacerbate, social or political tensions leading to conflict or violent 
confrontation, which in turn perpetuate cycles of deprivation and exclusion.<b>11</b>  This close 
interrelationship has been acknowledged by truth commissions as well.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>31. In a similar vein, organizations combating torture have come to the conclusion that there 
is a continuum between infringements of socio-economic rights and torture or other massive 
violations of civil and political rights.  Research shows that torture and collective violence - on 
the part of those who control the State in order to serve their own interests and among the 
victims - emerge in societies in which social injustice, marginalization and unrestrained 
exploitation thrive.<b>13</b>  A comprehensive strategy to fight torture or prevent violence should 
therefore address the socio-economic root causes of conflict and promote the respect of 
economic, social and cultural rights in addition to civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p>32. No transition to a just peace would be possible without addressing violations of 
economic, social and cultural rights along with violations of civil and political rights, and putting 
into place a non-discriminatory framework of access to resources and power.  In addition to 
conceptual and legal arguments about the obligation to promote economic, social and cultural 
rights, this is also a matter of effectiveness.  All sources and aspects of the violence (be it 
manifested through torture or disappearances, or through an armed conflict) must be addressed 
and victims of these violations must be offered remedies. </p>
<p><b>C. The realization of economic, social and cultural rights 
in post-conflict settings 
</b></p>
<p>33. There is thus no legal, conceptual or instrumental justification for the comparative 
neglect of economic, social and cultural rights in conflict and post-conflict societies.  An 
examination of post-conflict situations confirms the functional interaction between factors such 
as access to justice, political participation, control over economic resources, income, and

<p>enjoyment of social rights.  Civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are too strongly 
interdependent to be treated separately.  Action on any one front alone is not likely to work.  
Accordingly, strategies in post-conflict societies must be comprehensive, including specific 
measures to address violations of economic, social and cultural rights and to realize these rights 
alongside civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p>34. A wide range of strategies are necessary to ensure accountability for past abuses and to 
construct a society in which those abuses are less likely to occur.  While acknowledging that 
other strategies can be considered, the following section focuses on measures often adopted in 
post-conflict settings that seem particularly crucial to the protection and realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights and that have already shown their potential in this regard.  This 
selective examination of a few mechanisms and processes should not be taken to diminish the 
importance of other measures, such as peacekeeping, security measures, disarmament, 
demobilization, and reintegration of ex-combatants, or reconciliation processes, all of which are 
vital for the prospects for sustainable peace in any context. </p>
<p>35. Transitional justice mechanisms<b>14</b> are one of the obvious avenues for ensuring 
accountability for past abuses and establishing the true facts about crimes committed.  Some of 
these mechanisms have already considered economic, social and cultural rights in their work. 
International criminal tribunals have also been investigating and determining accountability for 
violations of economic, social and cultural rights in some instances, although approaches to these 
rights have been neither systematic nor comprehensive.  International criminal tribunals have 
found on several occasions that provided certain criteria are fulfilled, the &#8220;appropriation or 
plunder of property&#8221; and the &#8220;intentional or wanton destruction of private property including 
homes and business and public property including cultural monuments and sacred sites&#8221; may 
constitute acts of persecution amounting to crimes against humanity.<b>15</b>  In addition, penalties 
envisaged by the statutes of international courts include the ordering of the return of any property 
and proceeds acquired by criminal conduct to their rightful owners.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>36. Such cases illustrate that there is no fundamental legal or institutional obstacle to the 
judicial protection of economic, social and cultural rights and the provision of redress for any 
such violation under international criminal law.  On this basis, the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights has encouraged the international community to make greater use of existing 
statutes to adjudicate economic, social and cultural rights violations and to consider the 
possibility of international criminal law ultimately reaching beyond its current focus on property

</p>
<p>to encompass other gross violations of these rights, such as the deliberate denial of health care 
or education.<b>17</b>  The High Commissioner further noted that national or regional courts and 
quasi-judicial bodies mandated to protect human rights may be well placed to undertake the 
evidentiary assessment to determine the facts and responsibilities for violations committed, 
including those of economic, social and cultural rights.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>37. Truth commissions play important roles in identifying the true course of the past, 
examining the causes, consequences and nature of gross human rights violations and making 
recommendations accordingly.  For that reason, the High Commissioner has commented that 
they lend themselves well to the investigation and protection of economic, social and cultural 
rights.<b>19</b>  Some commissions have already made efforts to identify economic and social rights 
violations, on the basis that the impact of these violations on victims was as damaging as 
violations of civil and political rights.<b>20</b>  It is difficult to argue that gross violations of economic, 
social and cultural rights, such as massive forced evictions or interference with access to food or 
water, resulting in famine, loss of shelter or of livelihoods, should not be the subject of attention 
of truth commissions.  Where contextually appropriate, truth commissions can and should 
investigate violations of economic, social and cultural rights more systematically and provide 
effective and comprehensive remedies in case of clear violations.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>38. Reparations programmes offer a means to redress the economic and social problems that 
might have led to or exacerbated gross human rights and humanitarian law violations.  Some 
reparations programmes have already included measures related to socio-economic rights, such 
as housing and property restitution programmes, physical and mental health care, or social 
reinsertion measures.<b>22</b>  The practice to date, however, has been more limited, with the truth 
commissions that have proposed reparation measures generally focusing - with few exceptions - 
on victims of war crimes and other gross civil and political rights violations, thereby limiting the 
scope of reparation.  Against this backdrop, a significant recent development in the work of truth

<p>  Making the case for the integration of economic, social and cultural rights in transitional

<p>  See for instance reparations or restitution programmes in South Africa, Guatemala, Bosnia

(art. 75, Rome Statute), which could in principle relate to economic, social and cultural rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>commissions has been the inclusion of communal reparations in addition to individual ones, in 
order, for instance, to promote the development and reintegration of specific regions that had 
been particularly affected by violence and marginalized.<b>23</b>  This proposal reflects the 
understanding that an approach focused solely on individual victims of selected civil and 
political rights violations would ignore the plight of many other people who suffered differently 
but were equally affected by the conflict. 
</p>
<p>39. Communal reparations are a significant expansion of the scope of reparations 
programmes and would be an appropriate tool for truth commissions.  It remains the case, 
however, that, in the words of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, &#8220;[communal 
reparations do not] substitute for more broad-based and longer term socio-economic policies that 
aim to redress and prevent widespread inequalities and discrimination&#8221;.<b>24</b> </p>
<p>40. Ensuring accountability for a few civil and political rights violations will not bring full 
justice if the surrounding conditions leading to those violations are not addressed and 
discrimination between groups remains a reality.  Judicial redress, albeit crucial, has limitations.  
If unlawful discrimination is occurring, it must be challenged as a matter of principle, as with 
any other violation.  It is, however, equally crucial to address the legitimate grievances which, if 
ignored, are likely to fuel the next conflagration.  To the extent that socio-economic inequalities 
constitute a significant source of conflict and remain acute in the post-conflict period, correcting 
them should form a central aspect of policy design.  As the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights noted:  &#8220;Democracy, stability and peace cannot long survive in conditions of 
chronic poverty, dispossession and neglect&#8221; (A/CONF.157/PC/62/Add.5, para. 9). 
</p>
<p>41. Policies to redress inequalities can take several forms, such as temporary &#8220;special 
measures&#8221;<b>25</b> or programmes for vulnerable groups (such as minorities, women, children or 
civilian victims of war) who have been particularly discriminated against, or an emphasis on 
social policies, which have proven effective and more beneficial to growth than macroeconomic 
policies, in the immediate aftermath of a conflict.<b>26</b>  The rationale for these measures reflects the 
fact that entire groups may have been either discriminated against economically and socially or 
particularly affected by the conflict, groups who may not be the subject of attention from courts,

<p>truth commissions or reparation programmes.  While such measures are arguably a crucial part 
of the necessary reparation for victims of all types of violations and of a comprehensive strategy 
for the preservation of peace, they have often been neglected.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>42. The issues of sequencing and prioritization should be briefly examined in this context.  
Resistance to developing specific programmes for implementing economic, social and cultural 
rights is often based on the assumption that their realization will flow automatically from the 
enjoyment of civil and political rights, and that any imbalance in the full realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights could in the long term be corrected by the discipline of market forces in 
open economies.  Truth commissions have shown themselves vulnerable to these assumptions as 
well:  when investigating violations of economic, social and cultural rights, they have generally 
stopped short of proposing reparations to redress these violations, citing such concerns as 
feasibility and needs-based prioritization.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>43. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has emphasized that the full 
realization of human rights is rarely if ever achieved as a mere by-product, or fortuitous 
consequence, of some other programmes or developments - be it transition to a system of 
democracy or economic growth (see A/CONF.157/PC/62/Add.5, para. 3).<b>29  </b>The latter, for 
instance, does not automatically translate into an improvement of the standards of living of 
specific groups, unless special measures or policies are directed to those ends.<b>30</b>  The 
Committee further noted:  &#8220;Just as carefully targeted policies and unremitting vigilance are 
necessary to ensure that respect for civil and political rights will follow from, for example, the 
introduction or restoration of an essentially democratic system of government, so too is it 
essential that specific policies and programmes be devised and implemented by any Government 
which aims to ensure the respect of the economic, social and cultural rights of its citizens&#8221; 
(A/CONF.157/PC/62/Add.5, para. 4). 
</p>
<p>44. It is therefore crucial to specifically address violations of economic, social and cultural 
rights which have been at the root of the conflict or are consequences of it, as soon as the conflict 
ends.  In addition to being a matter of law, addressing socio-economic inequalities between 
groups as early as possible would also contribute to peacebuilding efforts.  Research suggests 
that once a country has had a civil war it is at greater risk of further war.  The typical country 
reaching the end of a civil war faces around a 44 per cent risk of returning to conflict within five 
years.  Reasons for this high risk seem twofold:  the same factors that caused the initial war are 
usually still present and, in addition, a civil war generally results in the deterioration of all

</p>
<p>aspects of economic, political and social life.<b>31</b>  Accordingly, efforts to address serious violations 
of international humanitarian law on the one hand and promote economic growth on the other, 
however crucial, will not bring the expected results - sustainable peace - if systemic violations of 
economic, social and cultural rights are not explicitly addressed alongside them.  This calls for 
legal and institutional foundations for the protection of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>45. In post-conflict settings, legislative and institutional frameworks are marked by the 
conflict in a variety of ways:  they may contribute to impunity or contain discriminatory 
elements, while they rarely reflect the minimum requirements set by international human rights 
standards.<b>32</b>  Therefore, a further step towards ensuring that human rights violations will not be 
perpetuated in the future is the creation or strengthening of an inclusive system of governance, 
politically, economically and socially, which guarantees non-discriminatory access to public 
services, power and resources for all.  This is extremely relevant for the realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>46. A compelling starting point in this respect is peace agreements, which are usually seen to 
precede the post-conflict phase.  Peace agreements not only end a conflict and a pattern of gross 
human rights violations.  In addition, they often lay the foundations for a wide range of political, 
legal or judicial arrangements and processes which may greatly support renewed State 
accountability and the reconstruction of a society based on the rule of law.  In this respect, the 
potential of peace agreements for protecting human rights in the long run should be further 
explored, notwithstanding the tensions between human rights considerations and the need for a 
rapid peace settlement.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>47. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has stressed that when peace agreements 
include human rights,<b>34</b> they should give adequate consideration to economic, social and cultural 
rights.<b>35  </b>The inclusion of these rights in peace agreements would seem particularly crucial if 
violations of them were sources of the conflict.  While peace agreements tend to recognize only 
civil and political rights, some agreements have expressly acknowledged the importance of 
social justice and the need to guarantee a number of economic, cultural and social rights, in 
particular those of marginalized groups, as a means to address widespread patterns of

<p>discrimination and ensure sustainable peace.<b>36</b>  Other peace agreements ensured the right to 
equal opportunity in social and economic activities, and proposed measures related to combating 
unemployment and strengthening non-discrimination legislation in order to eliminate the 
differential in unemployment rates between communities,<b>37</b> or recognized the application in the 
State territory of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, among 
other treaties.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>48. Key measures to ensure the protection and realization of all human rights, including 
economic, social and cultural rights, in post-conflict settings comprise their incorporation or 
recognition in the domestic legal system, starting - if possible and relevant to the context - with 
the State&#8217;s constitutional instrument.  Some constitutions have incorporated economic, social and 
cultural rights, such as rights related to labour, property, housing, health care, food, social 
security, or education.  In some cases, the integration of these rights into a new constitution 
might be a direct result of the experience of violations of economic, social and cultural rights in 
the past.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p>49. Legislation provides an important means of recognizing economic, social and cultural 
rights at the domestic level and is an important step towards their effective realization.  The 
legislative recognition of these rights can further contribute to the redress of discriminatory 
patterns and inequalities, thereby complementing other mechanisms of redress and reparation.<b>40</b>  
By themselves, however, legislative measures are not sufficient, but are dependent on 
implementation.  In this respect, institutions specifically aimed at monitoring and protecting 
human rights, in particular national human rights institutions or quasi-judicial bodies, should be 
set up or strengthened.  Existing ones already play an increasingly important role in ensuring 
legal protection of economic, social and cultural rights.<b>41</b>

and sets up a series of measures to address widespread inequities (see in particular

 <p> 
</p>
<p>50. While acknowledging the constraints put on the justice system in a post-conflict situation, 
and its possible complicity in past abuses (whether through the facilitation of abuse or in its 
failure to provide redress), judicial protection remains key to the protection of economic, social 
and cultural rights.<b>42</b>  Even though national courts have traditionally focused more on civil and 
political rights, the judicial protection of certain economic, social and cultural rights is far from 
new - examples include workers&#8217; rights or protection against discrimination.  Relevant 
jurisprudence has burgeoned in the last decade, enforcing a wide range of economic, social and 
cultural rights, such as the rights to health, food, social security or adequate housing.  This 
growing corpus of case law at national, regional and international levels on a full range of 
economic, social and cultural rights clearly demonstrates that these rights lend themselves to 
judicial scrutiny and enforcement.<b>43</b>  Moreover, judicial protection can be very effective and 
even have life-saving implications, such as in recent cases of court-mandated food distribution or 
access to essential medication.  Therefore, programmes to strengthen national justice systems 
and institutions in the aftermath of conflict should pay equal attention to economic, social and 
cultural rights.  The inclusion of particular protection for economic, social and cultural rights 
alongside civil and political rights throughout the legal and institutional foundations of 
post-conflict societies would exponentially increase the chances for the preservation of peace 
in the long term. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>In considering and determining strategies for ensuring accountability and peace in 
conflict and post-conflict societies, it is important to keep in mind the indivisibility and 
interrelatedness of human rights.  Civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights are 
too interdependent to be realized in isolation.  While it may seem at first difficult to 
embark on a comprehensive strategy for protecting all rights, such an approach will pay 
off in the long term.  Indeed, an exclusive preoccupation with civil and political rights 
violations and the failure to recognize the role of economic, social and cultural rights 
violations in triggering or fuelling conflict may make conflicts more pervasive than they 
would otherwise be.  Similarly, post</b>-<b>conflict strategies to consolidate peace and maintain it 
in the long run should recognize the contribution that the realization of economic, social 
and cultural rights could make in this respect.</b> 
</p>
<p>52. <b>A comprehensive strategy for post-conflict settings should not wait for long-term 
development to protect and realize economic, social and cultural rights.  Rather, these 
rights should be taken into consideration at each step of the way.  While transitional justice 
mechanisms have started to address economic, social and cultural rights violations to some

<p>53. <b>Further requirements include that protective constitutional, legislative and judicial 
measures be put in place to ensure that gross human rights violations, including of 
economic, social and cultural rights, will not be perpetuated in the future.  The systematic 
anchoring of economic, social and cultural rights in the political, legal and social edifice of 
societies is key in this context.

<p>54. <b>This report has briefly examined conceptual, legal and instrumental reasons why 
economic, social and cultural rights must be addressed in societies emerging from conflict.  
Strategies to protect and realize these rights should be further explored, so as to ensure 
true protection to victims of conflicts and comprehensively address complex post-conflict 
realities, as part of the transition to a sustainable, peaceful society based on the rule of law.
