Kirk Milling, CEO, commented “I’m pleased to report the corrective actions we undertook earlier
in the year to resolve production issues encountered from lower ore quality paid off in the form of
higher production and sales volumes in the quarter. In fact, we set several new production
records during the quarter as we came out of our maintenance outage in April and believe we are
poised for even higher production levels in the second half of the year.
“International pricing was relatively flat compared to first quarter as higher Asian prices were
offset by mix issues experienced in Latin America. We believe most of the Chinese production
that was taken off-line earlier in the year is now running again and therefore we anticipate this
will lead to slightly softer prices in Asia during the 3rd quarter. However, we should be able to
offset any pricing impact with continued diligent cost management and higher production
volumes.  As a result, we remain comfortable with our 2016 outlook.”

Consolidated Results
Net sales. Net sales decreased by 4.5% to $116.7 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 from $122.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, driven by a decrease in total
average sales price of 6.8%, slightly offset by an increase in soda ash volumes sold of 2.5%.
Domestic average sales price declined 4.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2016, mostly
due to freight. Our efforts to increase our domestic market share resulted in soda ash prices flat to
slightly below 2015 levels. However, we had more volume in 2016 to customers who arrange
their own freight, as well as one customer who switched volume to a closer location, resulting in
lower freight costs. Lower freight costs resulted in a $9.77 reduction in domestic average price
per short ton in the second quarter of 2016.
International average sales price declined 8.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2016,
slightly lower than our full year outlook. Our international sales include both ANSAC and
customers in Europe and South Africa. We made a decision to scale back our sales volume into
Europe in 2016 due to unfavorable exchange rates, as our net profit from both ANSAC and
domestic volumes are higher. The mix shift from Europe to additional ANSAC volume results in
lower international prices as the Europe price includes freight all the way to the customer’s
location.
Cost of products sold. Cost of products sold, including depreciation, depletion and amortization
expense, decreased by 3.6% to $88.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from
$91.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, due primarily to a decrease in
maintenance and operating costs, freight costs and compensation and benefit costs, partially
offset by an increase in royalty rates and energy costs as a result of higher soda ash volume sold.

Consolidated Results
Net sales. Net sales decreased by 4.7% to $231.1 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 from $242.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, driven by a decrease in total
average sales price of 6.4%, slightly offset by an increase in soda ash volumes sold of 1.8%.

per short ton for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
International average sales price declined 7.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2016, slightly
lower than our annual outlook. Our international sales include both ANSAC and customers in
Europe and South Africa. We made a decision to scale back our sales volume into Europe in
2016 due to unfavorable exchange rates, as our net profit from both ANSAC and domestic
volumes are higher. The mix shift from Europe to additional ANSAC volume results in lower
international prices as the Europe price includes freight all the way to the customer’s location.
Cost of products sold. Cost of products sold, including depreciation, depletion and amortization
expense, decreased by 2.7% to $174.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from
$179.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, due primarily to a decrease in
maintenance and operating costs, freight costs and compensation and benefit costs, partially
offset by an increase in royalty rates.

FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY
As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $16.8 million. In addition, we have
approximately $104 million ($200 million, less $76 million outstanding and less standby letters of
credit of $20 million) of remaining capacity under our revolving credit facilities. As of June 30,
2016, our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios, as calculated per the Ciner Wyoming Credit
Facility, were 0.89 and 1.20, respectively.
CASH FLOWS AND QUARTERLY CASH DISTRIBUTION
  
Cash Flows
Cash provided by operating activities increased to $66.1 million during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $61.5 million of cash generated during six months ended June 30,
2015, primarily driven by an increase in cash flows provided from working capital of $9.8 million,
partially offset by a decrease of $8.1 million in net income during the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to six months ended June 30, 2015.
Cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 were partially
offset by cash used in investing activities of $11.2 million for capital expenditures and cash used
in financing activities during the six month period of $58.5 million, of which majority was due to
distributions paid of $44.5 million and repayments on the Ciner Wyoming revolving credit facility
of $14.0 million.
Quarterly Distribution
On July 14, 2016, the Partnership declared its second quarter 2016 quarterly distribution of
$0.567 per unit. This represents an increase of 0.5% and 4.1% over the distributions declared
during the first quarter 2016 and second quarter of 2015, respectively. The quarterly cash
distribution is payable on August 12, 2016 to unitholders of record on July 29, 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States (“GAAP”). We also present the non-GAAP financial measures of:
•Adjusted EBITDA;
•Distributable cash flow; and
•Distribution coverage ratio.
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax,
depreciation, depletion and amortization and certain other expenses that are non-cash charges
or that we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations. Distributable cash flow is defined
as Adjusted EBITDA less net cash paid for interest, maintenance capital expenditures and
income taxes, each as attributable to Ciner Resources LP. Distributable cash flow will not reflect
changes in working capital balances. We define distribution coverage ratio as the ratio of
distributable cash flow as of the end of the period to cash distributions payable with respect to
such period.
•
•
Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio are non-GAAP
supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated
financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use
to assess:
our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in our industry,
without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods;
•the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders;
•our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and
the viability of capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment
opportunities.
We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution
coverage ratio provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and
results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and
distributable cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Our non-
GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage
ratio should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP net income, operating income, net cash
provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity
presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have
important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all items that affect
net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Investors should not consider Adjusted
EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio in isolation or as a substitute for
analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash
flow and distribution coverage ratio may be defined differently by other companies, including
those in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution
coverage ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby
diminishing its utility.

(1)  The Partnership may fund expansion-related capital expenditures with borrowings under
existing credit facilities such that expansion-related capital expenditures will have no impact on
cash on hand or the calculation of cash available for distribution.  In certain instances, the timing
of the Partnership’s borrowings and/or its cash management practices will result in a mismatch
between the period of the borrowing and the period of the capital expenditure.  In those
instances, the Partnership adjusts designated reserves (as provided in the partnership
agreement) to take account of the timing difference.  Accordingly, expansion-related capital
expenditures have been excluded from the presentation of cash available for distribution.
