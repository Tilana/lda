(1) Omitted pursuant to General Instructions II.E of Form S-3. An indeterminate number or amount, as the case may be, of debt securities, common stock,
preferred  stock,  warrants  and  subscription  receipts  or  any  combination  thereof  are  being  registered  hereunder  as  may  from  time  to  time  be  issued  at
indeterminate prices. The securities being registered hereunder may be convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for other securities of any identified
class, and may be sold separately or in combination. In addition to the securities that may be issued directly under this registration statement, there is being
registered hereunder such indeterminate aggregate number or amount, as the case may be, of the securities of each identified class as may from time to time
be issued upon the conversion, exchange, settlement or exercise of other securities offered hereby. Separate consideration may or may not be received for
securities  that  are  issuable  upon  the  conversion  or  exercise  of,  or  in  exchange  for,  other  securities  offered  hereby  or  that  are  offered  in  combination.
Securities registered hereby may be offered for U.S. dollars or the equivalent thereof in foreign currencies.
(2) Pursuant  to  Rules  456(b)  and  457(r)  under  the  Securities  Act  of  1933,  as  amended  (the  “Securities  Act”),  the  Registrant  is  deferring  payment  of  all
registration fees in respect of securities which are being registered in an indeterminate amount.
(3) Represents (i) up to 4,875,177 shares of common stock that may be issued upon exchange or redemption of up to 4,875,177 exchangeable shares that were
issued by Gran Tierra Exchangeco Inc. (“Exchangeco”), a subsidiary of Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (“Gran Tierra”), in connection with the combination of the
registrant and Solana Resources Limited (“Solana”) and (ii) up to 3,638,889 shares of common stock that may be issued upon exchange or redemption of up
to 3,638,889 exchangeable shares that were issued by Gran Tierra Goldstrike Inc. (“Goldstrike Exchangeco”), a subsidiary of Gran Tierra, in connection
with  the combination of  the registrant and Goldstrike, Inc.  (“Goldstrike”).  Also includes, pursuant to Rule 416(a)  under  the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, any additional securities that may be offered or issued to prevent dilution resulting from stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar
transactions.  Under  all  circumstances,  the  maximum  aggregate  number  of  shares  of  common  stock  registered  hereby  underlying  the  Exchangeco  and
Goldstrike Exchangeco exchangeable shares that may be issued is 8,514,066 (and any additional securities that may be offered or issued to prevent dilution
resulting from stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar transactions). Accordingly, the maximum aggregate offering price and the amount of
the registration fee are based on this maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued.
(4) Estimated solely for purposes of calculating the registration fee pursuant to Rule 457(c) of the Securities Act, based on the average high and low per share
prices of Gran Tierra common stock on July 26, 2016, as reported on the NYSE MKT.

stock upon conversion of 57,835,134 subscription receipts previously issued by Gran Tierra. Also includes, pursuant to Rule 416(a) under the Securities
Act, any additional  securities  that may  be offered  or issued  to  prevent dilution  resulting from stock splits, stock dividends,  recapitalizations  or similar
transactions. Under all circumstances the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock registered hereby underlying the subscription receipts
that may be sold is 57,835,134 (and any additional securities that may be offered or issued to prevent dilution resulting from stock splits, stock dividends,
recapitalizations  or  similar  transactions).  Accordingly,  the  maximum  aggregate  offering  price  and  the  amount  of  the  registration  fee  are  based  on  this
maximum aggregate number of shares that may be sold.

ABOUT THE PETROLATINA ACQUISITION
On June 30, 2016, Gran Tierra Energy International Holdings Ltd., a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Gran Tierra, entered into a share purchase
agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with Tribeca Oil & Gas Inc., Macquarie Bank Limited and Rorick Ventures Group Inc., as vendors (the “Vendors”), 
and Petrolatina Energy Limited (“PetroLatina”) providing for the acquisition of PetroLatina for cash consideration of $525 million (the “Acquisition”). Funding 
for the Acquisition will consist of an initial payment of $500 million at closing, subject to closing adjustments, and a deferred payment of $25 million to be paid 
prior to December 31, 2016. Subsequent to the signing of the Acquisition Agreement, Gran Tierra delivered $5 million to Macquarie Bank Limited, which funds
are to be held in escrow and applied to the initial payment at closing (the “Escrow Funds”).
2
Gran Tierra expects to fund the Acquisition through a combination of Gran Tierra’s current cash balance, gross proceeds of $173.5 million from the
recently consummated private placement of subscription receipts, available borrowings under Gran Tierra’s revolving loan credit facility and $130 million of 
borrowings under a new term loan under the credit facility that is contingent upon the close of the Acquisition. For more information on the private placement, 
please read “Description of Capital Stock – Private Placement Subscription Receipts”.
The Acquisition was unanimously approved by the board of directors of Gran Tierra. The Vendors collectively hold more than 80% of the shares of
PetroLatina.  Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, it is a condition of closing that all of the remaining shares of PetroLatina are acquired pursuant to 
the drag-along provisions of the Articles of Association of PetroLatina upon the closing of the Acquisition. The Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or 
waiver of customary closing conditions, including, among other things, regulatory approvals. Approval from the Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (National 
Hydrocarbon Agency) of Colombia, was received on July 29, 2016 and the Acquisition is expected to close prior to August 31, 2016. Please read “Risk Factors 
– The acquisition of Petrolatina may not be completed, and even if the acquisition is completed, we may fail to realize the benefits anticipated as a result of the 
acquisition.” The Acquisition Agreement also contains mutual representations and warranties of the parties covering customary matters. Each of the parties also 
makes various covenants in the Acquisition Agreement, including those requiring the parties to use reasonable commercial efforts to consummate the 
transaction.
The Acquisition Agreement may be terminated by either Gran Tierra or the Vendors under certain circumstances set forth in the Acquisition Agreement,
including, among other circumstances, the failure of the Acquisition to be consummated on or before October 31, 2016. If the Acquisition Agreement is 
terminated by Gran Tierra as a result of the Vendors breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or obligations, the Vendors’ aggregate maximum 
liability will be limited to $5.0 million, and the Escrow Funds will be returned to Gran Tierra. If the Acquisition Agreement is terminated as a result of Gran 
Tierra breaching any representations, warranties, covenants or obligations, Gran Tierra’s maximum liability will be limited to the loss of the Escrow Funds 
deposited by Gran Tierra subsequent to the signing of the Acquisition Agreement.
PetroLatina is a private, independent exploration and production company with assets primarily in the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin of Colombia.
PetroLatina holds approximately 469 thousand working interest acres in the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin, Llanos Basin and Putumayo Basin of Colombia.

Estimated Reserves
Estimates of PetroLatina’s 2015 oil and gas reserves were prepared in connection with the Acquisition by McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd., an
independent third-party petroleum engineering firm.
The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and requires significant judgment, as discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” contained in
our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The reserve estimation process requires the use of significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of
available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each property. Therefore, the accuracy of the reserve estimate is dependent on the quality
of the data, the accuracy of the assumptions based on the data and the interpretations and judgment related to the data.
Proved  reserves  are  reserves  which,  by  analysis  of  geoscience  and  engineering  data,  can  be  estimated  with  reasonable  certainty  to  be  economically
producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the
time at which contracts providing the right to operate expires, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. The term “reasonable certainty”
implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty,
the independent reserve engineers employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. Estimates of proved
reserves are generated through the integration of relevant geological, engineering, and production data, utilizing technologies that have been demonstrated in the
field  to  yield  repeatable  and  consistent  results  as  defined  in  the  SEC  regulations.  Data  used  in  these  integrated  assessments  included  information  obtained
directly from the subsurface through wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production
test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements such as
seismic data. Reservoir parameters from analogous reservoirs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates when available. The
method or combination of methods used to estimate the reserves of each reservoir was based on the unique circumstances of each reservoir and the dataset
available at the time of the estimate. Probable reserves are reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved
reserves,  are  as  likely  as  not  to  be  recovered.  Estimates  of  probable  reserves  which  may  potentially  be  recoverable  through  additional  drilling  or  recovery
techniques are by nature more uncertain than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of not actually being realized
by us.
Possible reserves are reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. Estimates of possible reserves are also inherently imprecise.
Estimates  of  probable  and  possible  reserves  are  also  continually  subject  to  revisions  based  on  production  history,  results  of  additional  exploration  and
development, price changes and other factors.

RISK FACTORS
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should consider carefully the risks and 
uncertainties described under the heading “Risk Factors” discussed under the section entitled “Risk Factors” contained in our most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K, any subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any subsequently filed Current Report on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments thereto 
reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC, which are incorporated herein by reference, and those risk factors that may be included in any applicable 
prospectus supplement, together with other information in this prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference and any free writing prospectus that we may 
authorize for use in connection with this offering. The risks described in these documents are not the only ones we face. There may be other unknown or 
unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future results. Past financial 
performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any
of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price 
of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. Please also read carefully the section below entitled “Special Note 
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
The acquisition of Petrolatina may not be completed, and even if the acquisition is completed, we may fail to realize the benefits anticipated as a result of the
acquisition.
The Acquisition is expected to close prior to August 31, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions including, among other things, regulatory approval. 
Approval from the Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (National Hydrocarbon Agency) of Colombia, was received on July 29, 2016. If these conditions are not 
satisfied or waived, the Acquisition will not be consummated. There can be no assurances that the Acquisition will be consummated or that the expected 
benefits of the Acquisition will be realized. If the Acquisition is delayed, not consummated or consummated in a manner different than previously disclosed, the 
price of our common stock may decline.
If we are able to consummate the Acquisition, such consummation would involve potential risks, including, without limitation, inefficiencies and
unexpected costs and liabilities. If we consummate the Acquisition and if these risks or other expected costs and liabilities were to materialize, any desired 
benefits of the Acquisition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our future financial performance and results of operations could be negatively impacted.
SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This prospectus and the documents we have filed with the SEC that are incorporated by reference contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the 
Exchange Act. These statements relate to future events or to our future operating or financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties 
and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or 
achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about:
(cid:120)

our business strategy and our expectations with respect to the implementation of our business strategy;
our expectations with respect to the drilling, exploration or development of our resources;
our intended capital spending program, including expected costs and the allocation of our capital spending program;
our production expectations, the product mix of such production and expectations respecting production growth or maintenance; and

RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES
The following table sets forth, for each of the periods presented, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges or our deficiency of earnings to cover fixed charges.
Our earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The 
following table sets forth our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, and our deficiency of earnings available 
to cover fixed charges for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

For purposes of computing the ratio above, earnings consist of (loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes plus fixed charges. Fixed
charges include interest expense and the portion of operating lease expense that represents interest.
We had no preferred stock outstanding for any period presented, and accordingly, the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock
dividends is the same as the ratio of earnings to fixed charges.

SELLING STOCKHOLDERS
This prospectus covers the offering and sale, from time to time, of up to 57,835,134 shares of common stock by the selling stockholders. These shares of 
common stock will be issued to the selling stockholders upon conversion of the private placement subscription receipts. Such private placement subscription 
receipts were sold by us in a private placement to certain eligible purchasers in July 2016. The terms of conversion of the private placement subscription receipts
and the private placement are described in “Description of Capital Stock – Private Placement Subscription Receipts.”
The initial issuance of the private placement subscription receipts was, and the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the private
placement subscription receipts will be, exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. We are registering the offer and sale by the selling 
stockholders of the shares of common stock described below pursuant to the provisions of the RRAs (as defined below). For more information regarding the 
RRAs, please read “Description of Capital Stock – Private Placement Subscription Receipts.”
No offer or sale may occur unless the registration statement that includes this prospectus remains effective at the time such selling stockholder offers or
sells shares of our common stock. We are required, under certain circumstances, to update, supplement or amend this prospectus to reflect material 
developments in our business, financial position and results of operations and may do so by an amendment to this prospectus, a prospectus supplement or a 
future filing with the SEC incorporated by reference in this prospectus.
The following table sets forth information relating to the selling stockholders as of July 27, 2016 based on information supplied to us by the selling
stockholders on or prior to that date. We have not sought to verify such information. Information concerning the selling stockholders may change over time and 
selling stockholders may be added. If necessary, we will supplement this prospectus accordingly. Except as set forth below, none of the selling stockholders is a 
broker-dealer registered under Section 15 of the Exchange Act or an affiliate of a broker-dealer registered under Section 15 of the Exchange Act.
The selling stockholders may hold or acquire at any time shares of our common stock in addition to those offered by this prospectus and may have acquired
additional shares of our common stock since the date on which the information reflected herein was provided to us. In addition, the selling stockholders may 
have sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of some or all of their shares of our common stock since the date on which the information reflected herein was 
provided to us and may in the future sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of some or all of their shares of our common stock in private placement transactions 
exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
As of July 29, 2016, none of the private placement subscription receipts had been converted into shares of common stock. The beneficial ownership
information presented below assumes that all 57,835,134 Subscription Receipts have been converted pursuant to the Conversion (as defined below) for an 
equivalent number of shares of our common stock and such shares of our common stock are held by the selling stockholders. For purposes of the table below, 
we assume that all shares covered by this prospectus will be sold.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes voting or investment power with respect to shares of common
stock and the right to acquire such voting or investment power within 60 days through the exercise of any option, warrant or other right. Unless otherwise 
indicated below, to our knowledge, all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of common stock 
beneficially owned by them. Except as described in the footnotes to the following table, none of the persons named in the table has held any position or office or 
had any other material relationship with us or our affiliates during the three years prior to the date of this prospectus. The inclusion of any shares of common 
stock in this table does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership for the person named below.
The percentages in the table are based on 355,672,088 shares of common stock outstanding as of July 29, 2016, which, for purposes of this table includes
57,835,134 shares of common stock issuable upon Conversion of the Subscription Receipts and 3,638,889 shares of Goldstrike Exchangeco and 4,875,177 
shares of Exchangeco issued and outstanding as of July 29, 2016, as such exchangeable shares are immediately exchangeable for shares of our common stock 
and vote together with our common stock on all matters as if shares of our common stock. In calculating this percentage for a particular selling stockholder, we 
treated as outstanding the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of that particular holder’s 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 
of Gran Tierra (the “convertible notes”) and did not assume conversion of any other holder’s convertible notes.

Authorized Capital Stock
DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
Our restated articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 595,000,002 shares of our capital stock, of which 570,000,000 are designated as common 
stock, par value $0.001 per share, 25 million are designated as preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, one share is designated as Special A Voting Stock, 
par value $0.001 per share, and one share is designated as Special B Voting Stock, par value $0.001 per share.
Capital Stock Issued and Outstanding
The following description of our capital stock is derived from various provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws, and such other documents as
relate to the issuance of the two series of exchangeable shares.
Common Stock
We are authorized to issue 570,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Holders of the common stock are entitled to one vote for each
share on all matters submitted to a stockholder vote. Holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. Therefore, holders of a majority of the 
shares of common stock voting for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Holders of the common stock representing a majority of the voting 
power of the capital stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, are necessary to constitute a quorum at any meeting of 
stockholders. A vote by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock is required to effectuate certain fundamental corporate changes 
such as liquidation, merger or an amendment to the articles of incorporation.
Holders of common stock are entitled to share in all dividends that the board of directors, in its discretion, declares from legally available funds. In the 
event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each outstanding share entitles its holder to participate pro rata in all assets that remain after payment of 
liabilities and after providing for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the common stock. Holders of the common stock have no pre-emptive 
rights, no conversion rights and there are no redemption provisions applicable to the common stock.
Preferred Stock
We are authorized to issue 25,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The board of directors is vested with authority to 
divide the shares of preferred stock into series and to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of the shares of any such series. Once authorized, the 
dividend or interest rates, conversion rates, voting rights, redemption prices, maturity dates and similar characteristics of the preferred stock will be determined 
by the board of directors, without the necessity of obtaining approval of the stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock 
with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, 
while providing flexibility in connection with financings, possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of 
delaying, deferring, discouraging or preventing a change in control of our company, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting 
and other rights of the holders of common stock, and may reduce the likelihood that common stockholders will receive dividend payments and payments upon 
liquidation.
We will fix the designations, voting powers, preferences and rights of the preferred stock of each series we issue under this prospectus, as well as the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, in the certificate of designation relating to that series. We will file as an exhibit to the registration statement of

Special A Voting Stock
The one share of Special A Voting Stock was created to allow the holders of exchangeable shares (“GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares”), issued by our
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary Gran Tierra Goldstrike Inc. (“Goldstrike Exchangeco”), in connection with our combination with Goldstrike, Inc. 
(“Goldstrike”) in 2005, to vote at our stockholder meetings and exercise the other rights that the holders of our common stock may exercise. The holder of the 
one share of Special A Voting Stock is not entitled to receive dividends or distributions, but has the right to vote on each matter on which holders of our 
common stock are entitled to vote and to cast that number of votes equal to the number of GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares outstanding that are not owned 
by us or our subsidiaries. In connection with the share exchange transaction involving the former shareholders of Gran Tierra Canada, and pursuant to the 
Voting Exchange and Trust Agreement dated November 10, 2005 between Goldstrike, 1203647 Alberta Inc. (“Callco”), Goldstrike Exchangeco and Olympia 
Trust Company (now Computershare Trust Company of Canada) (the “Voting Exchange and Support Agreement”), the share of Special A Voting Stock was 
issued to a trustee for the holders of GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares (the “Special A Trustee”). The Special A Trustee may only cast votes with respect to 
the share of Special A Voting Stock based on instructions received from the holders of GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares. The GTE-Goldstrike 
Exchangeable Shares are described more fully below.
17
GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares
Each GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Share can be exchanged by the holder for one share of our common stock at any time, subject to compliance with the 
articles of Goldstrike Exchangeco and the retraction call right described below, and will receive the same dividends payable on our common stock. At the time 
of exchange, taxes may be due from the holders of the GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares. The GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares have voting rights 
through the one share of Special A Voting Stock described above, and the holders thereof are able to vote on all matters on which the holders of our common 
stock are entitled to vote.
In order to exchange GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares for shares of common stock, a holder of GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares must submit a
retraction request to Goldstrike Exchangeco together with the share certificate representing the GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed. Callco is 
a corporation incorporated under the laws of Alberta and is our wholly-owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the Voting Exchange and Support Agreement, Callco has 
an overriding retraction call right to purchase any GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares for which a retraction request has been submitted by providing the 
holder of the GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares subject to a retraction request with one share of our common stock for each GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable 
Share subject to the retraction request. Pursuant to the Voting Exchange and Support Agreement, we are obligated to deliver shares of our common stock to 
Callco in order to satisfy the obligations of Callco under the retraction call right. A holder of GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares may revoke their retraction 
request in writing to Goldstrike Exchangeco by close of business on the third business day prior to the date specified in the retraction request, however, in the 
event that the retraction request is not revoked by the holder and Callco does not exercise its right to override the holder’s retraction request, Goldstrike 
Exchangeco will redeem the retracted shares on the date specified in the retraction request.
If, as a result of solvency requirements or applicable law, Goldstrike Exchangeco is not permitted to redeem all of the GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable
Shares identified in the retraction request, and Callco has not exercised its retraction call right, Goldstrike Exchangeco will redeem only those retracted GTE-
Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares tendered by the holder as would not be contrary to provisions of applicable law. The Special A Trustee, on behalf of the holder 
of any retracted shares not so redeemed by Goldstrike Exchangeco or purchased by Callco, will require us to purchase the unredeemed retracted shares on the 
date set forth in the retraction request.
We have an overriding right to purchase, or cause Callco to purchase, all GTE–Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares for common stock in the event of a change 
of law that permits holders of GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares to exchange their GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares for shares of common stock on a 
basis that will not require holders to recognize a gain or loss for Canadian tax purposes. In addition, subject to applicable law, Goldstrike Exchangeco may at 
any time and from time to time purchase for cancellation all or any part of the outstanding GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares.
Holders of GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares have the right to instruct the Special A Trustee to cause Callco to purchase GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable 
Shares for shares of our common stock if Goldstrike Exchangeco becomes insolvent or institutes insolvency proceedings. In addition, Callco will be deemed to 
have purchased the GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares for shares of common stock if we are subject to liquidation, wound up or dissolved.
Special B Voting Stock
The one share of Special B Voting Stock was designated to allow former shareholders of Solana who elected, pursuant to the terms of the arrangement
agreement by and among us, Exchangeco and Solana (the “Arrangement Agreement”), to receive exchangeable shares (“GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares”), 
issued by our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary Solana Exchangeco, in lieu of shares of our common stock, to vote at our stockholder meetings. The holder of 
the one share of Special B Voting Stock is not entitled to receive dividends or distributions, but has the right to vote on each matter on which holders of our 
common stock are entitled to vote and to cast that number of votes equal to the number of GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares outstanding that are not owned by 
us or our affiliates. In connection with the arrangement under the Arrangement Agreement, and pursuant to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement between 
Solana Exchangeco, us and Computershare Trust Company of Canada (the “Solana Exchangeco Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement”), the share of Special 
B Voting Stock was issued to Computershare Trust Company of Canada as trustee for the holders of GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares (the “Special B 
Trustee”). The Special B Trustee may only cast votes with respect to the share of Special B Voting Stock based on instructions received from the holders of 
GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares. The GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares are described more fully below.
18
GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares
Under the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, certain Canadian Solana shareholders received GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares instead of shares of our
common stock. Each GTE-Solana Exchangeable Share can be exchanged by the holder for one share of our common stock at any time, subject to compliance 
with the articles of Solana Exchangeco and the retraction call right described below, and will receive the same dividends payable on our common stock. At the 
time of exchange, taxes may be due from the holders of the GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares. The GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares have voting rights 
through the one share of Special B Voting Stock described above, and the holders thereof are able to vote on all matters on which the holders of our common 
stock are entitled to vote.
In order to exchange the GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares for shares of Gran Tierra common stock, a holder of GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares must
submit a retraction request to Solana Exchangeco together with the share certificate representing the GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed. 
Pursuant to the articles of Solana Exchangeco and the Support Agreement, dated November 14, 2008, between us, Gran Tierra Callco ULC, a corporation 
incorporated under the laws of Alberta and our direct wholly-owned subsidiary (“Solana Callco”) and Solana Exchangeco (the “Support Agreement”), Callco 
has an overriding retraction call right to purchase all of the GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares for a price per GTE-Solana Exchangeable Share equal to one 
share of our common stock and (provided that the GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares are held on the applicable dividend record date), on the payment date for 
any declared and unpaid dividends, an amount in cash equal to such dividends on that GTE-Solana Exchangeable Share less any amount withheld on account of 
tax (the “Purchase Price”). A holder of GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares may revoke their retraction request in writing to Solana Exchangeco by close of 
business on the business day prior to the date specified in the retraction request, however, in the event that the retraction request is not revoked by the holder and 
Solana Callco does not exercise its right to override the holder’s retraction request, Solana Exchangeco will redeem the retracted shares on the date specified in 
the retraction request.
If, as a result of solvency requirements or applicable law, Solana Exchangeco is not permitted to redeem all of the GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares
identified in the retraction request, and Solana Callco has not exercised its retraction call right, Solana Exchangeco will redeem only those retracted GTE-Solana 
Exchangeable Shares tendered by the holder as would not be contrary to provisions of applicable law. The Special B Trustee, on behalf of the holder of any 
retracted shares not so redeemed by Solana Exchangeco or purchased by Solana Callco, will require us to purchase the unredeemed retracted shares on the date 
set forth in the retraction request.
The GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares are subject to redemption by Solana Exchangeco for shares of our common stock at any time on such date
established by the board of directors of Solana Exchangeco, which date will be no earlier than November 14, 2013, unless: (i) there are issued and outstanding 
less than 25,285,358 GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares not held by us or our affiliates; (ii) a control transaction for us occurs, being any merger, amalgamation, 
tender offer, material sale of shares or rights or interests therein or thereto or similar transactions involving us, or any proposal to carry out the same, and upon 
the determination of the board of directors of Solana Exchangeco that such redemption is necessary to effectuate the control transaction, among other things; 
(iii) any proposal subject to the vote of holders of GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares, as shareholders of Solana Exchangeco, the bona fide purpose of which the 
board of directors of Solana Exchangeco determines is not practicable to accomplish, excluding matters related to the equivalence of the rights of GTE-Solana 
Exchangeable Shares and our common stock, and matters in respect of which holders of GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares are entitled to vote, or to direct the 
Special B Trustee to vote, under the Solana Exchangeco Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement; or (iv) the business day following the day when holders of 
GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares fail to approve or disapprove, as applicable, a proposed change in the terms of the GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares where 
the approval or disapproval of such proposed change is required to maintain their economic equivalence to shares of our common stock.
19
Solana Callco has an overriding redemption call right to purchase all of the GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares not held by us or our affiliates upon the 
occurrence of one of the above described redemption events. Upon exercise of Solana Callco’s redemption call right, holders of GTE-Solana Exchangeable 
Shares will be obligated to sell their GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares to Solana Callco and Solana Exchangeco’s right and obligation to redeem the GTE–
Solana Exchangeable Shares will terminate upon payment by Solana Callco of the Purchase Price for the GTE–Solana Exchangeable Shares.
We have an overriding right to purchase, or cause Solana Callco to purchase, all GTE–Solana Exchangeable Shares for common stock in the event of a
change of law that permits holders of GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares to exchange their GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares for shares of common stock on a 
basis that will not require holders to recognize a gain or loss for Canadian tax purposes. In addition, subject to applicable law, Solana Exchangeco may at any 
time and from time to time purchase for cancellation all or any part of the outstanding GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares.
Holders of GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares have the right to instruct the Special B Trustee to cause us to purchase GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares for
shares of common stock if Solana Exchangeco becomes insolvent or institutes insolvency proceedings. In addition, we will be deemed to have purchased the 
GTE-Solana Exchangeable Shares for shares of common stock if we are subject to liquidation, wound up or dissolved.
Private Placement Subscription Receipts
On July 8, 2016, we issued 57,835,134 subscription receipts at a price of $3.00 per subscription receipt in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act and in Canada by way of a private placement in all provinces of Canada under applicable accredited investor and director and executive 
officer private placement exemptions. The private placement subscription receipts were issued by Gran Tierra pursuant to a subscription receipt agreement (the 
“Subscription Receipt Agreement”) by and between Gran Tierra and Computershare Trust Company of Canada, as subscription receipt agent. Pursuant to the 
terms of the Subscription Receipt Agreement, the gross proceeds from the sale and issuance of the subscription receipts (less 50% of the Agency Fee (as defined 
in the Subscription Receipt Agreement)), were placed in an escrow account. Each private placement subscription receipt evidences the right of the holder to 
receive without the payment of additional consideration or further action on the part of the holder and upon satisfaction of the Escrow Release Condition (as 
described below) on or before 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on October 31, 2016 (the “Deadline”), one share of common stock of Gran Tierra (the “Conversion”). 
The “Escrow Release Condition” will occur if and when, before the Deadline, both of the following two events occur:
(i) other than payment of the purchase price, all conditions precedent to the completion of the previously announced acquisition by Gran Tierra of
PetroLatina Energy Ltd. (or alternatively, certain entities of PetroLatina Energy Ltd. owning the interests in the Acordionero oil field (Midas Block) located in 
Colombia if a permitted reorganization of PetroLatina Energy Ltd. is effected) (the “Acquisition”) as provided for in the agreement governing the Acquisition 
(the “Acquisition Agreement”), as may be amended from time to time, have been satisfied in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement or waived 
(provided no such amendment or waiver is materially adverse to the holders of the private placement subscription receipts); and
(ii) the parties to the Acquisition Agreement are ready, willing and able to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby concurrent with the release of
the Escrowed Funds.
In the event that the Escrow Release Condition is not satisfied prior to the Deadline, the Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms
or Gran Tierra announces that it does not intend to proceed with the Acquisition, the subscription for common stock represented by each private placement 
subscription receipt shall be automatically terminated and cancelled and each holder shall receive an amount equal to $3.00 per private placement subscription 
receipt held plus such holder’s pro rata share of the Earned Interest (as defined in the Subscription Receipt Agreement), less applicable withholding taxes, all in 
the manner and on the terms and conditions set out in the Subscription Receipt Agreement. If the private placement subscription receipts are so terminated, the 
shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the private placement subscription receipts, the resale of which is registered hereby, will not be issued.
20
In connection with the issuance of the private placement subscription receipts, Gran Tierra agreed to enter into registration rights agreements with each of 
the subscribers (collectively, the “RRAs”). Pursuant to RRAs, Gran Tierra is required (i) to file with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event 
later than August 15, 2016, a shelf registration statement covering resales of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Subscription 
Receipts, (ii) to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such shelf registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable, 
(iii) to use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep such shelf registration statement effective until the earlier of (A) the sale pursuant to a registration 
statement of all of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the RRAs) covered by the shelf registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to Rule 
144 of all of the Registrable Securities and (B) July 8, 2019, subject to certain extensions as set forth in the RRAs and (iv) to use commercially reasonable 
efforts to file a prospectus with the applicable Canadian securities commissions in the various provinces of Canada where the private placement subscription 
receipts are distributed pursuant to the private placement to qualify the distribution of all of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the private 
placement subscription receipts on or before August 15, 2016.
Options
As of June 30, 2016, options representing the right to purchase 8,907,134 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding at a weighted average
exercise price of $4.27. The outstanding options were granted pursuant to our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, which is an amendment and restatement of our 2005 
Equity Incentive Plan, and our 2016 equity compensation program, to certain of our employees, officers and employee-directors.
Warrants
As of June 30, 2016, we did not have any warrants outstanding.
Indemnification; Limitation of Liability
Nevada Revised Statutes, or NRS, Sections 78.7502 and 78.751 provide us with the power to indemnify any of our directors and officers. The director or 
officer must have conducted himself/herself in good faith and reasonably believe that his/her conduct was in, or not opposed to our best interests. In a criminal 
action, the director, officer, employee or agent must not have had reasonable cause to believe his/her conduct was unlawful.
Under NRS Section 78.751, advances for expenses may be made by agreement if the director or officer affirms in writing that he/she believes he/she has
met the standards and will personally repay the expenses if it is determined such officer or director did not meet the standards.
Our bylaws include an indemnification provision under which we have the power to indemnify our directors, officers, employees and former directors,
officers and employees (including heirs and personal representatives) to the fullest extent permitted under Nevada law.
Our articles of incorporation and bylaws provide a limitation of liability in that no director or officer shall be personally liable to Gran Tierra or any of its 
shareholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as director or officer involving any act or omission of any such director or officer, provided there was no 
intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law, or payment of dividends in violation of NRS Section 78.300.
Our employment agreements with certain of our executive officers contain provisions which require us to indemnify them for costs, charges and expenses 
incurred in connection with (i) civil, criminal or administrative actions resulting from the executive officers service as such and (ii) actions by or on behalf of 
Gran Tierra to which the executive officer is made a party. We are required to provide such indemnification if (i) the executive officer acted honestly and in 
good faith with a view to the best interests of Gran Tierra, and (ii) in the case of a criminal or administrative proceeding or proceeding that is enforced by a 
monetary policy, the executive officer had reasonable grounds for believing that his conduct was lawful.
We have also entered into an indemnity agreement with all of our officers and directors. The agreement provides that we will indemnify officers and
directors to the fullest extent permitted by law, including indemnification in third party claims and derivative actions. The agreement also provides that we will 
provide an advancement for expenses incurred by the officers or directors.
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted for our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the 
foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public 
policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
21
Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Nevada State Law
We may be or in the future we may become subject to Nevada’s control share law. A corporation is subject to Nevada’s control share law if it has more 
than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and if the corporation does business in Nevada or through an 
affiliated corporation.
The law focuses on the acquisition of a “controlling interest” which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares is sufficient, but for the control share 
law, to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors: (1) one-fifth or more 
but less than one-third, (2) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (3) a majority or more. The ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or 
indirect, as well as individual or in association with others.
The effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person, and those acting in association with it, obtain only such voting rights in the control shares as 
are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation, approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control share law contemplates 
that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to take away voting rights from the control shares of an 
acquiring person once those rights have been approved. If the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person, those
shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others. If the buyers of those shares themselves do not 
acquire a controlling interest, their shares do not become governed by the control share law.
If control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power, any
stockholder of record, other than an acquiring person, who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for such 
stockholder’s shares.
Nevada’s control share law may have the effect of discouraging corporate takeovers.
In addition to the control share law, Nevada has a business combination law, which prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations 
and “interested stockholders” for two years after the “interested stockholder” first becomes an “interested stockholder” unless the combination meets all of the 
requirements of the articles of incorporation of the resident domestic corporation and (i) the corporation’s board of directors approves the combination in 
advance, or (ii) the combination is approved by the board of directors of the resident domestic corporation and, at or after that time, the combination is approved 
at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the resident domestic corporation, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of the holders of 
stock representing at least 60 percent of the outstanding voting power of the resident domestic corporation not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder 
or the affiliates or associates of the interested stockholder. For purposes of Nevada law, an “interested stockholder” is any person who is (1) the beneficial 
owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (2) an affiliate or associate of the 
corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the 
then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term “business combination” is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that 
would allow a potential acquirer to use the corporation’s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the 
corporation and its other stockholders.
The effect of Nevada’s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of Gran Tierra from doing so if it cannot
obtain the approval of our board of directors.
Transfer Agent and Registrar
We have appointed Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (including its affiliates in Canada) as the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.
22
Listing on the NYSE MKT and Toronto Stock Exchange
Our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “GTE.” Any applicable prospectus supplement
will contain information, where applicable, as to any other listing, if any, on the NYSE MKT, the Toronto Stock Exchange or any securities market or other 
exchange of the securities stock covered by such prospectus supplement.

DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES
We may issue debt securities from time to time, in one or more series, as either senior or subordinated debt or as senior or subordinated convertible debt. 
While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally to any debt securities that we may offer under this prospectus, we will describe the particular 
terms of any debt securities that we may offer in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement. The terms of any debt securities offered under a 
prospectus supplement may differ from the terms described below. Unless the context requires otherwise, whenever we refer to the indenture, we also are 
referring to any supplemental indentures that specify the terms of a particular series of debt securities.
We will issue the debt securities under the indenture that we will enter into with the trustee named in the indenture. The indenture will be qualified under
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or the Trust Indenture Act. We have filed the form of indenture as an exhibit to the registration statement of which 
this prospectus is a part, and supplemental indentures and forms of debt securities containing the terms of the debt securities being offered will be filed as 
exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part or will be incorporated by reference from reports that we file with the SEC.
The following summary of material provisions of the debt securities and the indenture is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the 
provisions of the indenture applicable to a particular series of debt securities. We urge you to read the applicable prospectus supplements and any related free 
writing prospectuses related to the debt securities that we may offer under this prospectus, as well as the complete indenture that contains the terms of the debt 
securities.
General
The indenture does not limit the amount of debt securities that we may issue. It provides that we may issue debt securities up to the principal amount that
we may authorize and may be in any currency or currency unit that we may designate. Except for the limitations on consolidation, merger and sale of all or 
substantially all of our assets contained in the indenture, the terms of the indenture do not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to give holders of 
any debt securities protection against changes in our operations, financial condition or transactions involving us.
We may issue the debt securities issued under the indenture as “discount securities,” which means they may be sold at a discount below their stated
principal amount. These debt securities, as well as other debt securities that are not issued at a discount, may be issued with “original issue discount,” or OID, 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes because of interest payment and other characteristics or terms of the debt securities. Material U.S. federal income tax 
considerations applicable to debt securities issued with OID will be described in more detail in any applicable prospectus supplement.

(cid:120) whether interest will be payable in cash or additional debt securities at our or the holders’ option and the terms and conditions upon which the election
may be made;
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)

any restrictions on transfer, sale or assignment of the debt securities of the series; and
any other specific terms, preferences, rights or limitations of, or restrictions on, the debt securities, any other additions or changes in the provisions of 
the indenture, and any terms that may be required by us or advisable under applicable laws or regulations.
Conversion or Exchange Rights
We will set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement the terms on which a series of debt securities may be convertible into or exchangeable for our
common stock or our other securities. We will include provisions as to settlement upon conversion or exchange and whether conversion or exchange is 
mandatory, at the option of the holder or at our option. We may include provisions pursuant to which the number of shares of our common stock or our other 
securities that the holders of the series of debt securities receive would be subject to adjustment.
Consolidation, Merger or Sale
Unless we provide otherwise in the prospectus supplement applicable to a particular series of debt securities, the indenture will not contain any covenant
that restricts our ability to merge or consolidate, or sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. 
However, any successor to or acquirer of such assets (other than a subsidiary of ours) must assume all of our obligations under the indenture or the debt 
securities, as appropriate.
Events of Default under the Indenture
Unless we provide otherwise in the prospectus supplement applicable to a particular series of debt securities, the following are events of default under the
indenture with respect to any series of debt securities that we may issue:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
if we fail to pay any installment of interest on any series of debt securities, as and when the same shall become due and payable, and such default 
continues for a period of 90 days; provided, however, that a valid extension of an interest payment period by us in accordance with the terms of any 
indenture supplemental thereto shall not constitute a default in the payment of interest for this purpose;
if we fail to pay the principal of, or premium, if any, on any series of debt securities as and when the same shall become due and payable whether at 
maturity, upon redemption, by declaration or otherwise, or in any payment required by any sinking or analogous fund established with respect to such 
series; provided, however, that a valid extension of the maturity of such debt securities in accordance with the terms of any indenture supplemental 
thereto shall not constitute a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any;
if we fail to observe or perform any other covenant or agreement contained in the debt securities or the indenture, other than a covenant specifically 
relating to another series of debt securities, and our failure continues for 90 days after we receive written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be
remedied and stating that such is a notice of default thereunder, from the trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the 
outstanding debt securities of the applicable series; and
if specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur.
26
If an event of default with respect to debt securities of any series occurs and is continuing, other than an event of default specified in the last bullet point
above, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series, by notice to us in writing, and to 
the trustee if notice is given by such holders, may declare the unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, due and payable immediately. If 
an event of default specified in the last bullet point above occurs with respect to us, the principal amount of and accrued interest, if any, of each issue of debt 
securities then outstanding shall be due and payable without any notice or other action on the part of the trustee or any holder.
The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of an affected series may waive any default or event of default with respect
to the series and its consequences, except defaults or events of default regarding payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, unless we have cured the 
default or event of default in accordance with the indenture. Any waiver shall cure the default or event of default.
Subject to the terms of the indenture, if an event of default under an indenture shall occur and be continuing, the trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under such indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of the applicable series of debt securities, unless such 
holders have offered the trustee reasonable indemnity. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series will have 
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on 
the trustee, with respect to the debt securities of that series, provided that:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
the direction so given by the holder is not in conflict with any law or the applicable indenture; and
subject to its duties under the Trust Indenture Act, the trustee need not take any action that might involve it in personal liability or might be unduly 
prejudicial to the holders not involved in the proceeding.
A holder of the debt securities of any series will have the right to institute a proceeding under the indenture or to appoint a receiver or trustee, or to seek
other remedies only if:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
the holder has given written notice to the trustee of a continuing event of default with respect to that series;
the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have made written request;
such holders have offered to the trustee indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred by the trustee in compliance 
with the request; and
the trustee does not institute the proceeding, and does not receive from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt 
securities of that series other conflicting directions within 90 days after the notice, request and offer.
These limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by a holder of debt securities if we default in the payment of the principal, premium, if any, or interest on,
the debt securities.
We will periodically file statements with the trustee regarding our compliance with specified covenants in the indenture.
Modification of Indenture; Waiver
We and the trustee may change an indenture without the consent of any holders with respect to specific matters:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the indenture or in the debt securities of any series;
to comply with the provisions described above under “Description of Debt Securities—Consolidation, Merger or Sale;”
to provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of certificated debt securities;
27
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
to add to our covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions such new covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions for the benefit of the holders of 
all or any series of debt securities, to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and the continuance, of a default in any such additional covenants, 
restrictions, conditions or provisions an event of default or to surrender any right or power conferred upon us in the indenture;
to add to, delete from or revise the conditions, limitations, and restrictions on the authorized amount, terms, or purposes of issue, authentication and 
delivery of debt securities, as set forth in the indenture;
to make any change that does not adversely affect the interests of any holder of debt securities of any series in any material respect;
to provide for the issuance of and establish the form and terms and conditions of the debt securities of any series as provided above under “Description 
of Debt Securities—General” to establish the form of any certifications required to be furnished pursuant to the terms of the indenture or any series of 
debt securities, or to add to the rights of the holders of any series of debt securities;
to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under any indenture by a successor trustee; or
to comply with any requirements of the SEC in connection with the qualification of any indenture under the Trust Indenture Act.
In addition, under the indenture, the rights of holders of a series of debt securities may be changed by us and the trustee with the written consent of the
holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series that is affected. However, unless we provide 
otherwise in the prospectus supplement applicable to a particular series of debt securities, we and the trustee may make the following changes only with the 
consent of each holder of any outstanding debt securities affected:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
extending the fixed maturity of any debt securities of any series;
reducing the principal amount, reducing the rate of or extending the time of payment of interest, or reducing any premium payable upon the redemption 
of any series of any debt securities; or
reducing the percentage of debt securities, the holders of which are required to consent to any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver.
Discharge
Each indenture provides that we can elect to be discharged from our obligations with respect to one or more series of debt securities, except for specified
obligations, including obligations to:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
provide for payment;
register the transfer or exchange of debt securities of the series;
replace stolen, lost or mutilated debt securities of the series;
pay principal of and premium and interest on any debt securities of the series;
(cid:120) maintain paying agencies;
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
hold monies for payment in trust;
recover excess money held by the trustee;
compensate and indemnify the trustee; and
appoint any successor trustee.
28
In order to exercise our rights to be discharged, we must deposit with the trustee money or government obligations sufficient to pay all the principal of, any
premium, if any, and interest on, the debt securities of the series on the dates payments are due.
Form, Exchange and Transfer
We will issue the debt securities of each series only in fully registered form without coupons and, unless we provide otherwise in the applicable prospectus 
supplement, in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. The indenture provides that we may issue debt securities of a series in temporary or 
permanent global form and as book-entry securities that will be deposited with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, or another depositary 
named by us and identified in the applicable prospectus supplement with respect to that series. To the extent the debt securities of a series are issued in global 
form and as book-entry, a description of terms relating to any book-entry securities will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.
At the option of the holder, subject to the terms of the indenture and the limitations applicable to global securities described in the applicable prospectus
supplement, the holder of the debt securities of any series can exchange the debt securities for other debt securities of the same series, in any authorized 
denomination and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
Subject to the terms of the indenture and the limitations applicable to global securities set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, holders of the debt 
securities may present the debt securities for exchange or for registration of transfer, duly endorsed or with the form of transfer endorsed thereon duly executed 
if so required by us or the security registrar, at the office of the security registrar or at the office of any transfer agent designated by us for this purpose. Unless 
otherwise provided in the debt securities that the holder presents for transfer or exchange, we will impose no service charge for any registration of transfer or 
exchange, but we may require payment of any taxes or other governmental charges.
We will name in the applicable prospectus supplement the security registrar, and any transfer agent in addition to the security registrar, that we initially
designate for any debt securities. We may at any time designate additional transfer agents or rescind the designation of any transfer agent or approve a change in 
the office through which any transfer agent acts, except that we will be required to maintain a transfer agent in each place of payment for the debt securities of 
each series.
If we elect to redeem the debt securities of any series, we will not be required to:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
issue, register the transfer of, or exchange any debt securities of that series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day 
of mailing of a notice of redemption of any debt securities that may be selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of the 
mailing; or
register the transfer of or exchange any debt securities so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any debt 
securities we are redeeming in part.
Information Concerning the Trustee
The trustee, other than during the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under an indenture, undertakes to perform only those duties as are
specifically set forth in the applicable indenture. Upon an event of default under an indenture, the trustee must use the same degree of care as a prudent person 
would exercise or use in the conduct of his or her own affairs. Subject to this provision, the trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the powers given it 
by the indenture at the request of any holder of debt securities unless it is offered reasonable security and indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities 
that it might incur.
Payment and Paying Agents
Unless we otherwise indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will make payment of the interest on any debt securities on any interest payment 
date to the person in whose name the debt securities, or one or more predecessor securities, are registered at the close of business on the regular record date for 
the interest.
29
We will pay principal of and any premium and interest on the debt securities of a particular series at the office of the paying agents designated by us, except
that unless we otherwise indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will make interest payments by check that we will mail to the holder or by wire 
transfer to certain holders. Unless we otherwise indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will designate the corporate trust office of the trustee as 
our sole paying agent for payments with respect to debt securities of each series. We will name in the applicable prospectus supplement any other paying agents 
that we initially designate for the debt securities of a particular series. We will maintain a paying agent in each place of payment for the debt securities of a 
particular series.
All money we pay to a paying agent or the trustee for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any debt securities that remains
unclaimed at the end of two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable will be repaid to us, and the holder of the debt security 
thereafter may look only to us for payment thereof.
Governing Law
The indenture and the debt securities will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, except to the extent
that the Trust Indenture Act is applicable.

the terms of the securities issuable upon exercise of the warrants; and
any other specific terms, preferences, rights or limitations of or restrictions on the warrants.
Before exercising their warrants, holders of warrants will not have any of the rights of holders of the securities purchasable upon such exercise, including:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
in the case of warrants to purchase debt securities, the right to receive payments of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the debt securities

dissolution or winding up or to exercise voting rights, if any.
Exercise of Warrants
Each warrant will entitle the holder to purchase the securities that we specify in the applicable prospectus supplement at the exercise price that we describe
in the applicable prospectus supplement. The warrants may be exercised as set forth in the prospectus supplement relating to the warrants offered. Unless we 
otherwise specify in the applicable prospectus supplement, warrants may be exercised at any time up to the close of business on the expiration date set forth in

Upon receipt of payment and the warrant or warrant certificate, as applicable, properly completed and duly executed at the corporate trust office of the
warrant agent, if any, or any other office, including ours, indicated in the prospectus supplement, we will, as soon as practicable, issue and deliver the securities 
purchasable upon such exercise. If less than all of the warrants (or the warrants represented by such warrant certificate) are exercised, a new warrant or a new 
warrant certificate, as applicable, will be issued for the remaining warrants.
Governing Law
Unless we otherwise specify in the applicable prospectus supplement, the warrants and any warrant agreements will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
Enforceability of Rights by Holders of Warrants
Each warrant agent, if any, will act solely as our agent under the applicable warrant agreement and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency 
or trust with any holder of any warrant. A single bank or trust company may act as warrant agent for more than one issue of warrants. A warrant agent will have 
no duty or responsibility in case of any default by us under the applicable warrant agreement or warrant, including any duty or responsibility to initiate any 
proceedings at law or otherwise, or to make any demand upon us. Any holder of a warrant may, without the consent of the related warrant agent or the holder of 
any other warrant, enforce by appropriate legal action its right to exercise, and receive the securities purchasable upon exercise of, its warrants.
32
DESCRIPTION OF SUBSCRIPTION RECEIPTS
We may issue subscription receipts, which will entitle holders to receive upon satisfaction of certain release conditions and for no additional consideration,
common stock, preferred stock, warrants or any combination thereof. Subscription receipts will be issued pursuant to one or more subscription receipt 
agreements (each, a “Subscription Receipt Agreement”), each to be entered into between us and an escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), which will establish the 
terms and conditions of the subscription receipts. Each Escrow Agent will be a financial institution organized under the laws of the United States or a state 
thereof or Canada or a province thereof and authorized to carry on business as a trustee. We will file as exhibits to the registration statement of which this 
prospectus is a part, or will incorporate by reference from a Current Report on Form 8-K that we file with the SEC, any Subscription Receipt Agreement 
describing the terms and conditions of subscription receipts we are offering before the issuance of such subscription receipts.
The following description sets forth certain general terms and provisions of subscription receipts and is not intended to be complete. The statements made
in this prospectus relating to any Subscription Receipt Agreement and subscription receipts to be issued thereunder are summaries of certain anticipated 
provisions thereof and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, all provisions of the applicable Subscription Receipt Agreement and the 
prospectus supplement describing such Subscription Receipt Agreement.
The prospectus supplement relating to any subscription receipts we offer will describe the subscription receipts and include specific terms relating to their 
offering. All such terms will comply with the requirements of the TSX and NYSE MKT relating to subscription receipts. If underwriters or agents are used in 
the sale of subscription receipts, one or more of such underwriters or agents may also be parties to the Subscription Receipt Agreement governing the 
subscription receipts sold to or through such underwriters or agents.
General
The prospectus supplement and the Subscription Receipt Agreement for any subscription receipts we offer will describe the specific terms of the
subscription receipts and may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:

receipts upon satisfaction of the release conditions, and the procedures that will result in the adjustment of those numbers;

common stock, preferred stock, warrants or combination thereof;
the procedures for the issuance and delivery of common stock, preferred stock, warrants or combination thereof to holders of subscription receipts upon 
satisfaction of the Release Conditions;
(cid:120) whether any payments will be made to holders of subscription receipts upon delivery of the common stock, preferred stock, warrants or combination
thereof upon satisfaction of the Release Conditions (e.g., an amount equal to dividends declared on common stock by us to holders of record during the 
period from the date of issuance of the subscription receipts to the date of issuance of any common stock pursuant to the terms of the Subscription 
Receipt Agreement);
(cid:120)
the terms and conditions under which the Escrow Agent will hold all or a portion of the gross proceeds from the sale of subscription receipts, together 
with interest and income earned thereon (collectively, the “Escrowed Funds”), pending satisfaction of the Release Conditions;

(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
the terms and conditions pursuant to which the Escrow Agent will hold common stock, preferred stock, warrants or combination thereof pending 
satisfaction of the Release Conditions;
the terms and conditions under which the Escrow Agent will release all or a portion of the Escrowed Funds to us upon satisfaction of the Release 
Conditions;
if the subscription receipts are sold to or through underwriters or agents, the terms and conditions under which the Escrow Agent will release a portion 
of the Escrowed Funds to such underwriters or agents in payment of all or a portion of their fees or commission in connection with the sale of the 
subscription receipts;
procedures for the refund by the Escrow Agent to holders of subscription receipts of all or a portion of the subscription price for their subscription

(cid:120) whether the subscription receipts will be listed on any exchange;
(cid:120) material United States and Canadian federal tax consequences of owning the subscription receipts; and
(cid:120)
any other terms of the subscription receipts.
In addition, the prospectus supplement and the Subscription Receipt Agreement for any subscription receipts we offer will describe all contractual rights of 
rescission that will be granted to initial purchasers of subscription receipts in the event this prospectus, the prospectus supplement under which the subscription 
receipts are issued or any amendment hereto or thereto contains a misrepresentation, as discussed further under the sub-paragraph entitled “Rescission” below.
The holders of subscription receipts will not be shareholders. Holders of subscription receipts are entitled only to receive common stock, preferred stock,
warrants or a combination thereof on exchange of their subscription receipts, plus any cash payments provided for under the Subscription Receipt Agreement, if 
the Release Conditions are satisfied. If the Release Conditions are not satisfied, the holders of subscription receipts shall be entitled to a refund of all or a 
portion of the subscription price therefor and all or a portion of the pro rata share of interest earned or income generated thereon, as provided in the Subscription 
Receipt Agreement.
Escrow
The Escrowed Funds will be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent, and such Escrowed Funds will be released to us (and, if the subscription receipts are sold 
to or through underwriters or agents, a portion of the Escrowed Funds may be released to such underwriters or agents in payment of all or a portion of their fees 
in connection with the sale of the subscription receipts) at the time and under the terms specified by the Subscription Receipt Agreement. If the Release 
Conditions are not satisfied, holders of subscription receipts will receive a refund of all or a portion of the subscription price for their subscription receipts plus 
their pro rata entitlement to interest earned or income generated on such amount, in accordance with the terms of the Subscription Receipt Agreement. Common 
stock, preferred stock or warrants may be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent, and will be released to the holders of subscription receipts following satisfaction 
of the Release Conditions at the time and under the terms specified in the Subscription Receipt Agreement.
34
Anti-Dilution
The Subscription Receipt Agreement will specify that upon the subdivision, consolidation, reclassification or other material change of the common stock,
preferred stock or warrants or any other reorganization, amalgamation, merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, the subscription receipts will 
thereafter evidence the right of the holder to receive the securities, property or cash deliverable in exchange for or on the conversion of or in respect of the 
common stock, preferred stock or warrants to which the holder of common stock, preferred stock or warrants would have been entitled immediately after such 
event. Similarly, any distribution to all or substantially all of the holders of common stock or preferred stock of rights, options, warrants, evidences of 
indebtedness or assets will result in an adjustment in the number of common shares or preferred shares, respectively, to be issued to holders of subscription 
receipts whose subscription receipts entitle the holders thereof to receive common stock or preferred stock. Alternatively, such securities, evidences of 
indebtedness or assets may, at our option, be issued to the Escrow Agent and delivered to holders of subscription receipts on exercise thereof. The Subscription 
Receipt Agreement will also provide that if other corporate actions affect the common stock, preferred stock or warrants, which, in the reasonable opinion of our 
directors, would materially affect the rights of the holders of subscription receipts and/or the rights attached to the subscription receipts, the number of common 
stock, preferred stock or warrants which are to be received pursuant to the subscription receipts shall be adjusted in such manner, if any, and at such time as our 
directors may in their discretion reasonably determine to be equitable to the holders of subscription receipts in such circumstances.
Rescission
The Subscription Receipt Agreement will also provide that any misrepresentation in this prospectus, the prospectus supplement under which the
subscription receipts are offered, or any amendment thereto, will entitle each initial purchaser of subscription receipts to a contractual right of rescission 
following the issuance of the common stock, preferred stock or warrants to such purchaser entitling such purchaser to receive the amount paid for the 
subscription receipts upon surrender of the common stock, preferred stock or warrants, provided that such remedy for rescission is exercised in the time 
stipulated in the Subscription Receipt Agreement. This right of rescission does not extend to holders of subscription receipts who acquire such subscription 
receipts from an initial purchaser, on the open market or otherwise, or to initial purchasers who acquire subscription receipts in the United States.
Global Securities
We may issue subscription receipts in whole or in part in the form of one or more global securities, which will be registered in the name of and be deposited
with a depositary, or its nominee, each of which will be identified in the applicable prospectus supplement. The global securities may be in temporary or 
permanent form. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the terms of any depositary arrangement and the rights and limitations of owners of 
beneficial interests in any global security. The applicable prospectus supplement also will describe the exchange, registration and transfer rights relating to any 
global security.
Modifications
The Subscription Receipt Agreement will provide for modifications and alterations to the subscription receipts issued thereunder by way of a resolution of 
holders of subscription receipts at a meeting of such holders or a consent in writing from such holders. The number of holders of subscriptions receipts required 
to pass such a resolution or execute such a written consent will be specified in the Subscription Receipt Agreement.
35
LEGAL OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES
We can issue securities in registered form or in the form of one or more global securities. We describe global securities in greater detail below. We refer to
those persons who have securities registered in their own names on the books that we or any applicable trustee, depositary or warrant agent maintain for this 
purpose as the “holders” of those securities. These persons are the legal holders of the securities. We refer to those persons who, indirectly through others, own 
beneficial interests in securities that are not registered in their own names, as “indirect holders” of those securities. As we discuss below, indirect holders are not 
legal holders, and investors in securities issued in book-entry form or in street name will be indirect holders.
Book-Entry Holders
We may issue securities in book-entry form only, as we will specify in the applicable prospectus supplement. This means securities may be represented by
one or more global securities registered in the name of a financial institution that holds them as depositary on behalf of other financial institutions that 
participate in the depositary’s book-entry system. These participating institutions, which are referred to as participants, in turn, hold beneficial interests in the 
securities on behalf of themselves or their customers.
Only the person in whose name a security is registered is recognized as the holder of that security. Securities issued in global form will be registered in the
name of the depositary or its participants. Consequently, for securities issued in global form, we will recognize only the depositary as the holder of the 
securities, and we will make all payments on the securities to the depositary. The depositary passes along the payments it receives to its participants, which in 
turn pass the payments along to their customers who are the beneficial owners. The depositary and its participants do so under agreements they have made with 
one another or with their customers; they are not obligated to do so under the terms of the securities.
As a result, investors in a book-entry security will not own securities directly. Instead, they will own beneficial interests in a global security, through a
bank, broker or other financial institution that participates in the depositary’s book-entry system or holds an interest through a participant. As long as the 
securities are issued in global form, investors will be indirect holders, and not holders, of the securities.
Street Name Holders
We may terminate a global security or issue securities in non-global form. In these cases, investors may choose to hold their securities in their own names
or in “street name.” Securities held by an investor in street name would be registered in the name of a bank, broker or other financial institution that the investor 
chooses, and the investor would hold only a beneficial interest in those securities through an account he or she maintains at that institution.
For securities held in street name, we will recognize only the intermediary banks, brokers and other financial institutions in whose names the securities are 
registered as the holders of those securities, and we will make all payments on those securities to them. These institutions pass along the payments they receive 
to their customers who are the beneficial owners, but only because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to do 
so. Investors who hold securities in street name will be indirect holders, not holders, of those securities.
Legal Holders
Our obligations, as well as the obligations of any applicable trustee and of any third parties employed by us or a trustee, run only to the legal holders of the 
securities. We do not have obligations to investors who hold beneficial interests in global securities, in street name or by any other indirect means. This will be 
the case whether an investor chooses to be an indirect holder of a security or has no choice because we are issuing the securities only in global form.
For example, once we make a payment or give a notice to the holder, we have no further responsibility for the payment or notice even if that holder is
required, under agreements with depositary participants or customers or by law, to pass it along to the indirect holders but does not do so. Similarly, we may 
want to obtain the approval of the holders to amend an indenture, to relieve us of the consequences of a default or of our obligation to comply with a particular 
provision of the indenture or for other purposes. In such an event, we would seek approval only from the holders, and not the indirect holders, of the securities. 
Whether and how the holders contact the indirect holders is up to the holders.
36
Special Considerations For Indirect Holders
If you hold securities through a bank, broker or other financial institution, either in book-entry form or in street name, you should check with your own
institution to find out:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
the performance of third party service providers;
how it handles securities payments and notices;
(cid:120) whether it imposes fees or charges;
(cid:120)
how it would handle a request for the holders’ consent, if ever required;
(cid:120) whether and how you can instruct it to send you securities registered in your own name so you can be a holder, if that is permitted in the future;
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
how it would exercise rights under the securities if there were a default or other event triggering the need for holders to act to protect their interests; and
if the securities are in book-entry form, how the depositary’s rules and procedures will affect these matters.
Global Securities
A global security is a security that represents one or any other number of individual securities held by a depositary. Generally, all securities represented by
the same global securities will have the same terms.
Each security issued in book-entry form will be represented by a global security that we deposit with and register in the name of a financial institution or its 
nominee that we select. The financial institution that we select for this purpose is called the depositary. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus 
supplement, DTC will be the depositary for all securities issued in book-entry form.
A global security may not be transferred to or registered in the name of anyone other than the depositary, its nominee or a successor depositary, unless
special termination situations arise. We describe those situations below under the section entitled “Special Situations When a Global Security Will Be 
Terminated” in this prospectus. As a result of these arrangements, the depositary, or its nominee, will be the sole registered owner and holder of all securities 
represented by a global security, and investors will be permitted to own only beneficial interests in a global security. Beneficial interests must be held by means 
of an account with a broker, bank or other financial institution that in turn has an account with the depositary or with another institution that does. Thus, an 
investor whose security is represented by a global security will not be a holder of the security, but only an indirect holder of a beneficial interest in the global 
security.
If the prospectus supplement for a particular security indicates that the security will be issued in global form only, then the security will be represented by a
global security at all times unless and until the global security is terminated. If termination occurs, we may issue the securities through another book-entry 
clearing system or decide that the securities may no longer be held through any book-entry clearing system.
Special Considerations For Global Securities
The rights of an indirect holder relating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of the investor’s financial institution and of the
depositary, as well as general laws relating to securities transfers. We do not recognize an indirect holder as a holder of securities and instead deal only with the 
depositary that holds the global security.
37
If securities are issued only in the form of a global security, an investor should be aware of the following:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
an investor cannot cause the securities to be registered in his or her name, and cannot obtain non-global certificates for his or her interest in the 
securities, except in the special situations we describe below;
an investor will be an indirect holder and must look to his or her own bank or broker for payments on the securities and protection of his or her legal 
rights relating to the securities, as we describe above;
an investor may not be able to sell interests in the securities to some insurance companies and to other institutions that are required by law to own their 
securities in non-book-entry form;
an investor may not be able to pledge his or her interest in a global security in circumstances where certificates representing the securities must be 
delivered to the lender or other beneficiary of the pledge in order for the pledge to be effective;
the depositary’s policies, which may change from time to time, will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to an investor’s 
interest in a global security;
(cid:120) we and any applicable trustee have no responsibility for any aspect of the depositary’s actions or for its records of ownership interests in a global
security, nor do we or any applicable trustee supervise the depositary in any way;
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
the depositary may, and we understand that DTC will, require that those who purchase and sell interests in a global security within its book-entry 
system use immediately available funds, and your broker or bank may require you to do so as well; and
financial institutions that participate in the depositary’s book-entry system, and through which an investor holds its interest in a global security, may 
also have their own policies affecting payments, notices and other matters relating to the securities.
There may be more than one financial intermediary in the chain of ownership for an investor. We do not monitor and are not responsible for the actions of
any of those intermediaries.
Special Situations When a Global Security Will Be Terminated
In a few special situations described below, the global security will terminate and interests in it will be exchanged for physical certificates representing
those interests. After that exchange, the choice of whether to hold securities directly or in street name will be up to the investor. Investors must consult their own 
banks or brokers to find out how to have their interests in securities transferred to their own name, so that they will be direct holders. We have described the 
rights of holders and street name investors above.
Unless we provide otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, the global security will terminate when the following special situations occur:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
if the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling, unable or no longer qualified to continue as depositary for that global security and we do not appoint 
another institution to act as depositary within 90 days;
if we notify any applicable trustee that we wish to terminate that global security; or
if an event of default has occurred with regard to securities represented by that global security and has not been cured or waived.
The applicable prospectus supplement may also list additional situations for terminating a global security that would apply only to the particular series of
securities covered by the applicable prospectus supplement. When a global security terminates, the depositary, and not we or any applicable trustee, is 
responsible for deciding the names of the institutions that will be the initial direct holders.
38
The Securities We May Offer
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
We may sell the securities from time to time pursuant to underwritten public offerings, direct sales to the public, negotiated transactions, block trades or a 
combination of these methods. We may sell the securities to or through underwriters or dealers, through agents, or directly to one or more purchasers. We may 
distribute securities from time to time in one or more transactions:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed;
at market prices prevailing at the time of sale;
at prices related to such prevailing market prices; or
at negotiated prices.
A prospectus supplement or supplements (and any related free writing prospectus that we may authorize to be provided to you) will describe the terms of
the offering of the securities, including, to the extent applicable:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
the name or names of the underwriters, if any;
the purchase price of the securities or other consideration therefor, and the proceeds, if any, we will receive from the sale;
any over-allotment options under which underwriters may purchase additional securities from us;
any agency fees or underwriting discounts and other items constituting agents’ or underwriters’ compensation;
any public offering price;
any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers; and
any securities exchange or market on which the securities may be listed.
Only underwriters named in the prospectus supplement will be underwriters of the securities offered by the prospectus supplement.
If underwriters are used in the sale, they will acquire the securities for their own account and may resell the securities from time to time in one or more
transactions at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. The obligations of the underwriters to purchase the securities will 
be subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable underwriting agreement. We may offer the securities to the public through underwriting syndicates 
represented by managing underwriters or by underwriters without a syndicate. Subject to certain conditions, the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all of 
the securities offered by the prospectus supplement, other than securities covered by any over-allotment option. Any public offering price and any discounts or 
concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers may change from time to time. We may use underwriters with whom we or they have a material 
relationship. We will describe in the prospectus supplement, naming the underwriter, the nature of any such relationship.
We may sell securities directly or through agents we designate from time to time. We will name any agent involved in the offering and sale of securities and 
we will describe any commissions we will pay the agent in the prospectus supplement. Unless the prospectus supplement states otherwise, our agent will act on 
a best-efforts basis for the period of its appointment.
We may authorize agents or underwriters to solicit offers by certain types of institutional investors to purchase securities from us at the public offering price
set forth in the prospectus supplement pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on a specified date in the future. We will 
describe the conditions to these contracts and the commissions we must pay for solicitation of these contracts in the prospectus supplement.
39
We may provide agents and underwriters with indemnification against civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and/or applicable 
Canadian securities laws, or contribution with respect to payments that the agents or underwriters may make with respect to these liabilities. Agents and 
underwriters may engage in transactions with, or perform services for, us in the ordinary course of business.
All securities we may offer, other than common stock, will be new issues of securities with no established trading market. Any underwriters may make a
market in these securities, but will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time without notice. We cannot guarantee the 
liquidity of the trading markets for any securities.
Any underwriter may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, short-covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M 
under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which create a short position. Stabilizing transactions permit bids to 
purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum price. Syndicate-covering or other short-covering 
transactions involve purchases of the securities, either through exercise of the over-allotment option or in the open market after the distribution is completed, to 
cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a dealer when the securities originally sold by the dealer are 
purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. Those activities may cause the price of the securities to be higher than it would 
otherwise be. If commenced, the underwriters may discontinue any of the activities at any time.
Any underwriters or agents that are qualified market makers on the NYSE MKT may engage in passive market making transactions in the common stock
on the NYSE MKT in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act, during the business day prior to the pricing of the offering, before the 
commencement of offers or sales of the common stock. Passive market makers must comply with applicable volume and price limitations and must be identified 
as passive market makers. In general, a passive market maker must display its bid at a price not in excess of the highest independent bid for such security; if all 
independent bids are lowered below the passive market maker’s bid, however, the passive market maker’s bid must then be lowered when certain purchase 
limits are exceeded. Passive market making may stabilize the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open 
market and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.
In compliance with guidelines of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, the maximum consideration or discount to be received by any
FINRA member or independent broker dealer may not exceed 8% of the aggregate amount of the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus and any 
applicable prospectus supplement.
Common Stock We May Issue upon Exchange or Redemption of Exchangeable Shares
We will distribute the shares of common stock issued upon exchange or redemption of the exchangeable shares by the holders of such exchangeable shares 
as discussed in “Description of Capital Stock—Capital Stock Issued and Outstanding—GTE-Goldstrike Exchangeable Shares and —GTE-Solana Exchangeable 
Shares”.
Common Stock that May be Offered by the Selling Stockholders
Shares of common stock that will be issued upon conversion of the private placement subscription receipts may from time to time be offered for sale either
directly by such selling stockholder, or through underwriters, dealers or agents or on any exchange on which the common stock may from time to time be 
traded, in the over-the-counter market, or in independently negotiated transactions or otherwise. The methods by which the common stock may be sold by the 
selling stockholders include:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
underwritten transactions;
privately negotiated transactions;
exchange distributions and/or secondary distributions;

(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
sales in the over the counter market;
ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker solicits purchasers;
broker-dealers may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares of common stock at a stipulated price per share;
a block trade (which may involve crosses) in which the broker or dealer so engaged will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and 
resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;
purchases by a broker or dealer as principal and resale by such broker or dealer for its own account pursuant to the prospectus;
short sales;
through the writing of options on the shares, whether or not the options are listed on an options exchange;
through the distributions of the shares by any selling stockholder to its partners, members or stockholders;
a combination of any such methods of sale; and
any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.
The selling stockholders may also sell common stock pursuant to an exemption from Securities Act registration, if available, rather than under this
prospectus.
Such transactions may be effected by the selling stockholders at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to market prices or at
negotiated prices. The selling stockholders may directly effect such transactions or alternatively through underwriters, dealers or agents or on any exchange on 
which the common stock may from time to time be traded, in the over-the-counter market, or in independently negotiated transactions or otherwise. The selling 
stockholders may agree to indemnify any underwriter, broker-dealer or agent that participates in transactions involving sales of the common stock against 
certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act. In certain circumstances, we have agreed to register the common stock for sale under the 
Securities Act and to indemnify the selling stockholders against certain civil liabilities, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act.
In connection with the sales of common stock or otherwise, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, which may in
turn engage in short sales of common stock in the course of hedging positions they assume. The selling stockholders may also sell common stock short and 
deliver common stock to close out short positions, or loan or pledge common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell such securities.
The selling stockholders may from time to time pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the common stock owned by them and, if they default in 
the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell common stock from time to time under this prospectus, or under 
an amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424 or other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending the list of selling stockholders to include the 
pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus.
The selling stockholders and any underwriters, dealers or agents that participate in distribution of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters, and any
profit on sale of the securities by them and any discounts, commissions or concessions received by any underwriter, dealer or agent may be deemed to be 
underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act.
There can be no assurances that the selling stockholders will sell any or all of the securities offered under this prospectus.
41
Distribution of Common Stock in Canada
In Canada, the distribution of the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the private placement subscription receipts may be qualified pursuant to a
prospectus filed in certain provinces of Canada.
42
Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, Vinson & Elkins LLP, Houston, Texas, and/or Greenberg Traurig, LLP, Las Vegas,
Nevada, will pass upon the validity of the securities offered by this prospectus and any supplement thereto.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers
Under Nevada law, a corporation shall indemnify a director or officer against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him, 
to the extent the director or officer has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding. A corporation may indemnify a 
director or officer who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, 
criminal, administrative or investigative, against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably 
incurred by him/her in connection with the action, suit or proceeding. Excepted from that immunity are:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
a willful failure to deal fairly with the company or its stockholders in connection with a matter in which the director has a material conflict of interest;
a violation of criminal law (unless the director had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that 
his or her conduct was unlawful);
a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal profit; and
(cid:120) willful misconduct.
Our bylaws include an indemnification provision under which we have the power to indemnify our directors, officers, employees and former officers,
directors and employees (including heirs and personal representatives) to the fullest extent permitted under Nevada law.
We have also entered into an indemnity agreement with all of our officers and directors. The agreement provides that we will indemnify officers and
directors to the fullest extent permitted by law, including indemnification in third party claims and derivative actions. The agreement also provides that we will 
provide an advancement for expenses incurred by the officers or directors.

Item 17.
Undertakings
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:
(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:
(i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;
(ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective
amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that 
which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed 
with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum 
aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and
(iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material
change to such information in the registration statement;
provided, however, that paragraphs (1)(i), (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those 
paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the 
registration statement.
(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new
registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering 
thereof.
(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of
the offering.
(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:
(i) Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed
prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and
(ii) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating
to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act 
of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after 
effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes 
of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to 
the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial 
bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or 
made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement 
will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration 
statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.
II-2
(5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the
securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, 
regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the 
following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:
(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;
(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned
registrant;
(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its
securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and
(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.
(6) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrant’s annual report pursuant to 
Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant 
to section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration 
statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
(7) To file an application for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the trustee to act under subsection (a) of Section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act in
accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission under Section 305(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act.
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against 
such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the 
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, 
the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the 
question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of 
such issue.
II-3
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the
requirements for filing on Form S-3 and has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in 
the City of Calgary, Province of Alberta, Canada, on July 27, 2016.

action  shall  be  certified  by  the  secretary  or  an  assistant  secretary  of  the  Company  and  delivered  to  the  Trustee  at  or  prior  to  the  delivery  of  the  Officer’s
Certificate of the Company setting forth the terms of the series.
Securities of any particular series may be issued at various times, with different dates on which the principal or any installment of principal is payable,
with different rates of interest, if any, or different methods by which rates of interest may be determined, with different dates on which such interest may be
payable and with different redemption dates.
Section 2.02       Form of Securities and Trustee’s Certificate.
The Securities of any series and the Trustee’s certificate of authentication to be borne by such Securities shall be substantially of the tenor and purport
as set forth in one or more indentures supplemental hereto or as provided in a Board Resolution, and set forth in an Officer’s Certificate, and they may have
such  letters,  numbers  or  other  marks  of  identification  or  designation  and  such  legends  or  endorsements  printed,  lithographed  or  engraved  thereon  as  the
Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture, or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule
or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any securities exchange on which Securities of that series may be listed, or to conform to
usage.
Section 2.03       Denominations: Provisions for Payment.
The Securities shall be issuable as registered Securities and in the denominations of one thousand U.S. dollars ($1,000) or any integral multiple thereof,
subject to Section 2.01(a)(13). The Securities of a particular series shall bear interest payable on the dates and at the rate specified with respect to that series.
Subject  to  Section  2.01(a)(23),  the  principal  of  and  the  interest  on  the  Securities  of  any  series,  as  well  as  any  premium  thereon  in  case  of  redemption  or
repurchase thereof prior to maturity, and any cash amount due upon conversion or exchange thereof, shall be payable in the coin or currency of the United
States of America that at the time is legal tender for public and private debt, at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose. Each Security
shall be dated the date of its authentication. Interest on the Securities shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months.
The interest installment on any Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Securities of that
series shall be paid to the Person in whose name said Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record
date for such interest installment. In the event that any Security of a particular series or portion thereof is called for redemption and the redemption date is
subsequent to a regular record date with respect to any Interest Payment Date and prior to such Interest Payment Date, interest on such Security will be paid
upon presentation and surrender of such Security as provided in Section 3.03.
6
Any interest on any Security that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Securities of the same
series (herein called “Defaulted Interest”) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered holder on the relevant regular record date by virtue of having been
such holder; and such Defaulted Interest shall be paid by the Company, at its election, as provided in clause (1) or clause (2) below:
(1) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on Securities to the Persons in whose names such Securities (or their
respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed
in the following manner: the Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each such Security and the
date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to
be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment,
such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee
shall fix a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall not be more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed
payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of
such special record date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the
special record date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Securityholder at his or her address as it appears in the Security Register (as
hereinafter defined), not less than 10 days prior to such special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record
date  therefor  having  been  mailed  as  aforesaid,  such  Defaulted  Interest  shall  be  paid  to  the  Persons  in  whose  names  such  Securities  (or  their  respective
Predecessor Securities) are registered on such special record date.
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on any Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with
the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice
given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Unless otherwise set forth in a Board Resolution or one or more indentures supplemental hereto establishing the terms of any series of  Securities
pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof, the term “regular record date” as used in this Section with respect to a series of Securities and any Interest Payment Date for
such series shall mean either the fifteenth day of the month immediately preceding the month in which an Interest Payment Date established for such series
pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof shall occur, if such Interest Payment Date is the first day of a month, or the first day of the month in which an Interest Payment
Date established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof shall occur, if such Interest Payment Date is the fifteenth day of a month, whether or not such
date is a Business Day.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security of a series delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu
of any other Security of such series shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, that were carried by such other Security.
Section 2.04       Execution and Authentications.
The Securities shall be signed on behalf of the Company by one of its Officers. Signatures may be in the form of a manual or facsimile signature.
The Company may use the facsimile signature of any Person who shall have been an Officer (at the time of execution), notwithstanding the fact that at
the time the Securities shall be authenticated and delivered or disposed of such Person shall have ceased to be such an officer of the Company. The Securities
may contain such notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or usage. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication
by the Trustee.
7
A Security shall not be valid until authenticated manually by an authorized signatory of the Trustee, or by an Authenticating Agent. Such signature
shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the holder is entitled to the benefits
of  this Indenture.  At any time and from time to time after the  execution and delivery  of this Indenture,  the Company may  deliver  Securities of  any  series
executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a written order of the Company for the authentication and delivery of such Securities,
signed by an Officer, and the Trustee in accordance with such written order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities.
Upon the Company’s delivery of any such authentication order to the Trustee at any time after the initial issuance of Securities under this Indenture, the
Trustee  shall  be  provided  with,  and  (subject  to  Sections  315(a)  through  315(d)  of  the  Trust  Indenture  Act)  shall  be  fully  protected  in  relying  upon,  (1) an
Opinion of Counsel or reliance letter and (2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to the execution, authentication and delivery of such
Securities are in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee’s own
rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner that is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Section 2.05       Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
(a) Securities of any series may be exchanged upon presentation thereof at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose,
for other Securities of such series of authorized denominations, and for a like aggregate principal amount, upon payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge in relation thereto,  all as provided in this Section. In respect of any Securities so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall
execute,  the  Trustee  shall  authenticate  and  such  office  or  agency  shall  deliver  in  exchange  therefor  the  Security  or  Securities  of  the  same  series  that  the
Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive, bearing numbers not contemporaneously outstanding.
(b) The Company shall keep, or cause to be kept, at its office or agency designated for such purpose a register or registers (herein referred to
as the “Security Register”) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall register the Securities and the transfers of
Securities as in this Article provided and which at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the Trustee. The registrar for the purpose of registering
Securities and transfer of Securities as herein provided shall be appointed as authorized by Board Resolution (the “Security Registrar”).
Upon  surrender  for transfer  of  any  Security at the office  or agency  of  the Company designated  for such  purpose,  the  Company  shall  execute,  the
Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series as
the Security presented for a like aggregate principal amount.
All Securities presented or surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer, as provided in this Section, shall be accompanied (if so required by the
Company or the Security Registrar) by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security Registrar, duly
executed by the registered holder or by such holder’s duly authorized attorney in writing.
(c) Except as provided pursuant to Section 2.01 pursuant to a Board Resolution, and set forth in an Officer’s Certificate, or established in one
or more indentures supplemental to this Indenture, no service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities, or issue of new
Securities in case  of partial redemption of any series or repurchase, conversion or  exchange  of  less than  the entire principal  amount of a Security, but  the
Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge in relation thereto, other than exchanges pursuant to Section
2.06, Section 3.03(b) and Section 9.04 not involving any transfer.
(d) The Company shall not be required (a) to issue, exchange or register the transfer of any Securities during a period beginning at the opening
of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of less than all the Outstanding Securities of the same series and ending at the close
of business on the day of such mailing, nor (b) to register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of any series or portions thereof called for redemption or
surrendered for repurchase, but not validly withdrawn, other than the unredeemed portion of any such Securities being redeemed in part or not surrendered for
repurchase, as the case may be. The provisions of this Section 2.05 are, with respect to any Global Security, subject to Section 2.11 hereof.
8
The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this
Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among depositary participants
or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly
required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form
with the express requirements hereof.
Section 2.06       Temporary Securities.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary
Securities (printed, lithographed or typewritten) of any authorized denomination. Such temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of the definitive
Securities in lieu of which they are issued, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be
determined by the Company. Every temporary Security of any series shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same
conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities of such series. Without unnecessary delay the Company will
execute  and  will  furnish  definitive  Securities  of  such  series  and  thereupon  any  or  all  temporary  Securities  of  such  series  may  be  surrendered  in  exchange
therefor (without charge to the holders), at the office or agency of the Company designated for the purpose, and the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or
agency shall deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of such series, unless the Company
advises the Trustee to the effect that definitive Securities need not be executed and furnished until further notice from the Company. Until so exchanged, the
temporary Securities of such series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series authenticated and delivered
hereunder.
Section 2.07       Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities.
In  case  any  temporary  or  definitive  Security  shall  become  mutilated  or  be  destroyed,  lost  or  stolen,  the  Company  (subject  to  the  next  succeeding
sentence) shall execute, and upon the Company’s request the Trustee (subject as aforesaid) shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of the same series,
bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security
so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Security shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may
be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the
Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of the applicant’s Security and of the ownership thereof. The Trustee may authenticate any
such substituted Security and deliver the same upon the written request or authorization of any officer of the Company. Upon the issuance of any substituted
Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and
any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
In case any Security that has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing
a substitute Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for such
payment shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as they may require to save them harmless, and, in case of destruction, loss or
theft, evidence to the satisfaction of the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
Every  replacement  Security  issued  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  Section  shall  constitute  an  additional  contractual  obligation  of  the  Company
whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be found at any time, or be enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of
this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned
upon  the  express  condition  that  the  foregoing  provisions  are  exclusive  with  respect  to  the  replacement  or  payment  of  mutilated,  destroyed,  lost  or  stolen
Securities, and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies, notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the
contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
9
Section 2.08       Cancellation.
All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, repurchase, exchange, registration of transfer or conversion shall, if surrendered to
the  Company  or  any  paying  agent  (or  any  other  applicable  agent),  be  delivered  to  the  Trustee  for  cancellation,  or,  if  surrendered  to  the  Trustee,  shall  be
cancelled by it, and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly required or permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. On request
of the Company at the time of such surrender, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company canceled Securities held by the Trustee. In the absence of such request
the  Trustee  may  dispose  of  canceled  Securities  in  accordance  with  its  standard  procedures  and  deliver  a  certificate  of  disposition  to  the  Company.  If  the
Company  shall  otherwise  acquire  any  of  the  Securities,  however,  such  acquisition  shall  not  operate  as  a  redemption  or  satisfaction  of  the  indebtedness
represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Section 2.09       Benefits of Indenture.
Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and the
holders of the Securities any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Indenture, or under any covenant, condition or provision herein
contained; all such covenants, conditions and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and of the holders of the Securities.
Section 2.10       Authenticating Agent.
So long as any of the Securities of any series remain Outstanding there may be an Authenticating Agent for any or all such series of Securities which
the Trustee shall have the right to appoint. Said Authenticating Agent shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series
issued upon exchange, transfer or partial redemption, repurchase or conversion thereof, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this
Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. All references in this Indenture to the authentication of
Securities by the Trustee shall be deemed to include authentication by an Authenticating Agent for such series. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to
the Company and shall be a corporation that has a combined capital and surplus, as most recently reported or determined by it, sufficient under the laws of any
jurisdiction under which it is organized or in which it is doing business to conduct a trust business, and that is otherwise authorized under such laws to conduct
such business and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities. If at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with these provisions, it shall resign immediately.
Any Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any
time (and upon request by the Company shall) terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating
Agent and to the Company. Upon resignation, termination or cessation of eligibility of any Authenticating Agent, the Trustee may appoint an eligible successor
Authenticating Agent acceptable to the Company. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested
with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent pursuant hereto.
Section 2.11       Global Securities.
(a)         If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 2.01 that the Securities of a particular series are to be issued as a Global Security,
then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 2.04, authenticate and deliver, a Global Security that (i) shall represent, and
shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of, all of the Outstanding Securities of such series, (ii) shall be registered in the
name of the Depositary or its nominee, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary’s instruction (or if the Depositary
names the Trustee as its custodian, retained by the Trustee), and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: “Except as otherwise provided in
Section 2.11 of the Indenture, this Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary
or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.”
10
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05, the Global Security of a series may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the
manner provided in Section 2.05, only to another nominee of the Depositary for such series, or to a successor Depositary for such series selected or approved by
the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.
(c) If at any time the Depositary for a series of the Securities notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for
such series or if at any time the Depositary for such series shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute
or regulation, and a successor Depositary for such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes
aware  of  such  condition,  as  the  case  may  be,  or  if  an  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and  is  continuing  and  the  Company  has  received  a  request  from  the
Depositary or from the Trustee, this Section 2.11 shall no longer be applicable to the Securities of such series and the Company will execute, and subject to
Section 2.04, the Trustee will authenticate and deliver the Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations,
and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series in exchange for such Global Security. In addition, the
Company may at any time determine that the Securities of any series shall no longer be represented by a Global Security and that the provisions of this Section
2.11 shall no longer apply to the Securities of such series. In such event the Company will execute and, subject to Section 2.04, the Trustee, upon receipt of an
Officer’s Certificate evidencing such determination by the Company, will authenticate and deliver the Securities of such series in definitive registered form
without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series in
exchange for such Global Security. Upon the exchange of the Global Security for such Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized
denominations, the Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee. Such Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Security
pursuant to this Section 2.11(c) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its
direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Depositary for delivery to the Persons in
whose names such Securities are so registered.
Section 2.12       CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Securities may use “CUSIP” numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use “CUSIP” numbers in
notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers
either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other elements of identification
printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the
Trustee of any change in the “CUSIP” numbers.
ARTICLE 3
REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES AND SINKING FUND PROVISIONS
Section 3.01       Redemption.
The Company may redeem the Securities of any series issued hereunder on and after the dates and in accordance with the terms established for such
series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof.
Section 3.02       Notice of Redemption.
(a)        In case the Company shall desire to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Securities of any series in
accordance with any right the Company reserved for itself to do so pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof, the Company shall, or shall cause the Trustee to, give notice
of such redemption to holders of the Securities of such series to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid (or with regard to any Global Security held
in book entry form, by electronic mail), a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days before the date fixed for redemption of that
series to such holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register, unless a shorter period is specified in the Securities to be redeemed.
Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder receives
the notice. In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Security of any series designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in
the notice, shall not  affect  the  validity  of the proceedings  for  the  redemption  of any  other  Securities  of  such  series or  any other series.  In  the  case  of any
redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the
Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer’s Certificate evidencing compliance with any such restriction.
11
Each such notice of redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP numbers, if any), specify the date fixed for redemption
and the redemption price at which Securities of that series are to be redeemed, and shall state that payment of the redemption price of such Securities to be
redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company, upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that interest accrued to the date fixed for
redemption will be paid as specified in said notice, that from and after said date interest will cease to accrue and that the redemption is from a sinking fund, if
such is the case. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of Securities of that series to be redeemed in part shall
specify the particular Securities to be so redeemed.
In case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Security shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount
equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
(b)        If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee at least 45 days’ notice (unless a
shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) in advance of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the series to
be redeemed, and thereupon the Trustee shall select, by lot or in such other manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair in its discretion and that may provide for
the selection of a portion or portions (equal to one thousand U.S. dollars ($1,000) or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of such Securities of
a denomination larger than $1,000, the Securities to be redeemed and shall thereafter promptly notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Securities to

Trustee or any paying agent to call all or any part of the Securities of a particular series for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the manner set forth
in this Section, such notice to be in the name of the Company or its own name as the Trustee or such paying agent may deem advisable. In any case in which
notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the
Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to

together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption and interest on such Securities or portions of Securities shall cease to accrue on and after the date
fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest with respect to any such Security or
portion thereof. On presentation and surrender of such Securities on or after the date fixed for redemption at the place of payment specified in the notice, said
Securities shall be paid and redeemed at the applicable redemption price for such series, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption
(but if the date fixed for redemption is an Interest Payment Date, the interest installment payable on such date shall be payable to the registered holder at the
close of business on the applicable record date pursuant to Section 2.03).
12
(b)         Upon presentation of any Security of such series that is to be redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and the office or agency where the Security is presented shall deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security of the

The provisions of Sections 3.04, 3.05 and 3.06 shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of such series.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a “mandatory sinking
fund payment,” and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an “optional
sinking fund payment”. If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as
provided in Section 3.05. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of
such series.

The Company (i) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series and (ii) may apply as a credit Securities of a series that have been redeemed either at
the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the
terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be
made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such series, provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited.
Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price specified in such Securities for redemption through
operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 3.06       Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee),
the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the
terms of the series, the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.05 and the basis for
such credit and will, together with such Officer’s Certificate, deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such
sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.02
and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.02. Such notice
having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.03.

Section 4.02       Maintenance of Office or Agency.
So long as any series of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Company agrees to maintain an office or agency with respect to each such series and at
such  other  location  or  locations  as  may  be  designated  as  provided  in  this  Section  4.02,  where  (i) Securities  of  that  series  may  be  presented  for  payment,
(ii) Securities of that series may be presented as herein above authorized for registration of transfer and exchange, and (iii) notices and demands to or upon the
Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be given or served, such designation to continue with respect to such office or agency
until the Company shall, by written notice signed by any officer authorized to sign an Officer’s Certificate and delivered to the Trustee, designate some other
office or agency for such purposes or any of them. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish
the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the
Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, notices and demands. The Company initially appoints the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee as its paying agent with respect to the Securities.
Section 4.03       Paying Agents.
(a)         If the Company shall appoint one or more paying agents for all or any series of the Securities, other than the Trustee, the Company
will cause each such paying agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions
of this Section:
(1) that it will hold all sums held by it as such agent for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the
Securities of that series (whether such sums have been paid to it by the Company or by any other obligor of such Securities) in trust for the benefit of the
Persons entitled thereto;
payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of that series when the same shall be due and payable;
(2)  that  it  will  give  the  Trustee  notice  of  any  failure  by  the  Company  (or  by  any  other  obligor  of  such  Securities)  to  make  any
request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such paying agent; and
(3) that it will, at any time during the continuance of any failure referred to in the preceding paragraph (a)(2) above, upon the written
(4) that it will perform all other duties of paying agent as set forth in this Indenture.
(b)         If the Company shall act as its own paying agent with respect to any series of the Securities, it will on or before each due date of the
principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on Securities of that series, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a
sum sufficient to pay such principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due on Securities of that series until such sums shall be paid to such Persons
or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of such action, or any failure (by it or any other obligor on such Securities) to
take such action. Whenever the Company shall have one or more paying agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of (and
premium, if any) or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with the paying agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest
so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such paying agent is the
Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of this action or failure so to act.
(c)         Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, (i) the agreement to hold sums in trust as provided in this Section is subject
to the provisions of Section 11.05, and (ii) the Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any
other purpose, pay, or direct any paying agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such paying agent, such sums to be held by the
Trustee upon the same terms and conditions as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such paying agent; and, upon such payment by the
Company or any paying agent to the Trustee, the Company or such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.

such form as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the holders of each series of Securities as of such regular record date, provided
that the Company shall not be obligated to furnish or cause to furnish such list at any time that the list shall not differ in any respect from the most recent list
furnished to the Trustee by the Company and (b) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of
any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished; provided, however, that, in either
case, no such list need be furnished for any series for which the Trustee shall be the Security Registrar.
Section 5.02       Preservation Of Information; Communications With Securityholders.
(a)         The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, all information as to the names and addresses of the

regulations  prescribe)  that  the  Company  is  required  to  file  with  the  Commission  pursuant  to  Section  13  or  Section  15(d)  of  the  Exchange  Act;  provided,
however, the Company shall not be required to deliver to the Trustee any correspondence filed with the Commission or any materials for which the Company
has sought and received confidential treatment by the Commission; and provided further, that so long as such filings by the Company are available on the
Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System (EDGAR), or any successor system, such filings shall be deemed to have been filed
with the Trustee for purposes hereof without any further action required by the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, a failure by the Company to file annual
reports, information and other reports with the SEC within the time period prescribed thereof by the Commission shall not be deemed a breach of this Section
5.03.
(b)         Delivery  of  reports,  information  and  documents  to  the  Trustee  under  Section  5.03  is  for  informational  purposes  only  and  the
information  and  the  Trustee’s  receipt  of  the  foregoing  shall  not  constitute  constructive  notice  of  any  information  contained  therein,  or  determinable  from
information  contained  therein  including  the  Company’s  compliance  with  any  of  their  covenants  thereunder  (as  to  which  the  Trustee  is  entitled  to  rely
exclusively on an Officer’s Certificate). The Trustee is under no duty to examine any such reports, information or documents delivered to the Trustee or filed
with the SEC via EDGAR to ensure  compliance with the provision of this Indenture  or to ascertain the  correctness  or otherwise of the information  or  the
statements contained therein. The Trustee shall have no responsibility or duty whatsoever to ascertain or determine whether the above referenced filings with the
SEC on EDGAR (or any successor system) has occurred.

events that has occurred and is continuing:
(a)         Whenever used herein with respect to Securities of a particular series, “Event of Default” means any one or more of the following
(1) the Company defaults in the payment of any installment of interest upon any of the Securities of that series, as and when the same
shall become due and payable, and such default continues for a period of 90 days; provided, however, that a valid extension of an interest payment period by the
Company in accordance with the terms of any indenture supplemental hereto shall not constitute a default in the payment of interest for this purpose;
(2) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any of the Securities of that series as and when
the  same  shall  become  due  and  payable  whether  at  maturity, upon  redemption,  by  declaration  or  otherwise,  or  in  any  payment  required by  any  sinking  or
analogous fund established with respect to that series; provided, however, that a valid extension of the maturity of such Securities in accordance with the terms
of any indenture supplemental hereto shall not constitute a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any;
(3) the Company fails to observe or perform any other of its covenants or agreements with respect to that series contained in this
Indenture or otherwise established with respect to that series of Securities pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof (other than a covenant or agreement that has been
expressly included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Securities other than such series) for a period of 90 days after the date on
which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied and stating that such notice is a “Notice of Default” hereunder, shall have been given to
the Company by the Trustee, by registered or certified mail, or to the Company and the Trustee by the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
Securities of that series at the time Outstanding;
(4) the Company pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law (i) commences a voluntary case, (ii) consents to the entry

involuntary case, (ii) appoints a Custodian of the Company for all or substantially all of its property or (iii) orders the liquidation of the Company, and the order
or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 90 days.
(b)         In each and every such case (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (4) or clause (5) above), unless the principal of all the
Securities of that series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by such Securityholders), may declare the
principal of (and premium, if any, on) and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such
declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in clause (4) or clause (5) above occurs, the
principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities of that series shall automatically be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or the holders of the Securities.

been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter
provided, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by written notice to the Company
and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of that series and the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any and all Securities of that series that

under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate per annum expressed in the Securities of that series to the date of such payment or
deposit) and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06, and (ii) any and all Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to such series, other
than the nonpayment of principal on (and premium, if any, on) and accrued and unpaid interest on Securities of that series that shall not have become due by
their terms, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 6.06.
No such rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(d)        In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right with respect to Securities of that series under this Indenture and such
proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely
to the Trustee, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceedings, the Company and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their
former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceedings had
been taken.

any of the Securities of a series when the same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of the Securities of a series or upon redemption or
upon declaration or otherwise then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of that
series, the whole amount that then shall have been become due and payable on all such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) or interest, or both, as the
case may be, with interest upon the overdue principal (and premium, if any) and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law)
upon overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum expressed in the Securities of that series; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be
sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06.
17
(b)        If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express
trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may
prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or other obligor
upon the Securities of that series and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law or equity out of the property of the
Company or other obligor upon the Securities of that series, wherever situated.
(c)        In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or judicial
proceedings affecting the Company, or its creditors or property, the Trustee shall have power to intervene in such proceedings and take any action therein that

may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and of the holders of Securities of such series allowed for the entire amount due and
payable by the Company under the Indenture at the date of institution of such proceedings and for any additional amount that may become due and payable by
the Company after such date, and to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim, and to distribute the same after
the deduction of the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized
by each of the holders of Securities of such series to make such payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such
payments directly to such Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it under Section 7.06.
(d)        All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the terms established with respect to Securities of that
series, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Securities, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative
thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment
shall, after provision for payment to the Trustee of any amounts due under Section 7.06, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series.
In case of an Event of Default hereunder, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by
such  appropriate  judicial  proceedings  as  the  Trustee  shall  deem  most  effectual  to  protect  and  enforce  any  of  such  rights,  either  at  law  or  in  equity  or  in
bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any
plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of that series or the rights of any holder thereof or to authorize the
Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding.

THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company or any other Person lawfully entitled thereto.
Section 6.04       Limitation on Suits.

proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder,
unless  (i) such  holder  previously  shall  have  given  to  the  Trustee  written  notice  of  an  Event  of  Default  and  of  the  continuance  thereof  with  respect  to  the
Securities of such series specifying such Event of Default, as hereinbefore provided; (ii) the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as
Trustee hereunder; (iii) such holder or holders shall have offered to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred in compliance with such request; (iv) the Trustee for 90 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have failed to institute
any such action, suit or proceeding and (v) during such 90 day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of that series do not give

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary or any other provisions of this Indenture, the right of any holder of any Security to receive
payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Security, as therein provided, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such
Security (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates or
redemption date, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder and by accepting a Security hereunder it is expressly understood, intended
and covenanted by the taker and holder of every Security of such series with every other such taker and holder and the Trustee, that no one or more holders of
Securities of such series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice
the rights of the holders of any other of such Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right
under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of Securities of such series. For the
protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section, each and every Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either
at law or in equity.
Section 6.05       Rights and Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
(a)        Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.07, all powers and remedies given by this Article to the Trustee or to the Securityholders
shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the
Securities,  by  judicial  proceedings  or  otherwise,  to  enforce  the  performance  or  observance  of  the  covenants  and  agreements  contained  in  this  Indenture  or
otherwise established with respect to such Securities.
(b)        No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Securities to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event
of  Default  occurring  and  continuing  as  aforesaid  shall  impair  any  such  right  or  power,  or  shall  be  construed  to  be  a  waiver  of  any  such  default  or  an
acquiescence  therein;  and,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  Section  6.04,  every  power  and  remedy  given  by  this  Article  or  by  law  to  the  Trustee  or  the
Securityholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Securityholders.
Section 6.06        Control by Securityholders.

8.04, shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series; provided, however, that such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this
Indenture or subject the Trustee in its sole discretion to personal liability. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to
follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed, subject
to the Trustee’s duties under the Trust Indenture Act, would involve the Trustee in personal liability or might be unduly prejudicial to the Securityholders not
involved in the proceeding. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding affected thereby,
determined in accordance with Section 8.04, may on behalf of the holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past default in the performance of any
of the covenants contained herein or established pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Securities of that series as and when the same shall become due by the terms of such Securities
otherwise  than  by  acceleration  (unless  such  default  has  been  cured  and  a  sum  sufficient  to  pay  all  matured  installments  of  interest  and  principal  and  any
premium has been deposited with the Trustee (in accordance with Section 6.01(c)). Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby shall be deemed to be
cured for all purposes of this Indenture and the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions
and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Section 6.07       Undertaking to Pay Costs.
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Securities by such holder’s acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court
may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken
or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion
assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith
of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted
by any Securityholder, or group of Securityholders, holding more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any
suit instituted by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security of such series, on or
after the respective due dates expressed in such Security or established pursuant to this Indenture.

personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if there is reasonable ground for believing that
the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Indenture or adequate indemnity against such risk is not reasonably
assured to it;

however, relieve the Trustee of the obligation, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to a series of the Securities (that has not been cured or
waived), to exercise with respect to Securities of that series such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and to use the same degree of care and
skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs;
21
within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture;
(e)        The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or
(f)        The  Trustee  shall  not  be  bound  to  make  any  investigation  into  the  facts  or  matters  stated  in  any  resolution,  certificate,  statement,

Company of one of its covenants under this Indenture, unless requested in writing so to do by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding  Securities  of  the  particular  series  affected  thereby  (determined  as  provided  in  Section  8.04);  provided,  however,  that  if  the  payment  within  a
reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee,

paid by the Company or, if paid by the Trustee, shall be repaid by the Company upon demand;
(g)        The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents

or  military  disturbances,  nuclear  or  natural  catastrophes  or  acts  of  God,  and  interruptions,  loss  or  malfunctions  of  utilities,  communications  or  computer

whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
regardless of the form of action; and
(j)         The Trustee agrees to accept and act upon instructions or directions pursuant to this Indenture sent by unsecured e-mail, facsimile
transmission  or  other  similar  unsecured  electronic  methods;  provided,  however,  that  (a) the  party  providing  such  written  instructions,  subsequent  to  such
transmission of written instructions, shall provide the originally executed instructions or directions to the Trustee in a timely manner, and (b) such originally
executed instructions or directions shall be signed by an authorized representative of the party providing such instructions or directions. If the party elects to
give  the  Trustee  e-mail  or  facsimile  instructions  (or  instructions  by  a  similar  electronic  method)  and  the  Trustee  in  its  discretion  elects  to  act  upon  such
instructions, the Trustee’s understanding of such instructions shall be deemed controlling. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses
arising  directly  or  indirectly  from  the  Trustee’s  reliance  upon  and  compliance  with  such  instructions  notwithstanding  such  instructions  conflict  or  are

(l)        The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to the
failure to pay the interest on, or the principal of, the Securities) until the Trustee shall have received written notification in the manner set forth in this Indenture
or a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have obtained actual knowledge.
Section 7.03       Trustee Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance or Securities.
(a)        The  recitals  contained  herein  and  in  the  Securities  shall  be  taken  as  the  statements  of  the  Company,  and  the  Trustee  assumes  no
responsibility for the correctness of the same. The Trustee shall not be responsible for any statement in any registration statement, prospectus, or any other
document in connection with the sale of Securities. The Trustee shall not be responsible for any rating on the Securities or any action or omission of any rating
agency.
(b)        The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities.
(c)        The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of any of the Securities or of the proceeds of such
Securities, or for the use or application of any moneys paid over by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture or established pursuant to
Section 2.01, or for the use or application of any moneys received by any paying agent other than the Trustee.
Section 7.04       May Hold Securities.
The Trustee or any paying agent or Security Registrar, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities with the
same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, paying agent or Security Registrar.

Subject to the provisions of Section 11.05, all moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the
purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability
for interest on any moneys received by it hereunder except such as it may agree with the Company to pay thereon.
Section 7.06       Compensation and Reimbursement.
(a)        The Company shall pay to the Trustee for each of its capacities hereunder from time to time compensation for its services as the
Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree upon in writing. The Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a
trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it. Such expenses shall
include the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee’s agents and counsel.
(b)        The Company shall indemnify each of the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder against any loss, liability or expense (including
the cost of defending itself and including the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee’s agents and counsel) incurred by it except as set forth in
Section 7.06(c) in the exercise or performance of its powers, rights or duties under this Indenture as Trustee or Agent. The Trustee shall notify the Company
promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may
have one separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made

(d)        To ensure the Company’s payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all funds or
property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of or interest on particular Securities. When the Trustee incurs expenses or
renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(4) or (5), the expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its
counsel) and the compensation for services in connection therewith are to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law. The provisions of
this Section 7.06 shall survive the termination of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.
Section 7.07       Reliance on Officer’s Certificate.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.01, whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it reasonably
necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such matter (unless other
evidence  in  respect  thereof  be  herein  specifically  prescribed)  may,  in  the  absence  of  negligence  or  bad  faith  on  the  part  of  the  Trustee,  be  deemed  to  be
conclusively proved and established by an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and such certificate, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part
of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith
thereof.
Section 7.08       Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.
If the Trustee has or shall acquire any “conflicting interest” within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee and the
Company shall in all respects comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.
Section 7.09       Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.
There shall at all times be a Trustee with respect to the Securities issued hereunder which shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing
business  under  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America  or  any  state  or  territory  thereof  or  of  the  District  of  Columbia,  or  a  corporation  or  other  Person
permitted to act as trustee by the Commission, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least
fifty million U.S. dollars ($50,000,000), and subject to supervision or examination by federal, state, territorial, or District of Columbia authority.
If such corporation or other Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising
or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation or other Person shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. The Company may not, nor may any Person directly or indirectly
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company, serve as Trustee. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance
with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 7.10.
Section 7.10       Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
(a)        The Trustee or any successor hereafter appointed may at any time resign with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving
written notice thereof to the Company and by transmitting notice of resignation by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Securityholders of such series, as their
names and addresses appear upon the Security Register. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee with
respect to Securities of such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be
delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment
within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor trustee with respect to Securities of such series, or any Securityholder of that series who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at
least six months may on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may
thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.
24
(b)        In case at any time any one of the following shall occur:
Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months; or
(i)  the  Trustee  shall  fail  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  Section  7.08  after  written  request  therefor  by  the  Company  or  by  any
therefor by the Company or by any such Securityholder; or
(ii) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.09 and shall fail to resign after written request
(iii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or commence a voluntary bankruptcy
proceeding, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or consented to, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or
of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;
then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in
duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor
trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of that holder and all others
similarly  situated,  petition  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  for  the  removal  of  the  Trustee  and  the  appointment  of  a  successor  trustee.  Such  court  may
thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.
(c)        The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding may at any time remove
the Trustee with respect to such series by so notifying the Trustee and the Company and may appoint a successor Trustee for such series with the consent of the
Company.
any of the provisions of this Section shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 7.11.
(d)        Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of a series pursuant to
such series, and at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series.
(e)        Any successor trustee appointed pursuant to this Section may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more series or all of
Section 7.11       Acceptance of Appointment By Successor.
(a)        In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor trustee so appointed
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or
removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of
its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights, powers, and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign,
transfer and deliver to such successor trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
(b)        In  case  of  the  appointment  hereunder  of  a  successor  trustee  with  respect  to  the  Securities  of  one  or  more  (but  not  all)  series,  the
Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental
hereto wherein each successor trustee shall accept such appointment and which (i) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and
confirm to, and to vest in, each successor trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those
series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates, (ii) shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all
the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall
continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (iii) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or
facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall
constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust, that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or
trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee and that no Trustee shall be responsible for any act or failure to act on the part of any other Trustee
hereunder; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the
extent provided therein, such retiring Trustee shall with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates
have  no  further  responsibility  for  the  exercise  of  rights  and  powers  or  for  the  performance  of  the  duties  and  obligations  vested  in  the  Trustee  under  this
Indenture, and each such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the
retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates; but, on request of the Company
or any successor trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor trustee, to the extent contemplated by such supplemental
indenture, the property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such
successor trustee relates.
25
and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
(c)        Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in
eligible under this Article.
(d)        No successor trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified and
(e)        Upon  acceptance  of  appointment  by  a  successor  trustee  as  provided  in  this  Section,  the  Company  shall  transmit  notice  of  the
succession of such trustee hereunder by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Securityholders, as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register.
If the Company fails to transmit such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such
notice to be transmitted at the expense of the Company.
Section 7.12       Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any
merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of
the Trustee, including the administration of the trust created by this Indenture, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that such corporation
shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 7.08 and eligible under the provisions of Section 7.09, without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not
delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and
deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
Section 7.13       Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Company.
The Trustee shall comply with Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, excluding any creditor relationship described in Section 311(b) of the Trust
Indenture Act. A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act to the extent included therein.
Section 7.14       Notice of Default.
If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if such Event of Default is known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to
each Securityholder in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act notice of the Event of Default within the earlier of 90
days after it occurs and 30 days after it is known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or written notice of it is received by the Trustee, unless such Event of
Default has been cured; provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any
Security, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the
withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Securityholders.

Section 8.01       Evidence of Action by Securityholders.
Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a
particular series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other
action),  the  fact  that  at  the  time  of  taking  any  such  action  the  holders  of  such  majority  or  specified  percentage  of  that  series  have  joined  therein  may  be
evidenced by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such holders of Securities of that series in person or by agent or proxy
appointed in writing.
If  the  Company  shall  solicit  from  the  Securityholders  of  any  series  any  request, demand,  authorization,  direction,  notice,  consent,  waiver  or  other
action,  the  Company  may,  at  its  option,  as  evidenced  by  an  Officer’s  Certificate,  fix  in  advance  a  record  date  for  such  series  for  the  determination  of
Securityholders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, but the Company shall have no obligation
to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action may be given before or after the
record  date,  but  only  the  Securityholders  of  record  at  the  close  of  business  on  the  record  date  shall  be  deemed  to  be  Securityholders  for  the  purposes  of
determining whether Securityholders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities of that series have authorized or agreed or consented to such request,
demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities of that series shall be computed as of
the record date; provided, however, that no such authorization, agreement or consent by such Securityholders on the record date shall be deemed effective unless
it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
Section 8.02        Proof of Execution by Securityholders.
Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder (such proof will not require notarization) or his

Section 8.04       Certain Securities Owned by Company Disregarded.
In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction,
consent or waiver under this Indenture, the Securities of that series that are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series or by any
Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under common control with the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series shall
be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee
shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities of such series that the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so
disregarded. The Securities so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding for the purposes of this Section, if the pledgee shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee’s right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not a Person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any such other obligor. In case of a dispute as to such right, any

Security of that series that is shown by the evidence to be included in the Securities the holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written
notice with the Trustee, and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any
such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Security, and
of any Security issued in exchange therefor, on registration of transfer thereof or in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is
made upon such Security. Any action taken by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series
specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Securities of
that series.

the form and provisions of the Warrant Certificates and the terms and conditions on which they may be issued, registered, transferred, exchanged, exercised and

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1

Issuance Of Warrants. [If Warrants alone —Upon issuance, each Warrant Certificate shall evidence one or more Warrants.] [If Other
Securities and Warrants —Warrant Certificates will be issued in connection with the issuance of the Other Securities but shall be separately transferable and
each Warrant Certificate shall evidence one or more Warrants.] Each Warrant evidenced thereby shall represent the right, subject to the provisions contained
herein and therein, to purchase one Warrant Security.[If Other Securities and Warrants —Warrant Certificates will be issued with the Other Securities and
each Warrant Certificate will evidence [●] Warrants for each [[●] shares] of Other Securities issued.]
1.2
Execution And Delivery Of Warrant Certificates. Each Warrant Certificate, whenever issued, shall be in registered form substantially
in the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, shall be dated the date of its countersignature by the Warrant Agent and may have such letters, numbers, or other
marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements printed, lithographed or engraved thereon as the officers of the Company executing the
same may approve (execution thereof to be conclusive evidence of such approval) and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may
be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any securities exchange on which the
Warrants  may  be  listed,  or  to  conform  to  usage.  The  Warrant  Certificates  shall  be  signed  on  behalf  of  the  Company  by  any  of  its  present  or  future  chief

officers of the Company, although at the date of the execution of this Agreement any such person was not such officer.

be registered upon the books to be maintained by the Warrant Agent for that purpose.

upon the order of the Company.
ARTICLE 2
WARRANT PRICE, DURATION AND EXERCISE OF WARRANTS
2.1
Warrant Price. During the period specified in Section 2.2, each Warrant shall, subject to the terms of this Warrant Agreement and the
applicable Warrant Certificate, entitle the holder thereof to purchase the number of Warrant Securities specified in the applicable Warrant Certificate at an
exercise  price  of  $[●]  per  Warrant  Security,  subject  to  adjustment  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events,  as  hereinafter  provided.  Such  purchase  price  per
Warrant Security is referred to in this Agreement as the “Warrant Price.”
2.2
Duration Of Warrants. Each Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part at any time, as specified herein, on or after [the date thereof]
[●] and at or before [●] p.m., [City] time, on [●] or such later date as the Company may designate by notice to the Warrant Agent and the holders of Warrant
Certificates mailed to their addresses as set forth in the record books of the Warrant Agent (the “Expiration Date”). Each Warrant not exercised at or before [●]
p.m.,  [City]  time,  on  the  Expiration  Date  shall  become  void,  and  all  rights  of  the  holder  of  the  Warrant  Certificate  evidencing  such  Warrant  under  this
Agreement shall cease.
2.3
Exercise Of Warrants.
(a)
During the period specified in Section 2.2, the Warrants may be exercised to purchase a whole number of Warrant Securities in
registered form by providing certain information as set forth on the reverse side of the Warrant Certificate and by paying in full, in lawful money of the United
States of America, [in cash or by certified check or official bank check in New York Clearing House funds] [by bank wire transfer in immediately available
funds]  the  Warrant  Price  for  each  Warrant  Security  with  respect  to  which  a  Warrant  is  being  exercised  to  the  Warrant  Agent  at  its  corporate  trust  office,
provided that such exercise is subject to receipt within five business days of such payment by the Warrant Agent of the Warrant Certificate with the form of
election  to  purchase  Warrant  Securities  set  forth  on  the  reverse  side  of  the  Warrant  Certificate  properly  completed  and  duly  executed.  The  date  on  which
payment in full of the Warrant Price is received by the Warrant Agent shall, subject to receipt of the Warrant Certificate as aforesaid, be deemed to be the date
on which the Warrant is exercised; provided, however, that if, at the date of receipt of such Warrant Certificates and payment in full of the Warrant Price, the
transfer books for the Warrant Securities purchasable upon the exercise of such Warrants shall be closed, no such receipt of such Warrant Certificates and no
such payment of such Warrant Price shall be effective to constitute the person so designated to be named as the holder of record of such Warrant Securities on
such date, but shall be effective to constitute such person as the holder of record of such Warrant Securities for all purposes at the opening of business on the
next succeeding day on which the transfer books for the Warrant Securities purchasable upon the exercise of such Warrants shall be opened, and the certificates
for the Warrant Securities in respect of which such Warrants are then exercised shall be issuable as of the date on such next succeeding day on which the
transfer books shall next be opened, and until such date the Company shall be under no duty to deliver any certificate for such Warrant Securities. The Warrant
Agent shall deposit all funds received by it in payment of the Warrant Price in an account of the Company maintained with it and shall advise the Company by
telephone at the end of each day on which a payment for the exercise of Warrants is received of the amount so deposited to its account. The Warrant Agent shall
promptly confirm such telephone advice to the Company in writing.

The  Warrant  Agent  shall,  from  time  to  time,  as  promptly  as  practicable,  advise  the  Company  of  (i) the  number  of  Warrant
Securities with respect to which Warrants were exercised, (ii) the instructions of each holder of the Warrant Certificates evidencing such Warrants with respect
to delivery of the Warrant Securities to which such holder is entitled upon such exercise, (iii) delivery of Warrant Certificates evidencing the balance, if any, of
the Warrants for the remaining Warrant Securities after such exercise, and (iv) such other information as the Company shall reasonably require.
(c)
As soon as practicable after the exercise of any Warrant, the Company shall issue to or upon the order of the holder of the
Warrant Certificate evidencing such Warrant the Warrant Securities to which such holder is entitled, in fully registered form, registered in such name or names
as may be directed by such holder. If fewer than all of the Warrants evidenced by such Warrant Certificate are exercised, the Company shall execute, and an
authorized officer of the Warrant Agent shall manually countersign and deliver, a new Warrant Certificate evidencing Warrants for the number of Warrant
Securities remaining unexercised.
(d)
The Company shall not be required to pay any stamp or other tax or other governmental charge required to be paid in connection
with any transfer involved in the issue of the Warrant Securities, and in the event that any such transfer is involved, the Company shall not be required to issue
or deliver any Warrant Security until such tax or other charge shall have been paid or it has been established to the Company’s satisfaction that no such tax or
other charge is due.
Date keep reserved, out of its authorized but unissued Warrant Securities, a number of shares sufficient to provide for the exercise of the Warrants.

WARRANT CERTIFICATES
3.1
No  Rights  As  Warrant  Securityholder  Conferred  By  Warrants  Or  Warrant  Certificates.  No  Warrant  Certificate  or  Warrant
evidenced thereby shall entitle the holder thereof to any of the rights of a holder of Warrant Securities, including, without limitation, the right to receive the
payment  of  dividends  or  distributions,  if  any,  on  the  Warrant  Securities  or  to  exercise  any  voting  rights,  except  to  the  extent  expressly  set  forth  in  this
Agreement or the applicable Warrant Certificate.
3.2
Lost, Stolen, Mutilated Or Destroyed Warrant Certificates. Upon receipt by the Warrant Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to
it and the Company of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Warrant Certificate and/or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the
Warrant Agent and the Company and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender of the mutilated Warrant Certificate to the Warrant Agent for cancellation, then,
in the absence of notice to the Company or the Warrant Agent that such Warrant Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall
execute, and an authorized officer of the Warrant Agent shall manually countersign and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated Warrant Certificate, a new Warrant Certificate of the same tenor and evidencing Warrants for a like number of Warrant Securities. Upon the issuance
of any new Warrant Certificate under this Section 3.2, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Warrant Agent) in connection therewith. Every substitute
Warrant Certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this Section 3.2 in lieu of any lost, stolen or destroyed Warrant Certificate shall represent an additional
contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Warrant Certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Warrant Certificates duly executed and delivered hereunder. The
provisions of this Section 3.2 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement of mutilated,

otherwise in respect of, such holder’s right to exercise the Warrants evidenced by such holder’s Warrant Certificate in the manner provided in such holder’s
Warrant Certificate and in this Agreement.
3.4
Adjustments.
(a)
In case the Company shall at any time subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the
Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced and the number of Warrant Securities purchasable under the
Warrants shall be proportionately increased. Conversely, in case the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company shall be combined into a smaller
number of shares, the Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased and the number of Warrant Securities
purchasable under the Warrants shall be proportionately decreased.
upon the exercise of the Warrants) shall have received or become entitled to receive, without payment therefore,
(b)
If at any time or from time to time the holders of Common Stock (or any shares of stock or other securities at the time receivable
Common Stock or any shares of stock or other securities which are at any time directly or indirectly convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock, or any rights or options to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any of the foregoing by way of dividend or other
distribution;
(i)
earnings;
(ii)
(iii)
any cash paid or payable otherwise than as a cash dividend paid or payable out of the Company’s current or retained
any evidence of the Company’s indebtedness or rights to subscribe for or purchase the Company’s indebtedness; or
(iv)
Common  Stock  or  additional  stock  or  other  securities  or  property  (including  cash)  by  way  of  spinoff,  split-up,
reclassification, combination of shares or similar corporate rearrangement (other than shares of Common Stock issued as a stock split or adjustments in respect
of which shall be covered by the terms of Section 3.4(a) above), then and in each such case, the holder of each Warrant shall, upon the exercise of the Warrant,
be entitled to receive, in addition to the number of Warrant Securities receivable thereupon, and without payment of any additional consideration therefore, the
amount of stock and other securities and property (including cash and indebtedness or rights to subscribe for or purchase indebtedness) which such holder would
hold on the date of such exercise had he been the holder of record of such Warrant Securities as of the date on which holders of Common Stock received or
became entitled to receive such shares or all other additional stock and other securities and property.
4
(c)
In case of (i) any reclassification, capital reorganization, or change in the Common Stock of the Company (other than as a result
of a subdivision, combination, or stock dividend provided for in Section 3.4(a) or Section 3.4(b) above), (ii) share exchange, merger or similar transaction of the
Company with or into another person or entity (other than a share exchange, merger or similar transaction in which the Company is the acquiring or surviving
corporation and which does not result in any change in the Common Stock other than the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock) or (iii) the sale,
exchange,  lease,  transfer  or  other  disposition  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  properties  and  assets  of  the  Company  as  an  entirety  (in  any  such  case,  a
“Reorganization Event”), then, as a condition of such Reorganization Event, lawful provisions shall be made, and duly executed documents evidencing the
same from the Company or its successor shall be delivered to the holders of the Warrants, so that the holders of the Warrants shall have the right at any time
prior to the expiration of the Warrants to purchase, at a total price equal to that payable upon the exercise of the Warrants, the kind and amount of shares of
stock and other securities and property receivable in connection with such Reorganization Event by a holder of the same number of Warrant Securities as were
purchasable by the holders of the Warrants immediately prior to such Reorganization Event. In any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect
to the rights and interests of the holders of the Warrants so that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable with respect to any shares of stock or other
securities and property deliverable upon exercise the Warrants, and appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Warrant Price payable hereunder provided the
aggregate purchase price shall remain the same. In the case of any transaction described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, the Company shall thereupon be relieved
of  any  further  obligation  hereunder  or  under  the  Warrants,  and  the  Company  as  the  predecessor  corporation  may  thereupon  or  at  any  time  thereafter  be
dissolved, wound up or liquidated. Such successor or assuming entity thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of
the  Company,  any  or  all  of  the  Warrants  issuable  hereunder  which  heretofore  shall  not  have  been  signed  by  the  Company,  and  may  execute  and  deliver
securities in its own name, in fulfillment of its obligations to deliver Warrant Securities upon exercise of the Warrants. All the Warrants so issued shall in all
respects  have  the  same  legal  rank  and  benefit  under  this  Agreement  as  the  Warrants  theretofore  or  thereafter  issued  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  this
Agreement as though all of such Warrants had been issued at the date of the execution hereof. In any case of any such Reorganization Event, such changes in
phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Warrants thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate. The Warrant Agent may receive a
written opinion of legal counsel as conclusive evidence that any such Reorganization Event complies with the provisions of this Section 3.4.
The Company may, at its option, at any time until the Expiration Date, reduce the then current Warrant Price to any amount
deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company for any period not exceeding twenty consecutive days (as evidenced in a resolution adopted by
such Board of Directors), but only upon giving the notices required by Section 3.5 at least ten days prior to taking such action.
(d)
Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, no adjustment in the Warrant Price shall be made by reason of the issuance of
shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, or securities carrying the right to purchase any of the
foregoing or for any other reason whatsoever.
(e)
(f)
No fractional Warrant Securities shall be issued upon the exercise of Warrants. If more than one Warrant shall be exercised at
one time by the same holder, the number of full Warrant Securities which shall be issuable upon such exercise shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate
number of Warrant Securities purchased pursuant to the Warrants so exercised. Instead of any fractional Warrant Security which would otherwise be issuable
upon exercise of any Warrant, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the last reported
sale price (or bid price if there were no sales) per Warrant Security, in either case as reported on the principal registered national securities exchange on which
the Warrant Securities are listed or admitted to trading on the business day that next precedes the day of exercise or, if the Warrant Securities are not then listed
or admitted to trading on any registered national securities exchange, the average of the closing high bid and low asked prices as reported on the OTC Bulletin
Board Service (the “OTC Bulletin Board”) operated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA” ) or, if not available on the OTC Bulletin
Board, then the average of the closing high bid and low asked prices as reported on any other U.S. quotation medium or inter-dealer quotation system on such
date, or if on any such date the Warrant Securities are not listed or admitted to trading on a registered national securities exchange, are not included in the OTC
Bulletin Board, and are not quoted on any other U.S. quotation medium or inter-dealer quotation system, an amount equal to the same fraction of the average of
the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by any FINRA member firm selected from time to time by the Company for that purpose at the close of business
on the business day that next precedes the day of exercise.
5
Whenever the Warrant Price then in effect is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall mail to each holder of the Warrants
at such holder’s address as it shall appear on the books of the Company a statement setting forth the adjusted Warrant Price then and thereafter effective under
the provisions hereof, together with the facts, in reasonable detail, upon which such adjustment is based.
(g)
3.5
Notice To Warrantholders. In case the Company shall (a) effect any dividend or distribution described in Section 3.4(b), (b) effect any
Reorganization Event, (c) make any distribution on or in respect of the Common Stock in connection with the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
Company, or (d) reduce the then current Warrant Price pursuant to Section 3.4(d), then the Company shall mail to each holder of Warrants at such holder’s
address as it shall appear on the books of the Warrant Agent, at least ten days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the record
date for such dividend or distribution, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of record of Common Stock that will be entitled to such
dividend or distribution are to be determined, (y) the date on which such Reorganization Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become
effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for
securities or other property deliverable upon such Reorganization Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, or (z) the first date on which the then current
Warrant Price shall be reduced pursuant to Section 3.4(d). No failure to mail such notice nor any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect any such
transaction or any adjustment in the Warrant Price required by Section 3.4.
3.6
[If The Warrants Are Subject To Acceleration By The Company, Insert — Acceleration Of Warrants By The Company.
(a)
At any time on or after [●], the Company shall have the right to accelerate any or all Warrants at any time by causing them to
expire at the close of business on the day next preceding a specified date (the “Acceleration Date”), if the Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of the Common
Stock equals or exceeds [●] percent ([●]%) of the then effective Warrant Price on any twenty Trading Days (as hereinafter defined) within a period of thirty
consecutive Trading Days ending no more than five Trading Days prior to the date on which the Company gives notice to the Warrant Agent of its election to
accelerate the Warrants.
(b)
“Market Price” for each Trading Day shall be, if the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading on any registered national
securities exchange, the last reported sale price, regular way (or, if no such price is reported, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices, regular
way) of Common Stock, in either case as reported on the principal registered national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to
trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any registered national securities exchange, the average of the closing high bid and low asked prices as reported
on the OTC Bulletin Board operated by FINRA, or if not available on the OTC Bulletin Board, then the average of the closing high bid and low asked prices as
reported on any other U.S. quotation medium or inter-dealer quotation system, or if on any such date the shares of Common Stock are not listed or admitted to
trading on a registered national securities exchange, are not included in the OTC Bulletin Board, and are not quoted on any other U.S. quotation medium or
inter-dealer quotation system, the  average of the  closing bid and  asked prices  as  furnished by  any FINRA member firm selected  from time to time  by the
Company for that purpose. “Trading Day” shall be each Monday through Friday, other than any day on which securities are not traded in the system or on the
exchange that is the principal market for the Common Stock, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company.

Notice of an acceleration specifying the Acceleration Date shall be sent by mail first class, postage prepaid, to each registered
holder of a Warrant Certificate representing a Warrant accelerated at such holder’s address appearing on the books of the Warrant Agent not more than sixty
days nor less than thirty days before the Acceleration Date. Such notice of an acceleration also shall be given no more than twenty days, and no less than ten
days,  prior  to  the  mailing  of  notice  to  registered  holders  of  Warrants  pursuant  to  this  Section 3.6,  by  publication  at  least  once  in  a  newspaper  of  general
circulation in the City of New York.

Any Warrant accelerated may be exercised until [●] p.m., [City] time, on the business day next preceding the Acceleration Date.
ARTICLE 4
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER OF WARRANT CERTIFICATES
4.1
Exchange  And  Transfer  Of  Warrant  Certificates. Upon  surrender  at  the  corporate  trust  office  of  the  Warrant  Agent,  Warrant
Certificates evidencing Warrants may be exchanged for Warrant Certificates in other denominations evidencing such Warrants or the transfer thereof may be
registered in whole or in part; provided that such other Warrant Certificates evidence Warrants for the same aggregate number of Warrant Securities as the
Warrant Certificates so surrendered. The Warrant Agent shall keep, at its corporate trust office, books in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may
prescribe, it shall register Warrant Certificates and exchanges and transfers of outstanding Warrant Certificates, upon surrender of the Warrant Certificates to the
Warrant Agent at its corporate trust office for exchange or registration of transfer, properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of registration
of  transfer  and  written  instructions  for  transfer,  all  in  form  satisfactory  to  the  Company  and  the  Warrant  Agent.  No  service  charge  shall  be  made  for  any
exchange or registration of transfer of Warrant Certificates, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax or other
governmental  charge  that  may  be  imposed  in  connection  with  any  such  exchange  or  registration  of  transfer.  Whenever  any  Warrant  Certificates  are  so
surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer, an authorized officer of the Warrant Agent shall manually countersign and deliver to the person or persons
entitled thereto a Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates duly authorized and executed by the Company, as so requested. The Warrant Agent shall not be
required to effect any exchange or registration of transfer which will result in the issuance of a Warrant Certificate evidencing a Warrant for a fraction of a
Warrant Security or a number of Warrants for a whole number of Warrant Securities and a fraction of a Warrant Security. All Warrant Certificates issued upon
any exchange or registration of transfer of Warrant Certificates shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same obligations and entitled to
the same benefits under this Agreement as the Warrant Certificate surrendered for such exchange or registration of transfer.
4.2
Treatment Of Holders Of Warrant Certificates. The Company, the Warrant Agent and all other persons may treat the registered holder
of a Warrant Certificate as the absolute owner thereof for any purpose and as the person entitled to exercise the rights represented by the Warrants evidenced
thereby, any notice to the contrary notwithstanding.
4.3
Cancellation  Of  Warrant  Certificates. Any  Warrant  Certificate  surrendered  for  exchange,  registration  of  transfer  or  exercise  of  the
Warrants evidenced thereby shall, if surrendered to the Company, be delivered to the Warrant Agent and all Warrant Certificates surrendered or so delivered to
the Warrant Agent shall be promptly canceled by the Warrant Agent and shall not be reissued and, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, no Warrant
Certificate shall be issued hereunder in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof. The Warrant Agent shall deliver to the Company from time to time or otherwise
dispose of canceled Warrant Certificates in a manner satisfactory to the Company.

GRAN TIERRA ENERGY INC.
PREFERRED STOCK WARRANT AGREEMENT
THIS PREFERRED STOCK WARRANT AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), dated as of [●], between GRAN TIERRA ENERGY INC., a Nevada corporation
(the “Company”) and [●], a [corporation] [national banking association] organized and existing under the laws of [●] and having a corporate trust office in [●],
as warrant agent (the “Warrant Agent”).
WHEREAS,  the  Company  proposes  to  sell  [If  Warrants  are  sold  with  other  securities — [title  of  such  other  securities  being  offered]  (the  “Other
Securities”) with] warrant certificates evidencing one or more warrants (the “Warrants” or, individually, a “Warrant”) representing the right to purchase [title
of Preferred Stock purchasable through exercise of Warrants] (the “Warrant Securities”), such warrant certificates and other warrant certificates issued pursuant
to this Agreement being herein called the “Warrant Certificates”; and
WHEREAS, the Company desires the Warrant Agent to act on behalf of the Company, and the Warrant Agent is willing so to act, in connection with the
issuance, registration, transfer, exchange, exercise and replacement of the Warrant Certificates, and in this Agreement wishes to set forth, among other things,
the form and provisions of the Warrant Certificates and the terms and conditions on which they may be issued, registered, transferred, exchanged, exercised and
replaced.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1
ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS AND EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY OF WARRANT CERTIFICATES
1.1           Issuance Of Warrants. [If Warrants alone —Upon issuance, each Warrant Certificate shall evidence one or more Warrants.] [If Other
Securities and Warrants —Warrant Certificates will be issued in connection with the issuance of the Other Securities but shall be separately transferable and
each Warrant Certificate shall evidence one or more Warrants.] Each Warrant evidenced thereby shall represent the right, subject to the provisions contained
herein and therein, to purchase one Warrant Security. [If Other Securities and Warrants —Warrant Certificates will be issued with the Other Securities and
each Warrant Certificate will evidence [●] Warrants for each [$[●] principal amount] [[●] shares] of Other Securities issued.]
1.2           Execution And Delivery Of Warrant Certificates. Each Warrant Certificate, whenever issued, shall be in registered form substantially in
the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, shall be dated the date of its countersignature by the Warrant Agent and may have such letters, numbers, or other marks
of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements printed, lithographed or engraved thereon as the officers of the Company executing the same
may approve (execution thereof to be conclusive evidence of such approval) and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be
required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any securities exchange on which the
Warrants  may  be  listed,  or  to  conform  to  usage.  The  Warrant  Certificates  shall  be  signed  on  behalf  of  the  Company  by  any  of  its  present  or  future  chief
executive officers, presidents, senior vice presidents, vice presidents, chief financial officers, chief legal officers, treasurers, assistant treasurers, controllers,
assistant controllers, secretaries or assistant secretaries under its corporate seal reproduced thereon. Such signatures may be manual or facsimile signatures of
such authorized officers and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Warrant Certificates. The seal of the Company may be in the form of a facsimile
thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Warrant Certificates.
No Warrant Certificate shall be valid for any purpose, and no Warrant evidenced thereby shall be exercisable, until such Warrant Certificate has been
countersigned by the manual signature of the Warrant Agent. Such signature by the Warrant Agent upon any Warrant Certificate executed by the Company shall
be conclusive evidence that the Warrant Certificate so countersigned has been duly issued hereunder.
In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Warrant Certificates either manually or by facsimile signature shall cease to be
such officer before the Warrant Certificates so signed shall have been countersigned and delivered by the Warrant Agent, such Warrant Certificates may be
countersigned and delivered notwithstanding that the person who signed such Warrant Certificates ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Warrant
Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Warrant Certificate, shall be the proper
officers of the Company, although at the date of the execution of this Agreement any such person was not such officer.
The term “holder” or “holder of a Warrant Certificate” as used herein shall mean any person in whose name at the time any Warrant Certificate shall
be registered upon the books to be maintained by the Warrant Agent for that purpose.
1.3           Issuance  Of  Warrant  Certificates.  Warrant  Certificates  evidencing  the  right  to  purchase  Warrant  Securities  may  be  executed  by  the
Company and delivered to the Warrant Agent upon the execution of this Warrant Agreement or from time to time thereafter. The Warrant Agent shall, upon
receipt of Warrant Certificates duly executed on behalf of the Company, countersign such Warrant Certificates and shall deliver such Warrant Certificates to or
upon the order of the Company.
ARTICLE 2
WARRANT PRICE, DURATION AND EXERCISE OF WARRANTS
2.1
Warrant  Price.  During  the  period  specified  in  Section 2.2,  each  Warrant  shall,  subject  to  the  terms  of  this  Warrant  Agreement  and  the
applicable Warrant Certificate, entitle the holder thereof to purchase the number of Warrant Securities specified in the applicable Warrant Certificate at an
exercise  price  of  $[●]  per  Warrant  Security,  subject  to  adjustment  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events,  as  hereinafter  provided.  Such  purchase  price  per
Warrant Security is referred to in this Agreement as the “Warrant Price.”
2.2           Duration Of Warrants. Each Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part at any time, as specified herein, on or after [the date thereof] [●]
and at or before [●] p.m., [City] time, on [●] or such later date as the Company may designate by notice to the Warrant Agent and the holders of Warrant
Certificates mailed to their addresses as set forth in the record books of the Warrant Agent (the “Expiration Date”). Each Warrant not exercised at or before [●]
p.m.,  [City]  time,  on  the  Expiration  Date  shall  become  void,  and  all  rights  of  the  holder  of  the  Warrant  Certificate  evidencing  such  Warrant  under  this
Agreement shall cease.
2
2.3
Exercise Of Warrants.
(a)           During the period specified in Section 2.2, the Warrants may be exercised to purchase a whole number of Warrant Securities in
registered form by providing certain information as set forth on the reverse side of the Warrant Certificate and by paying in full, in lawful money of the United
States of America, [in cash or by certified check or official bank check in New York Clearing House funds] [by bank wire transfer in immediately available
funds]  the  Warrant  Price  for  each  Warrant  Security  with  respect  to  which  a  Warrant  is  being  exercised  to  the  Warrant  Agent  at  its  corporate  trust  office,
provided that such exercise is subject to receipt within five business days of such payment by the Warrant Agent of the Warrant Certificate with the form of
election  to  purchase  Warrant  Securities  set  forth  on  the  reverse  side  of  the  Warrant  Certificate  properly  completed  and  duly  executed.  The  date  on  which
payment in full of the Warrant Price is received by the Warrant Agent shall, subject to receipt of the Warrant Certificate as aforesaid, be deemed to be the date
on which the Warrant is exercised; provided, however, that if, at the date of receipt of such Warrant Certificates and payment in full of the Warrant Price, the
transfer books for the Warrant Securities purchasable upon the exercise of such Warrants shall be closed, no such receipt of such Warrant Certificates and no
such payment of such Warrant Price shall be effective to constitute the person so designated to be named as the holder of record of such Warrant Securities on
such date, but shall be effective to constitute such person as the holder of record of such Warrant Securities for all purposes at the opening of business on the
next succeeding day on which the transfer books for the Warrant Securities purchasable upon the exercise of such Warrants shall be opened, and the certificates
for the Warrant Securities in respect of which such Warrants are then exercised shall be issuable as of the date on such next succeeding day on which the
transfer books shall next be opened, and until such date the Company shall be under no duty to deliver any certificate for such Warrant Securities. The Warrant
Agent shall deposit all funds received by it in payment of the Warrant Price in an account of the Company maintained with it and shall advise the Company by
telephone at the end of each day on which a payment for the exercise of Warrants is received of the amount so deposited to its account. The Warrant Agent shall
promptly confirm such telephone advice to the Company in writing.
(b)           The Warrant Agent shall, from time to time, as promptly as practicable, advise the Company of (i) the number of Warrant Securities
with respect to which Warrants were exercised, (ii) the instructions of each holder of the Warrant Certificates evidencing such Warrants with respect to delivery
of  the  Warrant  Securities  to  which  such  holder  is  entitled  upon  such  exercise,  (iii)  delivery  of  Warrant  Certificates  evidencing  the  balance,  if  any,  of  the
Warrants for the remaining Warrant Securities after such exercise, and (iv) such other information as the Company shall reasonably require.
(c)           As soon as practicable after the exercise of any Warrant, the Company shall issue to or upon the order of the holder of the Warrant
Certificate evidencing such Warrant, the Warrant Securities to which such holder is entitled, in fully registered form, registered in such name or names as may
be directed by such holder. If fewer than all of the Warrants evidenced by such Warrant Certificate are exercised, the Company shall execute, and an authorized
officer  of the  Warrant Agent shall manually  countersign and deliver, a new  Warrant Certificate  evidencing Warrants for the number  of Warrant  Securities
remaining unexercised.
(d)           The Company shall not be required to pay any stamp or other tax or other governmental charge required to be paid in connection
with any transfer involved in the issue of the Warrant Securities, and in the event that any such transfer is involved, the Company shall not be required to issue
or deliver any Warrant Security until such tax or other charge shall have been paid or it has been established to the Company’s satisfaction that no such tax or
other charge is due.
keep reserved, out of its authorized but unissued Warrant Securities, a number of shares sufficient to provide for the exercise of the Warrants.
(e)           Prior to the issuance of any Warrants there shall have been reserved, and the Company shall at all times through the Expiration Date
ARTICLE 3
OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF
WARRANT CERTIFICATES
3.1           No Rights As Warrant Securityholder Conferred By Warrants Or Warrant Certificates. No Warrant Certificate or Warrant evidenced
thereby shall entitle the holder thereof to any of the rights of a holder of Warrant Securities, including, without limitation, the right to receive the payment of
dividends or distributions, if any, on the Warrant Securities or to exercise any voting rights, except to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement or the
applicable Warrant Certificate.

3.2           Lost, Stolen, Mutilated Or Destroyed Warrant Certificates. Upon receipt by the Warrant Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it
and the Company of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Warrant Certificate and/or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the
Warrant Agent and the Company and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender of the mutilated Warrant Certificate to the Warrant Agent for cancellation, then,
in the absence of notice to the Company or the Warrant Agent that such Warrant Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall
execute, and an authorized officer of the Warrant Agent shall manually countersign and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated Warrant Certificate, a new Warrant Certificate of the same tenor and evidencing Warrants for a like number of Warrant Securities. Upon the issuance
of any new Warrant Certificate under this Section 3.2, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Warrant Agent) in connection therewith. Every substitute
Warrant Certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this Section 3.2 in lieu of any lost, stolen or destroyed Warrant Certificate shall represent an additional
contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Warrant Certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Warrant Certificates duly executed and delivered hereunder. The
provisions of this Section 3.2 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement of mutilated,
lost, stolen or destroyed Warrant Certificates.
3.3           Holder Of Warrant Certificate May Enforce Rights. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement, any holder of a Warrant
Certificate, without the consent of the Warrant Agent, the holder of any Warrant Securities or the holder of any other Warrant Certificate, may, in such holder’s
own behalf and for such holder’s own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company suitable to enforce, or
otherwise in respect of, such holder’s right to exercise the Warrants evidenced by such holder’s Warrant Certificate in the manner provided in such holder’s
Warrant Certificate and in this Agreement.
3.4           Adjustments.
(a)           In case the Company shall at any time subdivide its outstanding shares of [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through exercise of
Warrants] into a greater number of shares, the Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced and the number of
Warrant Securities purchasable under the Warrants shall be proportionately increased. Conversely, in case the outstanding shares of [title of Preferred Stock
purchasable through exercise of Warrants] of the Company shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to
such combination shall be proportionately increased and the number of Warrant Securities purchasable under the Warrants shall be proportionately decreased.
(b)           If at any time or from time to time the holders of [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through exercise of Warrants] (or any shares
of  stock  or  other  securities  at  the  time  receivable  upon  the  exercise  of  the  Warrants)  shall  have  received  or  become  entitled  to  receive,  without  payment
therefore,

any time directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through exercise of Warrants], or any rights or options
to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any of the foregoing by way of dividend or other distribution;
exercise of Warrants] or otherwise than as a cash dividend paid or payable out of the Company’s current or retained earnings;
(ii)          any  cash  paid  or  payable  otherwise  than  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  [title  of  Preferred  Stock  purchasable  through
(iii)         any evidence of the Company’s indebtedness or rights to subscribe for or purchase the Company’s indebtedness; or
(iv)         [title  of  Preferred  Stock  purchasable  through  exercise  of  Warrants]  or  additional  stock  or  other  securities  or  property
(including cash) by way of spinoff, split-up, reclassification, combination of shares or similar corporate rearrangement (other than shares of [title of Preferred
Stock purchasable through exercise of Warrants] issued as a stock split or adjustments in respect of which shall be covered by the terms of Section 3.4(a)
above), then and in each such case, the holder of each Warrant shall, upon the exercise of the Warrant, be entitled to receive, in addition to the number of
Warrant Securities receivable thereupon, and without payment of any additional consideration therefore, the amount of stock and other securities and property
(including cash and indebtedness or rights to subscribe for or purchase indebtedness) which such holder would hold on the date of such exercise had he been the
holder of record of such Warrant Securities as of the date on which holders of [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through exercise of Warrants] received or
became entitled to receive such shares or all other additional stock and other securities and property.

(c)           In case of (i) any reclassification, capital reorganization, or change in the [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through the exercise
of the Warrants] of the Company (other than as a result of a subdivision, combination or stock dividend provided for in Section 3.4(a) or Section 3.4(b) above),
(ii) share  exchange,  merger  or  similar  transaction  of  the  Company  with  or  into  another  person  or  entity  (other  than  a  share  exchange,  merger  or  similar
transaction in which the Company is the acquiring or surviving corporation and which does not result in any change in the [title of Preferred Stock purchasable
through the exercise of the Warrants] other than the issuance of additional shares of [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through the exercise of the Warrants])
or (iii) the sale, exchange, lease, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company as an entirety (in any such
case, a “Reorganization Event”), then, as a condition of such Reorganization Event, lawful provisions shall be made, and duly executed documents evidencing
the same from the Company or its successor shall be delivered to the holders of the Warrants, so that the holders of the Warrants shall have the right at any time
prior to the expiration of the Warrants to purchase, at a total price equal to that payable upon the exercise of the Warrants, the kind and amount of shares of
stock and other securities and property receivable in connection with such Reorganization Event by a holder of the same number of shares of [title of Preferred
Stock purchasable through the exercise of the Warrants] as were purchasable by the holders of the Warrants immediately prior to such Reorganization Event. In
any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the holders of the Warrants so that the provisions hereof shall
thereafter be applicable with respect to any shares of stock or other securities and property deliverable upon exercise the Warrants, and appropriate adjustments
shall be made to the Warrant Price payable hereunder provided the aggregate purchase price shall remain the same. In the case of any transaction described in
clauses (ii)  and  (iii)  above,  the  Company  shall  thereupon  be  relieved  of  any  further  obligation  hereunder  or  under  the  Warrants,  and  the  Company  as  the
predecessor corporation may thereupon or at any time thereafter be dissolved, wound up or liquidated. Such successor or assuming entity thereupon may cause
to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company, any or all of the Warrants issuable hereunder which heretofore shall not have
been  signed  by  the  Company,  and  may  execute  and  deliver  securities  in  its  own  name,  in  fulfillment  of  its  obligations  to  deliver  Warrant  Securities  upon
exercise of the Warrants. All the Warrants so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Agreement as the Warrants theretofore
or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as though all of such Warrants had been issued at the date of the execution hereof. In any
case of any such Reorganization Event, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Warrants thereafter to be issued as may
be appropriate. The Warrant Agent may receive a written opinion of legal counsel as conclusive evidence that any such Reorganization Event complies with the
provisions of this Section 3.4.
(d)           The Company may, at its option, at any time until the Expiration Date, reduce the then current Warrant Price to any amount deemed
appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company for any period not exceeding twenty consecutive days (as evidenced in a resolution adopted by such
Board of Directors), but only upon giving the notices required by Section 3.5 at least ten days prior to taking such action.

(f)            No fractional Warrant Securities shall be issued upon the exercise of Warrants. If more than one Warrant shall be exercised at one
time by the same holder, the number of full Warrant Securities which shall be issuable upon such exercise shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate
number of Warrant Securities purchased pursuant to the Warrants so exercised. Instead of any fractional Warrant Security which would otherwise be issuable
upon exercise of any Warrant, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the last reported
sale price (or bid price if there were no sales) per Warrant Security, in either case as reported on the principal registered national securities exchange on which
the Warrant Securities are listed or admitted to trading on the business day that next precedes the day of exercise or, if the Warrant Securities are not then listed
or admitted to trading on any registered national securities exchange, the average of the closing high bid and low asked prices as reported on the OTC Bulletin
Board Service (the “OTC Bulletin Board”) operated by The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) or, if not available on the OTC Bulletin Board, then
the average of the closing high bid and low asked prices as reported on any other U.S. quotation medium or inter-dealer quotation system on such date, or if on
any such date the Warrant Securities are not listed or admitted to trading on a registered national securities exchange, are not included in the OTC Bulletin
Board, and are not quoted on any other U.S. quotation medium or inter-dealer quotation system, an amount equal to the same fraction of the average of the
closing bid and asked prices as furnished by any Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) member firm selected from time to time by the
Company for that purpose at the close of business on the business day that next precedes the day of exercise.
(g)           Whenever the Warrant Price then in effect is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall mail to each holder of the Warrants at
such holder’s address as it shall appear on the books of the Company a statement setting forth the adjusted Warrant Price then and thereafter effective under the
provisions hereof, together with the facts, in reasonable detail, upon which such adjustment is based.
3.5           Notice To Warrantholders. In case the Company shall (a) effect any dividend or distribution described in Section 3.4(b), (b) effect any
Reorganization Event, (c) make any distribution on or in respect of the [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through the exercise of the Warrants] in connection
with the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, or (d) reduce the then current Warrant Price pursuant to Section 3.4(d), then the Company shall
mail to each holder of Warrants at such holder’s address as it shall appear on the books of the Warrant Agent, at least ten days prior to the applicable date
hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the record date for such dividend or distribution, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of
record of [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through the exercise of Warrants] that will be entitled to such dividend or distribution are to be determined,
(y) the date on which such Reorganization Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected
that holders of [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through the exercise of the Warrants] of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of [title of Preferred
Stock purchasable through the exercise of the Warrants] for securities or other property deliverable upon such Reorganization Event, dissolution, liquidation or
winding up, or (z) the first date on which the then current Warrant Price shall be reduced pursuant to Section 3.4(d). No failure to mail such notice nor any
defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect any such transaction or any adjustment in the Warrant Price required by Section 3.4.
3.6           [If The Warrants Are Subject To Acceleration By The Company, Insert—Acceleration Of Warrants By The Company.]
(a)           At any time on or after [●], the Company shall have the right to accelerate any or all Warrants at any time by causing them to expire
at the close of business on the day next preceding a specified date (the “Acceleration Date”), if the Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of the [title of Preferred
Stock purchasable through the exercise of the Warrants] equals or exceeds [●] percent ([●]%) of the then effective Warrant Price on any twenty Trading Days
(as hereinafter defined) within a period of thirty consecutive Trading Days ending no more than five Trading Days prior to the date on which the Company
gives notice to the Warrant Agent of its election to accelerate the Warrants.
(b)           “Market Price” for each Trading Day shall be, if the [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through the exercise of the Warrants] is
listed or admitted to trading on any registered national securities exchange, the last reported sale price, regular way (or, if no such price is reported, the average
of  the  reported  closing  bid  and  asked  prices,  regular  way)  of  [title  of  Preferred  Stock  purchasable  through  the  exercise  of  the  Warrants],  in  either  case  as
reported on the principal registered national securities exchange on which the [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through the exercise of the Warrants] is listed
or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any registered national securities exchange, the average of the closing high bid and low asked
prices as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board operated by NASDAQ, or if not available on the OTC Bulletin Board, then the average of the closing high bid and
low asked prices as reported on any other U.S. quotation medium or inter-dealer quotation system, or if on any such date the shares of [title of Preferred Stock
purchasable through the exercise of the Warrants] are not listed or admitted to trading on a registered national securities exchange, are not included in the OTC
Bulletin Board, and are not quoted on any other U.S. quotation medium or inter-dealer quotation system, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as
furnished by any FINRA member firm selected from time to time by the Company for that purpose. “Trading Day” shall be each Monday through Friday, other
than any day on which securities are not traded in the system or on the exchange that is the principal market for the [title of Preferred Stock purchasable through
the exercise of the Warrants], as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company.

pro rata or in such other manner as it deems, in its discretion, to be fair and appropriate.
(c)           In the event of an acceleration of less than all of the Warrants, the Warrant Agent shall select the Warrants to be accelerated by lot,
(d)           Notice of an acceleration specifying the Acceleration Date shall be sent by mail first class, postage prepaid, to each registered holder
of a Warrant Certificate representing a Warrant accelerated at such holder’s address appearing on the books of the Warrant Agent not more than sixty days nor
less than thirty days before the Acceleration Date. Such notice of an acceleration also shall be given no more than twenty days, and no less than ten days, prior
to the mailing of notice to registered holders of Warrants pursuant to this Section 3.6, by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City of New York.

ARTICLE 4
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER OF WARRANT CERTIFICATES
4.1           Exchange And Transfer Of Warrant Certificates. Upon surrender at the corporate trust office of the Warrant Agent, Warrant Certificates
evidencing Warrants may be exchanged for Warrant Certificates in other denominations evidencing such Warrants or the transfer thereof may be registered in
whole  or  in  part;  provided  that  such  other  Warrant  Certificates  evidence  Warrants  for  the  same  aggregate  number  of  Warrant  Securities  as  the  Warrant
Certificates  so  surrendered.  The  Warrant  Agent  shall  keep,  at  its  corporate  trust  office,  books  in  which,  subject  to  such  reasonable  regulations  as  it  may
prescribe, it shall register Warrant Certificates and exchanges and transfers of outstanding Warrant Certificates, upon surrender of the Warrant Certificates to the
Warrant Agent at its corporate trust office for exchange or registration of transfer, properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of registration
of  transfer  and  written  instructions  for  transfer,  all  in  form  satisfactory  to  the  Company  and  the  Warrant  Agent.  No  service  charge  shall  be  made  for  any
exchange or registration of transfer of Warrant Certificates, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax or other
governmental  charge  that  may  be  imposed  in  connection  with  any  such  exchange  or  registration  of  transfer.  Whenever  any  Warrant  Certificates  are  so
surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer, an authorized officer of the Warrant Agent shall manually countersign and deliver to the person or persons
entitled thereto a Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates duly authorized and executed by the Company, as so requested. The Warrant Agent shall not be
required to effect any exchange or registration of transfer which will result in the issuance of a Warrant Certificate evidencing a Warrant for a fraction of a
Warrant Security or a number of Warrants for a whole number of Warrant Securities and a fraction of a Warrant Security. All Warrant Certificates issued upon
any exchange or registration of transfer of Warrant Certificates shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same obligations and entitled to
the same benefits under this Agreement as the Warrant Certificate surrendered for such exchange or registration of transfer.
4.2           Treatment Of Holders Of Warrant Certificates. The Company, the Warrant Agent and all other persons may treat the registered holder of
a Warrant Certificate as the absolute owner thereof for any purpose and as the person entitled to exercise the rights represented by the Warrants evidenced
thereby, any notice to the contrary notwithstanding.
4.3           Cancellation  Of  Warrant  Certificates.  Any  Warrant  Certificate  surrendered  for  exchange,  registration  of  transfer  or  exercise  of  the
Warrants evidenced thereby shall, if surrendered to the Company, be delivered to the Warrant Agent and all Warrant Certificates surrendered or so delivered to
the Warrant Agent shall be promptly canceled by the Warrant Agent and shall not be reissued and, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, no Warrant
Certificate shall be issued hereunder in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof. The Warrant Agent shall deliver to the Company from time to time or otherwise
dispose of canceled Warrant Certificates in a manner satisfactory to the Company.

the date on which its desired resignation shall become effective; provided that such date shall not be less than three months after the date on which such notice is
given unless the Company otherwise agrees. The Warrant Agent hereunder may be removed at any time by the filing with it of an instrument in writing signed

upon the appointment by the Company, as hereinafter provided, of a successor Warrant Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company authorized under the

obligation of the Company under Section 5.2(a) shall continue to the extent set forth therein notwithstanding the resignation or removal of the Warrant Agent.

This certifies that [●] or registered assigns is the registered owner of the above indicated number of Warrants, each Warrant entitling such owner to
purchase, at any time [after [●] p.m., [City] time, on [●] and] on or before [●] p.m., [City] time, on [●] shares of [Title of Warrant Securities] (the “Warrant
Securities”), of Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (the “Company”) on the following basis: during the period from [●], through and including [●], the exercise price per

exercise the Warrants evidenced hereby by providing certain information set forth on the back hereof and by paying in full, in lawful money of the United States
of America, [in cash or by certified check or official bank check in New York Clearing House funds] [by bank wire transfer in immediately available funds], the
Warrant Price for each Warrant Security with respect to which this Warrant is exercised to the Warrant Agent (as hereinafter defined) and by surrendering this
Warrant Certificate, with the purchase form on the back hereof duly executed, at the corporate trust office of [name of Warrant Agent], or its successor as
warrant agent (the “Warrant Agent”), which is, on the date hereof, at the address specified on the reverse hereof, and upon compliance with and subject to the
conditions set forth herein and in the Warrant Agreement (as hereinafter defined).
The term “Holder” as used herein shall mean the person in whose name at the time this Warrant Certificate shall be registered upon the books to be
maintained by the Warrant Agent for that purpose pursuant to Section 4 of the Warrant Agreement.
The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate may be exercised to purchase a whole number of Warrant Securities in registered form. Upon any

Company and the Warrant Agent and is subject to the terms and provisions contained in the Warrant Agreement, to all of which terms and provisions the Holder

DATED AS OF __________
GRAN TIERRA ENERGY INC.
DEBT SECURITIES WARRANT AGREEMENT
THIS DEBT SECURITIES WARRANT AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), dated as of [●], between GRAN TIERRA ENERGY INC., a Nevada corporation (the
“Company”) and [●], a [corporation] [national banking association] organized and existing under the laws of [●] and having a corporate trust office in [●], as
warrant agent (the “Warrant Agent”).
WHEREAS, the Company has entered into an indenture dated as of [●] (the “Indenture”), with [●], as trustee (such trustee, and any successors to such
trustee, herein called the “Trustee”), providing for the issuance from time to time of its debt securities, to be issued in one or more series as provided in the
Indenture (the “Debt Securities”);
WHEREAS,  the  Company  proposes  to  sell  [If  Warrants  are  sold  with  other  securities — title  of  such  other  securities  being  offered]  (the  “Other
Securities”) with] warrant certificates evidencing one or more warrants (the “Warrants” or, individually, a “Warrant”) representing the right to purchase [title
of Debt Securities purchasable through exercise of Warrants] (the “Warrant Debt Securities”), such warrant certificates and other warrant certificates issued
pursuant to this Agreement being herein called the “Warrant Certificates”; and
WHEREAS, the Company desires the Warrant Agent to act on behalf of the Company, and the Warrant Agent is willing so to act, in connection with the
issuance, registration, transfer, exchange, exercise and replacement of the Warrant Certificates, and in this Agreement wishes to set forth, among other things,
the form and provisions of the Warrant Certificates and the terms and conditions on which they may be issued, registered, transferred, exchanged, exercised and
replaced.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1
ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS AND EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY OF WARRANT CERTIFICATES
1.1
Issuance Of Warrants. [If Warrants alone — Upon issuance, each Warrant Certificate shall evidence one or more Warrants.] [If Other
Securities and Warrants — Warrant Certificates will be issued in connection with the issuance of the Other Securities but shall be separately transferable and
each Warrant Certificate shall evidence one or more Warrants.] Each Warrant evidenced thereby shall represent the right, subject to the provisions contained
herein and therein, to purchase one Warrant Debt Security. [If Other Securities and Warrants — Warrant Certificates will be issued with the Other Securities
and each Warrant Certificate will evidence [●] Warrants for each [$[●] principal amount] [[●] shares] of Other Securities issued.]
1
1.2
Execution And Delivery Of Warrant Certificates. Each Warrant Certificate, whenever issued, shall be in registered form substantially in
the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, shall be dated the date of its countersignature by the Warrant Agent and may have such letters, numbers, or other marks
of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements printed, lithographed or engraved thereon as the officers of the Company executing the same
may approve (execution thereof to be conclusive evidence of such approval) and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be
required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any securities exchange on which the
Warrants  may  be  listed,  or  to  conform  to  usage.  The  Warrant  Certificates  shall  be  signed  on  behalf  of  the  Company  by  any  of  its  present  or  future  chief
executive officers, presidents, senior vice presidents, vice presidents, chief financial officers, chief legal officers, treasurers, assistant treasurers, controllers,
assistant controllers, secretaries or assistant secretaries under its corporate seal reproduced thereon. Such signatures may be manual or facsimile signatures of
such authorized officers and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Warrant Certificates. The seal of the Company may be in the form of a facsimile
thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Warrant Certificates.
No Warrant Certificate shall be valid for any purpose, and no Warrant evidenced thereby shall be exercisable, until such Warrant Certificate has been
countersigned by the manual signature of the Warrant Agent. Such signature by the Warrant Agent upon any Warrant Certificate executed by the Company shall
be conclusive evidence that the Warrant Certificate so countersigned has been duly issued hereunder.
In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Warrant Certificates either manually or by facsimile signature shall cease to be
such officer before the Warrant Certificates so signed shall have been countersigned and delivered by the Warrant Agent, such Warrant Certificates may be
countersigned and delivered notwithstanding that the person who signed such Warrant Certificates ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Warrant
Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Warrant Certificate, shall be the proper
officers of the Company, although at the date of the execution of this Agreement any such person was not such officer.
The term “holder” or “holder of a Warrant Certificate” as used herein shall mean any person in whose name at the time any Warrant Certificate shall be
registered upon the books to be maintained by the Warrant Agent for that purpose.
1.3
Issuance Of Warrant Certificates. Warrant Certificates evidencing the right to purchase Warrant Debt Securities may be executed by the
Company and delivered to the Warrant Agent upon the execution of this Warrant Agreement or from time to time thereafter. The Warrant Agent shall, upon
receipt of Warrant Certificates duly executed on behalf of the Company, countersign such Warrant Certificates and shall deliver such Warrant Certificates to or
upon the order of the Company.
ARTICLE 2
WARRANT PRICE, DURATION AND EXERCISE OF WARRANTS
2.1
Warrant  Price.  During  the  period  specified  in  Section 2.2,  each  Warrant  shall,  subject  to  the  terms  of  this  Warrant  Agreement  and  the
applicable  Warrant  Certificate,  entitle  the  holder  thereof,  to  purchase  the  principal  amount  of  Warrant  Debt  Securities  specified  in  the  applicable  Warrant
Certificate at an exercise price of [●]% of the principal amount thereof [plus accrued amortization, if any, of the original issue discount of the Warrant Debt
Securities] [plus accrued interest, if any, from the most recent date from which interest shall have been paid on the Warrant Debt Securities or, if no interest
shall have been paid on the Warrant Debt Securities, from the date of their initial issuance.] [The original issue discount ($[●] for each $1,000 principal amount
of Warrant Debt Securities) will be amortized at a [●]% annual rate, computed on a[n] [semi-] annual basis [using a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months].] Such purchase price for the Warrant Debt Securities is referred to in this Agreement as the “Warrant Price.”
2.2           Duration Of Warrants. Each Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part at any time, as specified herein, on or after [the date thereof] [●]
and at or before [●] p.m., [City] time, on [●] or such later date as the Company may designate by notice to the Warrant Agent and the holders of Warrant
Certificates mailed to their addresses as set forth in the record books of the Warrant Agent (the “Expiration Date”). Each Warrant not exercised at or before [●]
p.m.,  [City]  time,  on  the  Expiration  Date  shall  become  void,  and  all  rights  of  the  holder  of  the  Warrant  Certificate  evidencing  such  Warrant  under  this
Agreement shall cease.
2
2.3           Exercise Of Warrants.
(a)           During the period specified in Section 2.2, the Warrants may be exercised to purchase a whole number of Warrant Debt Securities in
registered form by providing certain information as set forth on the reverse side of the Warrant Certificate and by paying in full, in lawful money of the United
States of America, [in cash or by certified check or official bank check in New York Clearing House funds] [by bank wire transfer in immediately available
funds] the Warrant Price for each Warrant Debt Security with respect to which a Warrant is being exercised to the Warrant Agent at its corporate trust office,
provided that such exercise is subject to receipt within five business days of such payment by the Warrant Agent of the Warrant Certificate with the form of
election to purchase Warrant Debt Securities set forth on the reverse side of the Warrant Certificate properly completed and duly executed. The date on which
payment in full of the Warrant Price is received by the Warrant Agent shall, subject to receipt of the Warrant Certificate as aforesaid, be deemed to be the date
on which the Warrant is exercised; provided, however, that if, at the date of receipt of such Warrant Certificates and payment in full of the Warrant Price, the
transfer books for the Warrant Debt Securities purchasable upon the exercise of such Warrants shall be closed, no such receipt of such Warrant Certificates and
no such payment of such Warrant Price shall be effective to constitute the person so designated to be named as the holder of record of such Warrant Debt
Securities on such date, but shall be effective to constitute such person as the holder of record of such Warrant Debt Securities for all purposes at the opening of
business on the next succeeding day on which the transfer books for the Warrant Debt Securities purchasable upon the exercise of such Warrants shall be
opened, and the certificates for the Warrant Debt Securities in respect of which such Warrants are then exercised shall be issuable as of the date on such next
succeeding day on which the transfer books shall next be opened, and until such date the Company shall be under no duty to deliver any certificate for such
Warrant Debt Securities. The Warrant Agent shall deposit all funds received by it in payment of the Warrant Price in an account of the Company maintained
with  it  and shall  advise  the  Company  by  telephone at the end  of each  day on  which a  payment  for  the  exercise  of Warrants  is  received of  the  amount  so
deposited to its account. The Warrant Agent shall promptly confirm such telephone advice to the Company in writing.
(b)
The Warrant Agent shall, from time to time, as promptly as practicable, advise the Company of (i) the number of Warrant Debt
Securities with respect to which Warrants were exercised, (ii) the instructions of each holder of the Warrant Certificates evidencing such Warrants with respect
to delivery of the Warrant Debt Securities to which such holder is entitled upon such exercise, (iii) delivery of Warrant Certificates evidencing the balance, if
any,  of  the  Warrants  for  the  remaining  Warrant  Debt  Securities  after  such  exercise,  and  (iv) such  other  information  as  the  Company  or  the  Trustee  shall
reasonably require.
(c)           As  soon  as  practicable  after  the  exercise  of  any  Warrant,  the  Company  shall  issue,  pursuant  to  the  Indenture,  in  authorized
denominations, to or upon the order of the holder of the Warrant Certificate evidencing such Warrant, the Warrant Debt Securities to which such holder is
entitled, in fully registered form, registered in such name or names as may be directed by such holder. If fewer than all of the Warrants evidenced by such
Warrant Certificate are exercised, the Company shall execute, and an authorized officer of the Warrant Agent shall manually countersign and deliver, a new
Warrant Certificate evidencing Warrants for the number of Warrant Debt Securities remaining unexercised.
(d)           The Company shall not be required to pay any stamp or other tax or other governmental charge required to be paid in connection
with any transfer involved in the issue of the Warrant Debt Securities, and in the event that any such transfer is involved, the Company shall not be required to
issue or deliver any Warrant Debt Securities until such tax or other charge shall have been paid or it has been established to the Company’s satisfaction that no
such tax or other charge is due.
keep reserved, out of its authorized but unissued Warrant Debt Securities, a number of shares sufficient to provide for the exercise of the Warrants.
(e)           Prior to the issuance of any Warrants there shall have been reserved, and the Company shall at all times through the Expiration Date

ARTICLE 3
OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF
WARRANT CERTIFICATES
3.1           No Rights As Holders of Warrant Debt Securities Conferred By Warrants or Warrant Certificates. No Warrant Certificate or Warrant
evidenced thereby shall entitle the holder thereof to any of the rights of a holder of Warrant Debt Securities, including, without limitation, the right to receive
the payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Warrant Debt Securities or to enforce any of the covenants in the Indenture.
3.2           Lost, Stolen, Mutilated Or Destroyed Warrant Certificates. Upon receipt by the Warrant Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it
and the Company of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Warrant Certificate and/or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the
Warrant Agent and the Company and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender of the mutilated Warrant Certificate to the Warrant Agent for cancellation, then,
in the absence of notice to the Company or the Warrant Agent that such Warrant Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall
execute, and an authorized officer of the Warrant Agent shall manually countersign and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated Warrant Certificate, a new Warrant Certificate of the same tenor and evidencing Warrants for a like principal amount of Warrant Debt Securities.
Upon the issuance of any new Warrant Certificate under this Section 3.2, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Warrant Agent) in connection
therewith. Every substitute Warrant Certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this Section 3.2 in lieu of any lost, stolen or destroyed Warrant Certificate
shall  represent  an  additional  contractual  obligation  of  the  Company,  whether  or  not  the  lost,  stolen  or  destroyed  Warrant  Certificate  shall  be  at  any  time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Warrant Certificates duly
executed and delivered hereunder. The provisions of this Section 3.2 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with
respect to the replacement of mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed Warrant Certificates.
3.3           Holder Of Warrant Certificate May Enforce Rights. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement, any holder of a Warrant
Certificate, without the consent of the Warrant Agent, the Trustee, the holder of any Warrant Debt Securities or the holder of any other Warrant Certificate,
may, in such holder’s own behalf and for such holder’s own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company
suitable  to  enforce,  or  otherwise  in  respect  of,  such  holder’s  right  to  exercise  the  Warrants  evidenced  by  such  holder’s  Warrant  Certificate  in  the  manner
provided in such holder’s Warrant Certificates and in this Agreement.
3.4           Merger, Sale, Conveyance or Lease. In case of (a) any share exchange, merger or similar transaction of the Company with or into another
person or entity (other than a share exchange, merger or similar transaction in which the Company is the acquiring or surviving corporation) or (b) the sale,
exchange,  lease,  transfer  or  other  disposition  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  properties  and  assets  of  the  Company  as  an  entirety  (in  any  such  case,  a
“Reorganization Event”), then, as a condition of such Reorganization Event, lawful provisions shall be made, and duly executed documents evidencing the
same  from  the  Company’s  successor  shall  be  delivered  to  the  holders  of  the  Warrants,  so  that  such  successor  shall  succeed  to  and  be  substituted  for  the
Company,  and  assume  all  the  Company’s  obligations  under,  this  Agreement  and  the  Warrants.  The  Company  shall  thereupon  be  relieved  of  any  further
obligation hereunder or under the Warrants, and the Company as the predecessor corporation may thereupon or at any time thereafter be dissolved, wound up or
liquidated. Such successor or assuming entity thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company, any or all
of the Warrants issuable hereunder which heretofore shall not have been signed by the Company, and may execute and deliver securities in its own name, in
fulfillment of its obligations to deliver Warrant Debt Securities upon exercise of the Warrants. All the Warrants so issued shall in all respects have the same
legal rank and benefit under this Agreement as the Warrants theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as though all of such
Warrants had been issued at the date of the execution hereof. In any case of any such Reorganization Event, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in
substance) may be made in the Warrants thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate. The Warrant Agent may receive a written opinion of legal counsel as
conclusive evidence that any such Reorganization Event complies with the provisions of this Section 3.4.
4
3.5           Notice to Warrantholders. In case the Company shall (a) effect any Reorganization Event or (b) make any distribution on or in respect of
the [title of Warrant Debt Securities] in connection with the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, then the Company shall mail to each holder
of Warrants at such holder’s address as it shall appear on the books of the Warrant Agent, at least ten days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a
notice stating the date on which such Reorganization Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is
expected that holders of [title of Warrant Debt Securities] of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of [title of Warrant Debt Securities] for securities
or other property deliverable upon such Reorganization Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. No failure to mail such notice nor any defect therein or in
the mailing thereof shall affect any such transaction.
ARTICLE 4
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER OF WARRANT CERTIFICATES
4.1           Exchange And Transfer Of Warrant Certificates. Upon surrender at the corporate trust office of the Warrant Agent, Warrant Certificates
evidencing Warrants may be exchanged for Warrant Certificates in other denominations evidencing such Warrants or the transfer thereof may be registered in
whole or in part; provided that such other Warrant Certificates evidence Warrants for the same aggregate principal amount of Warrant Debt Securities as the
Warrant Certificates so surrendered. The Warrant Agent shall keep, at its corporate trust office, books in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may
prescribe, it shall register Warrant Certificates and exchanges and transfers of outstanding Warrant Certificates, upon surrender of the Warrant Certificates to the
Warrant Agent at its corporate trust office for exchange or registration of transfer, properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of registration
of  transfer  and  written  instructions  for  transfer,  all  in  form  satisfactory  to  the  Company  and  the  Warrant  Agent.  No  service  charge  shall  be  made  for  any
exchange or registration of transfer of Warrant Certificates, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax or other
governmental  charge  that  may  be  imposed  in  connection  with  any  such  exchange  or  registration  of  transfer.  Whenever  any  Warrant  Certificates  are  so
surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer, an authorized officer of the Warrant Agent shall manually countersign and deliver to the person or persons
entitled thereto a Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates duly authorized and executed by the Company, as so requested. The Warrant Agent shall not be
required to effect any exchange or registration of transfer which will result in the issuance of a Warrant Certificate evidencing a Warrant for a fraction of a
Warrant  Debt  Security  or  a  number  of  Warrants  for  a  whole  number  of  Warrant  Debt  Securities  and  a  fraction  of  a  Warrant  Debt  Security.  All  Warrant
Certificates issued upon any exchange or registration of transfer of Warrant Certificates shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same
obligations and entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement as the Warrant Certificate surrendered for such exchange or registration of transfer.
4.2
Treatment Of Holders Of Warrant Certificates. The Company, the Warrant Agent and all other persons may treat the registered holder of
a Warrant Certificate as the absolute owner thereof for any purpose and as the person entitled to exercise the rights represented by the Warrants evidenced
thereby, any notice to the contrary notwithstanding.
4.3           Cancellation  Of  Warrant  Certificates.  Any  Warrant  Certificate  surrendered  for  exchange,  registration  of  transfer  or  exercise  of  the
Warrants evidenced thereby shall, if surrendered to the Company, be delivered to the Warrant Agent and all Warrant Certificates surrendered or so delivered to
the Warrant Agent shall be promptly canceled by the Warrant Agent and shall not be reissued and, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, no Warrant
Certificate shall be issued hereunder in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof. The Warrant Agent shall deliver to the Company from time to time or otherwise
dispose of canceled Warrant Certificates in a manner satisfactory to the Company.

Certificates or beneficial owners of Warrants.
(b)
(c)           Counsel.  The  Warrant  Agent  may  consult  with  counsel  satisfactory  to  it,  which  may  include  counsel  for  the  Company,  and  the

or they may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Company and may act on, or as depositary, trustee or agent for, any committee

the Company in the performance of its covenants or agreements contained herein or in the Warrant Certificates or in the case of the receipt of any written
demand from a holder of a Warrant Certificate with respect to such default, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any duty or responsibility

the date on which its desired resignation shall become effective; provided that such date shall not be less than three months after the date on which such notice is
given unless the Company otherwise agrees. The Warrant Agent hereunder may be removed at any time by the filing with it of an instrument in writing signed

Corporation  as  if  they  had  been  manually  signed  by  such  officer.  Notwithstanding  that  the  person  whose  manual  or  facsimile  signature  appears  on  any
Subscription  Receipt  Certificate  as  such  officer  may  no  longer  hold  such  position  at  the  date  of  such  Subscription  Receipt  Certificate  or  at  the  date  of

certification thereof) and the Subscription Receipt Agent shall in no respect be liable or answerable for the use made of the Subscription Receipt
Certificates  or  any  of  them  or  of  the  consideration  therefor  except  as  otherwise  specified  herein.  The  certification  by  or  on  behalf  of  the

compliance  with  Section  2.15,  the  Corporation  shall  issue  and  thereupon  the  Subscription  Receipt  Agent  shall  certify  and  deliver  a  new
Subscription Receipt Certificate of like tenor in the name of the designated transferee and register such transfer in accordance with Section 2.4. If
less than all the Subscription Receipts evidenced by the Subscription Receipt Certificate(s) so surrendered are transferred, the transferor shall be
entitled to receive, in the same manner, a new Subscription Receipt Certificate registered in his name evidencing the Subscription Receipts not
transferred. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, Subscription Receipts shall only be transferred upon:
(i) payment to the Subscription Receipt Agent of a reasonable sum for each new Subscription Receipt Certificate issued upon such transfer, and
reimbursement of the Subscription Receipt Agent or the Corporation for any and all stamp taxes or governmental or other charges required to
be paid in respect of such transfer; and
(ii) such reasonable requirements as the Subscription Receipt Agent may prescribe, and all such transfers shall be duly noted in such register by
the Subscription Receipt Agent.
(b) The Corporation and the Subscription  Receipt Agent shall deem and treat the  registered  owner  of any Subscription Receipts  as the  beneficial

enter  the  name  of  any  transferee,  of  any  Subscription  Receipts  on  the  registers  referred  to  in  Section  2.4,  if  such  transfer  would  constitute  a
violation  of  the  securities  laws  of  any  jurisdiction  or  the  rules,  regulations  or  policies  of  any  regulatory  authority  having  jurisdiction  or  may
recognize the transfer upon receipt of evidence of compliance with applicable securities laws in form and substance satisfactory to it.
9
(e) Subject  to  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement  and  applicable  law,  a  Receiptholder  shall  be  entitled  to  the  rights  and  privileges  attaching  to  the
Subscription Receipts. Either the issue and delivery of Common Shares and applicable Dividend Equivalent Payment, less applicable withholding

of the Corporation and the Subscription Receipt Agent with respect to such Subscription Receipts and neither the Corporation nor the Subscription
Receipt Agent shall be bound to inquire into the title of a Receiptholder or a transferee of Subscription Receipts who surrenders a Subscription
Receipt Certificate.
2.14        Global Subscription Receipt
(a) Unless  the  Book-Entry  Only  System  is  terminated,  Subscription  Receipt  Certificates  will  only  be  issued  in  the  form  of  one  or  more  Global
Subscription Receipt certificates, which will be registered in the name of and deposited with CDS or its nominee. Subscription Receipt Certificates
sold pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act will be represented by separate Global Subscription Receipt certificates issued under a CUSIP
number dedicated to such Rule 144A Subscription Receipts Certificates. Such Rule 144A Global Subscription Receipt Certificates shall be issued
in compliance with Section 2.15 of this Agreement and substantially in the form set forth in Schedule 2.15(a).
(b) Unless the Book-Entry Only System is terminated or required to do so by applicable law, owners of the beneficial interests in the Subscription
Receipts  shall  not  be  entitled  to  have  Subscription  Receipts  registered  in  their  names,  shall  not  receive  or  be  entitled  to  receive  Subscription
Receipt Certificates in definitive form and shall not be considered owners or holders thereof under this Agreement or any supplemental agreement
except in circumstances where CDS resigns or is removed from its responsibility and the Subscription Receipt Agent is unable or does not wish to
locate  a  qualified  successor.  Beneficial  interests  in  the  Global  Subscription  Receipts  will  be  represented  only  through  the  Book-Entry  Only
System. Transfers of Subscription Receipts between CDS participants shall occur in accordance with CDS’ rules and procedures which rules and
procedures reflect the restrictions on transfers set forth in Section 2.15. Neither the Corporation, nor the Underwriters nor the Subscription Receipt
Agent shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspects of the records relating to or payments made by CDS, or its nominee, on account of
the beneficial interests in the Subscription Receipts. Nothing herein shall prevent the owners of beneficial interests in the Subscription Receipts
from voting such Subscription Receipts using duly executed proxies.
(c) All  references  herein  to  actions  by,  notices  given  or  payments  made  to  Receiptholders  shall,  where  Subscription  Receipts  are  represented  by
Global Subscription Receipt Certificates held through CDS, refer to actions taken by, or notices given or payments made to, CDS upon instruction
from the CDS participants in accordance with its rules and procedures. For the purposes of any provision hereof requiring or permitting actions
with the consent of or at the direction of Receiptholders evidencing a specified percentage of the aggregate Subscription Receipts outstanding,
such direction or consent may be given by holders of Subscription Receipts acting through CDS and the CDS participants owning Subscription
Receipts evidencing the requisite percentage of the Subscription Receipts. The rights of a Receiptholder whose Subscription Receipts represented
by Global Subscription Receipt Certificates are held through CDS shall be exercised only through CDS and the CDS participants and shall be
limited to those established by law and agreements between such holders and CDS and the CDS participants upon instructions from the CDS
participants. Each of the Subscription Receipt Agent and the Corporation may deal with CDS for all purposes (including the making of payments)
as  the  authorized  representative  of  the  respective  Receiptholders  and  such  dealing  with  CDS  shall  constitute  satisfaction  or  performance,  as
applicable, of their respective obligations hereunder.
10
(d) For  so  long  as  Subscription  Receipts  represented  by  Global  Subscription  Receipt  Certificates  are  held  through  CDS,  if  any  notice  or  other
communication is required to be given to Receiptholders, the Subscription Receipt Agent will give such notices and communications to CDS.
(e)
If  CDS  resigns  or is removed from its responsibility  as depository and the Subscription Receipt  Agent is unable or does not wish to locate a
qualified successor, CDS shall surrender the Global Subscription Receipts to the Subscription Receipt Agent with instructions for registration of
Subscription Receipts in the name and in the amount specified by CDS and the Corporation shall issue and the Subscription Receipt Agent shall
certify  and  deliver the aggregate  number  of  Subscription  Receipts  then  outstanding  in the form  of definitive  Subscription  Receipt  Certificates
representing such Subscription Receipts.
2.15        U.S. Legends
The Subscription Receipt Agent acknowledges and understands that the Subscription Receipts and Common Shares issuable upon exchange of the
Subscription Receipts have not been and will not be registered under the 1933 Act and may be transferred only pursuant to an exemption from the registration
requirement of the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws, and understands and acknowledges that upon the original issuance thereof, and until such time
as the same is no longer required under applicable requirements of the 1933 Act or applicable state securities laws, certificates representing the Subscription
Receipts  originally  issued  in  the  United  States  and  certificates  representing  Common  Shares  issued  upon  exchange  of  such  Subscription  Receipts  and  all
certificates issued in exchange therefor or in substitution thereof, shall bear the following legend:
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT
OF  1933,  AS  AMENDED  (THE  “U.S.  SECURITIES  ACT”),  OR  STATE  SECURITIES  LAWS.  THE  HOLDER  HEREOF,  BY

ACCORDANCE WITH (1) RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, IF AVAILABLE OR (2) RULE 144 UNDER THE U.S.

THE  UNITED  STATES,  OR  (D)  IN  ANOTHER  TRANSACTION  THAT  DOES  NOT  REQUIRE  REGISTRATION  UNDER  THE  U.S.
SECURITIES  ACT  OR  ANY  APPLICABLE  STATE  SECURITIES  LAWS  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES  AFTER  (I)  IN  THE  CASE  OF
TRANSFERS  PURSUANT  TO  (B)  ABOVE,  PROVIDING  A  DECLARATION  TO  [TRUSTEE],  TOGETHER  WITH  ANY  OTHER
EVIDENCE, WHICH MAY INCLUDE A LEGAL OPINION, REQUIRED BY [TRUSTEE], AND (II) IN THE CASE OF TRANSFERS
PURSUANT  TO  (C)(2) OR  (D) ABOVE,  PROVIDING A  LEGAL  OPINION SATISFACTORY TO  THE COMPANY. DELIVERY OF
THIS  CERTIFICATE  MAY  NOT  CONSTITUTE  “GOOD  DELIVERY” IN  SETTLEMENT  OF  TRANSACTIONS  ON  STOCK
EXCHANGES IN CANADA.”
provided  that,  if  the  Subscription  Receipts or  Common  Shares  issuable  upon exchange  of the Subscription Receipts are being sold  in compliance with  the
requirements of Rule 904 of Regulation S under the 1933 Act and in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations at a time when the Corporation is a
“foreign issuer” as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S under the 1933 Act, the legend may be removed by providing a declaration to the Corporation and
[Trustee], as registrar and transfer agent, in such form as [Trustee] or the Corporation may from time to time prescribe, substantially in the form set forth in
Schedule 2.15 (together with such other evidence of exemption as [Trustee] or the Corporation may from time to time prescribe, which may include an opinion
of  counsel  in  form  and  substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to  the  Corporation);  provided  further  that,  if  any  such  Subscription  Receipts  or  Common  Shares
issuable upon exchange of the Subscription Receipts are being sold under Rule 144 or in another transaction that does not require registration under the 1933
Act and in compliance with applicable state securities laws, the legend may be removed by delivery to the Corporation and [Trustee], as registrar and transfer
agent, of an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to the effect that such legend is no longer required under applicable requirements of
the 1933 Act or applicable state securities laws.

2.17        Right of Rescission
(a)
If the Prospectus, together with any amendment thereto, contains a misrepresentation (as such term is defined in the Securities Act (Alberta)) and it
was a misrepresentation on the date thereof or as of the date specified in the documents incorporated by reference therein, as the case may be,
purchasers  of  Subscription  Receipts  to  whom  the  Prospectus  was  sent  or  delivered  and  who  were  the  original  purchasers  of  the  Subscription
Receipts  (the  “Original  Purchasers”)  shall  have  a  right  of  action  against  the  Corporation  for  rescission  to  receive  the  Subscription  Price
exercisable on notice given to the Corporation not more than 180 days subsequent to the date hereof. The right of action for rescission is only

the misrepresentation.

place where, the meeting is to be held, shall state briefly the general nature of the business to be transacted thereat and shall contain such information as is
reasonably necessary to enable the Receiptholders to make a reasoned decision on the matter, but it shall not be necessary for any such notice to set out the
terms of any resolution to be proposed or any of the provisions of this Article 7.
7.3          Chairman
An individual (who need not be a Receiptholder) designated in writing by the Subscription Receipt Agent shall be chairman of the meeting and if no

Subject to the provisions of Section 7.11, at any meeting of the Receiptholders a quorum shall consist of one or more Receiptholders present in person

from the time fixed for holding any meeting, the meeting, if summoned by the Receiptholders or on a Receiptholders’ Request, shall be dissolved; but in any
other case the meeting shall be adjourned to the same day in the next week (unless such day is not a Business Day, in which case it shall be adjourned to the

Every question submitted to a meeting shall be decided in the first place by a majority of the votes given on a show of hands except that votes on an
Extraordinary  Resolution  shall  be  given  in  the  manner  hereinafter  provided.  At  any  such  meeting,  unless  a  poll  is  duly  demanded  as  herein  provided,  a
declaration by the chairman that a resolution has been carried or carried unanimously or by a particular majority or lost or not carried by a particular majority
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact.

On  every  Extraordinary  Resolution,  and on any  other  question  submitted  to  a  meeting  and  after  a  vote  by  show of  hands  when  demanded  by  the

more than one of them shall be present in person or by proxy, they shall vote together in respect of Subscription Receipts of which they are joint registered
holders. The chairman of any meeting shall be entitled, both on a show of hands and on a poll, to vote in respect of the Subscription Receipts, if any, held or

notice of and vote at such meeting;

Subscription  Receipt  Certificates  specified  therein  have  been  deposited  with  it  by  a  named  Person  and  will  remain  on  deposit  until  after  the
meeting, which voting certificate shall entitle the Persons named therein to be present and vote at any such meeting and at any adjournment thereof
or to appoint a proxy or proxies to represent them and vote for them at any such meeting and at any adjournment thereof in the same manner and
with the same effect as though the Persons so named in such voting certificates were the actual holders of the Subscription Receipt Certificates
specified therein;
(c)
the deposit of voting certificates and instruments appointing proxies at such place and time as the Subscription Receipt Agent, the Corporation or
the Receiptholders, convening the meeting, as the case may be, may direct in the notice convening the meeting;

themselves were produced at the meeting;
(e)
the form of the instrument of proxy and the manner in which the instrument of proxy must be executed; and
(f) generally for the calling of meetings of Receiptholders and the conduct of business thereat.

9.1          Rights and Duties of Subscription Receipt Agent
CONCERNING THE SUBSCRIPTION RECEIPT AGENT
ARTICLE 9
(a)
In the exercise of the rights and duties prescribed or conferred by the terms of this Agreement, the Subscription Receipt Agent shall exercise that
degree  of  care,  diligence  and  skill  that  a  reasonably  prudent  escrow  agent  would  exercise  in  comparable  circumstances.  No  provision  of  this
Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Subscription Receipt Agent from liability for its own gross negligent action, its own gross negligent
failure to act, or its own wilful misconduct or fraud.
(b) The obligation of the Subscription Receipt Agent to commence or continue any act, action or proceeding for the purpose of enforcing any rights of
the Subscription Receipt Agent or the Receiptholders hereunder shall be conditional upon the Receiptholders furnishing, when required by notice
by  the  Subscription  Receipt  Agent,  sufficient  funds  to  commence  or  to  continue  such  act,  action  or  proceeding  and  an  indemnity  reasonably
satisfactory  to  the  Subscription  Receipt  Agent  to  protect  and  to  hold  harmless  the  Subscription  Receipt  Agent  against  the  costs,  charges  and
expenses and liabilities to be incurred thereby and any loss and damage it may suffer by reason thereof. None of the provisions contained in this
Agreement  shall  require  the  Subscription  Receipt  Agent  to  expend  or  to  risk  its  own  funds  or  otherwise  to  incur  financial  liability  in  the
performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers unless indemnified as aforesaid.
(c) The Subscription Receipt Agent shall retain the right not to act and shall not be liable for refusing to act, if, due to a lack of information or for any
other reason whatsoever, the Subscription Receipt Agent, in its sole judgment, determines that such act might cause it to be in non-compliance
with any applicable anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist legislation, regulation or guideline. Further, should the Subscription Receipt Agent, in
its sole judgment, determine at any time that its acting under this Agreement has resulted in its being in non-compliance with any applicable anti-
money  laundering  or  anti-terrorist  legislation,  regulation  or  guideline,  then  it  shall  have  the  right  to  resign  on  ten  days’ written  notice  to  the
Corporation and the Lead Underwriter, provided that: (i) Subscription Receipt Agent’s written notice shall describe the circumstances of such non-
compliance; and (ii) if such circumstances are rectified to the Subscription Receipt Agent’s satisfaction within such ten day period, then such
resignation shall not be effective.
23
(d) The Subscription Receipt Agent may, before commencing or at any time during the continuance of any such act, action or proceeding, require the
Receiptholders at whose instance it is acting to deposit with the Subscription Receipt Agent the Subscription Receipts held by them, for which
Subscription Receipts the Subscription Receipt Agent shall issue receipts.
(e) Every provision of this Agreement that by its terms relieves the Subscription Receipt Agent of liability or entitles it to rely upon any evidence
submitted to it is subject to the provisions of this Section 9.1 and of Section 9.2.
(f) The Subscription Receipt Agent shall have no duties except those expressly set forth herein, and it shall not be bound by any notice of a claim or
demand with respect to, or any waiver, modification, amendment, termination or rescission of, this Agreement, unless received by it in writing and
signed by the other parties hereto and, if its duties herein are affected, unless it shall have given its prior written consent thereto.
(g) The Subscription Receipt Agent shall not be responsible for ensuring that the Proceeds are used in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus.
(h) The Subscription Receipt Agent shall retain the right not to act and shall not be held liable for refusing to act unless it has received clear and
reasonable documentation which complies with the terms of this Agreement, which documentation does not require the exercise of any discretion
or independent judgment.
(i) The Subscription Receipt Agent shall incur no liability whatsoever with respect to the delivery or non-delivery of any certificates whether delivery
by hand, mail or any other means.
(j) The Subscription Receipt Agent shall not be responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for the deficiency, correctness, genuineness or validity
of any securities deposited with it.
9.2          Evidence, Experts and Advisers
(a)
In addition to the reports, certificates, opinions and other evidence required by this Agreement, the Corporation shall furnish to the Subscription
Receipt  Agent  such  additional  evidence  of  compliance  with  any  provision  hereof,  and  in  such  form,  as  the  Subscription  Receipt  Agent  may
reasonably require by written notice to the Corporation.
(b) In  the exercise  of its rights  and duties hereunder, the  Subscription Receipt Agent may, if it is acting in good faith,  rely as to the truth  of the
statements  and  the  accuracy  of  the  opinions  expressed  in  statutory  declarations,  opinions,  reports,  written  requests,  consents,  or  orders  of  the
Corporation, certificates of the Corporation or other evidence furnished to the Subscription Receipt Agent pursuant to any provision hereof or
pursuant to a request of the Subscription Receipt Agent.
(c) Whenever it is provided in this Agreement that the Corporation shall deposit with the Subscription Receipt Agent resolutions, certificates, reports,
opinions, requests, orders or other documents, it is intended that the truth, accuracy and good faith on the effective date thereof and the facts and
opinions stated in all such documents so deposited shall, in each and every such case, be conditions precedent to the right of the Corporation to
have the Subscription Receipt Agent take the action to be based thereon.
24
(d) Proof of the execution of an instrument in writing, including a Receiptholders’ Request, by any Receiptholder may be made by the certificate of a
notary public, or other officer with similar powers, that the person signing such instrument acknowledged to the officer the execution thereof, or by
an affidavit of a witness to such execution or in any other manner which the Subscription Receipt Agent may consider adequate.
(e) The Subscription Receipt Agent may employ or retain such Counsel, accountants, appraisers or other experts or advisers as it may reasonably
require for the purpose of discharging its duties hereunder and may pay reasonable remuneration for all services so performed by any of them,
without taxation of costs of any Counsel, and shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such experts or advisers
who have been appointed with due care by the Subscription Receipt Agent.
9.3          Documents, Monies, etc. Held by Subscription Receipt Agent
Any securities, documents of title or other instruments that may at any time be held by the Subscription Receipt Agent pursuant to this Agreement may
be placed in the deposit vaults of the Subscription Receipt Agent or of any Canadian bank or deposited for safekeeping with any such bank. If the Subscription
Receipt Agent has not received a direction under Section 4.1, any monies so held pending the application or withdrawal thereof under any provisions of this
Agreement may be deposited in the name of the Subscription Receipt Agent in any Canadian bank, or in the deposit department of the Subscription Receipt
Agent or any other loan or trust company authorized to accept deposits under the laws of Canada or a province thereof, at the rate of interest (if any) then current
on similar deposits.
9.4          Actions by Subscription Receipt Agent to Protect Interest
The Subscription Receipt Agent shall have power to institute and to maintain such actions and proceedings as it may consider necessary or expedient to
preserve, protect or enforce its interests and the interests of the Receiptholders.
9.5          Third Party Interests
Each party to this Agreement hereby represents to the Subscription Receipt Agent that any account to be opened by, or interest to be held by, the
Subscription Receipt Agent in connection with this Agreement, for or to the credit of such party, either: (i) is not intended to be used by or on behalf of any third
party; or (ii) is intended to be used by or on behalf of a third party, in which case each of the Lead Underwriter and the Corporation agrees to complete and
execute forthwith a declaration in the Subscription Receipt Agent’s prescribed form as to the particulars of such third party.
9.6          Subscription Receipt Agent not Required to Give Security
The Subscription Receipt Agent shall not be required to give any bond or security in respect of the execution of this Agreement or otherwise in respect
of the premises.
9.7          Protection of Subscription Receipt Agent
By way of supplement to the provisions of any law for the time being relating to trustees it is expressly declared and agreed as follows:
(a)
the Subscription Receipt Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any statements of fact or recitals in this Agreement or in the Subscription
Receipt Certificates (except the representation contained in Section 9.9 or in the certificate of the Subscription Receipt Agent on the Subscription
Receipt Certificates) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements or recitals are and shall be deemed to be made by the Corporation;
25
(b) nothing herein contained shall impose any obligation on the Subscription Receipt Agent to see to or to require evidence of the registration or filing
(or renewal thereof) of this Agreement or any instrument ancillary or supplemental hereto;
(c)
the Subscription Receipt Agent shall not be bound to give notice to any Person or Persons of the execution hereof; and
(d) the Subscription Receipt Agent shall not incur any liability or responsibility whatsoever or be in any way responsible for the consequence of any

Corporation.
9.8          Replacement of Subscription Receipt Agent; Successor by Merger
(a) The  Subscription  Receipt  Agent  may  resign  its  appointment  and  be  discharged  from  all  other  duties  and  liabilities  hereunder,  subject  to  this
Section 9.8, by giving to the Corporation not less than 30 days’ prior notice in writing or such shorter prior notice as the Corporation may accept as
sufficient. The Receiptholders by Extraordinary Resolution shall have power at any time to remove the existing Subscription Receipt Agent and to
appoint  a  new  Subscription  Receipt  Agent.  In  the  event  of  the  Subscription  Receipt  Agent  resigning  or  being  removed  as  aforesaid  or  being
dissolved, becoming bankrupt, going into liquidation or otherwise becoming incapable of acting hereunder, the Lead Underwriter, on behalf of the
Underwriters, shall forthwith appoint a new escrow agent unless a new escrow agent has already been appointed by the Receiptholders; failing
such appointment by the Lead Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, the retiring Subscription Receipt Agent or any Receiptholder may apply
to a justice of the Court of Queen’s Bench (Alberta) on such notice as such justice may direct, for the appointment of a new escrow agent; but any
new escrow agent so appointed by the Lead Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, or by the Court shall be subject to removal as aforesaid by
the Receiptholders. Any new escrow agent appointed under any provision of this Section 9.8 shall be a corporation authorized to carry on the
business of a trust company in the Provinces of Alberta and Ontario and, if required by the applicable legislation for any other provinces, in such
other provinces. On any such appointment, the new escrow agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it
had been originally named herein as Subscription Receipt Agent hereunder. At the request of the Corporation or the new Subscription Receipt
Agent, the retiring Subscription Receipt Agent, upon payment of the amounts, if any, due to it pursuant to Section 5.3, shall duly assign, transfer
and deliver to the new Subscription Receipt Agent all property and money held and all records kept by the retiring Subscription Receipt Agent
hereunder or in connection herewith.
(b) Upon the appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Corporation shall promptly notify the Receiptholders thereof in the manner provided for in
Article 10.
(c) Any corporation into or with which the Subscription Receipt Agent may be merged or consolidated or amalgamated, or any corporation resulting
therefrom  to  which  the  Subscription  Receipt  Agent  shall  be  a  party,  or  any  corporation  succeeding  to  the  corporate  trust  business  of  the
Subscription Receipt Agent shall be the successor to the Subscription Receipt Agent hereunder without any further act on its part or any of the
parties hereto, provided that such corporation would be eligible for appointment as a successor escrow agent under Subsection 9.8(a).
(d) Any Subscription Receipt Certificates certified but not delivered by a predecessor escrow agent may be delivered by the successor escrow agent in
the name of the predecessor or successor escrow agent.
26
9.9          Conflict of Interest
(a) The  Subscription  Receipt  Agent  represents  to  the  Corporation  and  the  Lead  Underwriter,  on  behalf  of  the  Underwriters,  that  at  the  time  of
execution and delivery hereof no material conflict of interest exists between its role as an escrow agent hereunder and its role in any other capacity
and agrees that in the event of a material conflict of interest arising hereafter it will, within 30 days after ascertaining that it has such material
conflict of interest, either eliminate the same or assign its appointment as escrow agent hereunder to a successor escrow agent approved by the
Corporation and meeting the requirements set forth in Subsection 9.8(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Subsection 9.9(a), if any
such material conflict of interest exists or hereafter shall exist, the validity and enforceability of this Agreement and the Subscription Receipt
Certificates shall not be affected in any manner whatsoever by reason thereof.
(b) Subject to Subsection 9.9(a), the Subscription Receipt Agent, in its personal or any other capacity, may buy, lend upon and deal in securities of the
Corporation  and  generally  may  contract  and  enter  into  financial  transactions  with  the  Corporation  or  any  affiliated  entity  of  the  Corporation

so deposited.

10.7        Subscription Receipts Owned by the Corporation or its Subsidiaries - Certificate to be Provided

This Agreement may be executed and delivered in counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and

date hereof.

Re: S-3 Registration Statement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as special Nevada counsel with respect to certain matters in connection with the filing by Gran Tierra Energy Inc., a
Nevada corporation (the "Company"), of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the base prospectus (the "Base Prospectus") filed with the Registration Statement.
The Base Prospectus provides that it will be supplemented in the future by one or more prospectus supplements (each, a "Prospectus Supplement") and any free-
writing prospectus(es). The Registration Statement, including the Base Prospectus as supplemented from time to time by one or more Prospectus Supplements
and any free-writing prospectus(es), covers the registration of:
(i)
(ii)
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock");
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 par value, of the Company (the "Preferred Stock");
(iii)
debt securities, in one or more series (the "Debt Securities"), which may be issued pursuant to an indenture to be dated on or about the date of
the first issuance of Debt Securities thereunder, by and between a trustee to be selected by the Company (the "Trustee") and the Company, in the form filed as
Exhibit 4.6 to the Registration Statement (the "Indenture");
(iv)
warrants to purchase Common Stock, Preferred Stock or Debt Securities (the "Warrants"), which may be issued under warrant agreements, to
be dated on or about the date of the first issuance of the applicable Warrants thereunder, by and between a warrant agent to be selected by the Company (the
"Warrant Agent") and the Company, in the forms filed as Exhibits 4.8,4.9 and 4.10 to the Registration Statement (each, a "Warrant Agreement");
(v)
subscription receipts for shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or Warrants (the "Subscription Receipts"), which may be issued under
subscription receipt agreements, to be dated on or about the date of the first applicable Subscription Receipt thereunder in the form filed as Exhibit 4.11 to the
Registration Statement (the "Subscription Receipt Agreement");
(vi)
(A) up to 4,875,177 shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon exchange or redemption of up to 4,875,177 exchangeable shares that
were issued by Gran Tierra Exchangeco Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, in connection with the combination of the Company and Solana Resources Limited
and (B) up to 3,638,889 shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon exchange or redemption of up to 3,638,889 exchangeable shares that were issued by
Gran  Tierra  Goldstrike  Inc.,  a  subsidiary  of  the  Company,  in  connection  with  the  combination  of  the  Company  and  Goldstrike,  Inc.  (and  any  additional
securities that may be offered or issued to prevent dilution resulting from stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar transactions) (collectively, the
"Exchange Shares"); and
(vii)
up to 57,835,134 shares of Common Stock that may be offered and sold by certain selling stockholders named in the Registration Statement
(the  "Selling  Stockholders")  subsequent  to  the  issuance  of  such  shares  of  Common  Stock  to  them  upon  conversion  of  57,835,134  Subscription  Receipts
previously issued by the Company (and any additional securities that may be offered or issued to prevent dilution resulting from stock splits, stock dividends,
recapitalizations or similar transactions) (the "Secondary Shares").
The Common Stock, the Preferred Stock, the Debt Securities, the Warrants and the Subscription Receipts are collectively referred to herein as the
"Company Securities." The Company Securities are being registered for offer and sale from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act.
In  connection  with  this  opinion,  we  have  examined  and  relied  upon  originals,  or  copies  certified  to  our  satisfaction,  of  such  records,  documents,
certificates, opinions, memoranda and other instruments as in our judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable us to render the opinion expressed below. As
to certain factual matters, we have relied upon a certificate of an officer of the Company and have not independently sought to verify such matters.
In rendering this opinion, we have assumed the genuineness and authenticity of all signatures on original documents; the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals; the conformity to originals of all documents submitted to us as copies; the accuracy, completeness and authenticity of certificates of
public  officials;  and  the  due  authorization,  execution  and  delivery  of  all  documents  where  authorization,  execution  and  delivery  are  prerequisites  to  the
effectiveness of such documents. With respect to our opinion as to the Common Stock (including the Exchange Shares and the Secondary Shares), we have
assumed that, at the time of issuance and sale, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock are authorized and available for issuance. With respect to our
opinion as to the Preferred Stock, we have assumed that, at the time of issuance and sale, a sufficient number of shares of Preferred Stock are authorized,
designated and available for issuance. We have also assumed that any Debt Securities or Warrants offered under the Registration Statement, and the related
Indenture or Warrant Agreement, as applicable, will be executed in the forms filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement and will be validly and legally
binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights, and subject to general equity principles and to
limitations on availability of equitable relief, including specific performance. We have also assumed that (i) with respect to the Company Securities being issued
upon  conversion  of  any  convertible  Preferred  Stock,  the  applicable  convertible  Preferred  Stock  will  be  duly  authorized,  validly  issued,  fully  paid  and
nonassessable;  and  (ii) with  respect  to  any  Company  Securities  being  issued  upon  conversion  of  any  convertible  Debt  Securities  or  upon  exercise  of  any
Warrants, the applicable convertible Debt Securities or Warrants will be valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other
similar  laws  affecting  creditors'  rights,  and  subject  to  general  equity  principles  and  to  limitations  on  availability  of  equitable  relief,  including  specific
performance.
Our opinion is expressed solely with respect to Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Our opinion is based on these laws as in effect on the date
hereof. We express no opinion as to whether the laws of any jurisdiction are applicable to the subject matter hereof. We are not rendering any opinion as to
compliance with any federal or state law, rule or regulation relating to securities, or to the sale or issuance thereof.
On the basis of the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications herein stated, we are of the opinion that:
1. With respect to the Common Stock offered under the Registration Statement (including the Exchange Shares and the Secondary Shares), provided
that  (i) the  Registration  Statement  and  any  required  post-effective  amendment  thereto  have  all  become  effective  under  the  Securities  Act  and  the  Base
Prospectus, any and all Prospectus Supplement(s) required by applicable laws and any and all free-writing prospectus(es) related to the offer and sale of the
Common Stock offered under the Registration Statement (including the Exchange Shares and the Secondary Shares) have been delivered and filed as required
by such laws; (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock offered under the Registration Statement (including the Exchange Shares and the Secondary Shares) has
been  duly  authorized  by  all  necessary  corporate  action  on  the  part  of  the  Company;  (iii) the  issuance  and  sale  of  the  Common  Stock  offered  under  the
Registration Statement (including the Exchange Shares and the Secondary Shares) do not violate any applicable law, are in conformity with the Company's then
operative articles of incorporation (the "Articles of Incorporation") and bylaws (the "Bylaws"); and (iv) the certificates for the Common Stock offered under the
Registration Statement (including the Exchange Shares and the Secondary Shares) have been duly executed by the Company, countersigned by the transfer
agent  therefor  and  duly  delivered  to  the  purchasers  thereof  against  payment  therefor;  then  the  Common  Stock  offered  under  the  Registration  Statement
(including the Exchange Shares and the Secondary Shares), when issued and sold as contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus and the
related Prospectus Supplement(s) and any related free-writing prospectus(es) and in accordance with any applicable duly authorized, executed and delivered
purchase, underwriting or similar agreement, or upon exchange of any Exchange Shares in accordance with their terms, or upon conversion of any convertible
Preferred Stock or convertible Debt Securities or Subscription Receipts in accordance with their terms, or upon exercise of any Warrants in accordance with
their terms, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
2. With respect to the Preferred Stock offered under the Registration Statement, provided that (i) the Registration Statement and any required post-
effective amendment thereto have all become effective under the Securities Act and the Base Prospectus and any and all Prospectus Supplement(s) and any
related  free-writing  prospectus(es)  required  by  applicable  laws  have  been  delivered  and  filed  as  required  by  such  laws;  (ii) the  terms  and  issuance  of  the
Preferred Stock offered under the Registration Statement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company; (iii) the terms
of the shares of Preferred Stock offered under the Registration Statement and their issuance and sale do not violate any applicable law, are in conformity with
the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws; and (iv) the certificates for the Preferred Stock offered under the Registration Statement have been duly executed
by the Company, countersigned by the transfer agent therefor and duly delivered to the purchasers thereof against payment therefor; then the Preferred Stock
offered under the Registration Statement, when issued and sold as contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus and the related Prospectus

accordance with their terms, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal
Matters" in the Base Prospectus and any Prospectus Supplements. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise
you of any subsequent changes in the facts stated or assumed herein or of any subsequent changes in applicable law.

EXHIBIT 99.1
THIRD PARTY REPORT ON RESERVES
By McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. ("McDaniel") - (Independent Qualified Reserves Evaluator)
This report was prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in item 1202(a)(8) of Regulation S-K under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended,  with  respect  to  Gran  Tierra  Energy  Inc.’s  (“Gran  Tierra”)  acquisition  of  PetroLatina  Energy  Ltd.’s  (“PetroLatina”)  oil  and  gas  reserves  as  at
December 31, 2015, and to provide the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve estimation process, and is to be
used for inclusion in certain SEC filings by Gran Tierra.
The  numbering  of  items  below  corresponds  to  the  requirements  set  out  in  Item  1202(a)(8)  of  Regulation  S-K.  Terms  to  which  a  meaning  is  ascribed  in
Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X have the same meaning in this report.
i. We have prepared an independent estimate of the oil and gas reserves of Gran Tierra’s acquisition of PetroLatina Energy Ltd. for the management and
the board of directors of Gran Tierra. The primary purpose of our evaluation was to provide estimates of reserves information in support of Gran
Tierra’s reserves reporting requirements under US Securities Regulation S-K and for other internal business and financial needs of Gran Tierra.
ii. We estimated the reserves of Gran Tierra’s acquisition of PetroLatina as at December 31, 2015. The completion date of our estimate is June 24, 2016.
iii. McDaniel evaluated 100% of the reserves of PetroLatina.
The following table sets forth the net after royalty reserves of Gran Tierra’s acquisition of PetroLatina:

iv. As noted in item iii., our evaluation covered 100% of the reserves of each of Gran Tierra’s acquisition of PetroLatina. The assumptions, methods and
procedures  followed  in  the  evaluation  reflect  the  standards  set  out  in  the  Canadian  Oil  and  Gas  Evaluation  Handbook  (the  "COGE  Handbook")
modified as necessary to conform to the standards under the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board policies (the “FASB Standards”) and. the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulations (“SEC requirements”).
Data used in our evaluation of Gran Tierra's acquisition of PetroLatina was obtained from regulatory agencies, public sources and from Gran Tierra
personnel and Gran Tierra files. In the preparation of our report we have accepted as presented, and have relied, without independent verification, upon
a variety of information furnished by Gran Tierra such as interests and burdens on properties, recent production volumes, product transportation and
marketing and sales agreements, historical revenue, capital costs, operating expense data, budget forecasts and capital cost estimates and well data for
recently drilled wells. If in the course of our evaluation, the validity or sufficiency of any material information was brought into question, we did not
rely on such information until such concerns were resolved to our satisfaction.
Gran Tierra warranted in a representation letter to us that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, all data furnished to us was accurate in all material
respects, and no material data relevant to our evaluation was omitted.
A field examination of the evaluated properties was not performed nor was it considered necessary for the purposes of our evaluation.
In  our  opinion,  estimates  provided  in  our  evaluation  have,  in  all  material  respects,  been  determined  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  industry
standards, and results provided in our evaluation and summarized herein are appropriate for inclusion in filings under Regulation S-K.
v. As required under SEC Regulation S-X, reserves are those quantities of oil and gas that are estimated to be economically producible under existing
economic conditions. The primary economic assumptions relate to pricing, capital and operating costs, recoverable volumes and production forecasts.
As specified, in determining economic production, constant product benchmark prices are to be based on a 12-month average price, calculated as the 
unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the effective date of our 
evaluation unless prices are defined by contractual or other regulatory arrangements. The relevant benchmark prices for Gran Tierra's acquisition of 
PetroLatina’s reserves is Brent Blend Crude Oil FOB North Sea at $54.08 USD/bbl.
The product prices that were used to determine the future gross revenue for each property reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity,
quality, local conditions, and/or distance from market, referred to herein as “differentials.” The differentials used in the preparation of this evaluation
estimated from received price information provided by Gran Tierra.
The average realized prices for Gran Tierra's acquisition of PetroLatina’s reserves in the evaluation are:
Oil and NGLs (USD/bbl) - Colombia
$
41.92
In our economic analysis, operating and capital costs are those costs estimated as applicable at the effective date of our evaluation, with no future
escalation. Where deemed appropriate, the capital costs and revised operating costs associated with the implementation of committed projects designed
to modify specific field operations in the future may be included in economic projections. Capital costs used in this evaluation were provided by Gran
Tierra and actual costs from recent activity. Capital costs are included as required for workovers, new development wells, and production equipment.
Based on our understanding of future development plans, a review of the records provided to us, and our knowledge of similar properties, we regard
these estimated capital costs to be reasonable. Abandonment costs were assigned to the abandonment of wells assigned reserves, including future wells.
Reserves were assigned by volumetric, material balance, decline analysis or analogy where considered appropriate. In some cases, where sufficient
data were available, a combination of the methods were applied.
Test data and other related information were used to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or analogous locations. For reserves
not yet on production, forecast sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date furnished by Gran Tierra. Wells or locations that are not
currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in our estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to
initiate production. Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing and/or recompleting
wells and/or constraints set by regulatory bodies.
The  future  production  rates  from  wells  currently  on  production  or  wells  or  locations  that  are  not  currently  producing  may  be  more  or  less  than
estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and
artificial lift, pipeline capacity and/or operating conditions, producing market demand and/or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
vi. Our  evaluation  has  been  prepared  assuming  the  continuation  of  existing  regulatory  and  fiscal  conditions  subject  to  the  guidance  in  the  COGE
Handbook  and  SEC  regulations.  Notwithstanding  that  Gran  Tierra  currently  has  regulatory  approval  to  produce  the  reserves  identified  in  our
evaluation, there is no assurance that changes in regulation will not occur; such changes, which cannot reliably be predicted, could impact Gran Tierra's
ability to recover the estimated reserves.
vii. Oil and gas reserves estimates have an inherent degree of associated uncertainty the extent of which is affected by many factors. Reserves estimates
will vary due to the limited and imprecise nature of data upon which the estimates of reserves are predicated. Moreover, the methods and data used in
estimating reserves are often necessarily indirect or analogical in character rather than direct or deductive. Furthermore, the persons involved in the
preparation of reserves estimates and associated information are required, in applying geosciences, petroleum engineering and evaluation principles, to
make  numerous  unbiased  judgments  based  upon  their  educational  background,  professional  training,  and  professional  experience.  The  extent  and
significance  of  the  judgments  to  be  made  are,  in  themselves,  sufficient  to  render  reserves  estimates  inherently  imprecise.  Reserves  estimates  may
change  substantially  as  additional  data  becomes  available  and  as  economic  conditions  impacting  oil  and  gas  prices  and  costs  change.  Reserves
estimates will also change over time due to other factors such as knowledge and technology, fiscal and economic conditions, contractual, statutory and
regulatory provisions.
viii. In  our  opinion,  the  reserves  information  evaluated  by  us  have,  in  all  material  respects,  been  determined  in  accordance  with  all  appropriate  data,
assumptions, methods and procedures applicable for the filing of reserves information under U.S. SEC Regulation S-K. All methods and procedures we
considered necessary under the circumstances to prepare the evaluation were used.
ix. A summary of Gran Tierra's acquisition of PetroLatina’s reserves evaluated by us is provided in item iii.
