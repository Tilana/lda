statutory audit, as disclosed in Note 34 to the financial statements.   
 
The Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services provided by the auditor is compatible with 
the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001.  The Directors are 
satisfied  that  these  non-audit  services  do  not  compromise  the  auditor’s  independence,  based  on  advice 
received from the Audit and Risk Committee, for the following reasons: 
  all non-audit services have been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee to ensure they did not impact
the impartiality and objectivity of the auditor; and
  none of the services undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 
110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor’s 
own work, acting in a management or decision-making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate 
for the Company or jointly sharing economic risks and rewards.
Auditor Independence
A copy of the Auditor’s Independence Declaration, as required by the Corporations Act 2001, is included after

DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
 
Environmental Regulation and Performance
The Managing Director reports to the Board on all significant safety, health and environmental incidents.  The 
Board  also  has  a  Safety  and  Sustainability  Committee  which  has  oversight  of  the  safety,  health  and 
environmental performance of the Group and meets at least four times per year.  The Directors are not aware 
of any environmental incidents occurring during the 2016 financial year which would have a materially adverse 
impact on the overall business of the Group. 
 
The operations of the Group are subject to environmental regulation under the jurisdiction of the countries in 
which those operations are conducted, including Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire and 
Fiji.  Each mining operation is subject to particular environmental regulation specific to their activities as part 
of  their  operating licence  or  environmental  approvals.    Each  of  our  sites  are  required  to  also manage  their 
environmental obligations in accordance with our corporate environmental policies and standards.   
 
The environmental laws and regulations that cover each of our sites, combined with our policies and standards, 
address the potential impact of the Group’s activities in relation to water and air quality, noise, land disturbance, 
waste and tailings management, and the potential impact upon flora and fauna.  The Group releases an annual 
Sustainability Report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative that details our activities in relation to 
management of key environmental aspects. 
 
The  Group  has  a  uniform  internal  reporting  system  across  all  sites.    All  environmental  incidents,  including 
breaches  of  any  regulation  or  law,  are  assessed  according  to  their  actual  or  potential  environmental 
consequence.    Five  levels  of  environmental  incidents  are  tracked  based  on  factors  such  as  spill  volume, 
incident  location  (onsite  or  offsite)  and  potential  or  actual  environmental  impacts.    These  levels  include:  I 
(insignificant), II (minor), III (moderate), IV (major) and V (catastrophic).  Data on Category I incidents are only 
collected at a site level and are not reported in aggregate for the Group.   
 
The number of incidents reported in each category during the year is shown in the following table.  In all cases, 
environmental authorities were notified of those events where required and remedial action undertaken.

Indemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers
Newcrest maintains a Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy  which, subject to some exceptions, provides 
insurance cover to past, present or future Directors, Secretaries and Executive Officers of the Group and its 
subsidiaries.  The Company has paid an insurance premium for the policy.   
 
 
Indemnification of Auditors
To the extent permitted by law, the Company has agreed to indemnify its auditors, Ernst & Young, as part of 
the  terms  of  its  audit  engagement  agreement  against  claims  by  third  parties  arising  from  the  audit  (for  an 
unspecified amount).  No payment has been made to indemnify Ernst & Young during or since the end of the 
financial year.

Newcrest Mining Limited – Annual Financial Report - Year Ended 30 June 2016
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Full year results 
Newcrest has continued to realise operational improvement across the business through the Group-wide 
program known as Edge, with a focus on safe production and processes, cash generation and profitable 
growth. The results of this program are most evident in the improved operational performance at Lihir during 
the year, and cost reductions and efficiency gains across the Group.   
These operational improvements have reduced the adverse impacts of lower commodity prices and higher 
depreciation charges in the current period. Statutory profit of US$332 million was US$44 million lower than 
the prior period. The current period Statutory profit included significant items with a net benefit of US$9 million, 
comprising a US$18 million profit on sale of a financial asset partially offset by a US$9 million net expense 
associated with the settlement and costs of a shareholder class action.   
Underlying profit in the current period of US$323 million was US$101 million lower than the prior period 
primarily  reflecting  lower  realised  US  dollar  gold  and  copper  prices,  the  suspension  of  operations  at 
Gosowong following a geotechnical event in February 2016, higher depreciation and lower copper volumes 
from Cadia and Telfer. This was partially offset by improved financial and operational performance at Lihir, 
positive impact on costs from the weakening of all key operating currencies against the US dollar, lower 
energy prices, and lower income tax expense compared to the prior period. 
The average realised gold price in the current year of US$1,166 per ounce was 5% lower than the prior 
period, while the average realised copper price of US$2.21 per pound was 24% lower. 
Gold production of 2.439 million ounces was 1% higher than the prior period and within the market guidance 
range of 2.4–2.6 million ounces. Record gold production volumes were achieved at Lihir due to higher milling 
rates  and  higher  ore  feed  grades,  and  gold  production  at  Bonikro  also  increased  year  on  year.  Gold 
production  volume  in  the  current  period  was  adversely  impacted  by  the  suspension  of  operations  at 
Gosowong from mid-February 2016 and lower ore feed grades at Telfer.   
Copper production of 83.1 thousand tonnes was 14% lower than the prior period due to lower production at 
Cadia and Telfer. 
Newcrest’s All-In Sustaining Cost of US$762 per ounce in the current period was US$18 per ounce or 2% 
lower than the prior period, reflecting lower unit operating costs (particularly from Lihir) as a result of cost and 
efficiency improvements partially offset by lower copper by-product credits and higher sustaining capital. 
Free cash flow of US$814 million was US$40 million lower than the prior period. All operations were free 
cash flow positive before tax with improved free cash flow generation from Lihir driven by record production 
and lower unit operating costs.   
The free cash flow performance of the Group enabled a US$782 million reduction in net debt during the 
period, delivering an improvement in Newcrest’s key target financial ratios. At 30 June 2016, Newcrest had 
a gearing ratio of 22.8% and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.6 times, which compares favourably with gearing 
of 29.3% and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.1 times as at 30 June 2015.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Capital structure  
Newcrest’s net debt as at 30 June 2016 was US$2,107 million. Newcrest also had US$53 million of cash and 
US$2,405 million6 in committed undrawn bank facilities (a total of US$2,458 million). Of those committed 
undrawn bank facilities, US$2,375 million (facility limit of US$2,400 million) were refinanced in May 2016 and 
have tenors expiring between May 2019 and June 2021. The remaining US$30 million committed undrawn 
bank facility (facility limit of US$50 million provided to PT Nusa Halmahera Minerals, a subsidiary entity) 
expires in January 2017 unless extended prior to expiry.   
During the current period, Newcrest repaid net US$950 million of senior unsecured bilateral bank debt as the 
Company prioritised the application of free cash flow to the reduction of debt, consistent with the achievement 
of its financial objectives. 
Newcrest’s  financial  objectives  are  to  meet  all  financial  obligations,  maintain  a  strong  balance  sheet  to 
withstand cash flow volatility, be able to invest capital in value-creating opportunities, and be able to return 
excess cash generated to shareholders. Newcrest looks to maintain a conservative level of balance sheet 
leverage. 
From a financial policy perspective, Newcrest looks to: 
  Target an investment grade credit rating throughout the cycle; 
  Maintain a leverage ratio (Net Debt to EBITDA) of less than 2.0 times;  
  Maintain a gearing ratio of below 25%; and  
  Maintain diverse funding sources, sizeable committed undrawn bank facilities and US dollar debt with
an appropriate tenor having regard to the life of the Group’s assets.
At 30 June the Group’s position in relation to these metrics was:

Dividend  
Newcrest’s  dividend  policy  continues  to  balance  financial  performance  and  capital  commitments  with  a 
prudent leverage and gearing level for the Company. Newcrest looks to pay ordinary dividends that are 
sustainable  over  time  having  regard  to  its  financial  policy,  profitability,  balance  sheet  strength  and 
reinvestment options in the business. 
The Newcrest Board has determined that, having regard to the Company’s financial performance in the 2016 
financial year and target financial metrics at year end, a final unfranked dividend of US 7.5 cents per share 
will be paid on 18 October 2016.  The record date for entitlement is 22 September 2016. The financial impact 
of  the  dividend  amounting  to  US$57  million  has  not  been  recognised  in  the  Consolidated  Financial 
Statements for the year. The dividend will be paid from conduit foreign income and will be exempt from 
withholding tax. The Dividend Reinvestment Plan remains in place.

‘Underlying profit (loss)’ is profit or loss after tax before significant items attributable to owners of the Company. 
‘EBITDA is ‘Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and significant items’. EBIT is ‘Earnings before interest, 
tax and significant items’. 
‘EBITDA  Margin’  is  EBITDA  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  revenue.  ‘EBIT  Margin’  is  EBIT  expressed  as  a  percentage  of 
revenue. 
ROCE is ‘Return on capital employed’ and is calculated as EBIT expressed as a percentage of average total capital employed 
(net debt and total equity). 
Interest coverage ratio is calculated as EBITDA adjusted for facility fees and discount unwind on provisions, divided by net 
interest payable (interest expense adjusted for facility fees, discount unwind on provisions and interest capitalised). 
‘AISC’ is All-In Sustaining Cost and ‘AIC’ is All-In Cost as per World Gold Council Guidance Note on Non-GAAP Metrics released 
June 2013. AISC Margin reflects the average realised gold price less the AISC per ounce sold. 
Net debt to EBITDA is calculated as net debt divided by EBITDA.   
‘Free Cash Flow’ is calculated as cash flow from operating activities less cash flow related to investing activities. Free Cash 
Flow for each operating site is calculated as Free Cash Flow before interest and tax.

These materials include forward looking statements. Often, but not always, forward looking statements can generally be identified 
by the use of forward looking words such as “may”, “will”, “expect”, “intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “continue”, “outlook” and 
“guidance”,  or  other  similar  words  and  may  include,  without  limitation,  statements  regarding  plans,  strategies  and  objectives  of 
management, anticipated production or construction commencement dates and expected costs or production outputs. The Company 
continues to distinguish between outlook and guidance in forward looking statements. Guidance statements are a risk-weighted 
assessment constituting Newcrest’s current expectation as to the range in which, for example, its gold production (or other relevant 
metric), will ultimately fall in the current financial year. Outlook statements are a risk-weighted assessment constituting Newcrest’s 
current view regarding the possible range of, for example, gold production (or other relevant metric) in years subsequent to the 
current financial year. 
Forward  looking  statements  inherently  involve  known  and  unknown  risks,  uncertainties  and  other  factors  that  may  cause  the 
Company’s actual results, performance and achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements. 
Relevant  factors  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  changes  in  commodity  prices,  foreign  exchange  fluctuations  and  general 
economic  conditions,  increased  costs  and  demand  for  production  inputs,  the  speculative  nature  of  exploration  and  project 
development,  including  the  risks  of  obtaining  necessary  licences  and  permits  and  diminishing  quantities  or  grades  of  reserves, 
political and social risks, changes to the regulatory framework within which the Company operates or may in the future operate, 
environmental conditions including extreme weather conditions, recruitment and retention of personnel, industrial relations issues 
and litigation.  
Forward looking  statements are  based on the  Company  and its Management’s good faith assumptions relating to the financial, 
market, regulatory and other relevant environments that will exist and affect the Company’s business and operations in the future. 
The Company does not give any assurance that the assumptions on which forward looking statements are based will prove to be 
correct, or that the Company’s business or operations will not be affected in any material manner by these or other factors not 
foreseen or foreseeable by the Company or Management or beyond the Company’s control. Although the Company attempts and 
has attempted to identify factors that would cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those disclosed in forward 
looking statements, there may be other factors that could cause actual results, performance, achievements or events not to be as 
anticipated, estimated or intended, and many events are beyond the reasonable control of the Company. Accordingly, readers are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements in these materials speak only at 
the date of issue. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law or any relevant stock exchange listing rules, in providing 
this information the Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any of the forward looking statements 
or to advise of any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. 
The  guidance  stated  assumes  weighted  average  copper  price  of  US$2.10  per  pound,  silver  price  of  US$16.50  per  ounce  and 
AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.73 for FY17.  
All data relating to operations is shown as 100%, apart from Hidden Valley which is shown at Newcrest’s ownership percentage of

2.  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS AND THE INCOME STATEMENT 
 
2.1.  Profit overview 
Statutory profit was US$332 million and Underlying profit was US$323 million in the current period.   
The Statutory profit in the current period includes significant items (after tax and non-controlling interests) 
with a net benefit of US$9 million, comprising a US$18 million profit on  sale of a financial asset partially offset 
by a US$9 million net expense associated with the settlement and costs of a shareholder class action. 
Underlying profit was US$101 million lower than the prior period primarily driven by lower realised gold and 
copper prices, the suspension of operations at Gosowong in February 2016, higher depreciation expense 
and lower copper sales volumes. This was partially offset by improved financial and operational performance 
at Lihir, positive impact on costs from the weakening of all key operating currencies against the US dollar, 
lower energy prices, and lower income tax expense compared to the prior period.

2.2.  Revenue 
Total sales revenue for the twelve months ended 30 June 2016 of US$3,295 million was US$309 million or 
9% lower than the prior period. Newcrest’s sales revenue continues to be predominantly attributable to gold, 
being 87% of total sales revenue in the current period (82% in the prior period).

Gold revenue of US$2,857 million was 3% lower than the prior period, due to a 5% reduction in the realised 
gold price (US$1,166 per ounce in the current period compared to US$1,221 per ounce in the prior period).   
The gold price impact was partly offset by a 1% increase in gold sales volumes, primarily due to higher ore 
feed grades and milling rates at Lihir and higher throughput at Bonikro. Production and associated sales 
volumes in the current period were adversely impacted by the suspension of operations at Gosowong and 
lower ore volume and mill grades at Telfer.  
Copper revenue of US$403 million was 35% lower than the prior period, driven by a 24% reduction in the 
average realised copper price (US$2.21 per pound in the current period compared to US$2.89 per pound in 
the prior period) and a 16% decrease in copper sales volumes.   
During the current year, Newcrest announced that it had hedged a portion of Telfer’s sales across FY16 to 
FY19. The current period included 64,714 ounces of gold sales hedged at an average price of A$1,707 per 
ounce.

Operating costs of US$1,921 million were US$248 million or 11% lower than the prior period.  
The decrease in operating costs includes a foreign exchange benefit of approximately US$186 million as a 
result of the weakening of the Company’s key operating currencies against the US dollar.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Lower site production costs also related to lower energy prices and continuing cost reductions from the Edge 
improvement program in the form of lower input prices and increased operational efficiency. Unit operating 
costs were adversely impacted at Gosowong following the geotechnical event at Kencana on 8 February 
2016  that  resulted  in  the  suspension  of  mining  activities  at  both  Kencana  and  Toguraci  mines.  Mining 
recommenced at Toguraci on 12 April 2016 and at Kencana on 10 June 2016. 
Lower treatment and realisation costs were largely due to lower copper concentrate production at Cadia and 
Telfer and the lower realised US dollar copper price reducing copper metal deduction payments.  
The increase in depreciation expense compared with the prior period primarily reflects the higher depreciable 
asset base of Telfer following the partial reversal of the Telfer asset impairment at 30 June 2015, higher levels 
of  depreciation  at  Ridgeway  leading  up  to  cessation  of  mining  in  March  2016  and  increased  production 
volumes at Lihir and Bonikro. The weaker Australian dollar against the US dollar partially offset the increase 
in depreciation at Telfer and Ridgeway, where it is an Australian dollar denominated expense. 
As the Company is a US dollar reporting entity, its operating costs will vary in accordance with the movements 
in its operating currencies where those costs are not denominated in US dollars. The table below shows 
indicative currency exposures in FY16 on operating costs by site:

2.4.  Other items 
Corporate administration expenses of US$79 million were 18% lower than the prior period. This included 
Corporate costs of US$53 million, which benefited from a weaker Australian dollar against the US dollar. 
Exploration  expenditure  of  US$44  million  was  16%  higher  than  the  prior  period.  Of  this  exploration 
expenditure, US$32 million was expensed resulting in a capitalisation rate of 27%. 
Other income of US$11 million is described in the table below. The foreign exchange gain in the current 
period primarily relates to the restatement of US dollar denominated concentrate receivables in the Group’s 
Australian dollar functional currency operations (Cadia and Telfer). 
The net fair value gain on gold and copper derivatives and fair value movements on concentrate receivables 
in  the  current  period  primarily  related  to  the  movement  in  spot  prices  and  fair  value  arising  from  the 
quotational  period  adjustments  on  sales.  Newcrest  seeks  to  lock  in  the  gold  and  copper  price  for  the 
quotational period for concentrate shipments at the time of sale using forward sales contracts to minimise 
this impact.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Share  of  profit  of  associates  is  nil  in  the  current  period  as  Newcrest  ceased  equity  accounting  for  its 
investment in Evolution Mining Limited in the second half of FY15 following the partial divestment of the 
shareholding in February 2015.  
2.5.  Income tax 
Income tax expense on Underlying profit was US$121 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 27%, which 
is lower than the Australian company tax rate of 30%. This difference in effective and company tax rate in the 
current year is primarily due to the de-recognition of deferred tax liabilities in relation to Newcrest’s foreign 
operations. In the prior period, income tax expense on Underlying profit was US$211 million with an effective 
tax rate of 32%. The difference in effective and company tax rates in the prior period was due to an adjustment 
to income tax expense following the review of Australian research and development allowances claimed in 
prior periods.   
Income tax expense on Statutory profit in the current period was US$118 million, resulting in an effective tax 
rate of 26%. This is a reduction from the Underlying effective tax rate of 27% as there was no income tax 
expense recognised on the gain on disposal of the shareholding in Evolution Mining Limited.
2.6.  Significant items 
Significant  items  totalling  a  net  benefit  of  US$9  million  (after  tax  and  non-controlling  interests)  were 
recognised for the twelve months ended 30 June 2016 comprising: 
  US$18  million  gain  recognised  following  the  sale  of  Newcrest’s  remaining  shareholding  in  Evolution
Mining Limited.
  US$9 million net expense recognised in respect of the settlement and costs of a shareholder class action.

3.  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOW 
Free cash flow for the current period of US$814 million was US$40 million lower than the prior period. The 
decrease reflects lower cash flows from operating activities primarily due to lower average realised gold and 
copper prices, and the suspension of operations at Gosowong, partially offset by lower operating costs and 
improved financial and operational performance at Lihir. 
All operations were free cash flow positive before tax in the current period.

Cash outflow from investing activities of US$427 million was US$1 million higher than the prior period, with 
increased sustaining  capital  expenditure  primarily  at  Lihir,  Telfer and  Gosowong  partially  offset  by  lower 
expenditure on major projects and production stripping. Investing cash flows includes US$88 million received 
from the sale of Newcrest’s remaining interest in Evolution Mining Limited (US$82 million in the prior period).
Capital expenditure of US$471 million in the twelve months ended 30 June 2016 comprised: 
  Production  stripping  of  US$54  million  reflecting  production  stripping  at  Phase  14  at  Lihir  and  the 
commencement of production stripping at Telfer (Main Dome Stage 6/7 and West Dome Interim Stage 
2) and Bonikro (Hiré pit). Production stripping at Phase 9 at Lihir was concluded in the prior period.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
  Sustaining  capital  expenditure  of  US$251  million  with  higher  expenditure  at  Gosowong  due  to  the 
commencement of works to extend the tailing storage facility in the current period and the replacement 
of mobile fleet. Higher expenditure at Telfer was driven by an increase in underground development, 
whilst the increased expenditure at Lihir was primarily due to the planned component replacement of the 
existing fleet. Lower expenditure at Cadia was a result of completion of projects in the prior period.
  Major project, or non-sustaining, capital expenditure of US$166 million primarily related to:
o  Cadia East development: the current period focussed on the installation of upgraded ground 
support and restart of undercut firing and production drilling after the seismic event in February 
2015, as well as continued roadway development in Panel Cave 2. Construction continued on 
the  expanded  concentrate  dewatering  facility  at  Blayney.  Total  expenditure  was,  however, 
US$60 million lower than the prior period.
o  Lihir major projects: Major project spend focussed on increasing processing plant throughput and
additional mining fleet capacity to drive a substantial increase in total material movement.
o  Wafi-Golpu: an update on the Stage One Feasibility Study and Stage Two Prefeasibility Study 
was released to the market in February 2016. The update on the feasibility study for Stage One 
confirmed that access declines are required to undertake more drilling of the orebody at depth to 
inform the next stage of the feasibility study. The Joint Venture parties are progressing permitting 
and the application for a Special Mining Lease, while concurrently continuing discussions on a 
suitable fiscal and stability framework and supporting arrangements with the Papua New Guinea 
government. Changes to the level and manner of local equity participation in new projects are 
being considered as part of the Papua New Guinea government’s continuing review of the mining 
act.
Exploration activity was characterised by an increase in greenfield exploration spend.

The growth pipeline increased with a number of new exploration projects in Australia, Papua New Guinea, 
New Zealand, West Africa and Nicaragua commencing during the financial year.  
Exploration on these projects commenced with target generation undertaken on all new projects including 
drilling at Mungana (Queensland), Wamum (Papua New Guinea) and projects within New Zealand and West 
Africa. This work has been successful in identifying new targets and new zones of mineralisation. 
Exploration  continued  at  all  brownfield  sites  with  drilling  ongoing  at  Gosowong,  Cadia  and  Telfer.  At 
Gosowong exploration focussed on incremental resource growth around the existing operations and new 
discoveries  within  the  region.  At  Telfer,  the  exploration  was  focussed  on  resource  growth  around  the 
underground  operation  at  Main  Dome.  Resource  definition  and  target  generation  exploration  was  also 
undertaken at Cadia.

Marginally higher gold production for the current period was primarily the result of higher head grade due to 
Cadia East ore replacing Ridgeway ore (with Ridgeway placed on care and maintenance in March 2016). 
Improved  recovery  rates  were  also  partially  offset  by  a  5%  reduction  in  ore  milled  year-on-year,  largely 
attributed to the Concentrator 1 SAG outage in October 2015.   
Panel Cave 2 ore production continued to ramp up whilst development focussed on the completion of the 
extraction level and cave propagation. 
The lower EBIT in the current period was driven by a 5% decrease in the realised gold price and 24% decrease 
in the realised copper price. Lower cost of sales were primarily due to the 13% decline in the Australian dollar 
relative to the US dollar. Higher depreciation charges were due to increased depreciation at Ridgeway related 
to the cessation of mining in March 2016 and the ramp up of Cadia East volumes. 
A higher All-In Sustaining Cost per ounce was the result of the lower realised copper price and lower copper 
production impacting by-product credits, partially offset by reduced cost of sales and lower sustaining capital 
expenditure.   
Free cash flow was only 1% lower year on year, with the impact of lower realised gold and copper prices offset 
by lower costs benefitting from the weaker Australian dollar, favourable working capital movements (driven by 
concentrate sales matching production volumes) and reduced development expenditure at Cadia East.

Lower gold and copper production for the current period was primarily the result of lower head grade, driven 
by  lower  underground  ore  production  and  lower  grade  open  pit  material  mined,  with  mill  feed  volumes 
supplemented by low grade stockpile material. Lower production from underground operations resulted from 
equipment interaction issues related to infrastructure development to access the lower sub-level cave levels 
and the Western Flanks. The adverse impact of lower grade was partially offset by higher gold recovery rates 
from the processing plant. 
Lower revenue reflected the related reduction in sales volumes, a 5% decrease in the realised US dollar gold 
price and 24% decrease in the realised US dollar copper price.   
During the current year, Newcrest announced that it had hedged a portion of sales at Telfer across FY16 to 
FY19. The current period included 64,714 ounces of gold sales hedged at an average price of A$1,707 per 
ounce.   
The increase in cost of sales in the period was due to the increase in depreciation charges as a result of the 
partial reversal of the asset impairment at 30 June 2015.  
Lower operating costs reflected the lower production volumes and benefits from the weaker Australian dollar 
and the Edge improvement program.  
The increase in All-In Sustaining Cost per ounce and a decline in free cash flow were largely due to the lower 
volumes and lower realised gold and copper prices, as well as increases in both sustaining capital expenditure 
and production stripping expenditure. The increase in capital expenditure is associated with the ramp up of 
underground development activities whilst production stripping activity increased as a result of commencing 
waste stripping in Main Dome Stage 6/7 and West Dome Interim Stage 2.  
The All-In Sustaining Cost per ounce was also impacted by redundancies associated with the transition of 
open pit operations to contract mining in February 2016. The current period has been normalised (i.e. reduced) 
by US$17 per ounce for this redundancy cost. At a Group level, this normalisation adjustment reduced the 
Group All-In Sustaining Cost by US$3 per ounce.

Lihir’s  operating  performance  and  financial  results  for  the  current  period  demonstrate  the  sustained 
improvement achieved as a result of Edge business improvement initiatives that are debottlenecking the plant, 
reducing costs and improving efficiencies.  
Record  annual  grinding  throughput  of  12.1mt  and  record  annual  gold  production  of  900,034  ounces  were 
achieved in the current year. The increase in production volume was driven by a 24% increase in head grade, 
improved plant stability due to blended ore providing a more consistent feed, and improved plant reliability 
resulting in a 12% increase in milled tonnes. There was a 6% decrease in recovery rates, primarily due to the 
higher flotation rates and lower oxidation through the autoclaves (with partial oxidation the operating strategy 
applied in FY16).  
EBIT was significantly higher due to the record production, lower energy prices, lower labour costs and mining 
efficiencies. This was partially offset by a 5% decrease in the average realised gold price, higher mobile fleet 
maintenance charges and the cost of planned fixed plant shut downs during the period. Costs benefitted from 
a 13% decline in the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar, and a 14% decline in the Papua New Guinea 
Kina relative to the US dollar. Higher depreciation expense accompanied the increased level of production.   
A lower All-In Sustaining Cost per ounce reflects the higher grade and lower operating costs, partially offset 
by an increase in sustaining capital expenditure. Production stripping activity commenced in Phase 14 during 
the period. 
Free cash flow of US$307 million was significantly higher in the current period, driven by improved operating 
performance partially offset by increased capital expenditure on projects delivering efficiencies in both the mine 
and  the  plant.  Non-sustaining  capital  expenditure  related  to  increasing  processing  plant  throughput  and 
additional mining fleet capacity to drive a substantial increase in total material movement.

The operating and financial performance for the current period was significantly impacted by the geotechnical 
event at Kencana on 8 February 2016 which resulted in the suspension of mining activities at both Kencana 
and Toguraci mines. Mining recommenced at Toguraci on 12 April 2016 and at Kencana on 10 June 2016.  
The All-In Sustaining Cost per ounce was also impacted by increased sustaining capital expenditure due to 
work commencing on an extension of the Tailings Storage Facility. The current period has been normalised 
(i.e. reduced) by US$94 per ounce for the suspension of operations at Toguraci and Kencana. At a Group 
level, this normalisation adjustment reduced the Group All-In Sustaining Cost by US$9 per ounce. 
The impact of this geotechnical event has resulted in a revised mining sequence and a move to cut and fill as 
the sole mining method to be employed at Kencana. With the change in mining method, the ore production 
capacity in terms of ore mined from Gosowong is expected to be approximately three quarters of the production 
levels  previously  achieved  prior  to  the  geotechnical  event.  It  is  expected  that  Gosowong  will  ramp  up 
production to this level during the first quarter of FY17.

Increased gold production for the current period was primarily the result of increased throughput due to a 
higher portion of ore from the Hiré pit. The Hiré ore has a higher percentage of oxide material, resulting in 
lower overall ore hardness and increased mill rates. Mining in the Bonikro pit ceased in October 2015 and the 
Bonikro pit was placed on care and maintenance. The lower head grade was the result of blending low-grade 
stockpiled Bonikro ore with higher grade Hiré ore.   
The lower EBIT was due to the processing of low-grade stockpiled Bonikro ore and a 5% decrease in the 
average realised gold price, partially offset by higher sales volumes.   
A  higher  All-In  Sustaining Cost  per ounce  reflects  increased sustaining capital  expenditure and  increased 
production stripping activity in the Hiré pit.   
Free cash flow was in line with the prior year with the benefit of an increase in gold sales volumes largely offset 
by increased capital expenditure.

Lower  gold  production  for  the  current  period  reflected  a  combination  of  lower  gold  head  grade  and  lower 
material milled. Lower gold head grade was driven by both lower grade ore mined and the supplementing of 
ore  mined  with  lower  grade  stockpiled  ore  during  the  period.  Lower  material  milled  reflected  unplanned 
suspensions of the operation during the period.  
Improved EBIT was primarily driven by lower depreciation, partially offset by a 5% decrease in the average 
realised gold price. Lower depreciation expense reflected the impairment to the carrying value of the Hidden 
Valley assets at 30 June 2015.   
A lower All-In Sustaining Cost per ounce was due to lower costs, along with a reduction in sustaining capital 
expenditure and no production stripping expenditure in the period.   
Positive free cash flow of US$10 million was achieved as a result of lower capital expenditure, with capital 
expenditure for the period largely limited to the Tailings Storage Facility.   
The Hidden Valley Joint Venture partners continue to review all strategic options in relation to the future of 
Hidden  Valley.  Pre-stripping  for  Stage  5  area  of  the  Kaveroi  pit,  which  has  a  lead  time  to  first  ore  of 
approximately 18 months, remains on hold with the focus of the operation moving to processing stockpiles and 
reduced level of mining in the Hamata pit. It is expected that processing of the existing low grade stockpiles 
can potentially continue for approximately 12 months.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
6.  NON-IFRS FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
Newcrest results are reported under Australian Accounting Standards (‘AAS’). Compliance with AAS also 
results  in  compliance  with  International  Financial Reporting  Standards  (‘IFRS’).  This report  also  includes 
certain non-IFRS financial information, including EBIT (earnings before interest, tax and significant items), 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and significant items), Underlying profit 
(profit after tax before significant items attributable to owners of the Company), All-In Sustaining Cost and 
All-In Cost (both determined in accordance with the World Gold Council Guidance Note on Non-GAAP Metrics 
released June 2013), Free cash flow (cash flow from operating activities less cash flow related to investing 
activities), Sustaining capital and Major projects (non-sustaining) capital, ROCE and interest coverage ratio. 
These measures are used internally by Management to assess the performance of the business and make 
decisions on the allocation of resources, and are included in this report to provide greater understanding of 
the underlying financial performance of the Group’s operations. When reviewing business performance, this 
non-IFRS information should be used in addition to, and not as a replacement of, measures prepared in 
accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS information has not been subject to audit or review by Newcrest’s 
external auditor.  
The non-IFRS measures do not have any standard definition under IFRS and may be calculated differently 
by other companies. The tables below reconcile these non-IFRS measures to the most appropriate IFRS 
measure, noting that: 
  Sustaining and Major project (non-sustaining) capital are reconciled to investing cash flow in section 3.2;  
  Free cash flow is reconciled to the cash flow statement in section 3.
6.1.  Reconciliation of Statutory profit to Underlying profit 
Underlying  profit,  EBIT  and  EBITDA  is  reported  by  Newcrest  to  provide  greater  understanding  of  the 
underlying business performance of its operations and the Group. These measures exclude significant items 
of income or expense which are, either individually or in aggregate, material to Newcrest or to the relevant 
business segment and are either outside the ordinary course of business or are part of the ordinary activities 
of the business but unusual due to their size and nature. Examples include gains/losses and other costs 
incurred for acquisitions and disposals of mining interests and asset impairment and write-down charges. 
Statutory  profit  and  Underlying  profit  both  represent  profit  after  tax  amounts  attributable  to  Newcrest 
shareholders.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
7.  RISKS 
Newcrest’s  business,  operating  and  financial  results  and  performance  are  subject  to  various  risks  and 
uncertainties, many of which are beyond Newcrest’s reasonable control. Set out below are matters which 
Newcrest has assessed as having the potential to have a material adverse effect on the business, operating 
and/or financial results and performance of the Group. These matters may arise individually, simultaneously 
or in combination. 
The matters identified below are not necessarily listed in order of importance and are not intended as an 
exhaustive list of all of the risks and uncertainties associated with Newcrest’s business. Additional risks and 
uncertainties not presently known to Management, or that Management currently believes to be immaterial 
or manageable, may adversely affect Newcrest’s business. 
Market price of gold, copper and silver 
Fluctuations  in  metal  prices  can  occur  due  to  numerous  factors  beyond  Newcrest’s  control,  including 
macroeconomic and geopolitical factors (such as financial and banking stability, global and regional political 
events, inflationary expectations, changes in interest rates, global economic growth expectations and the 
relative strength of the US dollar), speculative positions taken by investors or traders, actual or expected gold 
purchases and/or sales by central banks, changes in supply or demand for gold, gold hedging and de-hedging 
by producers, and drivers that impact operating costs in major gold producing regions.  
Examples of the potential impact of changes in the metal prices on Newcrest’s total revenue from operations 
in the 2017 financial year include (but are not limited to): 
  a  US$10  per  ounce  change  in  the  average  realised  gold  price  is  estimated  to  have  an  impact  of
approximately US$23 million.
  a US$0.05 per pound change in the average realised copper price is estimated to have an impact of
approximately US$10 million.
Material changes in metal prices may change the economic viability of mining operations, particularly higher 
cost mining operations, which may result in decisions to alter production plans or the suspension or closure 
of mining operations. 
Lower metal prices may also reduce the market value of Newcrest’s gold, copper or silver inventory and 
furthermore  may  result  in  Newcrest  curtailing  or  suspending  its  exploration  activities,  with  the  result  that 
depleted Ore Reserves may not be replaced and/or unmined ore reserves or resources not be mined. 
In addition, historical and current metal price variability may impact upon Newcrest’s assumptions regarding 
future metal prices which, in turn, may affect Newcrest’s current and future operating activities and financial 
results. Examples of the potential impacts of changes to assumptions regarding future metal prices, alone or 
in combination with other factors such as foreign exchange rates, include (but are not limited to): 

changes to proposed project developments or the acceleration, deferral or abandonment of current or 
future project development; 
changes to Newcrest’s estimates of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves; and  
changes  in  the  estimation  of  recoverable  amount  of  Newcrest’s  assets  when  assessing  potential 
accounting impairment of those assets.
 

Foreign exchange rates 
The majority of Newcrest’s revenue is realised in, or linked to, the US dollar on the basis that metals are 
traded globally based on prices quoted in US dollars. Newcrest's operating costs are reported in US dollars 
but are exposed to multiple currencies, including a portion of costs at each operation being denominated in 
the local currency. The relative movement of these currencies (particularly the Australian dollar) against the 
US dollar will impact upon Newcrest’s costs and financial results. An example of the potential impact of foreign 
exchange rate changes on Newcrest’s EBIT in the 2017 financial year is (but not limited to): 

an A$0.01 decrease in the AUD:USD exchange rate is estimated to have a favourable impact on EBIT 
of approximately US$20 million.
Newcrest Mining Limited – Annual Financial Report - Year Ended 30 June 2016
C 27
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
As with assumptions regarding future metal prices, assumptions regarding future foreign exchange rates, 
alone  or  in  combination  with  other  factors,  may  impact  upon  continuing  operations,  project  development 
decisions,  exploration  investment  decisions,  Mineral  Resource  and  Ore  Reserves  estimates  and  the 
assessment of the recoverable amount of Newcrest’s assets. 
Increased costs and commodity inputs 
Operating costs are frequently subject to variations from one year to the next due to a number of factors, 
some  of  which  are  specific  to  a  particular  mine  site,  including  changing  ore  grade,  characteristics  and 
metallurgy, changes in the ratio of ore to waste as the mine plan follows the sequence of extracting the ore 
body, surface and underground haulage distances, underground geotechnical conditions and decisions made 
in respect of the level of sustaining capital invested to maintain operations. 
In addition operating costs and capital expenditure are, to a significant extent, driven by external economic 
conditions impacting on the cost of commodity inputs consumed in extracting and processing ore (including 
fuel,  chemical  reagents,  explosives,  tyres,  electricity  and  steel),  and  labour  costs  associated  with  those 
activities.   
Increases in costs may impact upon the profitability of existing mining operations and future developments, 
Newcrest’s inability to lower its cost profile and meet projected operating cost targets at its existing mines 
and  new  mining  projects,  could  make  certain  mines  or  projects  uneconomic,  and  could  impact  the 
assessment of the recoverable amount of Newcrest’s assets. 
Operating risks and hazards 
Newcrest’s  mining  operations  are  subject  to  operating  risks  and  hazards  including  (without  limitation) 
unanticipated  ground  conditions,  industrial  incidents,  infrastructure  and  equipment  under-performance  or 
failure, shortage of principal supplies, transportation and logistics issues in relation to the Group’s workforce 
and equipment, environmental incidents, health and safety related incidents, interruptions and delays due to 
community issues, and natural events such as seismic activity and severe weather events (including floods 
and drought). 
A  key  operational  risk  for  Newcrest  is  the  availability  of  power  and  water  to  support  mining  and  mineral 
processing activities, particularly at Newcrest’s remotely located assets. Even a temporary interruption of 
power or water supply could adversely affect an operation. 
Newcrest’s operations in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are in areas known to be seismically active and 
are subject to the risks of earthquakes and related risks of tidal surges and tsunamis, which are difficult to 
predict. Some of Newcrest’s operations may also experience other specific operating challenges relating to 
ground conditions and rock temperature, such as at Gosowong and Lihir. 
Newcrest faces particular geotechnical, geothermal and hydrological challenges, in particular due to the trend 
toward  more  complex  deposits,  deeper  and  larger  pits,  and  the  use  of  deep,  bulk  underground  mining 
techniques. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure 
to geotechnical and hydrological impacts. 
There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the block cave mining methods being applied 
by Newcrest at its Cadia operations. Risks include that a cave may not propagate as anticipated, excessive 
air pockets may form during the cave propagation, the caving spans needed for successful cave propagation 
give rise to a risk of unplanned ground movement due to changes in stresses released in the surrounding 
rock and rain, disturbance and the presence of fine materials may also give rise to unplanned release of 
material of varying properties and/or water through drawbells. 
In addition, the success of Newcrest at some of its operations, including the Lihir operation, depends, in part, 
upon  the  implementation  of  Newcrest’s  engineering  solutions  to  particular  hydrological  and  geothermal 
conditions. At Lihir, for example, significant removal of both groundwater and sea water inflow and geothermal 
control is required before and during mining.  
A failure to resolve any unexpected problems relating to these conditions at a commercially reasonable cost 
could adversely affect the safety, economics or feasibility of the impacted operations.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Future operating and capital cost requirements 
Newcrest’s business, operating and financial performance and results may be impacted by the extent to 
which Newcrest's revenues are able to fund its operating and capital expenditure requirements. To the extent 
that these are insufficient, Newcrest may need to draw on available debt facilities or seek additional funds 
through asset divestitures, equity raisings, or debt issue, or additional debt (or some combination of these), 
or may need to defer operating or capital expenditure. 
Newcrest's ability to service current debt arrangements and to raise and service any additional debt or to 
meet conditions applicable to current or future debt arrangements, will be a function of a number of factors, 
including  (without  limitation)  macroeconomic  conditions,  future  gold  and  copper  prices,  Newcrest's  credit 
rating,  operational  cash  flow  and  production  performance.  If  Newcrest  is  unable  to  obtain  any  required 
additional funding on acceptable terms then its business, operating and financial performance and results 
may be impacted. 
Exploration, project evaluation and project development 
Newcrest’s current and future business, operating and financial performance and results are impacted by the 
discovery of new mineral prospects and actual performance of developing and operating mines, which may 
differ significantly from estimates determined at the time the relevant project was approved for development. 
Newcrest’s current or future development activities may not result in expansion or replacement of current 
production, or one or more new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than anticipated or may 
not be profitable at all. 
Newcrest's ability to sustain or increase its current level of production in the future is in part dependent on 
the success of its exploration activities in replacing gold and copper reserves depleted by production, the 
development of new projects and the expansion of  existing operations. In the last decade the time from 
discovery to production has increased significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including increases in 
capital requirements, environmental considerations, economic conditions and the complexity and depth of 
ore bodies. 
In  the  absence  of  exploration  success,  or  additions  to  Newcrest’s  mineral  inventory  to  support  future 
operations through development activities, expansions or acquisitions, Newcrest will be unable to replace 
Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources depleted by operations. 
Exploration activities are speculative in nature and often require substantial expenditure on exploration drilling 
and sampling as a basis on which to establish the presence, extent and estimated grade (metal content) of 
mineralised material. 
Once mineralisation is discovered it may take several years to determine whether adequate Ore Reserves 
and/or  Mineral  Resources  exist  to  support  a  development  decision  and  to  obtain  necessary  ore  body 
knowledge to assess the technical and economic viability of mining projects. During that time the economic 
viability of the project may change due to fluctuations in factors that affect both revenue and costs, including 
commodity prices, currency exchange rates, the required return on capital and future cost of development 
and mining operations. 
Maintaining title 
Newcrest's production, development and exploration activities are subject to obtaining and maintaining the 
necessary titles, authorisations, permits and licences, and associated land access arrangements with the 
local community, which authorise those activities under the relevant law (Authorisations). There can be no 
guarantee that Newcrest will be able to successfully obtain and maintain relevant Authorisations, or obtain 
and maintain relevant Authorisations on terms acceptable to Newcrest, to support its activities, or that renewal 
of existing Authorisations will be granted in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to Newcrest. 
Authorisations held by or granted to Newcrest may also be subject to challenge by third parties which, if 
successful, could impact on Newcrest’s exploration, development and/or mining activities.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Law and regulation 
Newcrest's current and future mining operations, development projects and exploration activities are subject 
to  various  national  and  local  laws,  policies  and  regulations  governing  the  prospecting,  development  and 
mining  of  mineral  deposits,  taxation  and  royalties,  import  and  export  duties  and  restrictions,  exchange 
controls, foreign investment approvals, employee and community relations, health and safety, environmental 
management and other matters, and the manner in which these laws are applied or interpreted. Changes in 
these laws, policies and/or regulations may have the potential to materially alter the value of a particular 
operation and/or the Group as a whole. A failure to comply with legal requirements may result in enforcement 
action being taken against Newcrest with potentially material consequences, including financial penalties, 
suspension of operations and forfeiture. 
In  a  number  of  jurisdictions  where  Newcrest  has  existing  interests,  the  legal  framework  is  increasingly 
complex, subject to change and becoming more onerous. Changes in laws may result in material additional 
expenditure,  taxes  or  costs  or  interruption  to  Newcrest's  activities  in  order  to  comply  with  changing 
requirements. There can also be disputes in relation to the application or interpretation of laws, policies or 
regulations in the countries where Newcrest operates which could have an adverse impact on our operations,   
financial performance and/or value. 
Political, economic, social and security risks 
Newcrest  has  exploration,  development  and  production  activities  that  are  subject  to  political,  economic, 
social, security and other risks and uncertainties.  
These risks and uncertainties are unpredictable, vary from country to country and include but are not limited 
to law and order issues (including varying government capacity to respond), political instability, expropriation 
and/or nationalisation, changes in government ownership levels in projects, fraud, bribery and corruption, 
restrictions  on  repatriation  of  earnings  or  capital,  land  ownership  disputes  and  tenement  access  issues.  
These risks have become more prevalent in recent years, and in particular there has been an increasing 
social and political focus on: 

the revenue derived by governments and other stakeholders from mining activities, which has resulted in 
announced reviews of the fiscal regimes applicable to mining in a number of the jurisdictions in which 
Newcrest has interests (including Papua New Guinea and Indonesia); and
  national control of and benefit from natural resources, with proposed reforms regarding government or 
landowner participation in mining activities, limits on foreign ownership of mining or exploration interests 
and/or forced divestiture (with or without adequate compensation), and broad reform agenda in relation 
to mining legislation, environmental stewardship and local business opportunities and employment.
Recent examples of reviews announced in jurisdictions in which Newcrest has mining and/or exploration 
interests include (without limitation): 

In Indonesia (where Newcrest’s 75% owned Gosowong operations are located), in the context of the 
review of the Gosowong Contract of Work, the Government may seek to reduce the size of the tenement 
holding, impose requirements for additional local equity participation, and make changes to the fiscal 
regime that applies to the project. 
In Papua New Guinea, the Government has undertaken a broad review of mining laws and its taxation 
regime. In addition to the risk of an increased tax cost to the Group’s operations, potential reforms from 
these reviews may include changes to the level and manner of local equity participation in projects and 
the introduction of additional retrospective reporting and compliance requirements which may increase 
operating  costs.  There  is  also  the  risk  of  changes  to  exchange  controls  and/or  laws  or  regulations 
pertaining to the remittance of profits and capital.

There can be no certainty as to what changes, if any, will be made to relevant laws in the jurisdictions where 
the Group has current interests, or other jurisdictions where the Group may have interests in the future, or 
the impact that relevant changes may have on Newcrest’s ability to own and operate its mining and related 
interests and to otherwise conduct its business in those jurisdictions.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Community relations 
Newcrest’s relationship with the communities in which it operates is an essential part of ensuring success of 
its  existing  operations  and  the  development  of  its  projects.  A  failure  to  manage  relationships  with  the 
communities  in  which  Newcrest  operates  may  lead  to  local  dissatisfaction,  which,  in  turn,  may  lead  to 
interruptions  to  Newcrest's  production,  development  and  exploration  activities.  Particular  challenges  in 
community relations include increasing expectations regarding the level of benefits that communities receive 
and the level of transparency regarding the payment of compensation and the provision of other benefits to 
affected landowners and the wider community. 
Typically,  where  Newcrest  has  exploration  activities,  development  projects  or  operations,  it  enters  into 
agreements with local landowners. These agreements include compensation and other benefits and may be 
subject to periodic review. The negotiation and/or review of community agreements, including compensation 
and other benefits, involves complicated and sensitive issues, associated expectations and often competing 
interests, which Newcrest seeks to manage respectfully. The nature and subject matter of these negotiations 
may result in community unrest which, in some instances, results in interruptions to Newcrest’s activities. 
For example, the community agreements in place with customary landowners in relation to Newcrest's Lihir 
operation in Papua New Guinea are the subject of a regular review process. The duration of the review 
process  is  a  result  of  the  important  and  complex  issues  covered  by  the  agreements  and  the  competing 
interests of different landowner groups. During the ongoing review process, and in the context of the previous 
review (FY2000-FY2007), the Lihir operations have experienced periodic disruptions as a result of community 
unrest regarding the progress of the review negotiations and intra-community issues. Although community 
issues are generally resolved within a short period, there can be no assurance that further disputes with the 
customary  landowners  will  not  arise  from  time  to  time  which,  if  prolonged,  could  lead  to  disruptions  to 
Newcrest’s projects and operations. 
In addition, there is a level of community concern relating to the perceived effect of mining activities on the 
environment and on the communities located near such activities. Certain non-government-organisations are 
vocal critics of the mining industry and its practices, including in relation to the use of hazardous substances 
in processing activities and the use of deep sea tailings placement. Adverse publicity generated by non-
government-organisations or others relating to extractive industries generally, or Newcrest specifically, could 
have  an  adverse  impact  on  Newcrest's  reputation  or  financial  condition  and  may  impact  on  Newcrest's 
relationships with the communities in which it operates. No assurance can be given that incidents will not 
arise  that  generate  community  concerns  associated  with  Newcrest's  operations  and  potentially  cause 
disruptions until resolved. 
Health 
There are numerous occupational health risks associated with mining and metallurgical processes. These 
include musculoskeletal disorders, fatigue, mental health illnesses and exposure to noise, diesel particulate 
matter, silica and acid mist. Unforeseen or past workplace exposures may lead to long-term health issues 
and potential compensation liabilities. 
The global nature of our operations also means that our employees may be affected by mosquito borne 
diseases such as malaria, dengue fever or zika virus. Other potential health impacts include tuberculosis, 
and pandemic influenza outbreaks such as swine or avian flu.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Environment and Closure 
Mining operations and development activities have inherent risks and liabilities associated with potential harm 
to the environment and the management of waste products. Newcrest’s operations are therefore subject to 
extensive environmental law and regulation in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Compliance with 
these laws require significant expenditure and non-compliance may potentially result in fines or requests for 
improvement actions from the regulator or could result in reputational harm. 
Newcrest’s  operations  may  create  a  risk  of  exposure  to  hazardous  materials.  Newcrest  uses  hazardous 
material  (for  example,  cyanide)  and  generates  waste  products  that  must  be  disposed  of.  Appropriate 
management of waste is a key consideration in Newcrest's operations. Mining operations can also impact 
flows  and  water  quality  in  surface  and  ground  water  bodies  and  remedial  measures  may  be  required  to 
prevent or minimise such impacts. 
Newcrest is required to close its operations and rehabilitate the lands that it disturbs during the exploration 
and operating phases in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. A closure plan and 
estimate  of  closure  and  rehabilitation  liabilities  are  prepared  for  each  of  Newcrest’s  operations.  These 
estimates of closure and rehabilitation liabilities are based on current knowledge and assumptions, however 
actual costs at the time of closure and rehabilitation may vary materially. In addition, adverse or deteriorating 
external  economic  conditions  may  bring  forward  mine  closure  and  associated  closure  and  rehabilitation 
costs. 
Resources and reserves 
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates are necessarily imprecise and involve subjective judgements 
regarding a number of factors including (but not limited to) grade distribution and/or mineralisation, the ability 
to  economically  extract  and  process  mineralisation,  and  future  commodity  prices,  exchange  rates  and 
operating  costs.  Such  estimates  relate  to  matters  outside  Newcrest’s  reasonable  control  and  involve 
statistical analysis which may subsequently prove to be unreliable or flawed. 
Newcrest’s  annual  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore  Reserves  statement  is  based  upon  a  number  of  factors, 
including (without limitation) exploration drilling and production results, geological interpretations, economic 
assumptions (such as future commodity prices and exchange rates) and operating and other costs. These 
factors may result in reductions in Newcrest's Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates, which could 
adversely affect the life-of-mine plans and may impact upon the value attributable to Newcrest’s mineral 
inventory and/or the assessment of realisable value of one or more of Newcrest’s assets and/or depreciation 
expense. 
Reliance on contractors 
Some aspects of Newcrest's production, development and exploration activities are conducted by contract 
mining operators. As a result, Newcrest's business, operating and financial performance and results may be 
negatively impacted upon by the availability and performance of these contractors and their financial strength. 
The  material  risks  associated  with  contract  mining  operators  at  Newcrest’s  sites  includes  the  risk  of  the 
contractor or its sub-contractors being involved in a safety or environmental incident and the potential for 
interruption to Newcrest’s operations due to a Contractor becoming insolvent.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Marketing 
Newcrest  produces  mineral  concentrates  which  are  exported  by  ocean  vessels  to  smelters,  located 
predominantly in Asia, with associated risks including (without limitation) fluctuating smelter charges, marine 
transportation  charges  and  inland  freight  charges.  Transportation  of  the  concentrate  is  also  subject  to 
numerous risks including (without limitation) delays in delivery of shipments, terrorism, loss of or reduced 
access to export ports, weather conditions and environmental liabilities in the event of an accident or spill. 
Sales of concentrate may also be adversely impacted by disruption at the operations of one or more of the 
receiving smelters and consequent declarations of force majeure at such smelters. Additionally, the quality 
of  mineral  concentrates,  including  the  presence  of  impurities  and  deleterious  substances,  is  subject  to 
restrictions on import which vary across jurisdictions and may impact upon the saleability or price realised for 
the mineral concentrate. 
Human resources and industrial relations 
Newcrest competes with mining and other companies to attract and retain key employees and third party 
contractors with appropriate technical skills and managerial experience necessary to continue to operate its 
business. There can be no assurance that Newcrest will be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced 
personnel and, should Newcrest lose any of its key personnel or fail to attract personnel, its business may be 
harmed and its operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
Newcrest may be impacted by industrial relations issues in connection with its employees and the employees 
of Newcrest's contractors and suppliers. Any such activity could cause production delays, increased labour 
costs and adversely impact Newcrest's ability to meet its production forecasts. 
In  a  number  of  jurisdictions  where  Newcrest  has  mining  and  related  interests,  there  are  also  local 
requirements or expectations regarding the extent to which local and national persons are directly engaged 
in the mining and related activities which may result in disruptions to Newcrest’s activities where relevant 
requirements and/or expectations are not met. There can be no assurance that disruptions will not occur in 
the future which may have an adverse effect on Newcrest’s business. Similarly, there can be no assurance 
that Newcrest will be able to attract and retain suitably qualified and experienced local or national personnel, 
or that unskilled persons trained by Newcrest will be retained, in the future. 
Competition for projects to replace Ore Reserves 
Significant gold deposits are becoming more difficult to find, are deeper and often in remote and challenging 
jurisdictions.  The  declining  rate  of  discovery  of  new  gold  deposits  has,  in  recent  years,  increased  the 
challenge of replacing the mining depletion of existing resources and reserves throughout the global gold 
sector. Newcrest faces intense competition for acquisition of attractive exploration and mining properties to 
replace reserves depleted by mining. As a result of this competition, exploration and acquisitions may not 
result in Newcrest being able to maintain or increase its Ore Reserves which could negatively impact its future 
business, operating and financial performance and results. 
Newcrest evaluates potential acquisition and development opportunities for mineral deposits, exploration or 
development properties and operating mines. Newcrest's decision to acquire or develop these properties is 
based on a variety of factors, including historical operating results, estimates and assumptions regarding the 
extent  and  quality  of  mineralisation,  resources  and  reserves,  assessment  of  the  potential  for  further 
discoveries or growth in resources and reserves, development and capital costs, cash and other operating 
costs, expected future commodity prices, projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or potential 
liabilities  associated  with  the  relevant  assets  and  how  these  factors  may  change  in  future.  Other  than 
historical operating results (if applicable), these factors are uncertain and could have an impact on revenue, 
cash  and  other  operating  results,  as  well  as  the  process  used  to  estimate  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore 
Reserves.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Joint venture arrangements  
Newcrest has joint venture interests, including its interests in the Hidden Valley mine and Wafi Golpu Project 
in Papua New Guinea, the Gosowong mine in Indonesia and the Namosi project in Fiji. These operations are 
subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of Joint Ventures which include (but are not limited 
to) disagreement with joint venture partners on how to develop and operate the mines or projects efficiently, 
inability of joint venture partners to meet their financial and other joint venture commitments and particular 
risks associated with entities where a sovereign State holds an interest, including the extent to which the 
State intends to engage in project decision making and the ability of the State to fund its share of project 
costs. The existence or occurrence of one or more of these circumstances or events may have a negative 
impact on Newcrest’s future business, operating and financial performance and results, and/or value of the 
underlying asset. 
New acquisitions 
Newcrest's ability to make successful acquisitions and any difficulties or time delays in achieving successful 
integration  of  any  such  acquisitions  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  its  business,  operating  results  and 
financial condition. Business combinations and acquisitions entail a number of risks including the effective 
integration  of  acquisitions  to  realise  synergies,  unanticipated  costs  and  liabilities  and  issues  impacting 
production. Newcrest may also be liable for the acts or omissions of predecessors or otherwise exposed to 
liabilities that were unforeseen or greater than anticipated. These and other factors may result in reductions 
in the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates for the acquired business, and/or impact upon the 
value attributable to the acquired business. 
Macro-economic conditions 
Newcrest's operating and financial performance is influenced by a variety of macro-economic and business 
conditions including the level of inflation, interest rates, exchange rates and government fiscal, monetary and 
regulatory policies. Prolonged deterioration in general economic conditions, change or deterioration in the 
rate of economic growth including changes to interest rates or decrease in consumer and business demand, 
could be expected to ultimately have an impact on Newcrest's business, results of operations or financial 
condition and performance. 
Information Technology 
Newcrest’s operations are supported by information technology (IT) systems, consisting of infrastructure, 
networks, applications, and service providers. Newcrest could be subject to network and systems interference 
or  disruptions  from  a  number  of  sources,  including  (without  limitation)  security  breaches,  cyber-attacks, 
natural  disasters  and  system  defects.  The  impact  of  IT  systems  interference  or  disruption  could  include 
production downtime, operational delays, destruction or corruption of data and disclosure of commercially 
sensitive  information  any  of  which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  Newcrest's  business,  operations  or 
financial condition and performance. 
Uninsured risks 
In addition to maintaining insurances required by law, Newcrest maintains a range of insurance policies to 
assist in mitigating the impact of events which could have a significant adverse effect on its operations and 
profitability. Newcrest's insurances do not cover all potential risks associated with its business. Newcrest may 
elect not to insure, or to self-insure against certain risks, where the premiums associated with insuring against 
those risks are considered to be excessive or for various other reasons, including an assessment that the 
risks are remote. Further, Newcrest's insurance policies carry deductibles and limits which apply in the event 
of a claim which may lead to Newcrest not recovering the full monetary impact of an insured event, and are 
subject to policy terms and conditions (including exclusions) which may impact on the extent to which a 
relevant policy responds to the circumstances of a claim. The occurrence of events for which Newcrest is not 
insured, or in respect of which relevant insurances do not respond fully, may adversely affect Newcrest's 
financial condition and performance.

Liquidity and Indebtedness 
In  addition  to  cash  flows  from  operating  activities,  Newcrest  has  a  range  of  debt  facilities  with  external 
financiers – including unsecured bilateral bank loan facilities, corporate unsecured senior notes (or ‘bonds’) 
and private placement unsecured notes. Newcrest has sought to structure these debt facilities to have varying 
maturities so that its refinancing obligations are staggered. Although Newcrest currently generates sufficient 
funds to service its debt requirements, no assurance can be given that Newcrest will be able to meet its 
financial covenants, its debt repayment obligations, or be able to refinance the debt prior to its expiry on 
acceptable  terms  to  Newcrest.  If  Newcrest  is  unable  to  meet  its  financial  covenants  or  debt  repayment 
obligations when required or refinance its external debt on acceptable terms, its financial condition and ability 
to continue operating may be adversely affected. 
Litigation 
Litigation  has  the  potential  to  negatively  impact  upon  Newcrest’s  business,  operating  and  financial 
performance and results. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of litigation (which may be subject to appeal), 
and whether involving regulatory action or civil claims, litigation may have a material impact on Newcrest as 
a result of the costs associated with litigation (some of which may not be recoverable) and the management 
time associated with defending litigation. 
The notes to Newcrest’s Financial Statements provide details regarding certain current and potential litigation 
involving Newcrest.

REMUNERATION REPORT
15 August 2016
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, we are pleased to provide Newcrest’s Remuneration Report for the  year ended 30 
June 2016, for which we seek your support at our Annual General Meeting (AGM) in November 2016.
Year in review
The 2016 financial year was another strong year of free cashflow generation, notwithstanding lower average 
realised prices for gold and copper and the adverse impact of unplanned interruptions to production at some 
operations, most notably at Gosowong. The continuation of the improved production and financial performance 
of Lihir and ramp up of Cadia East was very pleasing. The free cashflow was applied to the reduction of debt, 
which  had  the  effect  of  bringing  the  Company’s  leverage  and  gearing  ratios  inside  the  target  range  we 
communicated at the start of the financial year. This strengthening financial position and outlook has provided 
the basis for the Directors determining to pay a final dividend, whilst also preserving the capacity to fund future 
growth.
As foreshadowed in the 2015 Remuneration Report, during the past financial year Tim Poole and Vince Gauci 
retired and Xiaoling Liu and Roger Higgins joined the Board.  Richard Knight will retire from the Board, with 
effect from 16 August 2016 and Vickki McFadden will join the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director 
(NED) with effect from 1 October 2016.
Two  Executive  General  Managers  left  the  Company  during  the  past  financial  year,  and  we  underwent  an 
extensive search for  suitable  Executives  to assist  us  in achieving our  strategic  objectives.    Michael  Nossal 
joined  as  Chief  Development  Officer,  Ian  Kemish  joined  as  Executive  General  Manager  Public  Affairs  and 
Social  Performance  and  Philip  Stephenson  was  promoted  to  Executive  General  Manager  Gosowong  and 
Telfer.  In  September  2016,  Jane  Thomas,  Executive  General  Manager  People,  will  leave  the  Company 
following her resignation and the process to fill her role is underway.  We believe that we have a very strong 
Executive team in place to manage the Company going forward.
Our good financial and operational performance was overshadowed by two tragic fatalities in the 2016 financial 
year – one at the Hidden Valley Joint Venture (in which the Company has a 50% interest) in July 2015 and 
one at Cadia in September 2015. An intensive review of all aspects of our safety processes and initiatives was 
undertaken and the Company is now implementing a comprehensive plan aimed at improving safety culture 
and  performance.  The  Board  and  Management  remain  focussed  on  safety  and  will  relentlessly  seek  to 
eliminate fatalities and life-altering injuries from the Company’s operations.
Remuneration outcomes and changes
The  remuneration  outcomes  for  our  Key  Management  Personnel  (KMP)  reflect  the  performance  outlined 
above.  Short term incentive outcomes for our Executives range from 54% to 67% of their potential maximum.  
19.1% of the 2012 Long Term Incentive (LTI) Plan vested during the 2016 financial year, reflecting the difficult 
challenges facing the Company for the three year period to 30 June 2015.
The Board takes great care to ensure that Newcrest’s remuneration frameworks are aligned to the Company’s 
strategy and performance and result in appropriate remuneration outcomes for Executives.  On this basis, the 
Board has made further improvements to some aspects of the framework following consultation with a number 
of  shareholders  and  proxy  advisers.    The  key  changes  implemented  during  the  2016  financial  year  (as 
foreshadowed in the 2015 Remuneration Report) are set out in the Report and include:
implementation of Short Term Incentive (STI) deferral, which covers all Executives;
 
  modification of the LTI measure for Reserves and Resources so that calculation is on a ‘per share’ basis;  
 

introduction of an overarching clawback policy that applies to LTI and STI awards; and 
introduction of a minimum shareholding requirement which covers all KMP.

REMUNERATION REPORT
The  key  change  that  is  planned  for  the  2017  financial  year  (described  in  more  detail  in  the  Report)  is  the 
introduction of relative total shareholder return (Relative TSR) as a performance condition for one-third of the 
LTI grant in place of the previous “strategic performance” measure.
Newcrest  remains  committed  to  ensuring  that  the  Company’s  Executive  remuneration  framework  and 
outcomes attract, reward and retain high calibre people and drive strong individual and Group performance in 
the interests of both the Company and its shareholders. We will continue to monitor and improve the framework 
as required during the 2017 financial year.  We thank you for your feedback and continued support.

REMUNERATION SNAPSHOT
1.1.
Key remuneration outcomes
Key remuneration outcomes for the 2016 financial year are summarised in the table below.
STI Outcomes
LTI Outcomes
The average STI outcome for Executives was 60.3% of the maximum opportunity based on the 
assessment of business and personal measures.  This reflects the Company’s strong financial 
performance, but disappointing safety performance, during the year.
19.1% of the 2012 LTI Plan vested during the 2016 financial year, reflecting the difficult 
challenges facing the Company during the three year period to 30 June 2015. This equates to 9% 
of the value of the original award, taking into account share price movements over the life of the 
award. The portion that vested recognises Management’s efforts in cost management and 
reduction relative to their peers whilst achieving production guidance during a particularly 
challenging period.
The 2013 LTI Plan (under which grants of LTIs were made in the 2014 financial year) is expected 
to vest on or around 16 September 2016 and it is anticipated that the vesting levels will be in the 
range of 25% to 33.3%.
Executive Remuneration
Executives received no increase in fixed remuneration during the 2016 financial year where they 
remained in their existing roles.
NED Remuneration
NEDs received no fee increases during the 2016 financial year.
1.2.
What changed in relation to the remuneration framework during the 2016 financial year?
The table below summarises the key changes to the Executive remuneration framework implemented during 
the 2016 financial year (all of which were foreshadowed in the 2015 Remuneration Report).
STI Deferral introduced for 
Executives
STI deferral was introduced for all Executives, with 50% of any STI award for an Executive being 
deferred into shares.  50% of the deferred shares are released after 12 months, with the 
remainder released after two years.  Refer to section 4.4 for further details.
Changes in LTI Measures
For the 2015 LTI Plan, the reserves replacement and resources replacement measures were 
stated and calculated on a “per share” basis and the diversity targets were updated.  Refer to 
section 4.5.2 for further details.
Clawback
An overarching General Clawback Policy was introduced.  It allows the Board to recover an 
amount from any unpaid, unvested, restricted or future LTI and/or STI award for a period of two 
years from vesting or the award date, if it is determined that an inappropriate benefit has been 
conferred on an employee. Refer to sections 4.4.1 and 4.5.1 for further details.
Minimum Shareholding 
Requirements
Minimum shareholding requirements were introduced for all KMP with effect from 1 July 2015. 
Refer to section 8.1 for further details.
1.3.
What changes occurred to reporting during the 2016 financial year?
As reported to the market on 17 December 2015, Newcrest changed its reporting (presentation) currency from 
Australian dollars to US dollars in the 2016 financial year.  In line with this change, Newcrest has also changed 
the currency which is used in this Report to US dollars.
Comparative financial information included in this Report, previously reported in Australian dollars has been 
restated into US dollars.  Executive remuneration, which is paid in Australian dollars, has also been translated 
into US dollars. The Total Fixed Remuneration for Executives in Australian dollars is shown in section 4.3 to 
enable comparisons to be made in future years  without the impact of changes in exchange rates. The NED 
fees in Australian dollars are shown in section 7.3.

REMUNERATION REPORT
1.4.
What changes are planned for the 2017 financial year?
In  addition  to  the  above,  the  Board  plans  to  make  the  changes  to  the  Company’s  Executive  remuneration 
framework set out below, to be implemented during the course of the 2017 financial year to more closely align 
the interests of Executives with the interests of shareholders.
Change in LTI measures
Relative TSR will be a new measure in the 2016 LTI Plan which will apply for one-third of the LTI 
grant and replace the Strategic Performance measure in the 2015 LTI Plan. The four elements of 
the Strategic Performance measure  - Resources and Reserves, Organisational Health, Diversity 
and Growth - continue to be considered important by the Board, but will be embedded into each 
Executive’s short-term objectives, underpinned by the STI Plan.
The  vesting  schedule  for  the  Comparative  Cost  Position  measure  in  the  2016  LTI  Plan  will  be 
amended, with: 
  maximum  vesting to  occur if  Comparative  Costs  are  below the  25th  percentile  (previously  it
was the lowest decile); and
  minimum vesting to occur if Comparative Costs are below the 50th percentile, but the vesting
level at this minimum vesting trigger will be reduced from 50% to 40%.
These  changes  are  aimed  at  ensuring  that  the  performance  required  for  maximum  vesting  is 
challenging but achievable, in light of the tendency for the lowest cost peers to be small, single-
mine  producers  who  are  not  comparable  to  companies  with  Newcrest’s  scale  and  breadth  of 
operations.  The level of vesting to occur for achieving the minimum threshold level of performance 
has been decreased to offset the easing of the target for maximum vesting. Refer to section 4.5.3 
for further details.
In relation to the third performance measure, Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), the Board is 
currently undertaking a review.  See section 4.5.3 for further details.
The remuneration policy of the Company is to attract and retain talented people and reward them appropriately 
for performance. During the course of the 2017 financial year the Board will review whether the total reward 
offering (inclusive of fixed remuneration, short term incentive and long term incentive) appropriately delivers 
on these policy objectives.
1.5.
Actual Remuneration Table
The table below details the cash and value of other benefits actually received by the current Executives in the 
2016 financial year.  This is a voluntary disclosure. It includes non-IFRS financial information and some of the 
figures  in  this  table  have  not  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards.    An 
explanation of the relevant remuneration items included in the table is provided in the associated footnotes.
The Board believes that presenting information in this way provides shareholders with increased clarity and 
transparency.
See  section  9.1  for  the  statutory  remuneration  table  that  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian 
Accounting Standards.

REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE
3.1.
Role of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee (HRR Committee)
The Board takes an active role in the governance and oversight of Newcrest’s remuneration policies and is 
responsible for ensuring that the Company’s remuneration strategy aligns with Newcrest’s short and long term 
business objectives.
The  HRR  Committee  reviews,  formulates  and  makes  recommendations  to  the  Board  in  relation  to  matters 
within  its  Charter,  including  the  remuneration  arrangements  of  the  CEO,  Executives  and  the  NEDs,  and 
oversees the major components of the Board’s approved remuneration strategy.
The  Charter  for  the  HRR  Committee  is  available  on  the  Company’s  website:  www.newcrest.com.au/about-
us/corporate-governance.
Current  members  of  the  HRR  Committee  are  Rick  Lee  (Chairman),  Philip  Aiken,  Xiaoling  Liu  and 
Winifred Kamit.
3.2.
External Remuneration Consultants
During the 2016 financial year, the HRR Committee obtained advice from KPMG as part of the review of the 
Company’s remuneration arrangements, including:
  benchmarking data for CEO, Executive and NED remuneration; and 

information and insights with respect to market practices and trends in remuneration within ASX listed and 
global gold companies, including use of TSR as an LTI metric.
KPMG did not provide a remuneration recommendation as defined by the Corporations Act 2001.
The engagement of KPMG was  initiated  by the HRR Committee, based on agreed protocols governing the 
engagement and processes set out in the Company’s External Remuneration Consultants Policy.

OUR EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK
4.1.
Remuneration Strategy
Our remuneration strategy is to provide market-competitive levels of remuneration, having regard to the size 
and complexity of the Company, the scope and work of each role, and the impact the Executive can have on 
Company performance.
Our  policy  is  to  offer  a  competitive  total  remuneration  package  for  Executives,  benchmarked  against 
comparable roles in ASX 11 – 40 companies, including a subset of industrial, materials, energy and utilities 
companies, as well as the following global gold mining companies: Goldcorp Inc, Yamana Gold Inc, Freeport-
McMoran Copper & Gold, Polyus Gold International Ltd, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited, AngloGold Ashanti Ltd, 
Barrick Gold Corporation,  Gold Fields Ltd, Eldorado  Gold Corp, Kinross Gold Corporation, IAMGOLD  Corp 
and  Newmont  Mining  Corporation.  Total  Fixed  Remuneration  (TFR)  is  targeted  at  the  50th  percentile  for 
comparable roles and experience/skills, while the total remuneration package for each Executive (inclusive of 
both  fixed  and  variable  remuneration)  is  targeted  at  up  to  the  75th  percentile  for  comparable  roles  and 
experience/skills.
The key elements of the remuneration strategy in determining the remuneration mix are:
  market  competitive  levels  of  remuneration  having  regard  to  both  the  level  of  work  and  the  impact
employees can potentially have on Company performance;
  appropriate levels of “at risk” performance pay to encourage, recognise and reward high performance; 
  group  performance  measures  that  align  performance  incentives  with  the  long  term  interests  of
shareholders;
  attraction and retention of talented, high performing Executives (including the provision of sign-on grants
where appropriate to attract key talent); and
  a remuneration structure that provides an appropriate balance of risk and reward sharing between each
participant and the Company.

The  diagram  below  outlines  the  remuneration  components  (other  than  any  sign-on  grants)  for  the  2016 
financial year for all Executives. Further details regarding each of the remuneration components are provided

Total Fixed Remuneration (TFR)
Feature
Description
Composition
TFR comprises base salary, superannuation contributions in line with statutory obligations, and any salary 
packaged amounts (for example, novated lease vehicles). TFR is paid in Australian dollars.
Relevant 
Considerations
Review
TFR  is  determined  on  an  individual  basis,  considering  the  scope  of  the  role,  the  individual’s  skills  and 
expertise, individual and group performance, market movements and competitiveness. For the 2016 financial 
year, the total remuneration packages for the majority of the Executives, including the CEO, were within the 
50 – 75% target range of the benchmarked ASX comparator groups.
TFR is reviewed annually, with any increases taking effect on 1 October each year. There were no increases 
to TFR for existing roles in the October 2015 salary review.  The only increase to TFR for existing roles in 
the August 2016 salary review  was for the CFO, who will receive an increase of 6.2% to A$975,000 with 
effect  from  1  October  2016,  following  benchmarking  that  was  undertaken  and  an  expansion  in  his 
accountabilities.
Set  out  below  is  the  TFR  for  the  current  Executives  as  at  30  June  2016,  shown  in  Australian  dollars.  This 
information is provided to enable comparisons to be made in future years, without  the impact of changes in 
exchange rates.

4.4.1.  Key features of the STI Plan for the 2016 financial year
Feature
Description
Participation
Opportunity
All Executives participate in the STI Plan. All employees from Supervisor level and above are also invited to 
participate in the STI Plan.
Target percentages awarded differ by level.   For “at target” performance, the CEO  has the opportunity to 
receive 100% of TFR; the CFO, CDO and EGM – Cadia and MMJV have the opportunity to receive 80% of 
TFR;  and  the  other  Executives  have  the  opportunity  to  receive  60%  of  TFR.  Each  Executive  has  the 
opportunity to receive double the “at target” percentage for ‘maximum’ performance. Targets are set with a 
level of “stretch” built in, and as such, maximum STI targets are designed to only be achieved in respect of 
exceptional performance.
Performance Period
The assessment period is the financial year preceding the payment date of the STI (i.e. 1 July 2015 – 30 June 
2016).
Performance 
Conditions
Performance  conditions  are  a  mix  of  personal  and  business  measures.  Robust  threshold,  target  and 
maximum  targets  are  established  for  all  measures  to  drive  high  levels  of  business  and  individual 
performance. The annual budget generally forms the basis for the “target” performance set by the Board.
The  diagram  below  illustrates  the  weighting  of  the  performance  conditions,  using  the  CEO’s  personal 
conditions as an example.
Each  of  the  CEO,  CFO  and  other  Executives  have  different  personal  measures,  but  the  same  business 
measures. For further details in relation to the personal and business measures, including their composition, 
and how they are set and assessed, refer to section 4.4.2.
Calculation of STI 
Award
STI Amount ($) = ((60% x business outcome) + (40% x personal outcome)) x “At Target” STI% x TFR
Business and personal outcomes are scored out of 200%, with 50% for threshold performance, 100% for 
target performance and 200% for maximum performance. Business or personal measures that fail to meet 
the threshold target score 0%. If the overall average of the four personal measures is below 50%, the CEO 
and/or Board has the discretion to not make an STI award to that participant.
Payment, Delivery 
and Deferral
The STI is delivered 50% in cash and 50% in deferred shares in October 2016, following finalisation of the 
audited annual Company results and the approval of all personal outcomes.  Of the deferred component, 
half is to be released after 12 months (in October 2017) and the remainder after two years (in October 2018). 
The Executives will be entitled to dividends and voting rights attaching to their deferred shares.
Cessation of 
Employment during 
Performance Period
Clawback
Overriding Board 
Discretion
Except at the discretion of the Board:
-
-
if a participant resigns or is dismissed, the STI is forfeited; and
if a participant ceases employment for any other reason, the STI award will be reduced on a pro rata 
basis, but will remain payable and any deferred shares will remain on foot for the balance of the relevant 
restriction period and then be released.
In  general,  the  Board  has  the  discretion  to  reduce  or  forfeit  an  STI  award,  or  to  seek  recovery  from  a 
participant, if an event or circumstance has occurred which has resulted in an inappropriate benefit being 
conferred on a participant (including fraud, dishonesty, gross misconduct or if the outcomes are the result of 
material error or misstatement of the financial accounts). The discretion may be exercised for a period of 
two years from the vesting or award date.
The Board retains overriding discretion to adjust the final outcome to ensure any STI award is appropriate.

Weighting   Reason the Performance Measure Was Adopted
Safety

Major Hazard Audit and Significant 
Potential Incident (SPI)(2) Action 
Close Out on Time (50%)
Earnings

Adjusted Net Profit/(Loss) After Tax

The Company is committed to reinforcing a strong safety culture and improving 
safety  leadership.    The  combined  measures  maintain  a  focus  on  safety 
performance as measured by TRIFR and drive  critical actions to prevent future 
potential fatalities and/or serious injuries.
The  earnings  target  is  a  direct  financial  measurement  of  the  Company’s 
performance, providing a strong alignment to the interests of shareholders.  The 
results  are  based  on the  statutory  profit  of  the  Group  adjusted for  the  effect  of 
commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and other significant items determined 
by the Board which are considered to be outside the control of management. It 
provides a strong reflection of production delivery, operational efficiency and cost 
management.
Costs
AISC per ounce(3)
25%
This measure is a highly relevant short and long term measure which is consistent 
with  the  Company’s  strategy  of  focussing  on  sustainable  cash  generation  and 
profitability.  It is the primary unit cost measure in the gold industry, and is visible 
and readily understood. It is based on publicly disclosed and reconciled results 
and  is  therefore  a  reliable  measure  for  use  by  the  Company,  adjusted  for  the 
effect of commodity prices and foreign exchange rates.
Free Cash Flow
25%
FCF
FCF was adopted as the fourth business measure for the 2016 financial year as 
a  highly  relevant  short  and  long  term  measure.    It  reflects  cost  and  capital 
management  and  production  efficiencies.  FCF  is  necessary  to  fund  growth 
opportunities, repay debt and ultimately pay dividends to shareholders. It is based 
on  publicly  disclosed  and  reconciled  results  and  is  adjusted  for  the  same 
uncontrollable items as earnings.
(1)  TRIFR is the total number of recordable injuries per million hours worked. It is a lagging indicator of safety performance. 
(2)  Major Hazard Audit action close out, and SPI close out, ensures a stronger focus on addressing hazards which may lead to serious 
potential incidents in the future, including the potential for a fatality. Actions are measured by reference to completion against their 
due date.
(3)  All-In Sustaining Cost metrics as per World Gold Council Guidance Note on Non-GAAP metric released 27 June 2013.
Personal measures for the 2016 financial year
For the 2016 financial year, the key elements of the personal performance measures for Sandeep Biswas were 
set  by  the  Board  to  align  with  the  Company’s  strategic  goals.    The  personal  performance  measures  were 
selected to recognise the important role that the CEO plays in personally advancing the Company’s strategic 
objectives of improving the safety and sustainability performance of the Company, its operational performance, 
value and cash generation and progressing its growth initiatives.
The personal performance measures for other Executives for the 2016 financial year focussed on their areas 
of responsibility which, in the case of the operational Executives, included safety, production, cost saving and 
operational  efficiency.  If there is a fatality  within  the area of accountability  of an Executive, the  Board may 
exercise discretion to adjust the assessment of the personal safety measure, including a zero award, where 
appropriate.
Further detail as to the personal measures for the CEO and CFO and outcomes with respect to such measures 
is set out in section 5.2.1.

year)
Feature
Description
Equity type
Maximum LTI 
Opportunity
Grant Date
Allocations  are  in  the  form  of  rights  to  shares  in  the  Company  (Rights).  Upon  vesting,  each  Right  is 
automatically  exercised  at  a  nil  exercise  price  and  vests  as  one  fully  paid  ordinary  share.  As  the  Rights 
represent a participant’s ‘at risk’ long term incentive component of their remuneration package, the Rights 
are granted at no cost to the participant.
The CEO opportunity is 150% of TFR, the opportunity for the CFO, CDO and EGM – Cadia and MMJV is 
100% of TFR, and the opportunity for the other Executives is 80% of TFR. Section 4.6 indicates the value 
of the grants expressed as a percentage of the total remuneration package.
The grant date was 5 November 2015 and Rights under the plan will vest, subject to the satisfaction of the 
performance  conditions,  on  5  November  2018.    The  total  number  of  Rights  held  by  each  Executive  is 
summarised in section 9.4.
LTI Value
For  these  purposes, the  value  of  each  Right  is  calculated  based  on  the  value  of  the  underlying  security, 
using the five day VWAP of Newcrest’s share price immediately preceding the grant date.
Performance period
The assessment period is the three financial years commencing on 1 July in the year the grant is issued.
Performance 
Conditions
Rights issued under the 2015 LTI Plan are subject to the Performance Conditions shown below:
Vesting
Holding lock
Dividends
Clawback
Cessation of 
employment
The Performance Conditions have been set to align with the long-term goals and performance of Newcrest 
and  the  generation  of  shareholder  returns.  Further  details  in  regards  to  the  Performance  Conditions  are 
detailed in section 4.5.2.
Rights vest three years from the grant date subject to the Performance Conditions being met.  Rights are 
automatically exercised on vesting.
For Executives, shares received on the vesting and automatic exercise of Rights are subject to a 12 month 
holding lock.
No dividends are paid on unvested Rights. Dividends, when applicable, will be paid for vested shares held 
under the holding lock.
In  general,  the  Board  has  the  discretion  to  reduce  or  forfeit  an  LTI  award  for  a  participant  if  an  event  or 
circumstance has occurred which has resulted in an inappropriate benefit being conferred on a participant 
(including  fraud,  dishonesty,  gross  misconduct  or  if  the  outcomes  are  the  result  of  material  error  or 
misstatement of the financial accounts). The discretion may be exercised for a period of two years from the 
vesting or grant date.
Except at the discretion of the Board:
-
-
if a participant gives a notice of resignation or is dismissed, unvested Rights will lapse on cessation of 
employment; and
if a participant ceases employment for any other reason, pro-rata unvested Rights will remain on foot 
and vest subject to the application of the performance conditions and any holding lock in the terms of 
grant.
For all leavers, any restricted shares will be released after expiration of the holding lock period (subject to 
the Board exercising a discretion under the clawback policy).

Description
Change of control
The Board may exercise its discretion to allow all or some unvested rights to vest if a change of control event 
occurs.
Retesting
There is no retesting. Rights that do not vest based on performance over the three year performance period 
will lapse on the third anniversary of the grant date.
Overriding Board 
discretion
The Board retains overriding discretion to adjust the final outcome to ensure any LTI award is appropriate.

ROCE
ROCE is an absolute measure, defined as 
underlying earnings before interest and tax 
(EBIT),  divided  by  average  capital 
employed, being shareholders’ equity plus 
net debt.
The  vesting  scale  for  this  measure  is  as 
follows:
-
-
-
-
0%  vests  if  Comparative  Costs  are  at 
or above the 50th percentile;
50%  vests  if  Comparative  Costs  are 
less than the 50th percentile, but at or 
above the 25th percentile;
80%  vests  if  Comparative  Costs  are 
below  the  25th  percentile  but  at  or 
above the 10th percentile;
100%  vests  if  Comparative  Costs  are 
below the 10th percentile.
Straight line vesting occurs between each 
of these thresholds.
The  Comparative  Costs  measure  will  be 
assessed  using  peer  data  for  the  period 
from 1 July 2015 until 31 March 2018 (i.e. 
2 years and 9 months).
The  vesting  scale  for  this  measure  is  as

is  averaged
-  An additional 6.25% vests for each 1%

Straight line vesting occurs between each

Average capital employed is calculated as 
a  simple  average  of  opening  and  closing 
balances.    If  material  equity  transactions 
(for  example,  significant  equity  issuances 
or asset impairments) occur such that the 
simple  average  is  not  representative  of 
actual  performance,  the  average  capital 
employed  for  the  year  is  adjusted  for  the 
effect of these transactions.
Reason the Performance Measure Was 
Adopted
is  closely  aligned
This  measure 
to 
Newcrest’s strategic objective to be a low 
cost  producer  and  aligned  to  our  relative 
value proposition for gold equity investors.
The  AISC  result  is  a  sound  basis  for  the 
Company to use in assessing comparative 
cost  as  it  is  based  on  publicly  disclosed 
results.
ROCE  aligns  management  action  and 
company outcomes closely with long term 
shareholder  value.    ROCE  provides  a 
balance  to  the  other  LTI  metrics  as  it 
serves as a counter to “buying” success.
ROCE is also based on publicly disclosed 
and  reconciled  results  and  is  therefore  a 
sound  basis  for  the  Company  to  use  in 
assessing value.
Impairments are excluded from the capital 
base in the year in which they occur, such 
that the return is on a pre-impairment basis 
and LTI participants do not benefit from the 
impairment.  However, the post impairment 
capital  base  is  used  in  the  calculation  of 
returns  in  future  years  so  as  to  not  de-
incentivise current or new management.

4.5.3.  Outlook for 2016 LTI Performance Conditions (2017 financial year)
The LTI Performance Conditions to be adopted for grants made during the 2017 financial year (the 2016 LTI 
Plan) will comprise of the following equally weighted measures:
  ROCE. The Board intends to review the vesting schedule and calculation of ROCE prior to the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting to ensure that it appropriately reflects prevailing expectations of rates of return on assets, 
and  the  effect  of  development  capital  on  the  calculation,  to  better  align  Management  reward  with  the 
interests  of  shareholders.  Any  changes  to  this  measure  (including  the  vesting  schedule)  will  be 
communicated in the Notice of Meeting for the 2016 Annual General Meeting;
  Comparative Cost Position, assessed using peer data for the period from 1 July 2016 until 30 June 2019 
(i.e. 3 years), with a variation measure to the vesting schedule aimed at ensuring that the performance 
required for minimum and maximum vesting is challenging but achievable (set out below):
Performance level
Vesting level
Rationale for change
Comparative Cost position is at or 
above the 50th percentile.
0% vesting
No change.
Comparative Cost position is less 
than the 50th percentile.
40% vesting
Straight line vesting occurs 
between 50th and 25th percentiles.
Comparative Cost position is less 
than the 25th percentile.
100% vesting
Vesting level for this level of performance has been reduced from 50% to 
40%  of  maximum.    This  is  intended  to  offset  the  easing  of  the  maximum 
performance requirement described below.
The performance standard has been eased from the lowest cost decile (ie 
the lowest 10%) to the lowest quartile (ie the lowest 25%).  This is to ensure 
the  maximum  vesting  level  is  challenging  but  achievable,  in  light  of  the 
tendency for the lowest cost peers to be small, single-mine producers who 
are not comparable to companies with Newcrest’s breadth of operations.
  A new Relative TSR measure which will replace the Strategic Performance measure, in order to provide 
greater alignment between the outcomes of the Plan and the returns experienced by shareholders, and in 
order to specifically encourage outperformance against other gold mining companies.
After  thorough  analysis,  it  has  been  determined  that  the  S&P  TSX  Global  Gold  Index  will  be  the  most 
appropriate comparison point for Newcrest to use for the Relative TSR measure.  The key reasons for this 
are as follows:
o
o
o
As  a  gold  mining  company,  Newcrest’s  share  price  performance  is  significantly  impacted  by 
fluctuations  in  the  gold  price.   Accordingly,  the  Board’s  view  is  that  it  is  appropriate  to compare 
Newcrest’s performance to that of other gold mining companies (to ensure that any outperformance 
or underperformance is not dictated by fluctuations in the gold price). 
There are few ASX-listed gold mining companies  which act as a directly relevant comparison to 
Newcrest  given  the  differences  in  scale,  and  it  is  therefore  considered  that  a  comparison  with 
international peers is more appropriate. 
Rather than hand-pick a selection of peer gold mining companies from various stock exchanges 
globally, the Board considers that Newcrest’s performance should be compared to the S&P TSX 
Global Gold Index as each of Newcrest’s major peers are constituents in the S&P TSX Global Gold 
Index.
Newcrest Mining Limited – Annual Financial Report – Year Ended 30 June 2016

REMUNERATION REPORT
Newcrest’s Relative TSR will be assessed by reference to the movement in Newcrest’s Australian dollar 
share price and dividends, relative to movement in the S&P TSX Global Gold Index, over a performance 
period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2019. The vesting schedule will be as follows, with the Board having 
the discretion to adjust the final outcome to ensure any LTI award is appropriate.
Newcrest is below the performance of the index
Newcrest is equal to the performance of the index

50% vests
Newcrest exceeds the performance of the index by less than 18 percentage points
50 to 100% vests
Straight-line pro-rating
Newcrest exceeds the performance of the index by 18 percentage points or more
100% vests
The Board commissioned an analysis of TSR performance of key international peers over several previous 
LTI performance periods.  After considering the results of this analysis, performance equal to the index 
was considered an appropriate proxy for threshold performance, and outperformance of the index by 18 
percentage  points  over  a  3  year  performance period  (approximately  5.7  percentage  points  per  annum) 
was identified as an appropriate level of stretch performance.
The  strategic  performance  measures  (replacement  of  reserves  and  resources  depletion,  organisational 
health,  diversity  and  growth)  continue  to  be  considered  important  by  the  Board,  but  will,  in  future,  be 
embedded into Executives’ short-term objectives, underpinned by the STI.

Sign-on grants
To support Newcrest’s ability to attract suitable Executives and senior managers, it is sometimes necessary to 
offer  sign-on  payments.    Such  payments  are  consistent  with  market  practice  in  the  industry  and  facilitate 
movement  of  Executives  to  Newcrest  by  compensating  them  for  a  portion  of  entitlements  that  they  would 
otherwise  lose  on  leaving  another  company.    In  August  2015,  an  Executive  Remuneration  Policy  was 
introduced  that  requires  that  any  sign-on  payments  to  new  Executives  take  into  account  an  independent 
assessment of any amounts expected to be foregone by an incoming Executive and that, where practicable, 
any such payments offered be made in equity and the timing of such payments not be accelerated.   A new 
sign-on rights share plan was approved during the year to support this policy.
Consistent with the policy outlined above, the following sign-on arrangements were agreed during the year:
  On commencement, Michael Nossal received performance rights with a value of US$1,092,750, and 
a cash payment of US$113,805 in March 2016, to compensate for the value of incentives forfeited on 
cessation of employment with his previous employer, with the form of compensation intended to align 
with the incentives forfeited on cessation.  Accordingly, the performance rights were granted at no cost 
and are not subject to any performance conditions (other than a service condition).  The rights are due 
to be automatically exercised at a nil exercise price and vest as fully paid ordinary shares in two equal 
tranches  in  July  2016  and  July  2017  (or  as  soon  as  possible  afterwards  in  accordance  with  the 
Securities Dealing Policy).  An additional cash payment of US$54,638 is due to be made in September 
2016.  The  sign-on  arrangements  are  subject  to  continuing  employment  (other  than  in  limited 
circumstances).
  On  commencement,  Ian  Kemish  received  performance  rights  with  a  value  of  US$284,115,  to 
compensate  for  the  value  of  incentives  forfeited  on  cessation  of  employment  with  his  previous 
employer, with the form of compensation intended to align with the incentives forfeited on cessation.  
Accordingly, the performance rights were granted at no cost.  The rights are due to be automatically 
exercised at a nil exercise price and vest as fully paid ordinary shares in progressive tranches through 
to  November  2018  (or  as  soon  as  possible  afterwards  in  accordance  with  the  Securities  Dealing 
Policy).  An  additional  cash  payment  of  US$58,280  is  due  to  be  made  in  July  2017.  The  sign-on 
arrangements are subject to adequate performance and continuing employment (other than in limited 
circumstances).
These payments, together with sign-on payments made to Executives in recent years (including the issue of 
shares to Sandeep Biswas in November 2015, as foreshadowed in Newcrest’s 2015 Remuneration Report), 
are detailed in the Remuneration Tables in section 9 of this report.  The minimum value of sign-on payments 
that have not yet been made or are unvested is nil if the performance conditions are not met.

The fatality at Hidden Valley in July 2015 was already considered and taken into account when determining 
the overall score for the 2015 financial year STI Business measures.
In  determining  the  overall  score  for  the  2016  financial  year  Business  measures,  the  Board  took  into 
consideration  the  fatality  at  Cadia  in  September  2015.   Whilst  this  event  was  extremely  disappointing,  the 
Board determined not to exercise discretion to amend the overall score in recognition of the significant steps 
that have been taken to improve the Company’s safety processes and culture.  However, as noted above, this 
fatality  was  taken  into  consideration  when  assessing  the  personal  performance  of  Sandeep  Biswas  and 
Craig Jones, who received 0% for the safety component of their personal measures in their STI assessment.

performance year worked prior to his cessation date. His personal performance was assessed as “at target’.  He will receive his 
total pro-rated 2016 financial year STI award in cash, to be paid in October 2016.
Note: David Woodall was not eligible to receive a pro-rata reward under the STI Plan for the 2016 financial year for the proportion of the

Estimated Vesting of LTI Rights in the 2017 financial year (2013 LTI Plan)
The 2013 LTI Plan is expected to vest on or about 16 September 2016.  The vesting outcome is not yet known 
but it is anticipated that the vesting will be in the range of 25% to 33.3%.  Relevant considerations in finalising 
the  vesting  outcome  will  include  confirmation  of  the  Comparative  Cost  outcomes,  for  which  final  data  is 
pending.
Based on current estimates, the outcome for both ROCE and the Reserves Growth measures will be nil.  The 
nil  outcome  for  the  Reserves  Growth  measures  is  primarily  as  a  result  of  a  strategic  decision  early  in  the 
performance period to significantly reduce spend on exploration over the performance period.

EXECUTIVE SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND TERMINATION ARRANGEMENTS
Remuneration  and  other  terms  of  employment  for  the  Executives  are  formalised  in  Executive  Service 
Agreements  (ESA).    Each  of  the  ESAs  provides  for  the  payment  of  fixed  and  performance  based  at  risk 
remuneration,  employer  superannuation  contributions,  other  benefits  such  as,  death  and  disablement 
insurance cover via the Newcrest Superannuation Plan, and salary continuance cover.  The ESAs do not have 
a fixed end date.  The remuneration for each Executive during the 2016 financial year is detailed in sections 
1.5 and 9.1, and positions held are detailed in section 2.
Each ESA provides that the Executive may terminate their employment by giving the Company three months’ 
notice.  The  Company  may  terminate  the  Executive’s  employment  by  giving  12  months’  notice  and  the 
Company may, at its discretion, elect to pay the Executive an amount in lieu of notice for any portion of the 12 
months not worked.
The Company may terminate an Executive’s employment without notice at any time for cause.  No payment 
in lieu of notice, or any payment in respect of STI or LTI is payable under the ESA in this circumstance.
On cessation of employment, STI or LTI awards vest in accordance with the relevant Plan Rules.  Refer to 
sections 4.4 and 4.5 for further details.

REMUNERATION REPORT

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
7.1.
Remuneration Policy
The Non-Executive Director (NED) fees and other terms are set by the Board.  NEDs are paid by way of a 
fixed  Director’s  fee  and  Committee  fees  commensurate  with  their  respective  time  commitments  and 
responsibilities.  The level and structure of the fees is based upon the need for the Company to attract and 
retain NEDs of suitable calibre, the demands of the role and prevailing market conditions.
In  order  to  maintain  impartiality  and  independence,  NEDs  do  not  receive  any  performance-related 
remuneration  and  are  not  entitled  to  participate  in  the  Company’s  short  and  long  term  incentive  schemes.  
NEDs are not provided with any retirement benefits, other than statutory superannuation contributions.
7.2.
Fee Pool
The maximum amount of fees (including superannuation contributions) that can be paid to NEDs is capped by 
a pool  approved  by  shareholders.    At  the Annual  General  Meeting  held on 28  October  2010,  shareholders 
approved the current fee pool of A$2,700,000 per annum (US$1,967,000 using the average exchange rate of 
0.7285 for the 2016 financial year).
In June 2016, the Board resolved that the aggregate maximum amount of NEDs’ fees should remain at the 
level approved by shareholders in 2010.
7.3.
Fee Structure
In  reviewing  the  level  of  fees,  the  Board  obtained  independent  market  data  from  KPMG.  The  fees  were 
compared to the ASX 11 - 40 comparator group.  The benchmarking review showed that the current NED fees 
are competitively positioned, and as a result, the Board decided that there would be no change to existing fee 
levels.
The table below outlines the main Board and Committee fees as at 30 June 2016.

(1)  Board and Committee fees have been translated from Australian dollars to US dollars using an average exchange rate of 0.7285
for the 2016 financial year.
(2)  The Chairperson of the Board does not receive any additional payments for his/her role as Chair or Member of any Committee.
Under the Company’s Constitution, NEDs may be reimbursed for reasonable travel, accommodation and other 
expenses  incurred  while  engaged  on  the  business  of  the  Company.    NEDs  may  also  be  remunerated  for 
additional  services,  for  example,  if  they  undertake  specialist  or  consulting  work  on  behalf  of  the  Company 
outside the scope of their normal Director’s duties.  No fees for additional services were paid to NEDs for the 
current or prior financial year.

REMUNERATION REPORT
9.1  Executive Remuneration (continued)
The table above details the statutory remuneration disclosures as calculated with reference to the Corporations 
Act  2001  and  relevant  accounting  standards.    All  Executives  are  compensated  in  Australian  dollars. 
Remuneration  has  been  presented  in  US  dollars,  consistent  with  Newcrest’s  presentation  currency.  All 
remuneration components have been translated from Australian dollars to US dollars using an average rate of 
0.7285  (2015:  0.8388),  with  the  exception  of  ‘termination  payments’,  which  have  been  translated  at  the 
applicable spot rate.
Where  applicable,  remuneration  is  pro-rated  for  the  time  periods  during  the  financial  year  1  July  2015  to 
30 June 2016 that the Executive was a KMP.  An explanation of the relevant remuneration items included in 
the tables is provided in the associated footnotes.  The figures provided in relation to share based payments 
(columns  H  to  J)  are  calculated  in  accordance  with  accounting  standards  and  represent  the  amortised  fair 
value of equity instruments that have been granted to Executives.
Notes to Executive Remuneration
(A)  Salaries comprise cash salary and available salary package options grossed up by related fringe benefits tax, where applicable, net 
of superannuation commitments, paid during the financial year.  For former and new Executives, this balance is pro-rated for time 
served as KMP.
(B)  Short Term Incentive refers to cash amounts earned under the STI Plan which are paid in the following financial year.  For Executives
who departed Newcrest during the year, the STI treatment applies in accordance with the Plan Rules.
(C)  Other cash benefits comprise:
Year ended 30 June 2016: 
-  For Ian Kemish and Michael Nossal, this includes the cash component awarded as “sign-on” incentives, as detailed in Section 
4.7.  These entitlements are being expensed over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, 
ending on the date on which they become fully entitled to the award.
-    For Craig Jones, this represents relocation costs incurred in his relocation from Melbourne to Brisbane.  
-  For all other Executives this relates to travel costs paid in lieu of relocation entitlements.
Year ended 30 June 2015: 
- In accordance with her Executive  Service Agreement, Jane Thomas received, on commencement, a cash amount of US$171k 
being the value of incentives forfeited on cessation of employment with her previous employer. In addition, Newcrest paid the 
sum of US$27k which relates to travel costs paid in lieu of relocation entitlements.
-   For all other Executives this relates to travel costs paid in lieu of relocation entitlements.
(D)  Other benefits represents non-monetary benefits such as parking, insurance and applicable fringe benefits tax payable on benefits.
(E)  Separation payments comprise amounts payable in accordance with Executive Service Agreements for Colin Moorhead and David
Woodall.
(F)  Represents leave entitlements, measured on an accruals basis, and reflects the movement in the entitlements over the year.
(G)  Represents company contributions to superannuation under the Superannuation Guarantee legislation (SGC).
(H)  Represents the fair value of performance rights, comprising rights over unissued shares, granted under the LTI plan which have 
been  valued  using  a Black-Scholes  option  pricing model.   This  is calculated  in  accordance  with Australian  Accounting  Standard 
AASB  2  Share  Based  Payments.  The  calculation  of  the  share  based  payment  expense  is  based  on  the  apportioned  expense 
associated with Rights granted, adjusted for the reassessment of estimated vesting outcomes of those rights.
(I)
This represents the deferral of 50% of the STI award granted to the Executives which will be deferred in the form of shares (refer to 
section 1.2). The deferred amount is being expensed over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, 
ending on the date on which the Executive fully becomes entitled to the award.
(J)  Represents rights awarded to Executives as “sign-on” incentives in accordance with their Executive Service Agreements, as detailed 
in Section 4.7. Their entitlements are being expensed over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, 
ending on the date on which they become fully entitled to the award.
(K)  Represents performance related remuneration as a percentage of total remuneration.  Performance related remuneration comprises
short-term incentive, LTI rights and STI deferral. Comparative percentages have been restated to align to this methodology.

The following assumptions have been applied to this table:
(A)  The accounting value of the Rights granted under the LTI Plan reflects the fair value of a Right on the Grant Date, being US$8.57 
multiplied by the number of Rights granted during the year. The accounting value of a sign-on Right granted to Ian Kemish and 
Michael Nossal reflects the fair value of the Rights on the Grant Date, being US$14.99 and US$9.75 respectively, multiplied by the 
number of Rights granted during the year. This amount represents the maximum value which will be expensed over the performance 
period.  The minimum value is nil if the performance and/or service conditions are not met.
(B)  The value at the exercise date has been determined by the Company’s share price at the close of business on the exercise date
multiplied by the number of rights exercised during the year ended (nil exercise price).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Corporate Information
Basis of Preparation
INTRODUCTION 
 
This  section  provides  information  about  the  overall  basis  of  preparation  that  is  considered  to  be  useful  in 
understanding these financial statements. 
 
 
1.  
 
Newcrest  Mining  Limited  is  a  company  limited  by  shares,  domiciled  and  incorporated  in  Australia,  whose 
shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the Port Moresby Stock Exchange 
(PoMSOX).    The  registered  office  of  Newcrest  Mining  Limited  is  Level  8,  600  St  Kilda  Road,  Melbourne, 
Victoria, 3004, Australia. 
 
The  nature  of  operations  and  principal  activities  of  Newcrest  Mining  Limited  and  its  controlled  entities  are 
exploration, mine development, mine operations and the sale of gold and gold/copper concentrate. 
 
The financial report of Newcrest Mining Limited for the year ended 30 June 2016 was authorised for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 15 August 2016. 
 
 
2.  
 
(a)   Overview 
 
This financial report is a general purpose financial report,  prepared by a for-profit entity, in accordance with 
the  requirements  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001,  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  other  authoritative 
pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB). 
 
The  financial  report  also  complies  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  including 
interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).   
 
The financial report has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments 
and available-for-sale assets which have been measured at fair value. 
 
The financial report has been presented in United States (US) dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest 
US$1,000,000 (US$m) unless otherwise stated. 
 
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by all entities included in the Group and are consistent 
with those applied in the prior year, except as disclosed in Note 3. 
 
(b) 
 
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent entity, Newcrest Mining 
Limited,  and  its  controlled  entities  (referred  to  as  ‘the  Consolidated  Entity’  or  ‘the  Group’  in  these  financial 
statements).  A list of significant controlled entities (subsidiaries) is presented in Note 24. 
 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has the rights, to variable returns from its involvement with 
the investee  and has the  ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.  The Group re-
assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to 
one or more of the three elements of control. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the 
Group has all of the following:
Basis of Consolidation
  Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities
of the investee);
  Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
  The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
Non-controlling  interests  in  the  results  and  equity  of  the  entities  that  are  controlled  by  the  Group  is  shown 
separately  in the Income Statement, Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Financial  Position 
and Statement of Changes in Equity respectively.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Foreign Currency
Basis of Preparation (continued)
2. 
 
(c) 
 
Presentation and Functional Currency 
The presentation currency of the Group is US dollars.  Each entity in the Group determines its own functional 
currency  and  items  included  in  the  financial  statements  of  each  entity  are  measured  using  that  functional 
currency.  All non-Australian operating entities have a functional currency of US dollars, while the parent entity 
and the Group’s Australian entities have a functional currency of Australian dollars. 
 
Transactions and Balances 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rates ruling 
at the date of the transaction.  The subsequent payment or receipt of funds related to a transaction is translated 
at the rate applicable on the date of payment or receipt.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.  Non-monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date 
of the initial transaction. 
 
All exchange differences in the consolidated financial statements are taken to the Income Statement with the 
exception  of  differences  on  certain  US  dollar  denominated  borrowings  (held  by  entities  with  a  functional 
currency  of  Australian  dollars)  where  the  foreign  currency  components  are  designated  as  either  cash  flow 
hedges of future US dollar denominated sales or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.  These are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a reserve until the forecast sales used to repay 
the debt occur (for cash flow hedges) or the foreign operation is disposed (for net investment hedges), at which 
time they are recognised in the Income Statement. 
 
Translation 
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than US dollars (being the presentation 
currency of the group) are translated into US dollars at the exchange rate at the reporting date and the income 
statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the period.  On consolidation, exchange differences 
arising from the translation of these subsidiaries, translation of net investments in foreign operations and of 
the borrowings designated as hedges of the net investment are  recognised in other comprehensive income 
and  accumulated  in  the  foreign  currency  translation  reserve.    On  disposal  of  a  foreign  operation,  the 
component  of  other  comprehensive income relating to that  particular  foreign  operation is  recognised  in the 
Income Statement. 
 
 
(d)  Critical Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions 
 
Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and 
other  factors,  including  expectations  of  future  events  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the 
circumstances.  All judgements, estimates and assumptions made are believed to be reasonable based on the 
most  current  set  of  circumstances  available  to  management.    The  resulting  accounting  estimates  will,  by 
definition, seldom equal the related actual results.  The judgements, estimates and assumptions that potentially 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are found within the relevant notes.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Changes in Accounting Policies
3.  
 
During the year, the Group:
  Changed its presentation currency from Australian dollars to US dollars 
  Early adopted accounting standard AASB 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 2016 
  Early adopted accounting amendment AASB 2015-2 Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 101
from 1 July 2015
(a)  Change in Presentation Currency 
 
Newcrest has changed its reporting (presentation) currency from Australian dollars to US dollars in the current 
financial  year.  The  Company  believes  that  the  change  in  reporting  currency  to  US  dollars  will  enhance 
comparability with Newcrest’s industry peer group, the majority of which report in US dollars.  
 
The change in reporting currency represents a voluntary change in accounting policy which is accounted for 
retrospectively.  Comparative  information  included  in  this  financial  report,  previously  reported  in  Australian 
dollars and the statement of financial position at the opening of the comparative period (1 July 2014), has been 
restated into US dollars using the procedures outlined below:
1.  The Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows have been translated to US dollars using
average exchange rates for the relevant year.
2.  Assets and Liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position have been translated to US dollars
using the exchange rate as at the relevant balance dates.  The exchange rates were as follows:
As at: 
30 June 2015 
1 July 2014
0.7680 
0.9420
3.  The Equity section of the Statement of Financial Position has been converted to US dollars using
historical exchange rates.
(b)   Early adoption of AASB 9 
 
The  Group  has  early  adopted  AASB  9  Financial  Instruments  as  of  1  January  2016.    The  impact  of  early 
adopting AASB 9 had no material impact on the classification and measurement of any financial instruments.  
Refer to Note 35 for further details. 
 
 
(c)   Early adoption of AASB 2015-2 
 
The Group has early adopted AASB 2015-2 Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 101 as of 1 July 2015.  
This Standard made amendments to AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements arising from the IASB’s 
Disclosure  Initiative  project.    The  amendments  are  designed  to  facilitate  improved  reporting,  including  an 
emphasis on only including material disclosures, clarity on the aggregation and disaggregation of line items, 
the presentation of subtotals, the ordering of notes and the identification of significant accounting policies.  The 
adoption of the Standard affects the presentation of the Group’s financial statements.

Segment Information
PERFORMANCE 
 
This section highlights the key indicators on how the Group performed in the current year. 
 
 
4.  
 
The Group's operating segments are based on the internal management reports that are reviewed and used 
by  the  Group's  Executive  Committee  in  assessing  performance.  The  operating  segments  represent  the 
Group’s operating mines and projects which are organised and managed according to their location. 
 
The Group’s reportable operating segments are:
  Cadia, Australia 
  Telfer, Australia
Lihir, Papua New Guinea 
 
  Gosowong (1), Indonesia 
  Hidden Valley JV (50% interest), Papua New Guinea 
  Bonikro, Cote d’Ivoire (2) 
  Exploration and Other (3)
(1)  Newcrest owns 75% of Gosowong through its holding in PT Nusa Halmahera Minerals. 
(2)  Bonikro includes mining and near-mine exploration interests in Cote d’Ivoire, which are held by LGL Mines CI SA and 
Newcrest Hire CI SA (of which Newcrest owns 89.89% respectively). This segment was acquired in August 2010 and 
was previously referred to as ‘West Africa’. In addition to the Bonikro and near-mine exploration interests, this segment 
held  extensive  greenfields  exploration  licenses  in  Cote  d’Ivoire  which  have  now  been  largely  relinquished  and  the 
acquired value fully impaired. New greenfields exploration was initiated in Cote d’Ivoire in 2016 which is now included 
in the ‘Exploration and Other’ segment.
(3)  Exploration and Other mainly comprises projects in the exploration, evaluation and feasibility phase and includes Wafi-
Golpu JV (50% interest) in PNG, Namosi JV (70.67% interest) in Fiji, O’Callaghans in Australia and Newcrest’s global 
greenfields exploration portfolio.
(a)  Segment Results, Segment Assets and Segment Liabilities 
 
The measurement of segment results is in line with the basis of information presented to the Group’s Executive 
Committee  for  internal  management  reporting  purposes.    The  performance  of  each  segment  is  measured 
based on their Revenues, Costs, EBITDA and EBIT (‘Segment Result’). 
 
Segment Revenues represent gold, copper and silver sales revenue.  
 
EBITDA  is  earnings  before  interest,  tax,  depreciation,  amortisation  and  significant  items.    EBIT  is  earnings 
before interest, tax and significant items.  The reconciliation of EBIT to profit before tax is shown in Note 4(b). 
 
Capital Expenditure comprises payments for property, plant and equipment, production stripping expenditure, 
mines under construction, development and feasibility expenditure and information systems development.   
 
Segment assets exclude intercompany receivables.  Segment liabilities exclude intercompany payables.

Revenue Recognition 
 
Revenue from  the  sale of goods  is  recognised  when  there has  been  a transfer of  risks  and  rewards  to the 
customer and no further processing is required by the Group, the quality and quantity of the goods has been 
determined with reasonable accuracy, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable.  The 
point at which risk and title passes for concentrate sales is generally upon receipt of the bill of lading when the 
commodity is delivered for shipment.  Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable.  
 
The terms of metal in concentrate sales contracts with third parties contain provisional pricing arrangements 
whereby the selling price for metal in concentrate is based on prevailing spot prices on a specified future date 
after shipment to the customer (quotation period).  Adjustments to the sales price occur based on movements 
in quoted market prices up to the date of final settlement.  The period between provisional invoicing and final 
settlement  is  typically  between  one  and  six  months.    Revenue  on  provisionally  priced  sales  is  recognised 
based on the estimated fair value of the total consideration receivable. 
 
Prior  to  the  adoption  of  AASB  9  on  1  January  2016,  the  provisionally  priced  sales  of  metal  in  concentrate 
contained an embedded derivative that was separated from the host contract, i.e. the concentrate receivable, 
for accounting purposes.  Accordingly the embedded derivative, which did not qualify for hedge accounting, 
was recognised at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement each 
period until final settlement, and presented as part of ‘Other Income/Expense’.  The initial estimate of fair value 
and subsequent changes in fair value over the quotation period and up until final settlement  were estimated 
by reference to forward market prices.  On adoption of AASB 9, the embedded derivative is no longer separated 
from the concentrate receivables.  Instead, the receivables are accounted for as one instrument and measured 
at fair value through profit or loss with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement 
each period until final settlement and presented as part of ‘Other Income/Expense’.  Refer to Note 35 for further 
details on the impact of the adoption of AASB 9.

Exploration, Evaluation and Deferred Feasibility Expenditure 
 
Exploration and Evaluation 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure related to areas of interest is capitalised and  carried forward to the 
extent that:
(i)  Rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and
(ii)   (a)   Costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the
area of interest or alternatively by sale; or
(b)  Where  activities  in  the  area  of  interest  have  not  yet  reached  a  stage  which  permits  a 
reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, 
and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.
Such expenditure consists of an accumulation of acquisition costs and direct exploration and evaluation costs 
incurred, together with an appropriate portion of directly related overhead expenditure. 
 
The carrying value of capitalised exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts 
and circumstances suggest that the carrying value may exceed its recoverable amount.  
 
Deferred Feasibility 
Feasibility  expenditure  represents  costs  related  to  the  preparation  and  completion  of  a  feasibility  study  to 
enable a development decision to be made in relation to an area of interest and are capitalised as incurred. 
 
At the commencement of construction, all past exploration, evaluation and deferred feasibility expenditure in 
respect of an area of interest that has been capitalised is transferred to mines under construction.
Accounting Judgement, Estimates and Assumptions – Exploration, Evaluation and Deferred 
Feasibility Expenditure 
 
Judgement is required to determine whether future economic benefits are likely, from either exploitation or 
sale, or whether activities have not reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment of the existence 
of reserves. In addition to these judgements, the Group has to make certain estimates and  assumptions. 
The  determination  of  a  JORC  resource  is  itself  an  estimation  process  that  involves  varying  degrees  of 
uncertainty  depending  on  how  the  resources  are  classified  (i.e.  measured,  indicated  or  inferred).  The 
estimates  directly  impact  when  the  Group  capitalises  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure.  The 
capitalisation policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events 
and circumstances, in particular, the assessment of whether economic quantities of reserves will be found.  
Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. 
 
The  recoverable  amount  of  capitalised  expenditure  relating  to  undeveloped  mining  projects  (projects  for 
which the decision to mine has not yet been approved at the required authorisation level within the Group) 
can be particularly sensitive to variations in key estimates and assumptions. If a variation in key estimates 
or assumptions has a negative impact on recoverable amount it could result in a requirement for impairment.
Mines Under Construction 
 
This expenditure includes net direct costs of construction, borrowing costs capitalised during construction and 
an  appropriate  allocation  of  attributable  overheads.    Expenditure  is  net  of  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  ore 
extracted  during  the  construction  phase  to  the  extent  that  this  ore  extracted  is  considered  integral  to  the 
development of the mine. 
 
After production commences, all aggregated costs of construction are transferred to mine development or plant 
and equipment as appropriate.

Production Stripping Expenditure  
 
Stripping  (waste  removal)  costs  are  incurred  both  during  the  development  phase  and  production  phase  of 
operations.    Stripping  costs  incurred  during  the  development  phase  are  capitalised  as  part  of  mine 
development costs. Stripping costs incurred during the production phase are generally considered to create 
two benefits:  

the production of ore inventory in the period – accounted for as a part of the cost of producing those ore 
inventories; or 
improved access to the ore to be mined in the future – recognised as ‘production stripping asset’, if the 
following criteria are met: 
o

Future economic benefits (being improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping 
activity are probable; 
The component of the ore body for which access has been improved can  be accurately identified; 
and 
The  costs  associated  with  the  stripping  activity  associated  with  that  component  can  be  reliably 
measured.
o
o
The amount of stripping costs deferred is based on the ratio obtained by dividing the amount of waste tonnes 
mined by the quantity of gold ounces contained in the ore for each component of the mine. Stripping costs 
incurred in the period are deferred to the extent that the actual current period waste to contained gold ounce 
ratio exceeds the life of component expected waste to contained gold ounce ratio (‘life of component’) ratio. 
 
A component is defined as a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping 
activity and is determined based on mine plans.  An identified component of the ore body is typically a subset 
of the total ore body of the mine.  Each mine may have several components, which are identified based on the 
mine plan. 
 
The production stripping asset is initially measured at cost, which is the accumulation of costs directly incurred 
to  perform  the  stripping  activity  that  improves  access  to  the  ore  within  an  identified  component,  plus  an 
allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. 
 
The production stripping asset is depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the 
ore body that is made more accessible by the activity, on a units of production basis. Economically recoverable 
reserves are used to determine the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body.
Accounting Judgement - Production Stripping 
 
The  life  of  component  ratio  is  a  function  of  the  mine  design  and  therefore  changes  to  that  design  will 
generally result in changes to the ratio.   Changes in other technical or economic parameters that impact 
reserves will also have an impact on the life of component ratio even if they do not affect the mine design.  
Changes  to  production  stripping  resulting  from  a  change  in  life  of  component  ratios  are  accounted  for 
prospectively.
Mineral Rights 
 
Mineral  rights  comprise identifiable  exploration  and evaluation  assets,  mineral  resources  and ore  reserves, 
which are acquired as part of a business combination or a joint arrangement acquisition and are recognised 
at fair value at date of acquisition.  Mineral rights are attributable to specific areas of interest and are amortised 
when  commercial  production  commences  on  a  units  of  production  basis  over  the  estimated  economically 
recoverable reserves of the mine to which the rights relate. 
 
Plant and Equipment and Mine Development 
 
Cost 
Plant  and  equipment  and  mine  development  is  carried  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  any 
accumulated impairment losses.  The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, 
and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, the initial estimate of the rehabilitation 
obligation, and for  qualifying assets  (where relevant),  borrowing  costs.    The  purchase price or  construction 
cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.

Plant and Equipment and Mine Development (continued) 
 
Construction  cost  for  mine  development  includes  expenditure  in  respect  of  exploration,  evaluation  and 
feasibility, previously accumulated and carried forward in relation to areas of interest in which development or 
construction is underway.  
 
Depreciation and Amortisation 
Items of plant and equipment and mine development are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. 
 
The  Group  uses  the  units  of  production  basis  when  depreciating  mine  specific  assets  which  results  in  a 
depreciation charge proportional to the depletion of the anticipated remaining life of mine production.  Each 
item’s  economic  life  has  due  regard  to  both  its  physical  life  limitations  and  to  present  assessments  of 
economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which it is located. 
 
For the remainder of assets the straight line method is used, resulting in estimated useful lives between 3  – 
20 years, the duration of which reflects the specific nature of the asset.   
 
Estimates of remaining useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed annually for all 
major items of plant and equipment and mine development.  Any changes are accounted for prospectively. 
 
When an asset is surplus to requirements or no longer has an economic value, the carrying amount of the 
asset is reviewed and is written down to its recoverable amount or derecognised.
Accounting Estimate and Assumptions - Units of Production Method of Depreciation/Amortisation 
 
The group uses the units of production basis when depreciating/amortising specific assets which results in 
a  depreciation/amortisation  charge  proportional  to  the  depletion  of  the  anticipated  remaining  life  of  mine 
production. Each item’s economic life, which is assessed annually, has due regard to both its physical life 
limitations and to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which 
it is located. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions.
Accounting Estimates and Assumptions - Ore Reserves & Resources 
 
The  Group  estimates  its  ore  reserves  and  mineral  resources  annually  at  31  December  each  year,  and 
reports  in  the  following  February,  based  on  information  compiled  by  Competent  Persons  as  defined  in 
accordance  with  the  Australasian  code  for  reporting  Exploration  Results,  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore 
Resources (JORC code 2012).  The estimated quantities of economically recoverable reserves are based 
upon interpretations of geological models and require assumptions to be made regarding factors such as 
estimates of short and long-term exchange rates, estimates of short and long-term commodity prices, future 
capital requirements and future operating performance.  Changes in reported reserves estimates can impact 
the  carrying  value  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  (including  exploration  and  evaluation  assets),  the 
provision  for  rehabilitation  obligations,  the  recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets,  as  well  as  the  amount  of 
depreciation charged to the Income Statement.

Impairment testing
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
13.  
 
a) 
 
Impairment tests are performed when there is an indication of impairment.  Newcrest conducts a review of the 
asset values of cash generating units (‘CGUs’) annually, which is used as a source of information to determine 
whether there is an indication of impairment or reversal of previously recognised impairments.  Other factors, 
such as changes in assumptions in future commodity prices, exchange rates, production rates and input costs, 
are also monitored to assess for indications of impairment or reversal of previously recognised impairments. 
Where an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount 
is determined.  
 
CGUs represent a grouping of assets at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets.  Generally this results in 
the  Group  evaluating  its  CGUs  as  individual  mining  operations,  which  is  consistent  with  the  Group’s 
representation of operating segments. 
 
After consideration of the potential indicators which could impact the valuation of the CGUs at 30 June 2016, 
the Group concluded:
  Hidden  Valley’s  continued  underperformance  against  expectations  represented  an  indicator  of  potential 
impairment. An updated assessment of the recoverable amount of Hidden Valley has determined that no 
further impairment is required as at 30 June 2016.
  The  interruption  to  operations  at  Gosowong  following  a  geotechnical  event  in  February  2016  and  the 
potential  impact  on  future  production  capacity  represented  an  indicator  of  potential  impairment.    An 
assessment of the recoverable amount of Gosowong has determined that no impairment is required as at 
30 June 2016.
  There are no indicators of impairment or impairment reversal for the remainder of Newcrest’s CGUs as at
30 June 2016.
Basis of impairment and impairment reversal calculations
b) 
 
An  impairment  loss  is  recognised  when  a  CGU’s  carrying  amount  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount.    The 
recoverable amount of each CGU has been estimated on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal (‘Fair 
Value’).  The costs of disposal have been estimated by management based on prevailing market conditions.  
 
For CGUs that have previously recognised an impairment loss, an impairment reversal is recognised for non-
current  assets  (other  than  goodwill)  when the  Fair  Value  indicates  that  the  impairment  has  been reversed.  
Such a reversal is limited to the lesser of the amount that would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its 
recoverable amount or the value that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment 
loss been recognised. 
 
Fair Value is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market-based commodity price and exchange 
assumptions,  estimated  quantities  of  recoverable  minerals,  production  levels,  operating  costs  and  capital 
requirements, based  on CGU latest  life of mine plans.  In certain cases,  where multiple investment options 
exist, Fair Value may be determined from a combination of two or more scenarios that are weighted to provide 
a single Fair Value that is determined to be the most indicative.  When plans and scenarios used to estimate 
Fair Value do not fully utilise the existing mineral resource for a CGU, and options exist for the future extraction 
and processing of all or part of those resources, an estimate of the value of unmined resources, in addition to 
an estimate of value of exploration potential, is included in the estimation of Fair Value.   
 
The  Fair  Value  estimates  are  considered to  be  level  3 fair  value  measurements  (as  defined  by  accounting 
standards, refer Note 21) as they are derived from valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based 
on observable market data.  The Group considers the inputs and the valuation approach to be consistent with 
the approach taken by market participants. 
 
Estimates of quantities of recoverable minerals, production levels, operating costs and capital requirements 
are sourced from the Group’s planning and budgeting process, including life of mine (‘LOM’) plans, latest short-
term forecasts and CGU specific studies.

Accounting Estimates and Assumptions – Fair Value 
 
Significant judgements, estimates and assumptions are required in determining estimates of Fair Value.  This 
is  particularly  so  in  the  assessment  of  long  life  assets.    It  should  be  noted  that  the  CGU  Fair  Values  are 
subject  to  variability  in  key  assumptions  including,  but  not  limited  to,  gold  and  copper  prices,  currency 
exchange rates, discount rates, production profiles and operating and capital costs.  A change in one or more 
of the assumptions used to estimate Fair Value could result in a change in a CGU’s Fair Value.

Commodity prices and exchange rates estimation approach
Commodity price and foreign exchange rates are estimated with reference to external market forecasts and 
reviewed  at  least  annually.    The  rates  applied  have  regard  to  observable  market  data  including  spot  and 
forward values, and to market analysis including equity analyst estimates. 
 
Metal prices
Newcrest has maintained the long term (2020+) US dollar gold and copper price estimates applied in 2015. 
The gold price estimate for 2018 and the copper price estimates for the short term (2017 to 2019) have reduced 
compared to 2015, reflecting spot prices during the 2016 financial year and Newcrest’s analysis of observable 
market data for future periods.  
 
AUD:USD exchange rate
Newcrest has also maintained its AUD:USD exchange rate estimates for the long term (2020+) compared to 
2015. Estimates for the period 2017 to 2019 have reduced compared to 2015, reflecting spot prices during the 
2016 financial year and Newcrest’s analysis of observable market data for future periods.  
 
USD:PGK exchange rate
Changes made in 2016 to the USD:PGK exchange rate estimates reflected the sustained weakening of the 
PNG  Kina  against  the  US  dollar  over  the  past  12  months.    Lihir  and  Hidden  Valley  both  have  a  material 
proportion of operating and capital costs denominated in PNG Kina, resulting in this change having a positive 
impact on the Fair Value of both CGUs.

Sensitivity Analysis
LOM production activity and operating and capital cost assumptions are based on the Group’s latest forecasts 
and longer term LOM plans.  These projections can include expected operating performance improvements 
reflecting the Group’s objectives to maximise free cash flow, optimise and reduce operational activity, apply 
technology, improve capital and labour productivity.  
 
d) 
 
During the past three years, impairments have been recognised for Lihir (in 2013 and 2014), Telfer (in 2013 
and 2014), Hidden Valley (in 2013, 2014 and 2015) and Bonikro (in 2013, 2014 and 2015) and an impairment 
reversal recognised for Telfer in 2015. 
 
Following the review of the CGU asset values as at 30 June 2016, and in recognising no requirement for asset 
impairments or impairment reversals, the Group has determined that the carrying amount as at 30 June 2016 
of the Lihir, Telfer, Hidden Valley and Bonikro CGUs approximate their respective Fair Values. 
 
Any variation in the key assumptions used to determine Fair Value would result in a change of the estimated 
Fair Value.  If the variation in assumption had a negative impact on Fair Value it could indicate a requirement 
for impairment of non-current assets.  If the variation in assumption had a positive impact on Fair Value it could 
indicate a requirement for an impairment reversal of non-current assets. 
 
It is estimated that the following reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would have the following 
approximate impact on the Fair Value of each of these CGUs in its functional currency as at 30 June 2016:
$ million in functional currency
US$100 per ounce change in gold price
0.50% increase/decrease in discount rate

It must be noted that each of the sensitivities above assumes that the specific assumption moves in isolation, 
whilst all other assumptions are held constant.  In reality, a change in one of the aforementioned assumptions 
may accompany a change in another assumption which may have an offsetting impact (for example, a decline 
in the US dollar gold price accompanied with a decline in the  Australian dollar compared  to the US dollar).  
Action is  also usually taken by management to respond to adverse changes in economic assumptions that 
may mitigate the impact of any such change.

US$95 million (2015: US$96 million).
Ore stockpiles, gold in circuit, bullion and concentrate is physically measured or estimated and valued at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value.  Cost represents the weighted average cost and includes direct costs 
and an appropriate portion of fixed and variable production overhead expenditure, including depreciation and 
amortisation, incurred in converting materials into finished goods.  Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to 
make the sale. 
 
Ore  stockpiles  which  are  not  scheduled  to  be  processed  in  the  twelve  months  after  the  reporting  date  are 
classified as non-current inventory.  The Group believes the processing of these stockpiles will have a future 
economic benefit to the Group and accordingly values these stockpiles at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. 
 
Materials  and  supplies  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net  realisable  value.    Any  allowance  for 
obsolescence is determined by reference to stock items identified.
Accounting Judgement and Estimate – Net Realisable Value 
 
The computation of net realisable value for ore stockpiles involves significant judgements and estimates in 
relation  to  timing  and  cost  of  processing,  commodity  prices,  foreign  exchange  rates,  recoveries  and  the 
timing of sale of the bullion and concentrate produced.  A change in any of these assumptions will alter the 
estimated net realisable value and may therefore impact the carrying value of ore stockpiles.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of: 
 
 
because it is not probable that the Group will have sufficient future assessable income and/or capital gains 
available against which the deferred tax asset could be utilised.  This is partly due to restrictions that limit the 
extent to which the losses can be applied to future taxable income in future periods. 
 
(c)  Tax Consolidation 
 
The  Company  and its  wholly-owned Australian  subsidiaries  are  part  of  a tax  consolidated group.  Newcrest 
Mining Limited is the head entity of the tax consolidated group.  The tax losses attributable to the Australian 
entities  are  available  for  offsetting  against  future  profits  of  the  tax  consolidated  group.    Some  of  these  tax 
losses are subject to restrictions that limit the extent to which the losses can be applied against future taxable 
income.  Notwithstanding these restrictions, these losses do not have an expiry date.

Income Taxes 
 
Current Income Tax 
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior  year are measured at the amount expected to be 
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities based on the current year's taxable income. The tax rates 
and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting 
date. 
 
Deferred Income Tax 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits 
and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be 
utilised. 
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income 
tax  asset  to  be  utilised.    Unrecognised  deferred  tax  assets  are  reassessed  at  each reporting  date  and  are 
recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset 
to be recovered. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when 
the  asset is  realised  or  the  liability  is  settled,  based  on tax  rates  (and tax  laws)  that  have  been enacted  or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
 
Current and deferred taxes attributable to amounts recognised directly in equity are also recognised directly in 
equity.
Accounting Judgement, Estimates and Assumptions - Recovery of Deferred Tax Assets 
 
Judgement is required to determine whether deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial 
position.  Deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses, require management to 
assess the likelihood that the Group will generate sufficient taxable earnings in future periods in order to 
recognise and utilise those deferred tax assets.  Judgement is also required in respect of the application of 
existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. 
 
Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and existing tax laws 
in each jurisdiction.  These assessments require the use of estimates and assumptions such as exchange 
rates, commodity prices and operating performance over the life of the assets.  To the extent that cash flows 
and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax 
assets reported at the reporting date could be impacted.  
 
Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates could limit the ability 
of the Group to obtain tax deductions and recover/utilise deferred tax assets in future periods.

Employee benefits
Provisions  (other  than  those  relating  to  employee  benefits)  are  recognised  when  the  Group  has  a  present 
obligation  (legal  or  constructive)  as  a  result  of  a  past  event,  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation. 
 
 
(a) 
 
Liabilities for wages and salaries, annual leave and any other employee benefits are measured at the amounts 
expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.  
 
Amounts expected to settle within twelve months are recognised in ‘Current Provisions’ (for annual leave and 
salary  at  risk)  and  ‘Trade  and  Other  Payables’  (for  all  other  employee  benefits)  in  respect  of  employees’ 
services up to the reporting date.  Costs incurred in relation to non-accumulating sick leave are recognised 
when leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable. 
 
The  liability  for  long  service  leave  and  other  long  term  benefits  is  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the 
estimated future cash outflows resulting from employees’ services provided up to the reporting date. 
 
Long-term benefits not expected to be settled within twelve months are discounted using the rates attaching 
to high quality corporate bonds at the reporting date, which most closely match the terms of maturity of the 
related liability.

18.  Provisions (continued) 
 
b)  Mine rehabilitation  
 
The Group records the present value of the estimated cost of legal and constructive obligations (such as those 
under the Group’s Environmental Policy) to rehabilitate locations where activities have occurred which have 
led to a future obligation to make good. The nature of rehabilitation activities includes dismantling and removing 
structures,  rehabilitating  mines,  dismantling  operating  facilities,  closure  of  plant  and  waste  sites  and 
restoration, reclamation and revegetation of affected areas. 
 
Typically the obligation arises when the asset is installed or the ground/environment is disturbed at the mining 
location.  When the liability is initially recorded, the present value of the estimated cost is capitalised as part of 
the carrying amount of the related mining assets.  Over time, the discounted liability is increased for the change 
in  the  present  value  based  on  a  discount  rate  that  reflects  current  market  assessments.    Additional 
disturbances or changes in rehabilitation costs will be recognised as additions or changes to the corresponding 
asset and rehabilitation liability when incurred.  Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group 
has estimated its costs based on feasibility and engineering studies using current restoration standards and 
techniques. 
 
The unwinding of the effect of discounting the provision is recorded as a finance cost in the Income Statement.  
The carrying amount capitalised as a part of mining assets is depreciated/amortised over the life of the related 
asset. 
 
Costs incurred that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations but do not have a future economic 
benefit are expensed as incurred.
Accounting Estimate - Mine Rehabilitation Provision 
 
Significant estimates and assumptions are required in determining the provision for mine rehabilitation as 
there are many transactions and other factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable to rehabilitate the 
mine sites.  Factors that will affect this liability include changes in technology, changes in regulations, price 
increases, changes in timing of cash flows which are based on life of mine plans and changes in discount 
rates.  When these factors change or become known in the future, such differences will impact the mine 
rehabilitation provision in the period in which they change or become known.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
This section outlines the Group’s capital and financial management policies and significant capital and financial 
risk management activities that have been implemented during the year.  This includes the Group’s exposure 
to various risks and how these could affect the Group’s financial position and performance, as well as how the 
Group is managing those risks. 
 
19.   Capital Management and Financial Objectives 
 
Newcrest’s  capital  structure  consists  of  equity  and  net  debt,  which  includes  borrowings,  cash  and  cash 
equivalents.  Newcrest  aims  to  maintain  an  optimal  capital  structure  that  reduces  the  cost  of  capital  and 
maximises  shareholder  returns,  withstands  price  volatility  and  allows  completion  of  approved  major  capital 
projects through periods of price volatility. 
 
Newcrest’s key financial objectives are to:
  Meet all financial obligations;  
  Maintain a strong balance sheet so as to withstand cash flow volatility;  
 

Be able to invest capital in value-creating opportunities; and 
Be able to return excess cash generated to shareholders.
In order to achieve these financial objectives, Newcrest’s capital management strategy looks to:
Target an investment grade credit rating throughout the cycle;
 
  Maintain a leverage ratio (Net Debt to EBITDA) of less than 2.0 times; 
  Maintain a gearing ratio of below 25%; and 
  Maintain  diverse  funding  sources,  sizeable  committed  undrawn  bank  facilities  and  US$  debt  with  an
appropriate tenor having regard to the life of the Company’s assets.
At 30 June the Group’s position in relation to these metrics was:

Newcrest  borrows  funds  from  financial  institutions  and  debt  investors  in  the  form  of  committed  revolving 
facilities,  private  placement  notes  and  corporate bonds.    As  at  30  June  2016,  all  of  Newcrest’s  borrowings 
were unsecured. 
 
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.   Borrowings are net of 
transaction  costs  incurred.    Borrowings  are  classified  as  non-current  liabilities  where  Newcrest  has  an 
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the year end. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, on hand and short-term deposits.

21.   Financial Risk Management 
 
Newcrest  is  exposed  to  a  number  of  financial  risks,  by  virtue  of  the  industry  and  geographies  in  which  it 
operates  and  the  nature  of  the  financial  instruments  it  holds.    The  key  risks  that  could  adversely  affect 
Newcrest’s financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are: 
 
a)  Commodity and other price risks 
b)  Foreign currency risk 
c)  Liquidity risk 
d) 
e)  Credit risk 
 
Further detail of each of these risks is provided below, including management’s strategies to manage  each 
risk.  These strategies are executed subject to Board approved policies and procedures and administered by 
Group Treasury. 
 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain market risks.  The instruments used by the 
Group include forward sale contracts, diesel forward contracts and foreign currency forward contracts. 
 
Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date.  The resulting gain or loss is recognised in 
the Income Statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, 
in  which  event,  the  timing  of  recognition  in  the  Income  Statement  depends  on  the  nature  of  the  hedge 
relationship. 
 
For  instruments  in  hedging  transactions,  the  Group  formally  designates  and  documents  the  relationship 
between  hedging  instruments  and  hedged  items  at  the  inception  of  the  transaction,  as  well  as  its  risk 
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.   
 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’) through the Hedge Reserve.  Any gain or loss 
relating to an ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.  Amounts accumulated 
in the Hedge Reserve in equity are transferred to the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item 
affects the Income Statement, for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place. 
 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, if 
it  no  longer  qualifies  for  hedge  accounting  or  if  the  Group  changes  its  risk  management  objective  for  the 
hedging relationship.  At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised 
via  Other  Comprehensive  Income  remains  deferred  in  the  Hedge  Reserve  until  the  original  forecasted 
transaction occurs.  When the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or 
loss that was deferred in the Hedge Reserve is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. 
 
If  a  hedging  instrument  being  used  to  hedge  a  commitment  for  the  purchase  or  sale  of  gold  or  copper  is 
redesignated as a hedge of another specific commitment and the original transaction is still expected to occur, 
the gains and losses that arise on the hedging instrument prior to its redesignation are deferred and included 
in  the  measurement  of  the  original  purchase  or  sale  when  it  takes  place.    If  the  hedging  instrument  is 
redesignated as a hedge of another commitment because the original purchase or sale transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the gains and losses that arise on the hedge prior to its redesignation are recognised in the 
Income Statement at the date of the redesignation.

Gold and copper price
21.  Financial Risk Management (continued) 
 
(a)  Commodity and Other Price Risks 
 
(i) 
 
All of Newcrest’s gold and copper production is sold into global markets.  The market prices of gold and copper 
are the key drivers of Newcrest’s capacity to generate cash flow.  Newcrest is predominantly  an unhedged 
producer to provide its shareholders with exposure to changes in the market price of gold and copper. 
 
Newcrest does undertake selected financial risk management activities to mitigate specific gold and copper 
price risks, as follows:  
 
Provisionally priced concentrate sales and gold and copper forward sales contracts
The terms of metal in concentrate sales contracts with third parties contain provisional pricing arrangements 
whereby the selling price for metal in concentrate is based on prevailing spot prices on a specified future date 
after shipment to the customer (quotational period or ‘QP’).  The QP is usually one month for gold and three 
or four months for copper. In the prior period, this QP exposure was considered to be an embedded derivative 
which was separated from the host concentrate receivables and measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
On adoption of AASB 9, the embedded derivative is no longer separated from the concentrate receivables. 
Instead these receivables are accounted for as one instrument and measured at fair value through profit or 
loss and recognised in the Income Statement as part of ‘Other Income/Expense’. Refer to Notes 5 and 35 for 
further details.  
 
As at 30 June 2016, 133,000 gold ounces and 29,000 copper tonnes were subject to QP adjustment  
(2015: 150,000 ounces gold and 28,000 tonnes copper). 
 
In order to minimise the short term revenue volatility impact of QP adjustments, particularly across reporting 
periods, the Group takes out gold and copper forward sales contracts at the time of concentrate shipments to 
lock in the price.  These forward sales contracts are not designated into hedge relationships with the fair value 
adjustments at reporting date recognised in the Income Statement as part of ‘Other Income/Expense’. 
 
The following table details the gold and copper forward sale contracts outstanding as at the reporting date:

Partial hedging of Telfer future gold sales
In March and May 2016, Newcrest put in place hedges for a portion of the Telfer mine’s future gold production.  
Telfer is a large scale, low grade mine and its profitability and cashflow are both particularly sensitive to the 
realised  Australian dollar  gold  price.   Having  regard  to the  favourable spot  and  forward  prices  at that time, 
hedging instruments in the form of Australian dollar gold bullion swaps were put in place to secure margins on 
a portion of future production to December 2018, which will support the investment in future cutbacks and mine 
development. 
 
The Telfer AUD gold bullion swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges with a hedge relationship of 
1:1.  Potential sources of hedge ineffectiveness that may affect the hedging relationship during the term are 
variations to forecast production timing and volume assumptions and credit risk.  
 
As of 30 June 2016, the Group is holding AUD gold bullion swaps with the following maturity:

These swaps are measured at fair value and have been presented as part of ‘Other financial assets/liabilities’

There was no hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss during the year. 
 
 
(ii) 
 
The Group’s input costs are exposed to price fluctuations, in particular to diesel and fuel prices.  To mitigate 
this risk, the Group has entered into short-term diesel/fuel swaps to fix certain diesel and heavy fuel oil costs 
in line with budget expectations.  
 
These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges with a hedge relationship of 1:1.  Potential sources 
of hedge  ineffectiveness that may  affect the hedging  relationship during the  term include differences in the 
pricing of the physical (hedged) item and hedging instrument, timing of physical delivery misaligned with the 
hedging instrument and credit risk.

The following table summarises the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities held at the reporting 
date to movement in gold, with all other variables held constant.  The 15% movement for gold (2015: 15%) is 
based  on  reasonably  possible  changes,  over  a  financial  year,  using  an  observed  range  of  actual  historical 
rates for the preceding five year period.

Foreign Currency Risk
21.  Financial Risk Management (continued) 
 
(b) 
 
The  Group  undertakes  transactions  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  hence  exposures  to  exchange  rate 
fluctuations arise.  The Group’s revenue is denominated in US dollars whereas a material proportion of costs 
(including capital expenditure) are collectively in Australian dollars and Papua New Guinea Kina. The Group’s 
Australian  entities  have  AUD  functional  currencies,  while  all  non-Australian  operating  entities  have  USD 
functional currencies. 
 
The Group’s Statement of Financial Position can also be affected materially by movements in the AUD:USD 
exchange  rate.    Measuring  the  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  is  achieved  by  regularly  monitoring  and 
performing sensitivity analysis on the Group’s financial position.  
 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s US dollar denominated financial assets and liabilities in entities which do 
not have a US dollar functional currency at the reporting date are as follows:

(i)
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its foreign currency exposure by borrowing in US dollars.  The 
entity which undertakes the majority of the Group’s borrowing activities has an AUD functional currency.  
Where considered appropriate the US dollar denominated debt is designated either as a: 
 
  Net investment in foreign operations.   
Exchange gains or losses upon subsequent revaluation of US dollar denominated borrowings from the 
historical  draw  down  rate  to  the  period  end  spot  exchange  rate  are  recognised  through  Other 
Comprehensive Income and deferred in equity in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve and will be 
released  to  the  Income  Statement  if  the  foreign  operation  is  sold.    As  at  30  June  2016  US  dollar 
borrowings  of  US$2,025  million  were  designated  as  a  net  investment  in  foreign  operations  (2015: 
US$2,000 million); or 
 
  Cash flow hedge of future US dollar denominated commodity sales.   
Exchange gains or losses upon subsequent revaluation of US dollar denominated borrowings from the 
historical draw-down rate to the period-end spot exchange rate are recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income and deferred in equity in the Hedge Reserve and will be released to the Income Statement as 
the anticipated  hedged US  dollar denominated commodity sales to which the deferred gains/(losses) 
are designated, occur.

Sensitivity analysis 
 
The  following  table  details  the  Group’s  sensitivity  arising  in  respect  of  translation  of  financial  assets  and 
financial liabilities to a 10% movement (2015: 10%) (i.e. increase and decrease) in the Australian dollar against 
the  US dollar at the reporting  date,  with all other  variables held constant.   The  10% sensitivity  is based on 
reasonably possible changes, over a financial year, using the observed range of actual historical rates for the 
preceding five-year period.
AUD/USD +10% (2015: +10%)

Significant assumptions used in the foreign currency exposure sensitivity analysis above include: 
  Reasonably possible movements in foreign exchange rates;
The reasonably possible movement of 10% (2015: 10%) was calculated by taking the AUD spot rate as at 
the reporting date, moving this spot rate by 10% (2015:10%) and then re-converting the AUD into USD 
with the “new spot-rate”.  This methodology reflects the translation methodology undertaken by the Group. 
  The translation of the net assets in subsidiaries with a functional currency other than AUD has not been
included in the sensitivity analysis as part of the equity movement.

Liquidity Risk
21.  Financial Risk Management (continued) 
 
(c) 
 
Newcrest is exposed to liquidity risk primarily through its capital management policies and  objectives, which 
utilise  debt  as  a  key  element  of  the  Group’s  capital  structure.    The  specific  risk  exposures  include  the 
sufficiency of available unutilised facilities and the repayment maturity profile of existing financial instruments. 
 
Liquidity risk is managed centrally by Group Treasury to ensure sufficient liquid funds are available to meet 
the Group’s financial commitments through the following management actions: 
  Maintaining  minimum  undrawn  committed  liquidity  (cash  and  available  facilities)  of  more  than  US$1.0
billion that can be drawn upon at short notice.
  Targeting to maintain an investment grade credit rating. 
  Regular  forecasting  of  all  future  cash  flows  relating  to  operational,  investing  and  financing  activities,
including detailed sensitivity analysis to test multiple scenarios.
  Management of repayment maturities to avoid excessive refinancing in any period. 
  Maintain funding flexibility with committed available credit lines with a variety of counterparties. 
  Managing credit risk related to financial assets. 
 
The  Group  maintains  a  balance  between  continuity  of  funding  and  flexibility  through  the  use  of  loans  and 
committed available credit  lines.  Included in  Note  20  is  a list  of  undrawn  facilities  that  the  Group  has  at its 
disposal to manage liquidity risk. 
 
The following table reflects all contractually fixed repayments and interest resulting from recognised financial 
liabilities at the reporting date, including derivative financial instruments.  For derivative financial instruments 
the market value is presented, whereas for the other obligations the respective undiscounted cash flows for 
the respective upcoming financial years are presented.

The other financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group not included in the above table are non-interest 
bearing and not subject to interest rate risk. 
 
The sensitivity of this exposure has been analysed and determined to be not material to the Group. 
 
 
(e)  Credit Risk 
 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the potential default of the counterparty to the Group’s financial 
assets,  which  comprise  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  trade  and  other  receivables  and  derivative  financial 
instruments.   
 
It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms and providers of capital or financial 
counterparties are subject  to a credit risk analysis including assessment of credit rating, short term liquidity 
and financial position.  The Group obtains sufficient collateral (such as a letter of credit) where appropriate 
from customers, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial  loss from defaults.   At  the reporting date the 
value of collateral held was US$33 million (2015: US$43 million). 
 
Receivables  balances  are  monitored on  an  ongoing basis  with the  result  that the Group’s  exposure  to  bad 
debts is not significant.  There were no material impairments of receivables as at 30 June 2016 or 30 June 
2015. 
 
The  majority  of  the  Group’s  receivables  are  due  from  concentrate  customers  in  Japan,  Korean  and  the 
Philippines.  There have been no credit defaults with these customers in recent history.  Newcrest’s Treasury 
department evaluates credit risk on a continual basis.  At the reporting date there were no other significant 
concentrations of credit risk.  
 
The Group limits its counterparty credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments by dealing only 
with banks or financial institutions with credit ratings of at least BBB equivalent.

Fair value measurements recognised in the Statement of Financial Position 
For financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Group uses the following to categorise the method 
used: 
 

Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from 
prices).  Valuation inputs include forward curves, discount curves and underlying spot and futures prices. 
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the 
asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair Value


As  at  30  June  2016,  all  the  Group’s  financial  assets  and  liabilities  which  are  measured  at  fair  value  on  a 
recurring basis, are categorised as Level 2 measurements. 
 
As at 30 June 2015, the majority of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities  which were measured at fair 
value on a recurring basis, were categorised at Level 1 and 2 with the remaining in Level 3 considered  not 
material to the Group. 
 
Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost 
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost in the  financial 
statements approximate their fair value, except as detailed in the following table:

using discounted cash flow models that use discount rates that reflect the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the 
end of the reporting period.

Issued ordinary share capital  is classified  as equity  and  is recognised at the fair value of  the consideration 
received by the Group.  Any transaction costs arising on the issue of ordinary shares and the associated tax 
are recognised directly in equity as a reduction of the share proceeds received. 
 
Treasury Shares 
The Group's own equity instruments, which are purchased on-market for later use in employee share-based 
payment arrangements (treasury shares), are deducted from equity.  No gain or loss is recognised in profit or

Prior to the adoption of AASB 9,  where a revalued financial asset  was sold or  was determined to be 
impaired, the cumulative gain or loss included in the reserve was recognised in the Income Statement.  
The movement during 2015 related to the movement in the fair value of the investment in Evolution from 
US$69 million (being the fair value of the retained interest in Evolution at the date the Group sold down 
its interest in February 2015) to US$94 million as at 30 June 2015.

26.   Deed of Cross Guarantee 
 
Pursuant  to  ASIC  Class  Order  98/1418  (as  amended)  dated  13  August  1998,  the  wholly-owned  controlled 
entities detailed in Note 24 are relieved from the Corporations Act 2001 requirements for preparation, audit, 
and lodgement of financial reports, and Directors’ Report. 
 
It is a condition of the Class Order that the Company and each of  its eligible controlled entities enter into a 
Deed of Cross Guarantee (‘Deed’).  The effect of the Deed is that the Company guarantees to each creditor 
payment in full of any debt in the event of winding up of any of the controlled entities under certain provisions 
of the Corporations Act 2001.  If a winding up occurs under other provisions of the Act, the Company will only 
be liable in the event that after six months any creditor has not been paid in full.  The controlled entities have 
also given similar guarantees in the event that the Company is wound up. 
 
In May 2016, the Company and its eligible controlled entities entered into a new Deed. 
 
A consolidated Income Statement and consolidated Statement of Financial Position, comprising the Company 
and controlled entities which are a party to the Deed, after eliminating all transactions between parties to the

Interest in Joint Operations 
 
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties  that have joint control of the arrangement have 
rights  to  the  assets,  and  obligations  for  the  liabilities,  relating  to  the  arrangement.    Joint  control  is  the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant 
activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 
 
When a Group entity undertakes its activities under joint operations, the Group as a joint operator recognises 
in relation to its interest in a joint operation, its share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses from those 
operations and revenue from the sale of its share of the output from the joint operation or from the sale of the 
output by the joint operation. 
 
The Group accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation 
in accordance with the standards applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
 
(a)  Morobe Mining Joint Ventures
The Hidden Valley JV, Wafi-Golpu JV and the Morobe Exploration JV are collectively referred to as the 
Morobe Mining Joint Ventures.  These JVs are each owned 50% by the Group and 50% by subsidiaries 
of Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited.  Pursuant to the JV agreements, key operational decisions 
of the JVs require a unanimous vote and therefore the Group has joint control. 
 
For  segment  reporting,  Hidden  Valley  is  a  reportable  operating  segment.    Wafi-Golpu  and  Morobe 
Exploration are included within the ‘Exploration and Other’ segment. 
 
Refer to Note 31(a) regarding a contingent liability for the Hidden Valley JV. 
 
Under the conditions of the Wafi-Golpu exploration tenements, the PNG Government (‘the State’) has 
reserved the right to take up an equity interest of up to 30% in a mine developed from Wafi-Golpu.  The 
right is exercisable by the State once at any time prior to the commencement of mining.  If the State 
exercises this right, the exercise price is a pro rata share of the accumulated historical exploration costs.  
Once the right is exercised, the State is responsible for its proportionate share of ongoing exploration 
and project development costs.  During February 2012 the State indicated its intention to exercise its 
option.  As at 30 June 2016, this option has not been exercised.  In the event the option is exercised in 
full, Newcrest’s interest in the Wafi-Golpu JV would be reduced to 35%.
(b)  Namosi Joint Venture
The  Namosi  JV  was  established  between  the  Group  and  two  other  parties  under  the  Namosi  Joint 
Venture agreement in November 2007.  Pursuant to this JV agreement, key operational decisions of the 
JV  require  a  unanimous  vote  and  therefore  the  Group  has  joint  control.    For  segment  reporting,  the 
Namosi JV is included within the ‘Exploration and Other’ segment.

The  Group  accounted  for  its  investment  in  Evolution  Mining  Limited  (‘Evolution’)  using  the  equity 
method until 27 February 2015.  On 27 February 2015, the Group sold 124,600,000 shares in Evolution 
for  net  proceeds  of  US$82  million  (A$105  million)  which  reduced  the  Group’s  shareholding  from 
231,082,631 shares (32.3% interest) to 106,482,631 shares (14.9% interest).  
 
Following the sale, the Group determined that it no longer had significant influence over its investment 
and  discontinued  the  equity  method of  accounting.   The  Group’s  retained  interest  in  Evolution  was 
remeasured to fair value of US$69 million as at 27 February 2015 and was reclassified as an available-
for-sale financial asset.  Refer below for details of the profit or loss impact of this transaction and Note

31.   Contingent Liabilities 
 
a)
Hidden Valley 
 
Legal proceedings were commenced in December 2010 against the Hidden Valley mine unincorporated 
joint venture (in which Newcrest holds a 50% interest) in Papua New Guinea over alleged damage to 
the Watut River (which runs adjacent to the Hidden Valley gold mine) alleged to have been caused by 
waste rock and overburden run-off from the mine. The damages sought by the plaintiffs are not specified. 
The defendants intend to defend the claims.  No active steps have been taken by the plaintiffs in this 
proceeding since late 2012.  It is not practicable to make any reasonable assessment of the prospects 
of the plaintiffs succeeding if they proceed with these claims, nor the potential liability of the defendants 
if  the  plaintiffs  were  to  succeed.    Accordingly,  no  provision  has  been  recognised  in  the  financial 
statements for this matter.

Income Tax Matters – Indonesia 
 
During the current period the Indonesian Tax Office (‘ITO’) completed tax audits and issued amended 
assessments  to  PT  Nusa  Halmahera  Minerals  (‘PT  NHM’)  for  the  30  June  2012  and  30  June  2014 
financial years.  PT NHM is 75% owned by Newcrest.  In addition, during prior periods the ITO concluded 
audits  of  the  2010,  2011  and  2013  income  years.    The  principal  issue  raised  in  these  amended 
assessments was the income tax rate applicable under the Gosowong Contract of Work (‘COW’). 
 
The amended assessments issued by the ITO to PT NHM applied a higher tax rate to the income of PT 
NHM, in accordance with the ITO interpretation.  This resulted in additional tax assessments of US$32 
million in relation to 30 June 2012 and US$7 million in relation to 30 June 2014 (on a 100% basis).  In 
addition, PT NHM has previously received assessments in relation to this issue totalling US$46 million 
for the 2010, 2011 and 2013 financial years.  
 
PT  NHM  disagrees  with the ITO  interpretation  but  has  paid the  amounts  assessed  to mitigate future 
penalties. PT NHM has objected to these assessments and is seeking recovery of the US$85 million 
paid.  
 
PT NHM has also continued to apply its own interpretation of the income tax rate applicable under the 
COW to the 2015 and 2016 financial years.  If, following audits, the ITO issues assessments maintaining 
its  alternative  interpretation  of  the  applicable  tax  rate,  the  additional  tax  assessed  is  estimated to be 
approximately US$11 million (on a 100% basis).  
 
The Group considers that PT NHM has made adequate provision for its taxation liabilities and is taking 
appropriate steps to address issues raised by the ITO.  If PT NHM is ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining 
recovery of the paid amounts (US$85 million to date), income tax expense would be adversely impacted 
by any shortfall in recovery of the tax paid together with the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities.
Other Matters 
 
In addition  to the above matters,  companies  in  the  Group are  recipients  of,  or  defendants  in, certain 
claims, proceedings and/or complaints made, commenced or threatened. In the opinion of the Directors, 
all such matters are of such a kind, or involve such  amounts, that they are  not  anticipated to have a 
material effect on the financial position of the Group if disposed of unfavourably, or are at a stage which 
does not support a reasonable evaluation of the likely outcome of the matter.
Bank Guarantees 
 
The Group has negotiated  a number of bank guarantees in favour of  various  government authorities 
and service providers.  The total nominal amount of these guarantees at the reporting date is US$92 
million (30 June 2015: US$105 million).

32.   Share Based Payments 
 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment plans, including: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)    Executive Performance Share Plan (LTI Plan)  
 
The  Executive  Performance  Share  Plan  (also  referred  to  as  the  Long  Term  Incentive  (‘LTI’)  plan)  entitles 
participants to receive rights to ordinary fully paid shares in the Company (Performance Rights).  The Executive 
Directors, Executive General Managers, General Managers and Managers participate in this plan. 
 
The  performance  measures  for  the  Performance  Rights  granted  in  the  2016  and  2015  financial  years 
comprised of three equally weighted measures, being: 
  Comparative Cost Position; 
  Return on Capital Employed (ROCE); and 
  Strategic Performance. 
 
Each LTI measure was chosen by the Board as it is a key driver of group performance: 
  Comparative Cost Position and Strategic  Performance being key drivers of shareholder  value  in a gold
mining company; and
  ROCE being a direct measure of returns per unit of capital. 
 
Performance against each of these measures over the three year vesting period accounts for 1/3rd of any grant 
made to participants.  There is no ability to re-test performance under the Plan after the performance period. 
 
The assessed fair value at grant date of the Performance Rights granted under the plan during the 2016 year 
was  A$11.89  (2015:  A$10.72)  per  right.  The  fair  value  is  independently  determined  using  a  Black-Scholes 
option pricing model.  The model inputs for Performance Rights granted included:

Expected life of right  
Exercise price 
Risk-free interest rate

The  Group  provides  benefits  to  employees  (including  Executive  Directors)  in  the  form  of  share  based 
compensation,  whereby  employees  render  services  in  exchange  for  shares  or  rights  over  shares  (equity-
settled transactions). 
 
The fair value of the rights granted is adjusted to reflect market vesting conditions.  Non-market conditions are 
included  in  the  assumptions  about  the  number  of  rights  that  are  expected  to  become  exercisable  and  are 
updated at each reporting date.  The impact of the revision to original estimates is recognised in the Income 
Statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
 
Upon the exercise of rights, the balance of the equity settlements reserve relating to those rights remains in 
the Equity Settlements Reserve and the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, 
are credited to Share Capital. 
 
Accounting Estimates and Assumptions - Share-Based Payments 
The Group measures the cost of equity settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of 
equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.  The fair value is determined by an external valuer 
using an option pricing model, using the assumptions detailed above.

(c)    ESAP and Share Match Plans 
 
Under  the  ESAP,  eligible  employees  are  granted  shares  in  the  Company  for  no  cash  consideration.    All 
Australian resident permanent employees who have been continuously employed by the Group for a period of 
at least one year, and are not eligible for the LTI Plan, are able to participate in the ESAP.  
 
Under the Share Match Plan, eligible employees may contribute up to A$4,950 to acquire shares in the plan 
year.  On the third anniversary of the start of the plan year, the Company will match the number of acquired 
shares held by the employee at that time with matched shares.   
 
The number of shares and rights granted under these plans during the year was not material to the Group. 
 
 
(d)  STI Plan 
 
Under the STI Plan, 50% of the payment is provided in cash with the remaining 50% deferred into shares.  The 
number of shares calculated is based on the Company’s volume weighted average share price during the five 
trading days immediately preceding the allocation date of shares.  Half the shares are released after 12 months 
and the remainder after 2 years. 
 
This plan applies to certain employees including key management personnel.  During the year, 115,260 shares 
were allocated in respect to this plan (2015: nil).

To support Newcrest’s ability to attract suitable executives and senior managers, it is sometimes necessary to 
offer  sign-on  incentives.    Such  incentives  are  consistent  with  market  practice  in  the  industry  and  facilitate 
movement  of  executives  to  Newcrest  by  compensating  them  for  a  portion  of  entitlements  that  they  would 
otherwise forfeit on leaving another company.  Rights awarded under this plan vest over periods up to three 
years and are subject to continued employment.  During the year, 152,696 rights were allocated in respect to 
this plan (2015: nil).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
35.   New Accounting Standards and Interpretations 
 
(a)  Adoption of New Standards and Interpretations 
 
The Group has adopted the following new accounting standards for the year ended 30 June 2016: 
  AASB 9 – Financial Instruments (“AASB 9”) 
 
In  December  2014,  the  AASB  issued  AASB  2014-9:  Amendments  to  Australian  Accounting  Standards  – 
Conceptual Framework, Materiality and Financial Instrument” which consolidated a series of amendments to 
AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9 (2014)).  AASB 9 replaces the relevant sections of AASB 139: Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139) and applies to annual reporting periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The Group early adopted AASB 9 on a retrospective 
basis, with the exception of hedge accounting, from 1 January 2016 without restatement of prior year periods. 
Hedge  accounting  must  be  applied  on  a  prospective  basis.    No  material  differences  were  identified  on  the 
adoption of AASB 9. 
 
AASB  9  simplifies  the  classification  and  recognition  of  financial  instruments,  introduces  a  new  impairment 
model and aligns hedge accounting more closely with common risk management practices.  
 
(i)   Changes to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities  
 
Financial Assets  
AASB 9 requires that an entity classifies its financial assets as subsequently measured at their amortised cost 
or fair value depending on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual 
characteristics of the financial assets.  
 
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if two criteria are met:  

The objective of the business model is to hold the financial asset for the collection of the contractual cash 
flows  
 The contractual cash flows under the instrument solely represent payments of principal and interest
 
 
The  new  standard  removes  a  requirement  to  separate  embedded  derivatives  from  financial  asset  hosts. 
Instead, a hybrid contract should be classified in its entirety at fair value.  
 
An election can be made to designate a financial asset as measured at fair value through profit or loss on initial 
recognition if this significantly reduces an accounting mismatch. The designation at fair value through profit or 
loss is irrevocable.  
 
AASB 9 prohibits reclassifications, except in rare circumstances when the entity’s business model changes, in 
which case, the entity is required to reclassify affected financial assets prospectively.  
 
All equity investments in the scope of AASB 9 should be measured at fair value. The new standard provides 
the option to present separately in Other Comprehensive Income unrealised and realised fair value gains and 
losses  on  equity  investments  that  are  not  held  for  trading.  Such  designation  is  only  available  on  initial 
recognition on an instrument by instrument basis and it is irrevocable. There is no subsequent recycling of fair 
value gains and losses to the Income Statement, however, dividends from such investments will continue to 
be  recognised  in  the  Income  Statement.  AASB  9  removes  the  exemption  that  allowed  unquoted  equity 
instruments to be recognised at historical cost  but provides  guidance on when  cost may be an  appropriate 
estimate of fair value.  
 
Impairment  
AASB 9 introduces a new expected credit loss impairment model. This will require recognition of a provision 
based on expected credit losses when financial instruments are first recognised, rather than on an incurred 
loss basis, which was the requirement previously.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
35.  New Accounting Standards and Interpretations (continued) 
 
Financial Liabilities  
The  requirements  in  AASB  139  regarding  classification  and  measurement  of  financial  liabilities  have  been 
retained in AASB 9, including the related application and implementation guidance. Financial liabilities continue 
to  be  measured  at  either  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  or  amortised  cost.  The  criteria  for  designating  a 
financial liability at fair value through profit or loss also remain unchanged.  
 
Where financial liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss, changes in the fair value due to 
changes in our own credit risk can be recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and there is no subsequent 
recycling of these amounts to the Income Statement (accumulated gains or losses may be transferred within 
equity). Where this creates an accounting mismatch in the Income Statement, all fair value movements must 
be recognised in the Income Statement.  
 
Impact of changes  
On adoption of AASB 9 the Group classified financial assets as subsequently measured at either amortised 
cost or fair value, depending on the business model for those assets and on the asset’s contractual cash flow 
characteristics.  
 
The  only  change  to  the  Group’s  classification  or  measurement  of  financial  assets  was  that  it  no  longer 
separates the quotational period pricing embedded derivative from the host contract, being the concentrate 
receivable, but instead now measures the whole receivable at fair value through profit or loss. There was no 
impact on financial liabilities.   
 
Due to the short term nature of the accounts receivable portfolio, there were no material changes arising from 
the new impairment requirements of AASB 9 and there were no other material financial assets impacted by 
these new requirements.  
 
There was no material impact on the Statement of Comprehensive Income or the Statement of Changes in 
Equity on adoption of AASB 9 in relation to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial 
liabilities.  
 
The following table summarises the impact on the classification and measurement of our financial assets as 
at 1 January 2016:

35.  New Accounting Standards and Interpretations (continued) 
 
(ii)   Changes to hedge accounting  
AASB  9  aligns  hedge  accounting  more  closely  with  common  risk  management  practices.  Hedge 
ineffectiveness  will continue to be recognised in the income statement. An entity  is still required  to prepare 
hedge documentation; however, the information to be documented under AASB 9 differs.  
 
The following summarises the key changes:  
 
  Risk components that are separately identifiable and reliably measurable will be eligible as hedged items,
including non-financial items
  Effectiveness measurement testing is required only on a prospective basis and new hedge effectiveness 
criteria include existence of an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument  
  Certain  requirements  must  be  met  for  discontinuing  a  hedge  relationship.  Changes  to  the  hedge
relationship may result in rebalancing of the hedge ratio rather than de-designation
  Hedging of groups of net positions is permitted subject to certain criteria  
 
The  accounting  and  presentation  requirements  for  hedge  accounting  remain  largely  unchanged;  however 
additional disclosures are required under the new standard.  
 
Hedge relationships which existed on the date of transition continue to be valid. Fair value gains and losses 
on  derivative  financial  instruments  continue  to  be  recognised  in  the  Income  Statement,  or  through  Other 
Comprehensive Income if the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument.  
 
 
(b)  New Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective and not yet adopted 
 
The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been identified as those which 
may impact the Group in the period of initial application.  They have been issued but are not yet effective and 
are available for early adoption at 30 June 2016, but have not been applied in preparing this financial report.

AASB 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a 
lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more 
than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is 
required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the 
underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligations to 
make lease payments.

Independent auditor's report to the members of Newcrest Mining Limited
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Newcrest Mining Limited, which comprises the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated income statement, the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and
the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the
consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time
to time during the financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true
and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for
such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of the financial
report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 2(a), the directors
also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that
the financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's
preparation and fair presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity's internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the Directors’ Report.
