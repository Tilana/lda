<p><i>Summary 
</i>The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, 
</p>
<p>Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official mission to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri 
Lanka (hereafter Sri Lanka) from 2 to 6 December 2013, at the invitation of the 
Government and pursuant to his mandate contained in resolution 23/8 of the Human Rights 
Council. The objective of the mission was to engage in a dialogue with the Government 
with a view to promoting durable solutions for the significant number of internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) who have been in need of such solutions since the end of the 
conflict in Sri Lanka in 2009. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment identifies 
key modalities and conditions necessary to enable the implementation of durable solutions 
for IDPs in Sri Lanka in the context of development and reconstruction. 
</p>
<p>Although there have been impressive advances in rebuilding infrastructure 
destroyed during the conflict, there needs to be a linkage between rebuilding such 
infrastructure and the livelihoods of the significant number of IDPs. They are still living in 
protracted displacement, and many others have returned to, or have been relocated within, 
the Northern and Eastern Provinces and are still living in very precarious conditions. 
Concerted efforts are required to ensure that post-conflict reconstruction addresses durable 
solutions on a comprehensive basis for all IDPs, as well as those who have been relocated 
and those who have returned to their areas of origin.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Purpose and description of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with the mandate bestowed on him by Human Rights Council 
resolution 23/8, and at the invitation of the Government of Sri Lanka, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons (hereafter the Special 
Rapporteur), Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official mission to Sri Lanka from 2 to 6 
December 2013. Since the end of the conflict in May 2009, the Government of Sri Lanka 
has undertaken measures aimed at finding solutions for IDPs. The main objective of the 
mission was to engage in dialogue with the Government with a view to examining the 
measures taken in order to promote durable solutions for significant numbers of IDPs, out 
of the several hundreds of thousand persons displaced at the end of the armed conflict in Sri 
Lanka. From the assessment of the Special Rapporteur, the IDPs are in need of effective 
durable solutions. Accordingly, his assessment identifies key modalities and conditions 
necessary to enable the implementation of durable solutions for IDPs in Sri Lanka in the 
context of development and reconstruction. 
</p>
<p>2. In Colombo, the Special Rapporteur met with various government interlocutors, 
including the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, the Minister of 
External Affairs, the Minister of Economic Development and Chairman of the Presidential 
Task Force for Resettlement, Development and Security in the Northern Province, the 
Minister of Plantation Industries and Special Envoy of the President on Human Rights, the 
Minister of Resettlement and the Minister of Justice. He also met with representatives of 
international organizations, non-governmental organizations, civil society, donors and other 
Governments. He travelled to Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi districts, where he met 
with IDPs, returnees and relocated persons, government representatives, senior regional 
military commanders and representatives of local and international non-governmental 
organizations and United Nations agencies. While he focused on those displaced by armed 
conflict and acts of violence, the Special Rapporteur also wishes to recall the plight of those 
displaced by the devastating tsunami of December 2004 and subsequent natural disasters, as 
mentioned in the 2007 mission report of the then Representative of the Secretary-General 
on internally displaced persons (A/HRC/8/6/Add.4, para. 16 (f)).  
</p><p>3. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the cooperation of the Government of Sri Lanka, 
notably in inviting him and facilitating his meetings and field visits to the north, and the 
open conversations he had with interlocutors in Colombo and in the north of the country. 
He is very grateful for the outstanding support provided by the United Nations country 
team, in particular the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator and his team, and the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Colombo and its field 
offices. He benefitted from the substantive and insightful information provided to him by 
civil society organizations and appreciates the communications he received prior to and 
during his visit. Above all, he wishes to thank the many IDPs, returnees and relocated 
persons who patiently shared their experiences with him under very difficult circumstances, 
even when they could not hold individual conversations with him in the presence of 
security and other officials. The Special Rapporteur recalls that, in line with the Terms of 
Reference for Fact-Finding Missions by Special Rapporteurs/Representatives of the 
Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/1998/45, Appendix V), it is important that persons, 
whether officials or private individuals, who contacted him in relation to his official visit 
pursuant to his mandate, are not as a result intimidated, threatened or prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur shared his preliminary findings with the Government at the 
conclusion of his visit and was encouraged by the willingness of government officials to 
continue to cooperate with his mandate in acknowledging that more concerted action was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 </b> 
</p>
<p>needed to support durable solutions for IDPs, returnees and relocated persons. He 
commends the willingness and commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to continue to 
dialogue with him on the issue of durable solutions in the aftermath of his visit and views 
the response of the Government of Sri Lanka to the present report (A/HRC/26/33/Add.6) in 
that context. The Special Rapporteur, while cognisant of the human rights situation in Sri 
Lanka and of the developments in that regard at the Human Rights Council, focused 
exclusively in the present report on assessing the situation of internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Previous missions by the mandate to Sri Lanka  
</b></p>
<p>5. The former Representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons, 
Francis Deng, undertook an official mission to Sri Lanka from 10 to 17 November 1993. 
His successor, Walter K&#228;lin, undertook an official mission to Sri Lanka from 14 to 21 
December 2007, during which he focused on the situation of the estimated 577,000 IDPs at 
the time, as well as the key obstacles and conditions necessary to enable them to find 
durable solutions. He then conducted two follow-up working visits at the invitation of the 
Government from 2 to 6 April and from 24 to 26 September 2009. The first follow-up visit 
focused on the actions necessary to protect further the lives of the civilians still under the 
control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), critical steps for the protection of 
IDPs who at the time were under the Government&#8217;s care, and concrete measures to facilitate 
the prompt and sustainable return of the displaced. The second visit raised critical issues on 
the protection by the Government of IDPs in camps, including the issue of freedom of 
movement and release of IDPs, and provided recommendations to promote durable 
solutions.  
</p>
<p>6. The Representative of the Secretary-General also chaired a national consultation on 
durable solutions for IDPs, organized by the Sri Lankan Ministry of Disaster Management 
and Human Rights and supported by UNHCR, from 23 to 25 September 2008. At the end 
of the consultation, a series of recommendations were issued on improving baseline data, 
security and confidence-building measures and achieving durable solutions, but were not 
acted upon.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Dynamics of internal displacement and identifying those 
in need 
</b></p>
<p>7. Sri Lanka was affected by several cycles of displacement during the conflict, which 
lasted until 2009. As highlighted in the 2007 mission report of the Representative of the 
Secretary-General, international attention focused largely on two phenomena: the 2004 
tsunami which killed an estimated 40,000 persons and displaced more than half a million, 
and the re-escalation of the armed conflict since 2006 (A/HRC/8/6/Add.4, para. 14). In 
reality, hundreds of thousands of people, most of them belonging to the Tamil and Muslim 
ethnic minorities, but also some from the Sinhalese majority, were internally displaced at 
various stages of the conflict, many of them multiple times. Many IDPs were also affected 
by the tsunami and following that, were displaced once again owing to the war.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Identifying those in need of protection and durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>8. Following the end of the armed conflict in May 2009, the Government stated that, 
together with its national and international partners, it supported the return or relocation of 
some 760,000 internally displaced persons, as part of its post-conflict reconstruction </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>efforts.1 In practice, tens of thousands of IDPs, as well as relocated IDPs and returnees, are 
in need of protection and assistance to reach durable solutions. International understanding 
on reaching durable solutions in enshrined in principle 28 of the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2, Annex), which reads, &#8220;Competent 
authorities have the primary duty and responsibility to establish conditions, as well as 
provide the means, which allow internally displaced persons to return voluntarily, in safety 
and with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence, or to resettle voluntarily in 
another part of the country. Such authorities shall endeavour to facilitate the reintegration 
of returned or resettled internally displaced persons&#8221;. The Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement were recognized by Heads of State and Government during the 2005 World 
Summit (A/RES/60/1, para. 132). Therefore, the present report uses the term &#8220;durable 
solutions&#8221; on that basis, and uses the term &#8220;relocation&#8221; when referring to IDPs in relocation 
villages. That distinction is important, as the Government of Sri Lanka uses the term 
&#8220;resettlement&#8221; for return and settlement elsewhere in the country. Relocation does not 
necessarily mean or imply a durable solution. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. IDPs 
</b></p>
<p>9. The current number of IDPs in Sri Lanka is itself an issue to be addressed in the 
context of finding durable solutions on a comprehensive basis. Durable solutions cannot be 
implemented effectively without concise knowledge of the size and profile of the IDP 
population. There are discrepancies in the figures on IDPs used by the Government, local 
authorities, regional military command structures in the Northern and Eastern Provinces 
and international organizations. For example, the Ministry of External Affairs informed the 
Special Rapporteur that 22,000 IDPs were currently still displaced. According to UNHCR 
statistics obtained from local government officials, some 93,447 people were still internally 
displaced at the end of 2012, the most recent year in which such statistics were collected.2 
That includes IDPs living in camps called &#8220;welfare centres&#8221; or with host communities, and 
who have not been able to return, primarily owing to the occupation of their land or the 
presence of landmines on their land; they are mostly ethnic Tamil populations. According 
to civil society representatives, there are 34 welfare centres in Jaffna alone. The Special 
Rapporteur visited a welfare centre in Jaffna, and affirms that he saw for himself that there 
are persons there who have been displaced for 24 years and are living without electricity or 
adequate water or sanitation. Some of the lands on which welfare centres are built have 
recently been reclaimed by their original owners, themselves refugees abroad. He welcomes 
the initiative taken by the Government since his visit to address seriously the discrepancy in 
figures, and notes that the Government has discussed that as an important issue with 
UNHCR and other international organizations both in Colombo and Geneva, and with the 
participation of representatives of the Ministry of Resettlement and the Presidential Task 
Force for Resettlement, Development and Security in the Northern Province. As a result, 
hitherto unreported IDP families in the Northern and Eastern Provinces have been 
identified.  
</p>
<p>10. In addition to displacement in the 2000s, tens of thousands of IDPs fled their homes 
in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, the LTTE expelled the entire Muslim population, some 
75,000 people, from Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Vavuniya Districts, as 
well as reportedly some 35,000 Sinhalese from the Northern Province. The majority of 
them found refuge in Puttalam District, on the western coast of Sri Lanka. While the vast 
majority have, without being consulted, been registered by the authorities as having 
returned, in practice few of them are living permanently in their areas of origin. That is 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The Ministry of Resettlement has indicated that, as of January 2014, some 759,995 people had been 
</p>
<p>&#8220;resettled&#8221;, meaning they had returned or had been relocated.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.4

<p><b>6 </b> 
</p>
<p>owing to a combination of complex factors, including socioeconomic issues linked to the 
protracted nature of their displacement for almost 30 years, the growth in the size of 
displaced families during that time, the lack of access to land and the need for new land. 
The Special Rapporteur has been informed that the Government is taking measures to 
release nearly 3,200 acres of lands to such families to facilitate their return to their original 
places. That is crucial as many of those who are seeking to integrate locally are reported to 
lack durable housing and livelihoods. While some of them lost their documentation or their 
land is reportedly occupied, the Government explains that when the resettlement process 
commenced, only the Muslim IDP families who volunteered to return were registered as 
having returned, not all returnees. That explains the discrepancy in the figures, which is 
being addressed, but more support is needed to ensure that Muslim IDPs can either find a 
durable solution in line with their wishes through return to the north, or integrate locally in 
Puttalam District without suffering discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Returnees and relocated IDPs with needs linked to their displacement 
</b></p>
<p>11. Some 760,000 IDPs have registered as having &#8220;returned&#8221; to their areas of origin in 
the north and the east since April 2009. Tens of thousands of them, including people who 
were displaced in the last phases of the armed conflict and others who were displaced in 
previous decades, are reported not to have found durable solutions. During his visit, the 
Special Rapporteur met with returnees who lived on their land of origin, but were dwelling 
in makeshift shelters without access to their agricultural land, adequate water and sanitation 
or other basic services. He found the situation of single women headed households, such as 
widows, particularly dire, as explained in section IV C (4) below. 
</p><p>12. Also included among those registered as having &#8220;returned&#8221; are the thousands of 
individuals whose land remains closed for return, but whom the Government relocated in 
new villages in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Trincomalee and Mullaitivu Districts. The 
Government makes the point that the government agent in Mullaitivu visited the 
transitional welfare villages at Menik Farm and conducted discussions with regard to the 
provision of alternative lands for those families. After detailed interviews, the Special 
Rapporteur found that there had been little or no consultation of IDPs during the relocation 
process, and that those villages may not offer adequate access to livelihood opportunities. 
The Special Rapporteur visited the model village of Sooripuram in Keppapilavu, Mullaitivu 
District, where IDPs from Menik Farm were relocated onto public land by the State. 
Original lands belonging to some IDPs, at least some 185 IDP families by government 
account, have been occupied by the military and it is unclear whether those families will be 
able to return home or receive compensation for their land. The Government, through the 
Ministry of Defence, has taken steps to release land for cultivation, including 250 acres of 
land suitable for agriculture, to be distributed among relocated families at a quarter of an 
acre per family. However, those measures should be sustainable, support livelihoods, and 
meet the conditions stipulated in principle 28 of the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement in order to constitute durable solutions. During his visit, the Special 
Rapporteur found that the village built by the military has permanent houses of standard 
size, regardless of each family&#8217;s size, which begs a needs assessment exercise. It has 
unpaved roads, electricity, a primary school, a few water wells and a temple, but does not 
have a stationed health clinic or livelihood opportunities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Demographic issues 
</b></p>
<p>13. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur heard from several international and 
national civil society representatives that ethnic Sinhalese people originating from the south 
of the country were being supported officially to settle in the north. While some Sinhalese 
people were indeed displaced over the 26 years of conflict (22,000 Sinhalese were 
displaced in the 1980s and 1990s, according to the Secretary of Defence), it is not clear </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>whether the recently settled families originate from the north, or whether other families are 
encouraged to settle there as well. Some of the land where the families are being settled is 
also claimed by ethnic Tamil IDPs displaced within the north. Clearly, all the citizens of Sri 
Lanka, without discrimination, have the right to freedom of movement and choice of place 
of residence within Sri Lanka. Owing to the centrality of land and competing claims over it 
in the context of dealing with displacement and attaining durable solutions in the post-
conflict phase, the Special Rapporteur recommends prioritizing the resolution of land and 
property issues on a comprehensive basis in order to achieve durable solutions for IDPs in 
the framework of freedom of movement and choice of place of residence.  
</p>
<p><b> C. New displacement related to development projects 
</b>14. Over the past years, the Urban Development Authority, under the auspices of the 
Ministry of Defence, has undertaken several projects in the city of Colombo with a view to 
developing it as the country&#8217;s commercial capital, in line with the Government policy 
directives on urban development. The Government has implemented a programme to 
construct high-rise apartments targeting 65,000 housing units to be constructed to provide 
decent houses to low-income families living in underserved settlements scattered in the city 
of Colombo, covering an area of nearly 900 acres. It is one of the strategic programmes 
under way to achieve the expected urban development in the city of Colombo, among many 
other current rejuvenation projects. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the undertaking by 
the Government that, under the programme, no families will be displaced and all families 
will be provided with permanent houses, while releasing a large acreage of underutilized 
land for productive purposes in accordance with the Colombo Development Master Plan. 
The undertaking is significant because the Special Rapporteur received information that 
hundreds of families have been evicted from their homes in Colombo to make way for 
development projects and that durable solutions were not provided to the persons displaced 
in that process, a number of whom have appealed to the Supreme Court. The Special 
Rapporteur was given to understand that some of the people evicted obtained alternative 
rental accommodation for some years, but they were not provided with permanent housing, 
despite Court orders to that effect. He learned from civil society organizations that recently, 
550 families had been displaced from their land which was sold to a private company to 
build apartments. The Special Rapporteur also learned during his visit that the land around 
Jaffna airport would be expropriated to expand the airport. He urges the Government to 
conduct a transparent process and provide alternative areas of residence and fair 
compensation to those set to be relocated. The National Involuntary Resettlement Policy, 
which aims to ensure that persons affected by development projects are treated in a fair and 
equitable manner and are not impoverished in the process, should be applied in that case, 
with due regard for relevant international standards.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Relevant frameworks for protection and assistance to 
internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic legal, policy and institutional frameworks 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission 
</b></p>
<p>15. In 2010, Sri Lanka established the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission 
(LLRC), after President Mahinda Rajapaksa made a joint commitment to an accountability 
process in Sri Lanka alongside United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The LLRC 
was tasked to investigate the events leading to the breakdown of the 2002 ceasefire 
agreement, recommend measures to prevent the recurrence of such events and promote </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 </b> 
</p>
<p>national unity and reconciliation to address the past. The final report of the LLRC, 
published in 2011, contained chapters on IDPs, notably chapter 5, which focused on human 
rights with a specific section dedicated to IDPs, and chapter 6 entitled &#8220;Land issues: return 
and resettlement&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. The LLRC recognized the importance of finding durable solutions for IDPs in the 
medium and long term, &#8220;without which a sustainable and all inclusive reconciliation 
process cannot be achieved&#8221;.3 While encouraging the Government to respect IDPs&#8217; freedom 
of movement to &#8220;re-settle in their places of origin, in accordance with internationally 
accepted principles governing voluntary return&#8221;4 and to raise awareness amongst IDPs with 
regard to the options available to them, it also stressed the necessity to address the 
&#8220;continuing needs of people who have been resettled and are in the process of making 
efforts to rebuild their lives&#8221;.5  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur supports the conclusion of the LLRC on the need to find 
durable solutions for all IDPs and welcomes the recommendation on &#8220;the creation of a 
uniform State policy aimed at resettlement of these IDPs and/or integrating them into host 
community&#8221;,6 reiterating the need to raise awareness among IDPs about the options 
available to them and to respect their final decision. He calls for the urgent implementation 
of that recommendation.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>18. After three years of internal consultations and international encouragement 
following the first cycle of the Universal Periodic Review, in 2011, the Government of Sri 
Lanka adopted a five-year National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human 
Rights. A whole section of the Plan is dedicated to the rights of IDPs and includes the goal 
of developing a &#8220;broad national policy on displacement which takes into account all forms 
of displacement (conflict, natural disasters, economic development, etc.) drawing from the 
Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement Framework with specific attention to 
vulnerable groups;&#8221;7 the protection of IDPs&#8217; right to vote; access to legal documentation 
and justice; the promotion of safe return, notably through landmine clearance; the 
promotion and protection of IDPs&#8217; rights to land and housing; access to clean water and 
sanitation in a gender-sensitive manner and with due consideration of vulnerability, 
including disability; the enhancement of psychosocial support for displaced persons and 
communities, including host families; the promotion of adequate livelihood options for 
IDPs, including through training and education; protection for especially vulnerable groups 
such as the elderly and the disabled; and the prevention of displacement due to natural 
disasters.8  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Draft Framework for Resettlement Policy 
</b></p>
<p>19. In 2013, the Government developed a Framework for Resettlement Policy 
addressing conflict-induced displacement. The draft policy has important objectives, 
including the improvement of livelihoods and the restoration of land ownership and other 
lost documents. It mentions consultation with IDPs in project planning and implementation,

<p>and includes national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as 
partners. The Special Rapporteur, while recognizing the importance of the draft policy, 
notes that it falls significantly short of both the goals of the National Action Plan and of the 
comprehensive 2008 draft IDP bill. It focuses on the initial phases of conflict-induced 
displacement, does not encompass displacement caused by natural disasters and 
development projects, and is not consistent with international terminology on the three 
durable solutions (see below). At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, he was 
concerned that no time frame for the revision and adoption of the draft policy had been 
provided. He has since been assured that the Ministry of Resettlement is in the process of 
organizing broader consultations to finalize the draft framework. During that process, he 
calls for the draft policy to be based on the recommendations of the LLRC, the National 
Action Plan, the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and the Inter-Agency 
Standing Committee Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons 
(2010). 
</p>
<p><b> 4. National structures 
</b></p>
<p>20. At the end of the armed conflict in May 2009, a Presidential Task Force for 
Resettlement, Development and Security in the Northern Province was set up under the 
chairmanship of the Minister of Economic Development. The Task Force led a 180 day 
programme consisting of demining operations, reconstruction of basic infrastructure, 
humanitarian assistance and livelihood and early recovery.9 The Government worked with 
partners to rebuild roads, bridges, schools, hospitals and health centres, local government 
buildings, markets and houses. The military played a central role in reconstruction and the 
demining of return areas, with international assistance.10 The Government is also leading 
major projects to ensure the production of electricity in the north and east, as well as water 
and sanitation projects. The restoring of infrastructure in the north and east, the rebuilding 
or repairing of houses, as well as the release of some land to their original owners, have 
allowed many IDPs to return and go back to their traditional livelihoods of farming and 
fishing.  
</p>
<p>21. Several ministries have responsibilities for displacement-related issues, in particular 
the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights, and the Ministry of Resettlement 
and Disaster Relief Services. The Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Defence 
also participated in formulating policies and responses to displacement. A National Steering 
Committee chaired by the Minister for Resettlement was tasked to manage IDP camps. At 
the local level, the governors and local officials named &#8220;Government Agents&#8221; are 
responsible for supporting durable solutions for IDPs, together with the Chief Ministers for 
the north and east and the Chief Minister responsible for Puttalam IDPs. In order to be 
officially recognized as an IDP, one has to be registered as such by the Government. 
Registration entitles IDPs to a card granting them access to assistance. Since the end of the 
conflict, deregistration has been undertaken primarily by local authorities, based on the 
decision that areas of origin had been opened to return and not on whether IDPs had 
achieved durable solutions. Civil society representatives expressed their concerns at the 
Government&#8217;s decision to replace some people&#8217;s IDP cards with resident cards despite the 
fact that the people concerned were still displaced. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur learnt during his mission that the closing of IDP camps had 
led to the deregistration of IDPs, which paved the way to their subsequent registration as

</p>
<p>returnees, based on a factual assessment and as soon as IDPs reported for resettlement. The 
Special Rapporteur cautions that such deregistration is not in accordance with international 
practice. Deregistration by itself does not resolve the reality of the situation of IDPs. It is 
critical to carry out a survey of intent on the part of IDPs, in conjunction with profiling and 
needs assessment in order for durable solutions to be sustainable when IDPs no longer have 
specific displacement-related protection needs. The Special Rapporteur maintains that tens 
of thousands of those who returned or were relocated need support to reach durable 
solutions, particularly in terms of restoring their livelihood in safety and dignity, as many of 
them lack access to their original land or to fisheries. Special attention has to be paid to 
those whose livelihood is dependent on fishing in order to ensure that they have access to 
their traditional means of livelihood. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International frameworks to address durable solutions  
</b></p>
<p>23. The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement recognize that IDPs have the right 
to choose among three settlement options which, if sustainable, will lead to a durable 
solution: (i) return to their place of origin; (ii) integration in the area of displacement; or 
(iii) settlement in another part of the country. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee 
(IASC) Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons indicates that a 
&#8220;durable solution is achieved when internally displaced persons no longer have any specific 
assistance and protection needs that are linked to their displacement and can enjoy their 
human rights without discrimination on account of their displacement&#8221; 
(A/HRC/13/21/Add.4, p. 2). That implies that physical relocation or return do not in 
themselves constitute durable solutions. The IASC Framework identifies the human rights-
based principles that should inform the pursuit of durable solutions and sets out criteria to 
identify the extent to which a durable solution has been attained. The criteria are useful for 
monitoring progress towards durable solutions in Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p>24. The identification of durable solutions should take place against the backdrop of the 
overarching principles defined by international law to govern durable solutions, namely that 
the State has the primary responsibility to provide durable solutions, that the interests of 
IDPs are central in the process, that the choice of IDPs should be informed, participatory 
and voluntary, and that IDPs and host communities should be treated in a non-
discriminatory fashion. While the Government has made impressive strides in 
reconstructing the Northern and Eastern Provinces, more needs to be done to support 
people to rebuild their lives and to ensure that they can make free and informed choices. 
Solutions should be developed together with IDPs and should enable them to find a path 
towards self-reliance.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur notes with great appreciation the Government&#8217;s 
commitment at the highest level &#8220;to do whatever it can to solve the problem of IDPs&#8221;, as 
stated by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development during the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to the country.  
</p>
<p>26. The majority of IDPs, returnees and relocated IDPs are currently in the districts of 
Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, Mannar, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Ampara, 
Puttalam and Anuradhapura. It is important to identify durable solutions for the significant 
number of IDPs who live in protracted displacement situations, apart from, or in addition 
to, the tens of thousands who have returned or have been relocated in the Northern and 
Eastern Provinces and who live in very precarious conditions.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>27. According to a 2013 survey by the World Food Programme, nearly seven out of 
10 households in Vavuniya and Mullaitivu Districts were food insecure. The survey also 
reported a rising level of debt to cope with the lack of livelihood opportunities.11 The 
survey may not reflect the United Nations position on the matter, but it is indicative, in the 
context of the independence of the mandate. Many returnees&#8217; houses still need to be 
rehabilitated. Of the more than 140,000 houses destroyed or damaged in the north during 
the conflict, at least 44,000 have been repaired and rebuilt, which leaves some 61,000 
families, or 200,000 people, in temporary or damaged housing, or with host families.12 In 
Mullaitivu, for example, local authorities mentioned to the Special Rapporteur that 21,766 
houses still needed to be repaired or rebuilt. 
</p>
<p><b> A. International response, development actors and processes 
</b></p>
<p>28. Pursuant to the Government&#8217;s request, UNHCR has been the lead international 
agency for IDPs in Sri Lanka. In the aftermath of the conflict, UNHCR initially focused on 
providing protection and humanitarian assistance to IDPs; it has since shifted its action to 
support durable solutions. A range of local and international NGOs and United Nations 
agencies have provided emergency assistance, but also cash grants, transitional and 
permanent housing to IDPs in the aftermath of conflict. As explained by the Government, 
all projects in the Northern Province, as is the case in all the other provinces, require the 
approval of the Department of External Resources and the relevant ministry or ministries. 
The Presidential Task Force for Resettlement, Development and Security in the Northern 
Province (PTF) coordinates support for such projects through the government machinery. 
However, the Special Rapporteur learned that all humanitarian projects in the north 
required the approval of the PTF and that the PTF has rarely approved protection projects 
such as psychosocial support, legal assistance, family tracing and reunification.  
</p>
<p>29. Sri Lanka no longer attracts significant humanitarian resources, compared to the 
immediate aftermath of the conflict. In 2012, the last United Nations humanitarian plan for 
the north was only 27 per cent funded.13 Several humanitarian agencies recently closed their 
operations in Sri Lanka, and those dealing with humanitarian and development programmes 
have started to shift their focus to development aspects. Constructing a development based 
strategy for durable solutions for IDPs is therefore now essential. 
</p>
<p>30. While Sri Lanka has made significant progress towards achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals by 2015, the persisting regional disparities, which are most visible in 
the Northern and Eastern Provinces, need to be addressed, notably in terms of access to 
health services, education facilities and employment opportunities.14  
</p>
<p>31. Achieving durable solutions is a gradual process which may require sustained action 
over many years by national authorities to respond to the humanitarian, development and 
peacebuilding needs of IDPs, in partnership with civil society and international actors. The 
United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for 2013&#8211;2017 shifts the

</p>
<p>overall United Nations response from humanitarian to development aspects. The plan 
mentions the response to the needs of conflict-affected people, but it does not address the 
issue of durable solutions for IDPs per se. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
involvement of development actors to support livelihood and reconciliation projects in the 
north and the east, including for IDPs, returnees and relocated persons. Fostering durable 
solutions requires the rights, needs and legitimate interests of IDPs to be taken into account 
through their direct involvement at all stages of the process. The Special Rapporteur 
appreciates the fact that the Joint Needs Assessment, to be conducted by the Government of 
Sri Lanka and the United Nations humanitarian country team, will also address the issue of 
durable solutions for IDPs.  
</p>
<p>32. Working towards durable solutions entails effective coordination to ensure 
complementarity of action between all relevant partners and stakeholders, including IDPs. 
The relationship between the PTF and provincial and district authorities in relation to IDPs 
should be clarified, and other relevant ministries, including the Ministry for Resettlement, 
should be involved. The coordination mechanism should be linked to relevant international 
actors and platforms and should reach out to investment partners. Relevant entities, such as 
the Ministry for Resettlement and provincial and district authorities, should include budget 
provisions for IDPs and undertake capacity-building on internal displacement for relevant 
government employees. The Government should allow donors to partner directly with 
relevant local authorities to support solutions for IDPs. The response to the needs of IDPs 
should also use a protection lens, including in regard to single female heads of households, 
and be linked to the support of governance and the rule of law, as it is essential to ensure 
that IDPs get peace dividends. Also, the resilience of displaced and relocated communities, 
who are not in their areas of origin, should be supported as they are particularly vulnerable 
to recurrent shocks.  
</p>
<p>33. In addition, it is important to set up a monitoring system by local government 
(district) representatives in partnership with civil society organizations to check how people 
are faring during displacement, but also after return or relocation, and to make those data 
available to national and international partners. Monitoring should include a gender 
analysis and a credible complaint mechanism for IDPs, returnees and relocated persons, so 
that any concern is brought to the immediate attention of relevant authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The importance of harmonized data 
</b></p>
<p>34. The lack of precise knowledge on the current location, needs and aspirations of 
IDPs, as well as those who integrated locally, returned or were relocated, presents 
difficulties in designing an effective response for meeting the needs of those who have not 
found durable solutions. It is essential to harmonize data on IDPs, returnees and relocated 
persons in relation to the specific outstanding needs linked to their displacement in order to 
allow for the best possible allocation of resources. Rather than focusing on the categories of 
old and new IDPs, based on when people were displaced,15 assistance should be based on 
needs. A comprehensive assessment should focus on all areas that have historically hosted 
IDPs, the Northern, Eastern, North-Western and North-Central Provinces, and also consider 
the needs of communities hosting IDPs. Comprehensive data is not only essential for 
humanitarian planning, but also to bolster the engagement of development actors in the 
support of durable solutions for IDPs in Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>15
 &#8220;New IDPs&#8221; was the term used to describe those who were displaced after April 2008 and who were 
</p>
<p>then placed in closed camps. &#8220;Old IDPs&#8221; is a more flexible term used to describe those who were 
displaced before that date.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>35. The data should be disaggregated by age and sex to capture the needs of IDPs, 
including vulnerable groups such as single women headed households. As of December 
2013, the Government was cooperating with the United Nations on a so-called &#8220;survey of 
surveys&#8221;, mapping out the information on IDPs based on the different assessments 
available. The exercise is supposed to be followed by the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA), a 
joint effort of the Government and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 
to address gaps in information on the humanitarian, early recovery and development needs 
of IDPs, relocated persons and returnees. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
undertaking of the JNA and encourages government officials at the national, provincial and 
district levels, as well as humanitarian and development partners, in close consultation with 
IDPs, to undertake that important exercise and to devise an agreed timeline for its roll-out. 
A survey of intent of IDPs, but also of returned and relocated persons, to find out which 
durable solutions IDPs would prefer, should be built into the JNA to ensure a sustainable 
process. The Special Rapporteur encourages all relevant partners in Sri Lanka to work with 
the Joint IDP Profiling Service to include a profiling exercise in the JNA.16  
</p>
<p><b> C. Obstacles to durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>36. Several obstacles to durable solutions for IDPs in Sri Lanka, some of which are 
connected, are important to address at the current time.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Security concerns and impediments to freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>37. There are some general security issues which affect IDPs&#8217; freedom of movement 
and choice of place of residence which need to be addressed. They relate to the 
continuation of armed conflict measures, including the Prevention of the Terrorism Act 
(1978), and the continued heavy presence of military forces in the former conflict zone. An 
estimated 57 per cent of respondents to a recent UNHCR survey on durable solutions for 
IDPs reported a military presence or a checkpoint less than a mile from their homes, 87 per 
cent of respondents said they had been registered by the military, and a third said they had 
been interviewed by the military or the Criminal Investigation Department.17 Owing to the 
ethnic dimensions of the history of the conflict, the heavy presence of military personnel in 
the north does not instil confidence on the part of IDPs, relocated persons and returnees in 
the aftermath of the conflict. The Special Rapporteur was struck by the expressions of 
desolation and even despair he came across during his visit. &#8220;There is no war, but no peace 
either, we live under constant threat and tension,&#8221; and &#8220;we are in the jungle and living in 
darkness,&#8221; were some of the messages which interlocutors conveyed to the Special 
Rapporteur. The involvement of the military in civilian issues affects the security climate, 
in particular for women, whose position is made more vulnerable by the breakdown of 
social networks and communities. The heavy military presence also impacts on IDPs&#8217; 
prospects to return to their land and rebuild their lives, as explained in section IV C (2) 
below. The Special Rapporteur received official assurances that a gradual phased 
withdrawal of the military from certain areas would take place; he calls for transparent 
information on such plans to be shared with IDPs.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur also learned from various actors during his visit that military 
personnel in the north were involved in commercial activities, either in partnership with

<p>their relatives or with other people from outside the north. They were reported to be 
producing and selling vegetables at low prices with which small farmers cannot compete, to 
be running animal farms, to have taken over fisheries in certain areas, to have built hotels 
for tourism and to own factories serving no obvious military purpose. Civil society 
representatives also reported that they were under constant surveillance by the Government 
and the military and that their freedom of movement was curtailed. They added that the 
PTF was denying civil society organizations access to IDPs, whether to discuss their 
situation or offer support, on the ground that those people were no longer IDPs. In 
accordance with principle 30 of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, 
international monitoring bodies, national human rights institutions, non-governmental 
organizations and other independent observers should enjoy unimpeded access to areas of 
IDP return and relocation and to IDPs themselves. IDPs should feel comfortable meeting 
with national and international actors and not be concerned that such meetings might leave 
them open to reprisals.  
</p>
<p>39. The September 2013 elections to the Northern Provincial Council resulted in a 
victory for the Tamil National Alliance, which won 78 per cent of the vote. Civil society 
organizations in Jaffna reported an increase in military presence since the September 
elections. While the Governor in Jaffna emphasized to the Special Rapporteur the 
importance of working with the newly elected provincial authorities, the Chief Minister for 
the north stated that he had little autonomy to carry out his duties, including the promotion 
of durable solutions for IDPs. That underlines the need for clarity in the roles of the 
Governor, Government Agents, and the Chief Minister for the north with respect to IDPs in 
the context of decentralization.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Lack of access to land 
</b></p>
<p>40. Another obstacle to durable solutions for IDPs is the lack of access to their original 
land, which prevents their return and sustainable livelihoods. All the IDPs the Special 
Rapporteur talked to emphasized their strong wish to return home. He met with widows 
who, upon the release of their original land by the military, preferred to return to their small 
plot of land rather than stay in relocation villages, even if that meant living in a makeshift 
shelter instead of a new house. 
</p>
<p>41. The main reasons preventing IDPs from accessing their land are the presence of 
landmines, the establishment of special military and economic zones, and the IDPs&#8217; lack of 
documentation concerning their land of origin.  
</p>
<p>42. The Government indicated to the Special Rapporteur that 62,000 square miles still 
needed to be cleared of mines, out of more than 1.4 million square miles that had been 
contaminated at the end of the armed conflict. The local government representative in 
Mullaitivu informed the Special Rapporteur that those who could not return home owing to 
landmines would be relocated on another land of comparable size.  
</p>
<p>43. The second main reason preventing access to return areas is the use of IDPs&#8217; land of 
origin by the military, following the demarcation of large areas in the 1990s as High 
Security Zones (HSZs). Former HSZs have formally ceased to exist and since the beginning 
of 2010, areas of the HSZs have been demined and partly opened for return, but significant 
tracks of land continue to be used by the military for cantonment and other activities, 
including economic activities. In April 2013, the Government began acquiring over 6,000 
acres in Jaffna Peninsula under the Land Acquisition Act (1950). The vast majority of that 
land belongs to IDPs, but currently hosts 32 military camps and other installations. Civil 
society actors have pointed out that, according to the law, land should be taken only for a 
&#8220;public purpose,&#8221; which is far from established. Besides the land in Jaffna, the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights learned from the Minister of Economic 
Development of the compulsory acquisition of private land for the permanent installation of 
military camps and other installations in Trincomalee, Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Districts.18 In Trincomalee, that concerned an area falling under a Special Economic Zone 
which had previously been part of an HSZ. The Special Rapporteur was informed of 
concerns on the part of families in a camp in Jaffna who have been unable to return to their 
land for 24 years owing to military occupation. They used to make a living from fishing and 
farming activities and need to access their land in order to have sustainable livelihoods. The 
Special Rapporteur also learned that over 2,000 people displaced from their land have 
challenged the compulsory acquisition of land before the Court of Appeal and the Supreme 
Court. IDPs and civil society organizations that had filed cases reported to the Special 
Rapporteur that they have been intimidated by military personnel in an apparent attempt to 
make them withdraw their cases.  
</p>
<p>44. The third main reason preventing access to return areas is the lack of land 
ownership. Landless IDPs include families who had rented houses on agricultural land 
before displacement, or whose parents own land in their place of origin but who themselves 
did not have the capital necessary to purchase land. Many IDPs the Special Rapporteur met 
with said they had lost the documentation to their land during the conflict, or that their 
parents, who were the original owners, had died, but that they had not received assistance to 
recover documentation to their land. Landless IDPs with whom the Special Rapporteur met 
seemed open to settling elsewhere in the country if return was not possible. Local 
government officials indicated during the mission that, as much as possible, people without 
land were given public land, with titles delivered by the Government.  
</p>
<p>45. The fact that the Prescription Ordinance gives land ownership to those who have 
occupied the land for at least 10 years, even for land belonging to those who fled during the 
conflict, further exacerbates the situation.19 The LLRC recommended that the law be 
amended so that it would not apply to land transfers or land occupation which occurred 
during the conflict. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to hear from the Ministry of 
External Affairs that Parliament had decided to set up a group dedicated to resolving land 
conflicts at the grass-roots level, and looks forward to remaining updated on the progress 
made in that regard.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur advises the Government to ensure that IDPs are able to 
claim their land and are not prevented from returning owing to the acquisition or 
occupation of private lands by the military or State officials. In exceptional cases, when 
land cannot be returned to IDPs, the Government should take steps to follow due process, 
provide compensation and support sustainable relocation in line with international 
standards. The National Involuntary Resettlement Policy, although it applies to 
development projects, is a good starting point to guide such relocation.20  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Lack of accountability and impediments to reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p>47. Another major obstacle to durable solutions for IDPs, returnees and relocated 
persons is the lack of effective remedies for the violations of international human rights law 
and international humanitarian law which caused displacement or which occurred during 
displacement. The 2011 report of the Secretary-General&#8217;s Panel of Experts on 
Accountability in Sri Lanka pointed to the systematic failure of the Government to hold

the lack of independence and impartiality of the country&#8217;s judicial system.21 
</p><p>48. A recent worrying trend, which may lead to new waves of displacement and 
therefore requires prevention, is the series of attacks by Buddhist extremists, who have 
targeted Muslim and Christian religious sites in different parts of the country, and the lack 
of swift action taken against the perpetrators. The Special Rapporteur was informed during 
his visit that some mosques and churches frequented by IDPs had been destroyed in the 
north of the country. Some IDPs reported that their land of origin had been defined as a 
sacred area for a Buddhist temple, preventing them from returning. 
</p>
<p>49. Under principle 16 of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, all internally 
displaced persons have the right to know the fate and whereabouts of missing relatives. 
Principle 16 also requires that the authorities concerned endeavour to establish the fate and 
whereabouts of internally displaced persons who are reported missing and cooperate with 
relevant international organizations engaged in that task. In addition, principle 17 (3) 
stipulates that families that are separated by displacement should be reunited as quickly as 
possible. All appropriate steps should be taken to expedite the reunion of such families, 
particularly when children are involved. The responsible authorities should facilitate 
inquiries made by family members and encourage and cooperate with humanitarian 
organizations engaged in the task of family reunification. By virtue of those principles, the 
Special Rapporteur met with internally displaced families who had not heard from their 
sons and husbands since they had surrendered to the military in May 2009, despite the 
families&#8217; repeated attempts to receive news of their whereabouts from security officials. 
The Sri Lankan Government appointed a commission to investigate the fate of nearly 
18,000 people who disappeared during the armed conflict; it is important that the 
commission investigate the fate of internally displaced persons who went missing. Civil 
society organizations in Killinochchi have indicated that in that district alone, 16,000 
reports of missing persons have been collected, including in relation to persons arrested 
during the last phase of the conflict, and children handed over by their parents who were 
under the impression that they would get amnesty. On the basis of principles 16 and 17 (3) 
of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the Special Rapporteur is within the 
purview of his mandate in calling for the involvement of the Working Group on Enforced 
or Involuntary Disappearances of the United Nations to assist and complement the work of 
the commission established by the Government of Sri Lanka to investigate those 
disappearances. All internally displaced persons have the right to know the fate and 
whereabouts of missing relatives, and the authorities have a duty to cooperate with relevant 
international and humanitarian organizations engaged in that task. 
</p>
<p>50. In the search for durable solutions, it is vital to address issues impacting on access to 
justice, reconciliation and healing between the country&#8217;s Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim 
communities, including loss and suffering, and initiate an open dialogue with those affected 
by the conflict. It is important to ensure effective decentralization and to involve local 
governments in the support of durable solutions for IDPs, including on budgetary decisions, 
so that conditions return to normal. The recommendations of the LLRC in that regard, as 
well as on the independence of judiciary, on a transparent legal process and on the strict 
adherence to the rule of law, are essential elements underpinning any durable solutions for 
IDPs.

<p><b> 4. Protection of women and children  
</b></p>
<p>51. Displaced and relocated women face particular obstacles in achieving durable 
solutions. As indicated by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women, alleged gross violations of the human rights of internally displaced women, 
including sexual violence, still need to be fully addressed and an effective accountability 
system established (CEDAW/C/LKA/CO/7, paras. 40 and 41). Many of the women 
involved are landless, have few options in terms of housing solutions and livelihoods, and 
often work as daily labourers. Many used to live on public land before being displaced or 
have lost proper documentation to their land or have documents in their deceased husband&#8217;s 
or father&#8217;s name and cannot access their land. Land is used as a dowry by women in Sri 
Lanka, and many internally displaced women have been reported by civil society and local 
government representatives in the north to have given up hope of getting married owing to 
their lack of access to their land.  
</p>
<p>52. Houses built to relocate single women headed households in the north are often 
isolated and some are incomplete, making women continuously vulnerable to attacks and 
sexual violence, including reported forced prostitution by elements of the military. The 
Government has acknowledged that sexual violence has been a concern, particularly in 
conflict-affected areas, and has established women and children&#8217;s desks at police stations 
and women&#8217;s centres in IDP welfare centres.22 In response to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
questions on sexual violence in the north, government and military officials informed him 
that such violence was a relic of the conflict. He learnt during his mission that women are 
usually too afraid to report rape and sexual violence to the police. According to civil society 
representatives, when women do report rapes, testimonies given by them in their local 
language are generally recorded by the police in Sinhala, resulting in variation in their 
content. Very few members of the police speak Tamil, making communication between 
IDPs and the police difficult and discouraging. Also, female police officers are not 
available at women and children&#8217;s desks in some police stations in the north. The Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges that the State bears the primary responsibility under international 
human rights law to ensure that all allegations of acts of violence, including acts of sexual 
violence and forced prostitution, are investigated, prosecuted and punished.  
</p>
<p>53. While many IDPs the Special Rapporteur met with said that their children went to 
school, some indicated that their children were prevented from attending school because 
they did not have a birth certificate or because nearby schools had been destroyed. Those 
issues need to be addressed in order to promote and ensure the realization of elementary 
education for internally displaced children.

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>54. <b>The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Sri Lanka took place over four and a half 
years after the end of the armed conflict between the Government and the LTTE. 
Since the end of the armed conflict, the Government has made significant progress, 
together with national and international partners, to facilitate the return or relocation 
of some 760,000 IDPs. It is important to ensure that the tens of thousands for whom 
durable solutions have not yet been found do not stay in limbo but find solutions to 
their plight. The Special Rapporteur believes that significant efforts are required by

<p><b>the Government to find durable solutions, ensuring a voluntary and informed process, 
and invites both humanitarian and development partners to work together with 
national and local authorities to ensure that the livelihoods of IDPs, relocated persons 
and returnees are restored. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to 
invite international partners to assist in promoting the protection of IDPs and others 
in search of durable solutions. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to emphasize the 
need for reconciliation, justice, healing and in particular, the need to bring the 
perpetrators of violations of international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law to justice in order to ensure accountability for wrongs committed to 
IDPs during and after displacement.

<p>55. <b>In the spirit of cooperation extended to him during his visit, the Special 
Rapporteur looks forward to continuing dialogue with the Government of Sri Lanka 
and offers the following conclusions and recommendations.

Provinces, and consider the needs of communities hosting IDPs, in partnership 
with local civil society organizations and international partners; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Given that the conflict has ended, reassess the role of the military in
