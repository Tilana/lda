Provides Status Update on Late Filing of Financial Statements
December 9, 2005... Toronto, Ontario - Kinross Gold Corporation ("Kinross" or
the "Company") (TSX-K; NYSE-KGC). Pursuant to the alternative information
guidelines of the Ontario Securities Commission ("OSC") Policy 57-603 and
Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 57-301, Kinross is providing
bi-weekly updates to the market regarding the process relating to the
preparation and filing of its financial statements and related matters, until
such time as Kinross is current with its filing obligations under Canadian
securities laws.
On November 30, 2005 Kinross filed its audited financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2004 including the comparative audited restated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 and its related management
discussion and analysis ("MD&A"). Kinross also filed its restated quarterly
financial statements and MD&A's for 2004.
Kinross is currently working to finalize and file its quarterly financial
statements for 2005 and other required regulatory filings in order to bring the
Company current and expects to do so in the near future.
An application has been made to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to obtain
an extension to the previous order which required Kinross to hold its
shareholders meeting by December 31, 2005. The application is scheduled to be
heard on December 13, 2005. Kinross intends to hold its annual shareholders
meeting for the year ended December 31, 2004 on January 26, 2006.
We are issuing bi-weekly updates as to the status and timing which can be viewed
