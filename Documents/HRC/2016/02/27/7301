<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
</p>
<p>attainable standard of physical and mental health visited Malaysia from 19 November to 2 
</p>
<p>December 2015. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur considered, in a spirit of dialogue 
</p>
<p>and cooperation, how the country has endeavoured to implement the right to health. In 
</p>
<p>particular, he assessed issues related to: the health-care system and financing, and the right 
</p>
<p>to health of particular groups, such as women and girls; indigenous communities; migrants, 
</p>
<p>refugees and asylum seekers; lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons; 
</p>
<p>persons living with HIV/AIDS; children; and persons with psychosocial and developmental 
</p>
<p>disabilities. 
</p>
<p>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur commends Malaysia for its 
</p>
<p>commitment to realizing the right to health, in particular for advances made in reducing 
</p>
<p>poverty, increasing spending on health, and improving basic health-related indicators. For 
</p>
<p>Malaysia to fully realize the right to health, however, the Special Rapporteur encourages 
</p>
<p>the Government to address a number of serious challenges that are mostly connected to a 
</p>
<p>selective approach to human rights and the prevalence of discrimination against groups in 
</p>
<p>vulnerable situations. With a view to facilitating that endeavour, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>makes a number of recommendations in the report.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur gives details of his visit to Malaysia at 
</p>
<p>the invitation of the Government from 19 November to 2 December 2014. The purpose of 
</p>
<p>the visit was to ascertain, in a spirit of dialogue and cooperation, how the country has 
</p>
<p>endeavoured to implement the right to health. 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with government officials 
</p>
<p>from the Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister&#8217;s Department and the Ministries of 
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs; Health; Home Affairs; Education; Women, Family and Community 
</p>
<p>Development; Rural and Regional Development, including the Department of Orang Asli 
</p>
<p>Development; Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government; and Human Resources. 
</p>
<p>He also held meetings with representatives of the National Human Rights Commission 
</p>
<p>(Suhakam), civil society and international organizations and development partners, 
</p>
<p>academics, legal experts and health professionals.  
</p>
<p>3. As part of his visit, the Special Rapporteur visited health facilities in Kuala Lumpur, 
</p>
<p>Melaka and the State of Sabah, including in the Keningau district. He also visited the 
</p>
<p>infirmary of the Kajang Prison (Kuala Lumpur) and two immigration detention centres, the 
</p>
<p>Lenggeng Immigration Depot (Negeri Sembilan) and the Immigration Detention Depot of 
</p>
<p>the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Malaysia for its invitation 
</p>
<p>and full cooperation during his visit. He would like to take this opportunity to thank the 
</p>
<p>United Nations country team for their support for his visit, and all those who gave him the 
</p>
<p>benefit of their time and experience. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Malaysian economy grew rapidly during the late twentieth century and this 
</p>
<p>growth transformed the country&#8217;s economic and social landscape. The economy has moved 
</p>
<p>from its initial dependence on natural resources to being dominated by industry and 
</p>
<p>services, and has achieved the status of an upper middle-income country.1  
</p>
<p>6. Malaysia has placed the health of its population at the heart of its development 
</p>
<p>policy since it gained independence in 1957. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>commended the Government for its achievements in improving the health status in the 
</p>
<p>country through a sustained commitment to health policy. Considerable improvements have 
</p>
<p>been made in increasing the life expectancy of large sectors of the population. Overall, life 
</p>
<p>expectancy for women has increased from 65.5 to 77 years between 1970 and 2014, and 
</p>
<p>from 61.6 to 72.4 years for men during the same period.  
</p>
<p>7. Maternal mortality rates have plummeted from 140.8 deaths per 1,000 live births in 
</p>
<p>1970 to an estimated 25.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012. Infant mortality rates have 
</p>
<p>more than halved during the same period, from 39.4 deaths per 1,000 live births to an 
</p>
<p>estimated 6.3 per 1,000 live births, reaching ratios similar to those of high-income 
</p>
<p>developed countries. Malaysia is one of three countries in the Association of Southeast 
</p>
<p>Asian Nations (ASEAN) with infant and child mortality rates below 10 per 1,000 live 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 World Bank data, available from http://data.worldbank.org/country/malaysia. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>births. During the same period, the doctor/population ratio has improved from 1 per 4,493 
</p>
<p>to 1 per 758.2 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur commended the achievements related to some of the 
</p>
<p>underlying determinants of health, including the reduction of poverty, improvements in 
</p>
<p>access to water and sanitation and the effective control of outbreaks of recent epidemics. 
</p>
<p>Malaysia has achieved impressive results in reducing poverty, especially in urban areas, 
</p>
<p>where the percentage of households living in poverty has fallen from 21.3 per cent to an 
</p>
<p>estimated 0.5 per cent between 1970 and 2014.
3
 However, about 3.4 per cent of rural 
</p>
<p>households still live in poverty.
4
 In this respect, the Special Rapporteur noted with concern 
</p>
<p>stark disparities in the enjoyment of basic health indicators between certain groups of the 
</p>
<p>population, with indigenous and migrants particularly affected.  
</p>
<p>9. The health sector in Malaysia has developed over the past few decades with a strong 
</p>
<p>focus on primary care and has achieved universal coverage for most of its population, as 
</p>
<p>well as fairly good standards of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality. 
</p>
<p>Malaysia has also made serious attempts to recognize the challenges of the ongoing 
</p>
<p>demographical and epidemiological transition from a country with a focus on 
</p>
<p>communicable diseases to a country where non-communicable diseases are becoming a 
</p>
<p>concern. These include the National Strategic Plan for Non-Communicable Diseases 
</p>
<p>(2010&#8211;2014) and the Non-Communicable Disease Prevention in Community programme.  
</p>
<p>10. However, many of the challenges that the Special Rapporteur identified during his 
</p>
<p>visit are related to a selective approach to human rights. This approach, mostly based on 
</p>
<p>restrictive interpretations of cultural and religious norms and practices, is a departure from 
</p>
<p>universal human rights principles and standards and has reinforced the exclusion and 
</p>
<p>discrimination, in law or practice, of certain groups from the full enjoyment of the right to 
</p>
<p>health. 
</p>
<p>11. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur also ascertained the challenges and risks that 
</p>
<p>civil society faces when working on right to health issues, particularly when it comes to 
</p>
<p>exercising the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly. Civil society organizations in Malaysia operate in a very restrictive environment 
</p>
<p>and some work in fear of the application of the Sedition Act 1948. Such an environment 
</p>
<p>precludes the existence of one of the crucial preconditions for the effective realization of 
</p>
<p>the right to health: the participation and empowerment of those affected.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International and national legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. While recognizing the above-mentioned achievements in economic development 
</p>
<p>and improving basic health-related indicators, the Special Rapporteur notes that Malaysia 
</p>
<p>has only ratified three of the international human rights treaties: the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1995); the Convention of the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child (1995) and the first two Optional Protocols thereto (2012); and the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2010). Malaysia has not extended a 
</p>
<p>standing invitation to the special procedures of the Council although it has invited a number 
</p>
<p>of independent experts to visit the country since 2007.

</b></p>
<p>13. The accession of Malaysia to these conventions is subject to the understanding that 
</p>
<p>they do not conflict with the provisions of sharia law and the Federal Constitution. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, provisions contained in these core international human rights treaties are not 
</p>
<p>directly enforceable in domestic courts. In addition, Malaysia has introduced reservations to 
</p>
<p>key provisions of the treaties that it has ratified, including article 16 of the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which are considered to be 
</p>
<p>part of the core obligations of States parties to the conventions.  
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the limited number of international 
</p>
<p>human rights treaties that Malaysia has ratified and the reservations that it has introduced to 
</p>
<p>the conventions mentioned, some of them of a general nature, which seriously undermine 
</p>
<p>the nature and scope of the obligations under those treaties. Moreover, he is concerned that 
</p>
<p>the slow pace of reporting to the monitoring bodies has weakened the accountability of the 
</p>
<p>State and could undermine the efforts undertaken so far.  
</p>
<p>15. Malaysia has not ratified the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and 
</p>
<p>its 1967 Protocol. At the regional level, Malaysia ratified the ASEAN Charter in 2008, 
</p>
<p>which establishes that one of the purposes of ASEAN is to promote and protect human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms, with due regard to the rights and responsibilities of its 
</p>
<p>member States. 
</p>
<p>16. The Federal Constitution of Malaysia contains a number of provisions for the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the right to health, directly or indirectly, most of which are contained in 
</p>
<p>articles 5&#8211;13. If these rights are infringed, the victim(s) can seize the High Court Division. 
</p>
<p>Legislation in Malaysia related to the realization of the right to health includes the Penal 
</p>
<p>Code and the Criminal Procedure Code. Also worth highlighting are the Dangerous Drugs 
</p>
<p>Act 1952; the Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954; the Immigration Act 1959/63; the Medical Act 
</p>
<p>1971; the Drug Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act 1983; the Care Centres Act 
</p>
<p>1993; the Private Healthcare Facilities and Services Act 1998; the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission of Malaysia Act 1999; the Child Act 2001; and the Mental Health Act 2001. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Health system and financing 
</b></p>
<p>17. In Malaysia, the population has enjoyed relatively high standards of health care at 
</p>
<p>affordable levels owing to the post-colonial, welfare-oriented public administrations&#8217; strong 
</p>
<p>commitment to public health care. Since the 1980s, basic public health infrastructure, 
</p>
<p>functioning hospitals, primary care and full-fledged rural health services have all been put 
</p>
<p>in place with particular emphasis on universal health coverage as a hallmark to improve the 
</p>
<p>well-being of the population.  
</p>
<p>18. However, over the past few decades, Malaysia has witnessed the growth of private 
</p>
<p>health-care facilities and a reduction in the role of the State as health-care provider. Private 
</p>
<p>provision and financing of health care has emerged, in certain sectors, encouraged by public 
</p>
<p>policy. One of the results has been that national health expenses have significantly 
</p>
<p>increased and affordability has become a key challenge in ensuring universal access to 
</p>
<p>quality health care<i>. </i>In 2012, public expenditure accounted for 52 per cent of the total health 
</p>
<p>expenditure, private financing for 39 per cent.  
</p>
<p>19. The Government has set ambitious goals for the health system in its &#8220;Vision for 
</p>
<p>Health&#8221;, in which it stated that &#8220;Malaysia is to be a nation of healthy individuals, families 
</p>
<p>and communities through a health system that is equitable, affordable, efficient, 
</p>
<p>technologically appropriate, environmentally adaptable and consumer-friendly&#8221;.5 The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 Ministry of Health Malaysia, &#8220;Strategic Plan (2006&#8211;2010)&#8221;, April 2008, p. 4.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>health-care system consists of tax-funded and Government-run universal services and a 
</p>
<p>fast-growing private sector. Public sector health services are organized and are centrally 
</p>
<p>administered by the Ministry of Health, which exerts little regulatory power over the 
</p>
<p>private sector.6 
</p>
<p>20. Malaysia is thus facing the complex challenge of sustaining a relatively good health-
</p>
<p>care system, so that it can continue to provide accessible and affordable primary health-
</p>
<p>care, as well as specialized outpatient and inpatient medical services. Elements of that 
</p>
<p>challenge include the increased expectations of health-care consumers; the growth of the 
</p>
<p>private sector and out-of pocket payments in health-care system; the presence of a large 
</p>
<p>population of non-nationals in the working force; and the drain of medical doctors and 
</p>
<p>nurses from public to private sector.  
</p>
<p>21. The strengths of the health-care system, including the priority given to well-
</p>
<p>developed and accessible primary care, should continue to be assured and hospitals and 
</p>
<p>specialized outpatient health care developed in a rational and cost-effective way. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur saw examples of this during his visit, such as the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>widespread network of community clinics, One Malaysia Clinics, and mobile clinics.  
</p>
<p>22. Public expenditure on health care could and should be strengthened. Overall, the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s expenditure on health has considerably increased over the past few decades, 
</p>
<p>going from 1.3 per cent of the total public expenditure in 2006 to over 8.7 per cent in 2014. 
</p>
<p>However, health-care financing as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) was 4 per cent 
</p>
<p>in 2010 and 4.5 in 2013,7 which is low according to international standards and should be 
</p>
<p>increased. As an illustration, this share is lower than the 2010 averages in the Americas (8.1 
</p>
<p>per cent), Europe (7.4 per cent) and the former Soviet republics (5.7 per cent).8  
</p>
<p>23. According to data available,9 of the 2013 total expenditure on health, out-of-pocket 
</p>
<p>expenditure represented about 39 per cent. In many countries, the primary financial barrier 
</p>
<p>to accessing health care is out-of-pocket payments, which are made by the user for health 
</p>
<p>goods and services at the point of service delivery. While in an upper-middle income 
</p>
<p>country, out-of-pocket expenditure could be seen as reflecting the choice and preferences of 
</p>
<p>certain sectors of the population, data available show that, despite universal coverage, 4 per 
</p>
<p>cent of households in Malaysia incur catastrophic expenditures and the two lowest deciles 
</p>
<p>(poorest groups) spend more out of pocket than the eight other deciles in terms of 
</p>
<p>proportion of income.10 The phenomenon of out-of-pocket payments can have devastating 
</p>
<p>consequences and push into poverty and socially excluded the most vulnerable groups and 
</p>
<p>those who have most serious health needs. 
</p>
<p>24. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, a health-financing scheme should be 
</p>
<p>introduced so that individuals&#8217; ability or inability to pay does not affect their decision 
</p>
<p>whether to access the necessary health goods and services. Financial barriers that restrict 
</p>
<p>access to health care, especially for groups in vulnerable situations, should be removed. 
</p>
<p>There should be more integration and cooperation between public and private sectors. All

</p>
<p><b> IV. Groups in vulnerable situations 
</b></p>
<p>25. In addition to the challenges mentioned face the health-care system in Malaysia, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur identified during his visit important barriers to accessing health care, 
</p>
<p>including with respect to accessibility and affordability affecting some groups of the 
</p>
<p>population.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The right to health of women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>26. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur learned about key initiatives undertaken, 
</p>
<p>mostly since the 1990s, to improve the situation of women in the country. These include 
</p>
<p>programmes to increase their participation in the workforce and in key decision-making 
</p>
<p>positions, such as the National Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women, and 
</p>
<p>programmes to facilitate access to health care, such as the Mammography Subsidy 
</p>
<p>Programme.  
</p>
<p>27. Overall, girls and women in Malaysia have access to basic (primary and secondary) 
</p>
<p>health-care services and benefit from improved health indicators, including child and 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality, immunization and life expectancy. Maternal mortality rates have been 
</p>
<p>reduced thanks to increased access to professional care during pregnancy, childbirth and 
</p>
<p>postnatal care, and access to family planning services.  
</p>
<p>28. Malaysia ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women in 1995 but it has neither incorporated the Convention into national law nor 
</p>
<p>effectively introduced gender equality in its legal framework. This, together with the lack of 
</p>
<p>reporting to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and other 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies, makes it very difficult to properly assess the situation and hold the authorities 
</p>
<p>accountable with respect to compliance with international human rights standards related to 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination against women and gender equality.  
</p>
<p>29. Although Malaysia has consistently reaffirmed the agenda established by the 
</p>
<p>International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994 and its 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action (E/CN.9/2014/4), many of the goals on that agenda and set in the 
</p>
<p>follow-up to the Programme of Action have not been adequately addressed. While there has 
</p>
<p>been substantial progress in maternal health indicators, more needs to be done to achieve 
</p>
<p>key goals connected to the enjoyment of the right to health of women and girls, in particular 
</p>
<p>concerning sexual and reproductive health and rights, gender-based violence and harmful 
</p>
<p>traditional practices.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Sexual and reproductive health and rights  
</b></p>
<p>30. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur noted that women and girls face significant 
</p>
<p>barriers to the full enjoyment of their right to health, in particular when it comes to sexual 
</p>
<p>and reproductive health rights.  
</p>
<p>31. About one third of the population in Malaysia are adolescents and young people, 
</p>
<p>aged from 10 to 24. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the formulation of the National

<p><b>A/HRC/29/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>Adolescent Health Policy and the National Adolescent Health Plan of Action (2006&#8211;2020) 
</p>
<p>to ensure coordinated delivery of health-care services to this group of the population.  
</p>
<p>32. However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that, on the basis of certain restrictive 
</p>
<p>interpretations of religious and cultural values and beliefs which dominate the political 
</p>
<p>discourse and praxis, women and girls do not always have adequate access to 
</p>
<p>comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services or comprehensive sexuality 
</p>
<p>education.  
</p>
<p>33. The reproductive health services most needed, in particular among girls and young 
</p>
<p>women, include access to safe, reliable and good-quality contraception; comprehensive 
</p>
<p>maternal health services; safe abortion and treatment for complications of unsafe abortion; 
</p>
<p>and prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infection and HIV/AIDS (see 
</p>
<p>E/CN.9/2014/4, paras. 68&#8211;77). These services should be provided irrespective of age and 
</p>
<p>marital status. Evidence shows that access to comprehensive sexuality education has a 
</p>
<p>positive impact on the knowledge and health-related behaviours of adolescents and youth, 
</p>
<p>especially girls and women, as well as on their attitudes about gender equality (see 
</p>
<p>E/CN.9/2014/4, para. 68). 
</p>
<p>34. Comprehensive sexuality education is not properly integrated into school curricula 
</p>
<p>in Malaysia. Related educational programmes are often not based on evidence and have a 
</p>
<p>stronger emphasis on abstinence than on providing information and education to girls to 
</p>
<p>allow them to make free and informed decisions about their sexuality. This has contributed 
</p>
<p>to the high prevalence of unintended pregnancies amongst girls, high numbers of underage 
</p>
<p>marriages, unsafe abortions and a high risk of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, 
</p>
<p>including HIV/AIDS.12  
</p>
<p>35. Therapeutic abortion is available in Malaysia (under article 312 of the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Code) and the termination of pregnancy is allowed under specific circumstances, including 
</p>
<p>for saving the life of the mother, and for physical and mental health reasons. In 2012, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Health issued Guidelines on the Termination of Pregnancy, in which it is 
</p>
<p>clearly stated that the termination of pregnancy is legal and a service provided in public 
</p>
<p>hospitals. Despite efforts by the authorities, awareness about the legal status of abortion is 
</p>
<p>not yet widespread, neither among women nor among health professionals. An enabling 
</p>
<p>environment is needed to ensure that every woman legally eligible has access to safe 
</p>
<p>abortion care in Malaysia, including by providing the necessary information and training to 
</p>
<p>relevant health professionals and groups of women at risk and by addressing the stigma 
</p>
<p>associated with seeking abortion services or treatment for abortion complications.13 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>36. Gender-based violence in Malaysia is considered widespread although 
</p>
<p>underreported, and the scope and enforcement of existing legal provisions remains 
</p>
<p>unsatisfactory. Gender-based violence is an issue of concern for public health and is 
</p>
<p>associated with adverse consequences on the physical and mental health of women affected.  
</p>
<p>37. Domestic violence was reported to the Special Rapporteur as an issue of concern in 
</p>
<p>Malaysia. Although there is little data available about its incidence, anecdotal evidence 
</p>
<p>points to widespread prevalence of intimate partner violence, and non-partner sexual 
</p>
<p>violence. He commended the Government for the adoption of the Domestic Violence Act 
</p>
<p>(1994) and had discussions with the Ministry of Women, Family and Community 
</p>

</i></p>

<p>Development about preventing and monitoring domestic violence in the country. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur emphasized the need to adopt the inter-agency working together 
</p>
<p>document on handling domestic violence cases, in development since 2010.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur also commended the establishment of One Stop Crisis 
</p>
<p>Centres to provide integrated services for victims in public hospitals. The centres follow a 
</p>
<p>model of multisectoral response to violence against women, involving Government and 
</p>
<p>non-government actors in the establishment of medical, counselling and police services for 
</p>
<p>victims of violence. He visited some of these centres, which are available in most public 
</p>
<p>hospitals. However, he received testimonies indicating that the centres are at times not 
</p>
<p>sufficiently funded or supported with the appropriate human resources.  
</p>
<p>39. Sexual harassment is not covered in the law in Malaysia. The Code of Practice on 
</p>
<p>the Prevention and Eradication of Sexual Harassment in the Workplace (1999) is not 
</p>
<p>binding and the existing legal framework does not live up to the standards set therein. 
</p>
<p>While the last amendments to the Employment Act (2012) added a new section to address 
</p>
<p>sexual harassment in the workplace, the new provisions omit psychological harassment, 
</p>
<p>only cover strict employer-employee relationships in the private sector, do not protect inter 
</p>
<p>alia students or domestic workers and do not apply to East Malaysia.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Harmful traditional practices 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern during his visit about the situation of 
</p>
<p>women and girls who face compounded forms of discrimination owing to their social, 
</p>
<p>cultural and religious backgrounds. This includes the prevalence of child marriage among 
</p>
<p>Muslim and non-Muslim girls, and the practice of female genital mutilation or circumcision 
</p>
<p>among Muslim girls.  
</p>
<p>41. Child marriage is prevalent among certain groups of the population, including both 
</p>
<p>Muslim and non-Muslim children. Malaysian laws set the legal age of marriage at 18 both 
</p>
<p>for females and males but sharia law lowers this to 16 for Muslim females. There are 
</p>
<p>exceptions to these age limits: non-Muslim girls can marry between 16 and 18 years with a 
</p>
<p>licence from the Chief Minister, while Muslim girls below 16 and boys below 18 can marry 
</p>
<p>with the written permission of the sharia court judge.  
</p>
<p>42. Child marriage is considered a form of forced marriage and has adverse public 
</p>
<p>health-related consequences, which should be of concern for the authorities. Early marriage 
</p>
<p>is often associated with early and frequent pregnancies which result in higher infant and 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality and morbidity rates. In addition, child marriage causes girls to drop out 
</p>
<p>of school and increases the risk of domestic violence, given the subsequent impact on girls&#8217; 
</p>
<p>personal and economic autonomy.14  
</p>
<p>43. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the incidence of early marriage 
</p>
<p>among girls 15&#8211;19 years old has decreased between 1970 and 2010,15 he remains concerned 
</p>
<p>about its prevalence. Moreover, he is very worried about information received indicating 
</p>
<p>that, in an attempt to reduce the incidence of premarital sex, children born out of wedlock 
</p>
<p>and child abandonment, certain authorities are encouraging underage marriage. This goes 
</p>
<p>against international human rights standards, established by the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child, and can represent a regression with respect to the Cairo Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 14 See joint general recommendation No. 31 of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
</p>

</p>
<p>44. Female genital mutilation/cutting, which according to various definitions includes 
</p>
<p>female circumcision under type IV,16 is practised in Malaysia. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>expressed concern about the prevalence of this practice and learned that the health 
</p>
<p>authorities have produced guidelines to regulate it. He is concerned that this could be 
</p>
<p>contrary to the global strategy against the medicalization of this harmful practice, as 
</p>
<p>established by the World Health Organization (WHO).17  
</p>
<p>45. The removal, partially or wholly, of the external female genitalia, or otherwise the 
</p>
<p>injury of female genital organs, for non-medical or non-health reasons, can lead to multiple 
</p>
<p>immediate and long-term health consequences. The Special Rapporteur would like to 
</p>
<p>highlight that this is a form of violence against women and girls, even if not intended as an 
</p>
<p>act of violence, and a violation against their basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p>including their right to health. Addressing harmful traditional practices is part of the core 
</p>
<p>obligations of States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. These 
</p>
<p>practices constitute a denial of the dignity and integrity of those affected; are based on 
</p>
<p>unacceptable discrimination and violence on the basis of sex, gender, age and other 
</p>
<p>grounds; and often cause severe physical and/ or psychological harm or suffering.18  
</p>
<p><b> B. Indigenous communities  
</b></p>
<p>46. The indigenous peoples in Malaysia represent around 12 per cent of the total 
</p>
<p>population and include the Orang Asli, or aborigines of Peninsular Malaysia, and the 
</p>
<p>natives of Sabah and Sarawak, also referred to as Orang Asal. The Orang Asli represent 
</p>
<p>about 0.63 per cent of the total population.19 It is estimated that the natives of Sabah and 
</p>
<p>Sarawak represent about 70 and 60 per cent of the population in the two States, 
</p>
<p>respectively.20 About 60 per cent of the indigenous population live in rural areas, sometimes 
</p>
<p>in remote locations of difficult access.  
</p>
<p>47. The indigenous communities in Malaysia all have a struggle to preserve their own 
</p>
<p>ways of life based on customary systems (adat), constantly under pressure owing to 
</p>
<p>profound changes brought by the rapid economic development in the country. Indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples are among the most marginalized and disadvantaged groups in Malaysia suffering 
</p>
<p>from higher levels of poverty and social exclusion.  
</p>
<p>48. Malaysia has endorsed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples but it has not ratified International Labour Organization Indigenous and Tribal 
</p>
<p>Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169). The Aboriginal Peoples Act set forth the rights of the 
</p>
<p>Orang Asli to education, health, socioeconomic development and culture and beliefs. In 
</p>
<p>2010, the Department of Orang Asli Development was established under the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Rural and Regional Development to provide protection to this group and their way of life in 
</p>
<p>the wake of rapid development. The Orang Asli Development Strategic Plan (2011&#8211;2015)

</b></p>
<p>includes such objectives as expanding access to infrastructure, improving health and 
</p>
<p>cultivating traditional knowledge and heritage.  
</p>
<p>49. Despite commendable efforts by the part of the Government to address health-
</p>
<p>related issues affecting the indigenous communities, the Special Rapporteur observed that 
</p>
<p>serious challenges remain with regard to their enjoyment of the right to health and related 
</p>
<p>rights, both in peninsular Malaysia and in Sabah and Sarawak. Health indicators among 
</p>
<p>indigenous populations are significantly worse than those of the general population. Their 
</p>
<p>life expectancy is below 60 years, while the average in Malaysia is over 70 years, and they 
</p>
<p>carry a larger burden of disease, both for communicable and non-communicable diseases, 
</p>
<p>including tuberculosis, malaria and leprosy. Infant and maternal mortality rates are higher 
</p>
<p>than the national averages. Birth registration is a serious problem among indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities living in remote areas with a negative impact on access to health care. 
</p>
<p>50. Access to health-care services for indigenous populations has significantly improved 
</p>
<p>through the development of the infrastructure for health-care services, mostly primary care 
</p>
<p>in remote areas and specialized care, including a hospital for Orang Asli, the Gombak 
</p>
<p>Orang Asli Hospital. Some initiatives, such as &#8220;flying doctors&#8221; services or the community-
</p>
<p>based Village Health Promoter Programme, have improved the accessibility of and 
</p>
<p>participation in health-care services by indigenous communities in remote areas.  
</p>
<p>51. However, health information is not always accessible in a culturally appropriate 
</p>
<p>manner to the indigenous communities, and they are not always properly informed about or 
</p>
<p>involved in public health decisions that affect them. Language continues to be a barrier to 
</p>
<p>accessing health-care services for indigenous communities in the country.  
</p>
<p>52. Moreover, the right to health of indigenous people is threatened by changes in the 
</p>
<p>use of land caused by development projects linked to logging operations, palm oil 
</p>
<p>plantations and energy-intensive industries in certain parts of the country, in particular in 
</p>
<p>Sabah and Sarawak. This has led to a substantial loss of access to traditional land and 
</p>
<p>sources of livelihood, resettlement processes and instances of violence, which have had a 
</p>
<p>direct impact on the physical and mental health of these communities. 
</p>
<p>53. During his visit to Sabah, the Special Rapporteur heard testimonies that, as a 
</p>
<p>consequence of ongoing development projects, some of the communities have lost access to 
</p>
<p>traditional lands and sources of livelihood, which has had a negative impact on their diet 
</p>
<p>and physical health. Testimonies also pointed to a lack of meaningful dialogue between 
</p>
<p>authorities and indigenous communities, and these communities do not have access to basic 
</p>
<p>information about the projects in their region and the potential environmental impact.21 This 
</p>
<p>can have a serious effect on the mental health and emotional well-being of indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities owing to uncertainties about the security of their livelihood in the future, 
</p>
<p>which leads to chronic stress and anxiety.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur would like to underline that the right to health should be 
</p>
<p>promoted and protected not only through access to health-care services, which should be 
</p>
<p>available, affordable, appropriate and of good quality. The right to health also implies the 
</p>
<p>design and implementation of cross-sectoral programmes that address socioeconomic, 
</p>
<p>cultural and environmental factors and are guided by a human rights approach, with strong 
</p>
<p>emphasis on the principles of non-discrimination, participation and empowerment and 
</p>
<p>accountability.

</p>
<p><b> C. Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Documented and undocumented migrants 
</b></p>
<p>55. Malaysia is a multi-ethnic, multicultural, and multi-religious society that, owing to 
</p>
<p>its geographical location and economic dynamism, has become a main destination of 
</p>
<p>workers&#8217; migratory movements in the region, mostly into low-skilled labour, including 
</p>
<p>domestic work. It is estimated that there are currently over 6 million migrant workers in 
</p>
<p>Malaysia, predominantly from Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Nepal, the 
</p>
<p>Philippines and Sri Lanka, of whom about 2.9 million are undocumented.  
</p>
<p>56. Malaysia is a party to five of the eight International Labour Organization core 
</p>
<p>conventions that relate to fundamental principles and right at work. But it has neither 
</p>
<p>ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 
</p>
<p>1948 (No. 87) nor the Discrimination (employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 
</p>
<p>(No. 111), and it denounced the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105) in 
</p>
<p>1990.  
</p>
<p>57. The Immigration Act, amended in 2002, and modified by the Immigration 
</p>
<p>Regulations 1963, form the cornerstone of the Malaysian immigration system. In addition, 
</p>
<p>the Passports Act 1966 specifies requirements relating to necessary documentation on 
</p>
<p>entering or leaving Malaysia. Before a work permit can be granted, prospective workers 
</p>
<p>must pass a health check. The Foreign Workers Medical Examination Monitoring Agency 
</p>
<p>manages the health screening system of foreign workers in peninsular Malaysia. Fifteen 
</p>
<p>medical conditions automatically disqualify prospective workers, including an HIV-
</p>
<p>seropositive status and pregnancy. Workers who are renewing work permits must pass the 
</p>
<p>same health tests.  
</p>
<p>58. The notification of infectious diseases is required by the Prevention and Control of 
</p>
<p>Infectious Diseases Act, and the Immigration Act is used to deport migrant workers with 
</p>
<p>HIV and/or require them to submit to a medical examination if necessary. This policy and 
</p>
<p>practice poses a serious problem with respect to the right not to be discriminated on the 
</p>
<p>basis of health status, the right to privacy and informed consent. In addition, it goes against 
</p>
<p>international guidelines set out by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 
</p>
<p>(UNAIDS) and WHO regarding HIV testing.22 Although States may place restrictions on 
</p>
<p>the entry of non-citizens on public health grounds, HIV status is not a reasonable basis for 
</p>
<p>such restrictions.  
</p>
<p>59. Pregnancy, which is not an illness, also bars migrants from entering Malaysia and, 
</p>
<p>moreover, under current immigration policies a migrant worker who becomes pregnant is 
</p>
<p>subject to immediate dismissal and her work permit is revoked.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to remove these requirements from 
</p>
<p>the list, both the requirement to be tested for HIV status and for pregnancy. Moreover, both 
</p>
<p>for reasons of public health and to ensure the right to privacy and information, it is essential 
</p>
<p>to ensure that the results of medical examinations are communicated to migrants along with 
</p>
<p>the appropriate health information and counselling.23  
</p>
<p>61. Documented migrants, as non-nationals, face specific barriers when accessing the 
</p>
<p>health-care system, which presumes that migrants place a burden on an overstretched public 
</p>
<p>health system. Migrants and foreign nationals have a limit of five days to access medication 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 22 See UNAIDS/WHO Policy Statement on HIV Testing, June 2004. 
</p>
<p> 23 See ibid., p. 2. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>with a prescription for chronic illnesses, which can have devastating effects on the adequate 
</p>
<p>treatment of some illnesses.  
</p>
<p>62. Moreover, Malaysia has a policy of double fees, which requires migrant workers, 
</p>
<p>like all foreigners, to pay higher fees. This means, in practice, that migrants admitted to 
</p>
<p>public hospitals pay first-class fees, but are entitled only to third-class treatment. The 
</p>
<p>outpatient fee for migrants in public hospitals, which used to be 2 ringitt (as opposed to 1 
</p>
<p>ringitt paid by Malaysians) was increased to 15 ringitt in 2004. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>learned about an initiative in 2014 to increase the fees that migrants and non-nationals pay 
</p>
<p>to access public health care. This can have a catastrophic impact on the enjoyment of the 
</p>
<p>right to health of migrants, both documented and undocumented, given their economic 
</p>
<p>vulnerability and low wages.  
</p>
<p>63. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur also learned about the establishment of 
</p>
<p>immigration counters inside public hospitals to facilitate referrals of undocumented 
</p>
<p>migrants, which often includes asylum seekers, to the police when they come seeking 
</p>
<p>medical attention. He expressed concern that this practice is not only discriminatory but 
</p>
<p>also goes against public health interests and the code of ethics of doctors. While 
</p>
<p>acknowledging that health-care services are de facto available to migrants, including 
</p>
<p>undocumented ones, the Special Rapporteur warned about the potential adverse impact that 
</p>
<p>the establishment of immigration counters, as undocumented migrants will likely be 
</p>
<p>deterred from seeking health care for fear of being reported. This could have a devastating 
</p>
<p>impact on their health status and could cause the spread of communicable diseases, 
</p>
<p>including HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>64. In that connection, the Special Rapporteur was alarmed by testimonies during his 
</p>
<p>visit about a wave of arrests of undocumented women migrants and asylum seekers who, a 
</p>
<p>few days after giving birth, had been taken from hospitals directly to detention centres. In 
</p>
<p>those centres, some of these women and their babies had reportedly neither received the 
</p>
<p>necessary medical attention nor the appropriate care needed during the postnatal period.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur called upon the authorities to ensure that law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officers refrain from using medical procedures and medical care facilities for security and 
</p>
<p>immigration purposes. These policies and practices are intrinsically discriminatory on the 
</p>
<p>basis of legal status and country of origin, can create and reinforce health inequalities and 
</p>
<p>can have serious public health consequences (see A/HRC/23/41). It is therefore vital that 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Health guarantees access and affordability to adequate health care to all 
</p>
<p>groups in Malaysia, including documented and undocumented migrants. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Asylum seekers and refugees 
</b></p>
<p>66. Asylum seekers and refugees are by definition groups in a vulnerable situation, 
</p>
<p>given the persecution and violence they have faced in their countries of origin and the risks 
</p>
<p>they face if deported back. At end November 2014, there were approximately 150,460 
</p>
<p>refugees and asylum seekers registered with the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Malaysia, the majority of them from Myanmar, 
</p>
<p>but also from countries such as Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Sri Lanka and the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic. Of these, approximately 30 per cent are women and it is estimated that about 
</p>
<p>32,710 were children under 18 years of age.24  
</p>
<p>67. The vulnerability of this group is exacerbated by the fact that Malaysian law does 
</p>
<p>not provide for the protection of this group, since the country is not a signatory to the 1951 
</p>
<p>Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol. As a result, asylum

<p><b>A/HRC/29/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>seekers and refugees are subject to the Immigration Act as undocumented migrants, and 
</p>
<p>hence are liable to being imprisoned, whipped or removed.  
</p>
<p>68. There have been some improvements for refugees and asylum seekers in the country 
</p>
<p>recently, and those who have obtained recognition as &#8220;persons of concern&#8221; from the 
</p>
<p>UNHCR may be able to enjoy a basic de facto status at the national level. However, these 
</p>
<p>advances have not been codified into laws or written policies that could provide and ensure 
</p>
<p>an appropriate framework of protection. 
</p>
<p>69. The health needs of refugees and asylum seekers are complex and require special 
</p>
<p>consideration, given their displacement and relocation. In 2005, the Ministry of Health 
</p>
<p>agreed to provide UNHCR-recognized refugees with a 50 per cent discount on fees charged 
</p>
<p>to non-nationals for health-care services in public hospitals, which includes reproductive 
</p>
<p>health, family planning and immunization. Refugees are recognized as one of the target 
</p>
<p>groups under the National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS 2011&#8211;2015, which gives them 
</p>
<p>access to treatment and medication and could be considered as a good step. 
</p>
<p>70. However, while health-care services are available for this group, they are not 
</p>
<p>affordable or accessible, especially for asylum seekers. The cost is prohibitive for asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers, who are required to pay full foreign rates and cannot work to support themselves. 
</p>
<p>The sustained fears of arrest, detention and deportation, exacerbated by the measures 
</p>
<p>described above, deter asylum seekers from seeking medical treatment. Language barriers 
</p>
<p>also act a major obstacle to access vital health-related services and information.  
</p>
<p>71. Despite the fact that Malaysia has not ratified international standards that protect and 
</p>
<p>promote the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, the principle of non-refoulement is part 
</p>
<p>of customary international law. In addition, Malaysia is bound by the obligations contained 
</p>
<p>in the international human rights treaties that it has ratified which cover the rights of these 
</p>
<p>groups.25  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Detention conditions in immigration centres 
</b></p>
<p>72. Illegal entry and re-entry in Malaysia is punishable with a fine of up to 10,000 
</p>
<p>ringgit (about US$ 2,780), imprisonment of not more than five years and whipping of not 
</p>
<p>more than six strokes.26 Existing migration policy, together with the fact that the country 
</p>
<p>does not recognize the special need for protection of refugees and asylum seekers, leads to 
</p>
<p>high numbers of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in detention, who are exposed to 
</p>
<p>corporal punishment against the universal prohibition of torture and ill-treatment and the 
</p>
<p>obligations of Malaysia under international law.  
</p>
<p>73. One of the main concerns relating to migrant workers, refugees, and asylum seekers 
</p>
<p>in detention is their mental and physical health needs. Long periods of detention and poor 
</p>
<p>living conditions facilitate the transmission of communicable diseases and can have 
</p>
<p>devastating effects on the mental health of migrants (see A/HRC/23/41, para. 36). This is 
</p>
<p>exacerbated in the case of asylum seekers and refugees, who often suffer from previous 
</p>
<p>trauma from violence, persecution and displacement.  
</p>
<p>74. Legislation referring to the administration of immigration detention centres includes 
</p>
<p>the Prisons Act of 1995, the Prisons Regulations of 2000 and the Immigration 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 25 Article 22 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and general comment No. 6 (2005) on 
</p>
<p>treatment of unaccompanied and separated children outside their country of origin; and general 
</p>
<p>recommendation No. 32 (2014) on the gender-related dimensions of refugee status, asylum, 
</p>
<p>nationality and statelessness of women of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women.

<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>(Administration and Management of Immigration Depots) Regulation of 2003. Suhakam is 
</p>
<p>the only entity with legal permission to monitor the conditions of detention in these centres, 
</p>
<p>although the International Committee of the Red Cross and UNHCR are allowed to visit on 
</p>
<p>a regular basis. Non-governmental organizations have very limited access to places in 
</p>
<p>which migrants are detained. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the fact that the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Health is now conducting visits on a regular basis to some of the immigration 
</p>
<p>detention centres. 
</p>
<p>75. The detention conditions in immigration centres have been reported as a source of 
</p>
<p>concern about health (see A/HRC/16/47/Add.2).27 During his visit, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>had access to the Lenggeng Immigration Depot (Negeri Sembilan) and the Immigration 
</p>
<p>Detention Depot of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (Sepang, Selangor).  
</p>
<p>76. During his visit to the Lenggeng Depot, the Special Rapporteur found out that 
</p>
<p>women who have just given birth are held in a separate area where they have mattresses for 
</p>
<p>them and their babies and are provided with the necessary hygienic products. However, 
</p>
<p>their diet does not seem sufficient for breastfeeding mothers as it was reported that they 
</p>
<p>only get two meals per day. In addition, access to clean water seems to be only upon 
</p>
<p>request and some of these women are reportedly not allowed to spend enough time outside 
</p>
<p>the common cell, including with their babies.  
</p>
<p>77. In the Lenggeng Depot, the Special Rapporteur heard of two cases of migrants held 
</p>
<p>in isolation cells due to mental health issues. He learnt that, in such cases, sufferers do not 
</p>
<p>receive specialized medical attention and one migrants had been in detention for over a 
</p>
<p>year. Both women seemed in good physical condition, but isolation cells are too small and 
</p>
<p>should not be used for the same person for prolonged periods of time.  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur regrets that during his visit to Lenggeng he could not finish 
</p>
<p>an interview with a group of women because he was interrupted by an immigration officer 
</p>
<p>arguing security concerns. International standards that apply to monitoring places of 
</p>
<p>detention specify that interviews should be conducted out of sight and earshot of the 
</p>
<p>authorities responsible for the management of the facilities.  
</p>
<p>79. During his visit to the Immigration Detention Depot of the Kuala Lumpur 
</p>
<p>International Airport, the Special Rapporteur found out that the conditions in the male 
</p>
<p>wards were not up to international standards. Men held there have to sleep on concrete 
</p>
<p>floors, do not always get blankets when the weather is cold and do not have access to soap 
</p>
<p>to wash their clothes. He also found one minor who had been held with adults for more than 
</p>
<p>nine months, and a mental health patient unidentified and not properly treated. 
</p>
<p>80. In that depot, the Special Rapporteur visited the female ward and met with number 
</p>
<p>of children of Rohingya origin, aged from 4 to 12 years old, who had been held for a period 
</p>
<p>of five to seven months, some of them with special health needs. The detention of children 
</p>
<p>with their parents has a detrimental effect of their physical and mental health and should be 
</p>
<p>avoided; non-custodial alternatives should be explored. A decision to detain migrants who 
</p>
<p>are accompanied by their children should only be taken in very exceptional circumstances 
</p>
<p>and States should always try to preserve the family unit by using alternatives to detaining 
</p>
<p>the entire family (see A/HRC/20/24, para. 40). 
</p>
<p>81. The right to health requires States to ensure the right of access to health facilities, 
</p>
<p>goods and services on a non-discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable groups, as well 
</p>
<p>as to the underlying determinants of health.28 Prisoners and detainees are in a particularly

</p>
<p>standards related to the availability and accessibility of health care in prisons as well as the 
</p>
<p>underlying determinants of health. The Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners and

</p>
<p>imprisonment.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons 
</b></p>
<p>83. Although discrimination on the basis of gender is prohibited in the Federal 
</p>
<p>Constitution (art. 8 (2)), the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) 
</p>
<p>persons are not explicitly recognized. Colonial-era provisions have been retained under the 
</p>
<p>Penal Code and they criminalize sodomy (Penal Code, sects. 377(a) and 377(b)) and 
</p>
<p>perpetuate discrimination against LGBT persons. In addition, discriminatory societal 
</p>
<p>attitudes towards LGBT persons prevail in Malaysia and have been exacerbated over the 
</p>
<p>past few decades by the use of a stigmatizing rhetoric by politicians, public officials and 
</p>
<p>religious leaders.  
</p>
<p>84. Malaysia has become one of the few countries where transgender people are 
</p>
<p>criminalized. Since the 1980s, a series of legislative initiatives, mostly undertaken under 
</p>
<p>sharia enactments, prohibited &#8220;cross dressing&#8221; and forced transgender people, who had 
</p>
<p>historically enjoyed a certain degree of acceptance in society, to go underground. In 1982, a 
</p>
<p>fatwa issued by the National Fatwa Council, prohibited Muslims from undergoing sex 
</p>
<p>reassignment surgery and since then very few hospitals have performed such surgery. The 
</p>
<p>National Registration Department does not allow the gender indicator on identity cards to 
</p>
<p>be changed, and this applies both to Muslims and non-Muslims.  
</p>
<p>85. Some Government institutions have recognized the health needs of transgender 
</p>
<p>persons. The Ministry of Health has included transgender persons and men who have sex 
</p>
<p>with men as a group at risk under the National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS 2011&#8211;2015, 
</p>
<p>which gives them access to treatment and medication and is a positive step. 
</p>
<p>86. The criminalization of same-sex conduct and of different forms of gender identity 
</p>
<p>and expression has reinforced negative societal attitudes and has led to serious human rights 
</p>
<p>violations of the rights of this group of the population, including significant barriers in 
</p>
<p>access to health care. Law enforcement officials arrest transgender women and subject them 
</p>
<p>to various abuses, including humiliation in the media, and physical and verbal abuse. 
</p>
<p>87. Transgender women also face serious discrimination in public health-care facilities. 
</p>
<p>They are often associated with sex work, which is a crime, and they are forcibly tested for 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS. They are identified on the basis of their identity card and, unless they have 
</p>
<p>undergone sex reassignment surgery, are often housed in male wards where they can be 
</p>
<p>exposed to violence and abuse. The fear of stigma and discrimination deters transgender 
</p>
<p>women, and other LGBT people, from seeking health care, with the consequent devastating 
</p>
<p>effects that this can have.  
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the judgement of the Court of Appeal issued on 
</p>
<p>7 November 2014 that found section 66 of the Syariah Criminal Enactment of Negeri </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>Sembilan State criminalizing cross-dressing unconstitutional.29 The judgement of the Court 
</p>
<p>of Appeal stated that section 66 of the Syariah enactment was not in conformity with the 
</p>
<p>Federal Constitution and violated the rights to live with dignity, equality before the law and 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination, and directly affected freedom of movement and expression. The 
</p>
<p>judgement explicitly acknowledges the profound effect that section 66 has on the appellants 
</p>
<p>who live perpetually at risk of arrest and prosecution simply because they express their 
</p>
<p>gender identity. The Court of Appeal underlined that the existence of a law that punishes 
</p>
<p>gender expression is degrading and deprives those affected of their dignity and value in 
</p>
<p>society.  
</p>
<p>89. Laws that criminalize same-sex conduct, as well as legal enactments that criminalize 
</p>
<p>transgender women, infringe on the enjoyment of the right to health and other basic human 
</p>
<p>rights (see A/HRC/14/20, para. 6) which are guaranteed by the Federal Constitution and the 
</p>
<p>international treaties that Malaysia has ratified, including the human rights to dignity, 
</p>
<p>equality before the law and equal protection of the law, freedom from discrimination and 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>90. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was also very concerned about information 
</p>
<p>received on programmes and practices supported by public institutions to change the sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation of adolescents, so-called &#8220;corrective therapies&#8221;. Such therapies are not only 
</p>
<p>unacceptable from the human rights perspective but they are also against scientific 
</p>
<p>evidence, and have a serious negative impact on the mental health and well-being of 
</p>
<p>adolescents. State-led programmes to identify, &#8220;expose&#8221;, and punish LGBT adolescents 
</p>
<p>contribute to a detrimental educational environment where the inherent dignity of the child 
</p>
<p>is not respected and discrimination on basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is 
</p>
<p>encouraged.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Persons living with HIV/AIDS and drug users 
</b></p>
<p>91. The Government is to be commended on measures taken to reduce the spread of 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS. As a result, there has been a significant reduction of more than half in new 
</p>
<p>cases, from 28.4 per 100,000 persons in 2002 to 11.42 cases per 100,000 persons in 2012. 
</p>
<p>The number of persons living with HIV in 2013 was estimated at 86,324.  
</p>
<p>92. Malaysia is a country with a concentrated HIV epidemic, with infection rates that 
</p>
<p>remain high, above 5 per cent, among most-at-risk populations, which include drug users, 
</p>
<p>sex workers, transgender persons and men having sex with men.30 Measures have included 
</p>
<p>making available evidence-based treatment, such as antiretroviral treatment and the 
</p>
<p>implementation of harm reduction programmes, most of which have been in place since 
</p>
<p>2005.  
</p>
<p>93. Over the past decades, the Government&#8217;s response has evolved to include the input 
</p>
<p>of a group of stakeholders, including from non-health units within government agencies, 
</p>
<p>civil society actors, private agencies and bilateral and international agencies. In 1992, the 
</p>
<p>Malaysian AIDS Council was established under the auspices of the Ministry of Health to 
</p>
<p>complement the country&#8217;s responses, with special focus on the most-at-risk populations. 
</p>
<p>This multisectoral and multi-stakeholder response to the pandemic has contributed to 
</p>
<p>achieving positive results.

<p><b>A/HRC/29/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>94. Nevertheless, in recent years, Malaysia has seen a surge in HIV/AIDS infections due 
</p>
<p>to sexual transmission, mainly affecting men having sex with men, but now also women.31 
</p>
<p>The previous success in addressing the epidemic has been somewhat hampered by a lack of 
</p>
<p>full adherence to universal human rights obligations and principles, and the subsequent lack 
</p>
<p>of recognition of the rights of the groups most affected, including LGBT persons.  
</p>
<p>95. The experience of the HIV/AIDS pandemic has shown that the exposure of 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups to HIV/AIDS is reinforced through discrimination, stigmatization and 
</p>
<p>disrespect for human rights. Discriminating and ostracizing vulnerable groups will only add 
</p>
<p>to the continuation and further spread of HIV/AIDS. In order to address the increasing rate 
</p>
<p>of sexual transmission of HIV, the Special Rapporteur encourages the authorities to step up 
</p>
<p>their efforts and offer comprehensive sexuality education, which is a key component of the 
</p>
<p>fight against AIDS.  
</p>
<p>96. Regarding drug policy and the situation of drug users, Malaysia has ratified the three 
</p>
<p>International Drug Control Conventions. The Dangerous Drugs Act describes the 
</p>
<p>punishments for drug-related crimes. Under this act, the possession of 5&#8211;15 grams of heroin 
</p>
<p>can result in a life sentence, while possession of more than 15 grams may result in the death 
</p>
<p>penalty. Drug trafficking is also liable to capital punishment.32  
</p>
<p>97. In Malaysia, drug users are forcibly confined to rehabilitation camps, known as Cure 
</p>
<p>and Care Rehabilitation Centres, and receive treatment without their explicit and informed 
</p>
<p>consent. The Drug Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act established compulsory 
</p>
<p>drug treatment centres, placed under the supervision of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Upon 
</p>
<p>arrest, drug users undergo drug-use testing. If the test is positive, the person using drugs 
</p>
<p>appears before a magistrate, who can send the user to a drug treatment centre for a period of 
</p>
<p>two years. In these centres, HIV testing is compulsory upon arrival and treatment is mostly 
</p>
<p>abstinence-based, although limited methadone maintenance and anti-retroviral treatments 
</p>
<p>have been introduced. Treatment is still closely supervised by staff, which includes military 
</p>
<p>personnel and security officers, with limited knowledge and skills in health.33 According to 
</p>
<p>data available, the relapse rate of drug users held in compulsory detention centres was up to 
</p>
<p>90 per cent.34  
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur would like to underline that the right to health includes the 
</p>
<p>right to be free from non-consensual medical treatment and requires the informed consent 
</p>
<p>of all who possess legal capacity be obtained prior to the administration of medical 
</p>
<p>treatment (A/64/272). Punitive drug policy regulatory frameworks tend to result in more 
</p>
<p>health-related harms than those they seek to prevent (see A/65/255). A human rights focus 
</p>
<p>on drug policy and control should place the emphasis on voluntary, medically assisted and 
</p>
<p>evidence-based approaches.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Children and the right to health 
</b></p>
<p>99. The right to health of children has progressed significantly over the past few 
</p>
<p>decades. Malaysia has achieved good results in the area of right to life and survival, 
</p>
<p>reaching and sustaining low rates of infant and children under-5 mortality, and high 
</p>
<p>coverage of child immunization programmes. Recently, there have been effective efforts to

<p>prevent non-communicable diseases from childhood, for example by promoting healthy 
</p>
<p>lifestyles and preventing under-nutrition, as well as excess weight and obesity. 
</p>
<p>100. Malaysia acceded to the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1995 but still 
</p>
<p>maintains reservations to core articles of the Convention, including articles 2, 7, 14, 28 (1) 
</p>
<p>(a) and 37. As stated above, there remain inconsistencies in the definition of the child in 
</p>
<p>national legislation, both civil and sharia law. The Child Act was enacted in 2001 and the 
</p>
<p>National Child Policy and the National Child Protection Policy, with its Action Plan, were 
</p>
<p>introduced in 2009.  
</p>
<p>101. Many recommendations made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2007 
</p>
<p>have not been properly addressed, and important challenges remain, mainly concerning the 
</p>
<p>girl child and children from disadvantaged groups, including indigenous children, children 
</p>
<p>with disabilities, refugee and asylum-seeking children, undocumented migrant children and 
</p>
<p>LGBT children.  
</p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur underlined the lack of recognition of the right of children to 
</p>
<p>holistic development as the main cross-cutting issue. This, in his view, has led to the lack of 
</p>
<p>sustainable policies and measures to promote the emotional and social well-being of 
</p>
<p>children, to protect them from all forms of violence, including sexual violence, and to 
</p>
<p>enhance the ability of parents and teachers to raise and educate children using non-violent 
</p>
<p>methods.  
</p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur identified prevailing attitudes supporting punitive measures 
</p>
<p>for children and the use of violence as a remedy, both in public and private settings. This is 
</p>
<p>reinforced by national and local authorities, for example through the use of corporal 
</p>
<p>punishment in schools, often against LGBT adolescents, which goes against the universal 
</p>
<p>prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. He sees this as a serious systemic issue with a 
</p>
<p>detrimental impact on society&#8217;s physical and mental health and well-being, ranging from 
</p>
<p>child-rearing practices to public decision-making when addressing social problems. 
</p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteur raised the issue of bullying in schools and its detrimental 
</p>
<p>impact on the right to health of children, including mental health. He was encouraged by 
</p>
<p>the reaction of the authorities, acknowledging the problem and underlining their 
</p>
<p>commitment to address its root causes. However, he regrets the absence of modern whole-
</p>
<p>school approaches that advocate, by educating school communities, zero tolerance of any 
</p>
<p>form of violence. Instead, he had access to information indicating that the approach is, once 
</p>
<p>again, of a punitive nature, offering schools the option of inviting the police to station 
</p>
<p>auxiliary personnel to tackle the issue.35 The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to 
</p>
<p>reconsider this initiative, as it will undermine the role of schools as educational institutions 
</p>
<p>and will contribute to perpetuating punitive approaches that do not foster the emotional and 
</p>
<p>social well-being of children in society. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Persons with developmental and psychosocial disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>105. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur learned about important positive initiatives 
</p>
<p>implemented regarding community-based services for persons with psychosocial 
</p>
<p>disabilities and the integration of psychiatric inpatient units in general public hospitals. He 
</p>
<p>visited a mental health community centre in Putrajaya and was impressed by the approach 
</p>
<p>and the level of the health professionals with whom he met.

</p>
<p>106. However, there is still a long way to go in order to achieve the full realization of 
</p>
<p>rights of children and adults with developmental and psychosocial disabilities in the 
</p>
<p>country. Although Malaysia ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities in 2010, and the Mental Health Act was adopted in 2008, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was concerned that certain public policies and services are not in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the Convention&#8217;s standards. This is connected to the reservations made to the 
</p>
<p>Convention, which limit the application of the core principles of non-discrimination and 
</p>
<p>equality.  
</p>
<p>107. The infrastructure of user-friendly, community-based services for these groups is not 
</p>
<p>yet well developed, which can lead to systemic violations of their rights, such as right to 
</p>
<p>enjoy living in community and other rights. There are certain initiatives of inclusive 
</p>
<p>education of children with disabilities in mainstream schools but they need further support 
</p>
<p>and development. The Special Rapporteur was concerned about the high prevalence of 
</p>
<p>stigmatization and discrimination of persons living with psychosocial disabilities, which 
</p>
<p>makes it difficult to provide the full spectrum of effective and inclusive community-based 
</p>

<p><b> V. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the progress made in Malaysia 
</b></p>
<p><b>since independence, in particular, the significant reduction of poverty and the 
</b></p>
<p>Government&#8217;s commitmen<b>t to improving the health of the population. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government has recognized that the further successful development of the country 
</b></p>
<p><b>depends not just on investing in economic growth but also on the social well-being of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the population. It has taken steps to improve the well-being of the population, some of 
</b></p>
<p><b>which could serve as an inspiration to other countries.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>However, during his visit, the Special Rapporteur observed deeply entrenched 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory attitudes towards groups in vulnerable situations, mostly based on 
</b></p>
<p><b>certain restrictive interpretations of culture or religion that discriminate and restrict 
</b></p>
<p><b>the rights of these groups, including the right to health. These arguments go against 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights principles and standards, and when initiated, supported or 
</b></p>
<p><b>tolerated by public authorities, they threaten the development of a healthy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive society. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>Malaysia needs to move away from a selective approach to human rights. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights of all people living in Malaysia need to be protected, and more efforts are 
</b></p>
<p><b>needed to combat the discrimination of the more disadvantaged groups and to achieve 
</b></p>
<p><b>their full inclusion in society.  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ratify all core universal human rights treaties and the optional protocols 
</b></p>
<p><b>thereto, remove all reservations to the treaties ratified and ensure timely reporting to

<p><b>the monitoring bodies; and extend an standing invitation to the special procedures of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Human Rights Council; 
</b></p>
