<p>                        <b>    </b> 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Following a brief overview of the mandate&#8217;s activities pursuant to Human Rights 
Council resolution 6/14, the Special Rapporteur focuses on child slavery, one of the 
priority areas she identified for her work (see A/HRC/9/20). 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Activities of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. From 13 to 17 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur conducted a mission to 
Romania (see A/HRC/18/30/Add.1) to examine the effectiveness of Romanian policies, 
laws and specific programmes to combat the worst forms of child labour. 
</p>
<p>3. From 9 to 20 May 2011, the Special Rapporteur conducted a mission to Peru 
(see A/HRC/18/30/Add.2) to examine good practices and challenges to combat forced 
labour, debt bondage and the worst forms of child labour.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the invitations of Italy, Lebanon and 
Kazakhstan to carry out country visits. She would appreciate receiving invitations from 
the countries to which she has sent requests for visits: Bangladesh, Ghana, Nepal, Qatar, 
Sudan and Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>5. Since her last report, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with other mandates, sent 
communications on alleged cases of concern to her mandate to Bangladesh, India, Kuwait, 
Mauritania, Nepal and Thailand (see A/HRC/18/51). 
</p>
<p>6. During the year, the Special Rapporteur participated in various conferences 
relevant to the mandate. She also held consultations with Governments and United 
Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other stakeholders. By 
way of example, the Special Rapporteur would like to highlight the following. 
</p>
<p>7. On 1 to 2 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur travelled to the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to meet with NGOs working to eradicate 
domestic servitude. She was also able to brief British parliamentarians and senior 
Government officials about her mandate.   
</p>
<p>8. On 2 and 3 May 2011, the Special Rapporteur attended the international 
roundtable on &#8220;Rights Violations and Access to Justice of Domestic Workers in the 
Context of Diplomatic Immunity&#8221; which was organized by the German Institute for 
Human Rights and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and 
held in Berlin. She presented her recommendations for combating domestic servitude. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Scope of the thematic report  
</b></p>
<p>9. Children working in artisanal mines and quarries are subject to a series of 
violations of human rights and very often find themselves in conditions that amount to 
contemporary forms of slavery.   </p>


<p>10. Children are often treated by their employers as commodities &#8211; replaceable 
cheap labour to be thoroughly exploited. The 1926 Slavery Convention makes illegal any 
practice whereby &#8220;the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers 
attaching to the right of ownership are exercised&#8221;. Some of the children who work in 
artisanal mining and quarrying are also subjected to forced labour or debt bondage which 
are slavery-like practices that are expressly prohibited by international law. 
</p>
<p>11. Children working in this sector face particular, and in some cases a combination 
of, physical, psychological, economic and sexual exploitation not found in other areas 
where children work. This is prohibited by article 1 (d) of the 1956 Supplementary 
Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices 
Similar to Slavery which forbids &#8220;any institution or practice whereby a child or young 
person under the age of 18 years, is delivered by either or both of his natural parents or by 
his guardian to another person, whether for reward or not, with a view to the exploitation 
of the child or young person or of his labour&#8221;. The impact of these forms of abuses is not 
only immediate but has long-term harmful repercussions on the children.  
</p>
<p>12. Children, particularly unaccompanied children, working in artisanal mining and 
quarrying have no other choice but to work in this sector as they and their families are in 
desperate need of an income and have no or no better alternatives.  
</p>
<p>13. Employers also wield physical and psychological power over the children that 
they employ. Consequently, although unaccompanied children may be allowed to leave 
the mine or quarry, they are unlikely to leave their jobs as they have a real or imagined 
fear of the repercussions. The Special Rapporteur notes that the combined elements of 
coercion, fear, restriction on freedom of movement and complete dependence on the 
employer exhibit characteristics which amount to contemporary forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p>14. Large-scale mining companies undergo regular inspection and have unionized 
workers; however, child slavery in the mining and quarrying sector normally occurs in the 
small-scale (artisanal) mining and quarrying sector. The mining sector includes the 
extraction of minerals (such as coltan), precious metals (such as gold and silver), precious 
stones (such as diamonds and rubies) and semi-precious stones (such as tanzanite). 
Quarrying is extraction from an open pit in order to acquire stone or aggregate (sand, 
gravel or crushed rock) for the construction industry.   
</p>
<p>15. The mines and quarries in which children work are often informal and situated in 
remote areas of a country; they remain out of reach of the rule of law in communities 
commonly referred to as &#8220;frontier communities&#8221;, where traditional social structures of 
society and ethical value systems have broken down. These communities are often 
characterized by violence, crime and substance abuse. The people living in these 
communities are usually very poor and economically and socially marginalized. Children 
growing up in this type of community are vulnerable to various types of violations. 
</p>
<p>16. Small-scale mining and quarrying occurs in Africa, Asia, Latin America and 
Europe. As a result of the remoteness of mines and quarries and their informal and illegal 
nature, it is hard to provide exact statistics on the number of children working in this 
sector. Additionally, as in many other instances of contemporary forms of slavery, the 
victims are not visible. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that there 
are at least 1 million children working in mining and quarrying1 whereas, the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that there are 1&#8211;2 million children 
</p>
<p>  
 1 ILO, <i>Minors out of mining! Partnership for global action against child labour in small-scale mining</i> 
</p>
<p>(Geneva, 2006), p. 1. </p>


<p>working in artisanal small-scale mining alone.2 Although estimates of the number of 
children working in this sector may vary, what is clear is that the numbers are likely to 
increase as a result of higher prices and demand for minerals from the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development countries and emerging economies.3 
</p>
<p>17. In the past, the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery considered 
the issue of child economic exploitation.4 The Special Rapporteur has given due 
consideration to the discussions of the Working Group in the elaboration of her present 
report.   
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that not all children who work are 
exploited. Indeed, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that in some situations working 
can enrich the development of the child, family and community.5 Child exploitation 
occurs when the work that a child carries out is hazardous or interferes with the child&#8217;s 
education, or is harmful to the child&#8217;s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social 
development (art. 32, para. 1, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child).  
</p>
<p>19. This report will demonstrate that the work carried out by children in the mining 
and quarrying sector, by its very nature and the conditions in which it is performed, 
qualifies as a contemporary form of slavery due to the debt bondage, forced labour and 
economic exploitation of the child and particularly so with regard to unaccompanied 
children working in artisanal mining and quarries. For instance, employers yield complete 
physical and psychological power and control over the children, they are completely and 
severely dependent on their employer for their basic needs, unable to leave their place of 
work due to fear of reprisals against themselves or their families and work in physically 
and socially isolated and remote areas where they are not able to report abuses or access 
justice. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Relevant international legal framework for combating child 
slavery 
</b></p>
<p>20. Different international instruments, ranging from the core international law 
against slavery to international human rights law and international labour law are relevant 
when defining the concept of child slavery.   
</p>
<p>21. The core international law against slavery comprises the 1926 Slavery 
Convention and the 1956 Supplementary Convention. While the 1926 Convention defines 
the concept of slavery (art. 1) and introduces forced labour as being analogous to slavery 
(art. 5), the 1956 Convention broadens the concept so as to encompass other slavery-like 
practices. The ILO Convention No. 29 (1930) concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour 
offers a definition of forced labour and lays down a number of exceptions from its general 
prohibition.

session, E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/34, para. 10, and report of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms 
of Slavery on its twenty-ninth session, E/CN.4/Sub.2/2004/36, para. 28 (f).

International Law</i>, vol. 58, No. 1, (1989), pp. 35&#8211;53. </p>


<p>22. The concept of slavery and slavery-like practices cannot be analysed without 
referral to the development of international human rights instruments, starting with the 
adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which establishes the 
principle of the prohibition of slavery in all its forms. The International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights went on to legally prohibit slavery in all its forms, including servitude 
and forced labour (art. 8), while the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights recognizes that children should be protected from economic and social 
exploitation. Additionally &#8220;their employment in work harmful to their morals or health or 
dangerous to life or likely to hamper their normal development should be &#8230; punishable 
by law&#8221; (art. 10).  
</p>
<p>23. When it comes to the specific situation of children, it is important to note those 
developments which occurred both in international human rights and labour laws that are 
relevant when addressing the issue of child slavery.   
</p>
<p>24. International law does not clearly define child exploitation, but it has been 
widely accepted that &#8220;what gives cause for concern is work that places too heavy a burden 
on the child; work that endangers his safety, health or welfare, work that takes advantage 
of the defencelessness of the child, work that exploits the child as a cheap substitute for 
adult labour, work that uses the child&#8217;s efforts but does nothing for his development, work 
that interrupts the child&#8217;s education or training and this prejudices his future.&#8221;6 This 
definition was legally encapsulated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which 
contains one of the most explicit and comprehensive set of obligations for States relating 
to the suppression of economic exploitation and worst forms of child labour. Article 32 of 
the Convention recognizes the child&#8217;s right &#8220;to be protected from economic exploitation 
and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the 
child&#8217;s education, or to be harmful to the child&#8217;s health or physical, mental, spiritual, 
moral or social development.&#8221; Article 36 provides an even broader, albeit less specific 
safeguard, requiring States parties to &#8220;protect the child against all other forms of 
exploitation prejudicial to any aspects of the child&#8217;s welfare.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>25. In 1999, the ILO member States, conscious of the magnitude of the problem of 
children being trapped in the worst forms of child labour, adopted Convention No. 182 
(1999) concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst 
Forms of Child Labour. This convention is the reflection of a global consensus that 
immediate and effective measures should be taken to secure the prohibition and 
elimination of the worst forms of child labour as a matter or urgency. ILO 
recommendation No. 190 advises ILO members on the implementation of Convention No. 
182 and allows for exceptions for children from the age of 16 working in hazardous 
environments, provided that the health, safety and morals of the children concerned are 
fully protected and that &#8220;the children have received adequate specific instruction or 
vocational training in the relevant branch of activity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>26. There is undoubtedly a close link between ILO Convention No. 182 the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is important in combating the exploitation 
of children. Article 32 of the latter correlates to article 3 of the ILO Convention No. 182 
with regard to debt bondage, serfdom, forced or compulsory labour, and all forms of 
slavery and any work which will harm the health, safety or moral of children.7

means of implementing human rights?&#8221;, 22&#8211;24 February 2002, Hattingen, Germany. </p>


<p>27. The position followed by the Committee on the Rights of the Child when 
considering periodic reports from State parties is that, &#8220;any work carried out by children 
in conditions below those established by the United Nations Convention [on the Rights of 
the Child] or by ILO standards should be considered as economic exploitation&#8221; (report of 
the Secretary-General on status of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, A/64/172, 
para. 9).  
</p>
<p>28. In 1993, the Committee on the Rights of the Child devoted its second day of 
annual discussion to the economic exploitation of children (see CRC/C/20, para. 186&#8211;
196). On this occasion, the indivisibility and interrelatedness of the rights of the child 
stipulated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child were highlighted, as was the fact 
that they are all inherent to the human dignity of the child. Therefore, a holistic approach 
should be taken when looking at the implementation of the right enshrined in article 32.  
</p>
<p>29. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has on many occasions considered the 
issue of children working in mines and quarries. For example, in 2009, it expressed its 
concern at the presence of child workers as young as 5 years working in dangerous 
conditions in the mining industry, particularly the Katanga region (CRC/C/COD/CO/2, 
para. 80). In the past year, the Committee has considered the issue of children working in 
mines in Ecuador, Guatemala, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Most 
recently, during the Committee&#8217;s consideration of Ukraine (CRC/C/UKR/CO/3-4, paras. 
74 and 75), the Committee raised concern about children working in the informal and 
illegal economy of the coal-mining sector, where children work under difficult and 
hazardous conditions.   
</p>
<p>30. The Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights has also considered 
children working in mines and quarries in countries such as China (E/C.12/1/Add.107, 
para. 23) and Zambia (E/C.12/1/Add.106, para. 25). Most recently, it considered mining 
in Madagascar. The Committee recommended that the State party: reinforce the legal 
framework to combat child labour and adopt all the necessary legal and judicial measures 
to eradicate this phenomenon; support and reinforce the role of the family as an essential 
element for the protection of children and combat against child labour; and take all 
necessary measures to implement effectively all policies against child labour, including 
through awareness-raising campaigns for the public on protection of children, strengthen 
preventive measures, and prosecute and punish those who are responsible (see 
E/C.12/MDG/CO/2).   
</p>
<p><b> V.  Root causes, manifestations and aggravating factors that lead 
to child slavery in the mining and quarrying sector 
</b></p>
<p>31. The root causes, manifestations and aggravating factors of child slavery in the 
mining and quarrying sector sometimes occur individually (like in the case of forced 
labour and debt bondage), or when coupled with, for instance, poverty and the informality 
and illegality of the sector, or when combined together. This section describes each of 
these factors and how they cause and keep a child in contemporary forms of slavery, 
whereby the child is treated merely as a commodity and experiences coercion, fear, 
restriction of movement and complete dependence on the employer. 
</p>
<p> <b>A.</b> <b>Poverty 
</b></p>
<p>32. Poverty is one of the main reasons for children working in mines and quarries 
sector. In such cases, parents are unable to provide for their basic needs and require </p>


<p>children to work in this sector in order to support the family income. Very often children 
work with their parents.  
</p>
<p>33. With the growth in rural poverty and lack of investment in rural livelihoods, 
communities are drawn to work in this sector as they know that they can gain immediate 
benefits from selling gold as opposed to cultivating land.8 
</p>
<p>34. As in many other sectors where children work, employers find it easier to hire 
children as they are easily exploited and cheaper to employ. Children are also recruited to 
work in mines because of their small size and the fact that they are thought to be nimble. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Education 
</b></p>
<p>35. Although international law requires that primary education is free and 
compulsory, very often parents still have to pay for school equipment such as uniforms, 
books and stationery. Such additional costs make it unaffordable for parents to send their 
children to school. Additionally, mechanisms are often not in place to enforce the 
compulsory<b> </b>primary education requirements. Due to lack of childcare facilities or schools 
in the area of the mines and quarries, parents, often mothers, end up taking their children 
to work. 
</p>
<p>36. In cases where schools are available, their insufficient number, the insufficient 
number of teachers, the poor educational infrastructure and the poor quality of education 
result in illiterate children and disgruntled parents who have made a financial sacrifice to 
put their children in school. Moreover, further compounding the situation, where schools 
are available, compulsory and free, children may not be able to attend, as they are still 
required to work in order to supplement the family income to meet basic needs, such as 
food and accommodation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal and institutional structures 
</b></p>
<p>37. The lack of or insufficient legal framework, policies and institutions to combat 
child slavery and to support and protect children from slavery is a significant cause of 
child slavery in the mining sector. This is often compounded by a weak institutional 
framework whereby there is a lack of clarity about the roles and responsibilities of 
Government bodies and often a lack of sufficient human and financial resources to

<p><b> D. Informality and illegality in the artisanal mining and quarrying sector 
</b></p>
<p>38. The informality in which the artisanal mining and quarrying is performed makes 
it difficult for the authorities to control this sector, which allows for the use of children. 
Many existing laws on mining were established to regulate large-scale mining operations.  
These laws are inappropriate for small-scale and artisanal mining and quarrying whose 
owners have very little understanding of health, labour and safety regulations by which 
they are to abide. The mines and quarries are often in remote ungoverned areas of the 
country and have unskilled and non-unionized workers with little knowledge of their 
rights: this situation, compounded by the poverty in these remote areas, facilitates child 
slavery in this sector.

<p>39. Furthermore, where concessions are granted, they are given only to enable the 
extraction of minerals or stones. These concessions do not provide for ensuring workers&#8217; 
rights.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Lack of or weak State presence  
</b></p>
<p>40. Generally, regions where mining and quarrying communities live suffer from a 
lack of basic public services (potable water, sanitary facilities and electricity), including 
social services. The lack of these basic services means that families have to assume the 
costs for these services. This places a further financial burden on families, which can 
result in child slavery in this sector (see A/HRC/18/30/Add.2). 
</p>
<p><b> F. Conflict 
</b></p>
<p>41. Artisanal mines are often based in remote places which make it easy for armed 
groups to control. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, armed groups 
force both adults and accompanied and unaccompanied children to work in artisanal 
mines to extract minerals such as gold9 and coltan. Coltan is used in the manufacture of 
products such as mobile phones, laptops and rechargeable batteries. The minerals are then 
sold to fund the activities of the armed groups (A/HRC/13/63, para. 21). 
</p>
<p><b> G. Trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>42. Some unaccompanied children are brought to the mines and quarries by 
&#8220;middlemen&#8221; who traffic them from their families and leave them at the mines.  Such a 
case has been reported for instance in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire.10 Children and their families are 
deceived as to the dangerous and exploitative nature of the work they will end up doing.  
Such practice is prohibited by article 1 (d) of the 1956 Supplementary Convention: &#8220;any 
institution or practice whereby a child or young person under the age of 18 years, is 
delivered by either or both of his natural parents or by his guardian to another person, 
whether for reward or not, with a view to the exploitation of the child or young person or 
of his labour&#8221;.   
</p>
<p><b> H. Debt bondage 
</b></p>
<p>43. Some parents take out loans against their children&#8217;s labour. Other parents sell 
their children and, upon their arrival in the mines, the children are charged exorbitant 
prices for their transportation to the mines, food and tools by the employer or middleman. 
In both these instances, the children are often unable to leave the mines or quarries until 
they have paid off the debt owed to the middleman or employer. In majority of the cases, 
children become bonded as a result of their parents&#8217; debt. Bonded labour is prohibited 
under the 1956 Supplementary Convention. Many children report not being able to save or 
even earn enough money to send back home. This results in them being unable to leave 
their situation until their debt is paid. In 2010, the Special Rapporteur received 
information that Bangladeshi and Nepali children were being purchased by middlemen or 
abducted and sold by gangs to mining employers in India. The price of the child varied 
</p>
<p>  
 9 ILO, &#8220;Child labour in gold mining: the problem&#8221; (June 2006). 
 10 See <i>Protocols for Environmental and Health Assessment of Mercury</i>. </p>


<p>from 50&#8211;75 USD. According to the information received, the children are forced to work 
to pay off their debt. The middlemen bring both boys and girls to work in the mines. The 
girls living and working in the mines are often sexually abused by adult mine workers and 
employers.11 
</p>
<p><b> I. International and national market forces 
</b></p>
<p>44. The current financial crisis has seen demand in investments such as property fall 
and, with inflation on the rise and the lack of confidence in paper money, demand for gold 
has seen a huge increase.12 As of April 2011, the price of gold hit a record high of $1,466 
per ounce.13 Additionally, the increased usage of mobile phones has resulted in the 
increased international demand and price for coltan. International demand for minerals 
leads families and children to &#8220;rush&#8221; to work in this sector because they see this as a quick 
way to informally make money (see A/HRC/18/51). 
</p>
<p>45. The discovery of new mineral reserves tends to result in  
&#8220;rushes&#8221; for gold and diamonds. This has been the case for gold in Brazil, Ecuador and 
Papua New Guinea.14 Madagascar has also experienced a &#8220;sapphire rush&#8221;.15 On her recent 
mission to Peru, the Special Rapporteur was able to see the effects of the gold rush in 
Madre Dios, Peru (see A/HRC/18/30/Add.2). 
</p>
<p><b> J. Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>46. Many children who work also come from groups that have been discriminated 
against and/or marginalized, for example, indigenous peoples, migrants or those given a 
certain social status such as caste. For example, countries may have a highly stratified 
society which in many communities dictates the kind of work one does. This means that a 
family from a particular stratum can only perform certain jobs. The lower you are in this 
stratified society the lower paid the jobs that one can perform. Consequently, one finds 
that many children who work are those from the lower strata.16 This makes them doubly 
vulnerable to abuses. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Lack of social structures 
</b></p>
<p>47. The lack of traditional family and social structures in artisanal mining and 
quarrying communities increases the likelihood of child slavery. This is especially true for 
migrant and trafficked children working in this sector. They are often undocumented, do

<p>not receive any Government support or protection and are vulnerable to exploitation by 
mine employers. These communities are set up by people who for various reasons leave 
their traditional way of live and go to work in this sector. The communities are set up in 
an ad hoc manner with little or no regard to societal norms. These communities often 
attract those unable or unwilling to sustain traditional lifestyles or occupations (see 
A/HRC/18/30/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> L. HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>48. HIV/AIDS has had a huge impact on all of society, not least those subject to 
child slavery in mining and quarrying. In central and southern Africa the scourge of AIDS 
has left many orphans.17 This situation &#8211; coupled with the fact that there is already a lot of 
pressure on the disintegrating traditional extended family support system &#8211; means that 
many orphans end up working unaccompanied in this sector. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Nature and impact of child slavery on the enjoyment of 
children&#8217;s rights  
</b></p>
<p>49. As mentioned earlier, the combined elements of coercion, fear, restriction on 
freedom of movement and complete dependence on the employer exhibit characteristics 
which amount to contemporary forms of slavery. This contemporary form of slavery 
results in the violation of a series of other children&#8217;s rights. This section deals with the 
violations that occur while they are in slavery within mines and quarries. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Nature and impact on the child&#8217;s health or physical, mental, spiritual, 
moral or social development 
</b></p>
<p>50. Children start to work with their families (parents or relatives), unpaid, in mines 
and quarries from the age of 3.18 They start by performing small tasks such as lifting 
stones, supplying adults with tools, breaking stones and sifting gravel in order to support 
the family and eventually end up involved in all aspects of mining and quarrying. 
Children in artisanal mines and quarries also cook and clean for their families and other 
adult mine workers. 
</p>
<p>51. Children often start performing the same tasks as adults more regularly and full 
time from the age of 12 years (see A/HRC/18/30/Add.1). By the time they are 
adolescents, children work in the actual extraction of minerals underground, underwater 
or on the surface. These children are also likely to work in the separation, processing and 
transportation of the minerals. The children face the same risks as adults but lack the same 
strength and judgement to protect themselves from harm. The effects that this work has on 
children are much more severe than for adults because of their anatomical, physiological 
and psychological development, which places them in a situation of increased 
vulnerability. Tools and safety equipment, when available, have been designed for adults 
and to correspond to the measurement of children. Children also work very long hours 
with little or no pay.  
</p>
<p>52. Children working in the mines and quarries are vulnerable to physical, sexual, 
moral and social harm. Artisanal mining and quarrying is inherently informal and illegal &#8211;
</p>
<p>  
 17 See <i>Breaking new ground</i>. 
 18 See <i>Squeezing Gold from a Stone</i>. </p>


<p>as either it costs too much to get the legal permit to mine or there is no need to get a 
permit as the law is not enforced. These &#8220;frontier communities&#8221; are riddled with violence, 
crime, trafficking in young girls and women for sexual exploitation, prostitution, drug and 
alcohol use (ibid.). There have been reports that children are given drugs so that they are 
able to fearlessly extract minerals underground or underwater. Children also take drugs 
and alcohol in the belief that it makes them stronger and as a result of peer pressure. The 
drug abuse (particularly amphetamines and marijuana) and alcohol (commercial and/or 
local brew) destroy their health and keep them in the vicious circle of poverty. Children 
who arrive alone to work in this sector are even more vulnerable to abuses (see 
A/HRC/18/30/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>53. Working in &#8220;frontier communities&#8221; or in remote mines, children are often subject 
to moral turpitude. They are continuously exposed to physical violence from adult miners 
and their employers. Children are also at risk of sexual violence such as rape and other 
forms of sexual abuse. In some cases, children are also forced into prostitution. This has a 
huge impact on the child&#8217;s mental well-being and exposes the child to HIV and sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs). Without any proper guardianship, unaccompanied children 
fall easily prey to alcohol and drug addictions, which further perpetuate their poverty 
(ibid.). 
</p>
<p>54. Poor living and working conditions have an impact on the health and safety of 
children. As a result of unsanitary living conditions, children often suffer from diseases 
such as tuberculosis and diarrhoea.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Children in mining 
</b></p>
<p>55. Children working in mines are physically and economically exploited, as they 
are required to spend long hours in poorly lit and ventilated underground mines for little 
or no payment. When they are paid, children performing the same tasks as adults are paid 
less than adults. These makeshift mines may run to over 80 metres underground and, in 
some instances, can only accommodate the width of children who crawl to excavate the 
ore. Children also set explosives to blast rock underground and carry heavy loads of ore to 
the surface. Children who do not work inside a mine may be found digging for long hours 
in rivers beds, shifting through sand or silt and then carrying heavy loads of mud on their 
heads or backs for further processing. The long hours working outside, without proper 
clothing or shelter results in exposure to extreme heat, cold, dryness and moisture. 
</p>
<p>56. Children working in mines run the risk of spinal injuries and physical 
deformities as a result of the heavy loads carried. They also face injury and sometimes 
death as a result of working in makeshift mines and handling explosives.  Children mining 
underwater and underground risk death by suffocation and asphyxiation. 
</p>
<p>57. Children working in this sector commonly suffer respiratory illnesses such as 
silicosis due to the inhaling of rock dust. Many children are injured, disabled and 
sometimes die as a result of: the collapse of mine walls or roofs; handling explosives or 
drilling equipment; and using crude tools. These health risks may occur immediately or 
long after the children have been working in this sector.  
</p>
<p>58. Children work without any training, safety equipment or protection. They are 
exposed to heat, noise, toxic metals and hazardous chemicals such as mercury and 
cyanide. Mercury is used in the extraction of gold in artisanal mining areas. As children 
are sometimes regarded as less suitable to labour intensive work, they are often given 
work in mercury amalgamation. As children do not wear any protective equipment, they 
absorb mercury through their hands and inhale it when it burns. The mercury impacts on: 
the nervous system of the child resulting in uncontrollable tremors &#8211; particularly in the </p>


<p>face; their emotional well-being as they become prone to mood swings and irritability; 
their neuromuscular system leading to muscle atrophy, twitching, headaches and changes 
in nerve responses; and their cognitive functions are impaired. If exposed to higher levels 
of mercury, this affects the kidneys and can result in respiratory failure and death.19 
Mercury has been found in the bodies of children working in artisanal gold mines in the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Peru, the United Republic of Tanzania 
and Zimbabwe.20 
</p>
<p>59. Toxic chemicals like mercury are able to seep into the soil and water supply 
thereby affecting food and water. These artisanal communities often lack basic services 
such as potable drinking water, electricity and medical services. Continued exposure to a 
polluted environment and contaminated water can manifest itself in acute respiratory 
problems and skin ailments if not immediately then in adulthood (see 
A/HRC/18/30/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>60. Lead, the mineral, is also used in the extraction of gold and impacts on the 
neurological development of children. In 2010, the World Health Organization found lead 
poisoning in Nigerian children (some younger than 5 years) as a result of working directly 
in the extraction of gold and environmental lead contamination. Local villagers had 
noticed a high number of deaths and convulsions in young children, which is believed to 
be associated with the use of lead in gold-mining.21 
</p>
<p>61. Children endure physically demanding work where they have to carry heavy 
loads and stand, dive or squat for long hours. The physical demands have an effect on 
children&#8217;s osteo-muscular development. A survey of children working in artisanal gold-
mining in Mongolia reported that majority of them reported suffering from aches in the 
limbs and backbone.22 Another survey reported that they suffered from kidney and urinary 
diseases and exhaustion. During a mission to Ecuador, the Special Rapporteur witnessed 
children stunted in growth as a result of poor nutrition and working in mining 
(A/HRC/15/20/Add.3). 
</p>
<p>62. To mine underwater, children dive into open muddy wells, which are normally 2 
metres wide and 7 metres deep. Wearing crude eye masks which inhibit their vision and 
with the aid of oxygen from a compressor, the children extract soil in the hope that it 
contains gold. The children work for 3&#8211;5 hours underwater in a squatting position 
anchoring themselves with their elbows or knees. They face the risk of asphyxiation and 
suffocation underwater. This type of mining has been reported in places like Philippines 
(see E/C.12/MDG/CO/2).

<p><b> C. Children in quarrying 
</b></p>
<p>63. In quarries, children dig out stones, transport them on their heads and backs and 
spend long hours crushing stones into smaller pieces to be used in the construction 
industry. In the coal-mining sector, some children start working from the age of 4 but the 
majority of child workers start between the ages of 12 and 14. The majority of these 
children, accompanied or unaccompanied, work between 7 and 9 hours a day.  
</p>
<p>64. Children who work above ground (carrying and breaking coal) are exposed to 
heatstroke and sunstroke. They also work longer hours than the children who work 
underground (cutting, digging and pulling trolleys of coal). For the children who get 
wages, the long hours are not reflected in their wages. According to the information 
received by the Special Rapporteur, children who ask for more pay are often verbally or 
physically threatened, punished by being beaten or left locked in mines.   
</p>
<p>65. The growth of children is often stunted as a result of carrying heavy loads of 
stones, sand and gravel. These children also complain of exhaustion and muscle pain in 
the arms, shoulders and legs. 
</p>
<p>66. Various reports site that children working in quarries are exposed to various 
accidents, such as head injuries or the loss or injury of fingers and toes, which reduces 
their physical abilities. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The right to education 
</b></p>
<p>67. Some children try to combine working in the mines or quarries and going to 
school, as many of them need to work in order to assume the costs related to their 
education. However, these children are often tired, physically and mentally, and hence are 
often absent from class or lack the time to do their homework, rest in an adequate way or 
participate in recreational activities. This combination of factors results in their repeating 
classes, either a semester or a whole year. The school dropout rates increase drastically at 
10 years old and is more pronounced at the secondary level of education, the majority of 
mining communities lacking secondary schools.23   
</p>
<p>68. Studies show that such child slavery not only has a negative impact on the 
health, well-being and education of the child, but also later has a negative economic 
impact on communities and countries. According to the findings of these studies, children 
who work are more likely to have children who will also work and not go to school. 
Consequently, the poverty gets passed on from one generation to another.24 
</p>
<p><b> E. The gender dimension  
</b></p>
<p>69. Both boys and girls are found working in artisanal mining and quarrying, but, as 
they grow up, they are attributed different tasks.   
</p>
<p>70. The boys are mainly found in underground and underwater extraction. They face 
the dangers of working inside the mines. Most of the girls are found above ground, 
breaking down the rocks and processing the minerals.

<p>71. The overall majority of children who work in artisanal mining and quarrying are 
boys. However, the number of boys and girls working in mines varies from country to 
country. In countries like Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania, the majority of 
children working in the mines are boys.25 Furthermore, in countries like the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, as a result of cultural beliefs, girls are normally not 
allowed to enter mines or work outside the mines processing the ore and sifting the 
mineral from the slag (see E/C.12/MDG/CO/2). However, in Mongolia,  the majority of 
children who work under the age of 13 are girls.26 
</p>
<p>72. In addition to working in artisanal mining and quarrying, girls also perform 
domestic household tasks which involve cooking, taking care of siblings, cleaning 
supplying tools and food to other miners, carrying water and washing clothes. While 
performing these additional duties, girls are exposed to chemically contaminated water, 
food and soil. Women and girls are also found around the mines selling food, water and 
tools.  
</p>
<p>73. Girls, especially unaccompanied girls, working in and around the mines and 
quarries are vulnerable to rape and sexual exploitation. Sexual exploitation can start from 
the age of 9 but many of the girls involved are aged between 13 and 17 years.27  In some 
mining communities like those in Burkina Faso and Niger, it is believed that male child 
miners will have greater luck in the mining pits if they have sexual intercourse with a 
virgin or have unprotected sexual intercourse and do not wash before going underground 
(see E/C.12/MDG/CO/2). Child prostitution also occurs in the mining communities. For 
example, in Ghana, girls as young as 12 living in gold-mining communities are found in 
prostitution (ibid.). A United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) study on sexual 
exploitation of children around mines and quarries found four main types of exploitation: 
prostitution on a regular basis, occasional prostitution, companionship or temporary 
unions, and forced prostitution.28  
</p>
<p>74. Consequently, mining and quarrying communities often have a high rate of STIs 
(such as HIV and AIDS), teenage pregnancies and single-parent households. Chemical 
contamination from artisanal mining can be a risk to an unborn child or breastfeeding 
children.   
</p>
<p>75. The present chapter shows how if one principal crime goes unpunished, it makes 
way for  &#8211;sometimes more complex &#8211; subsequent secondary crimes which are dependent 
on the principal crime. In this case, the fact that child slavery in mines and quarries goes 
unpunished has led to a series of other human rights violations, such as rape and sexual 
exploitation. 
</p>

and education of children, as well as the violations of their rights to play and have

emotional capacities.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Challenges in the prevention of child slavery in the mining 
and quarrying sector 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur highlights the following five challenges in eradicating 
child slavery in artisanal mining and quarrying. 
</p>
<p>78. First, there are legal and enforcement challenges. This is due to the absence of 
legislation or inadequate legislation, lack of criminalization and the lack of enforcement 
or adequate enforcement of legislation relating to children working in slavery within the 
artisanal mining and quarrying sector. Where legislation exists, it is often complex and 
only favours the owner of the mine or quarry, not the workers &#8211; particularly in the case of 
the children. Additionally, where legislation exists in the form of bans on artisanal mining 
and quarrying, such activity is driven further underground. This increases the risk of 
violations of the rights of the children who work, as they are even more isolated and 
restricted in their movements in order to keep their work secretive.   
</p>
<p>79. Second, poverty, in particular rural poverty, is not only a cause but also an 
obstacle to eradicating slavery in artisanal mining and quarrying. Reports state that a 
working child incurs huge future income losses due to the negative impact working has on 
his human capital, health and education.29 In the case of child slavery in artisanal mining 
and quarrying, the negative impact is likely to be worse. With the lack of investment in 
rural livelihoods and alternatives to subsistence farming, mining &#8211; particularly gold-
mining &#8211; is regarded as a quick way of making money.30 31 Artisanal miners make one&#8212;
three times more money from mining than from farming (see E/C.12/MDG/CO/2). 
However, although better paid than other occupations, it needs to be highlighted that in 
most of the cases, owing to factors such as debt bondage, inflated prices for basic goods 
and lack of basic services, wages hardly cover subsistence costs, perpetuating the need for 
children to work.   
</p>
<p>80. Third, geographical challenges also contribute to the lack of proper enforcement 
of the law and Government programmes. Mines and quarries are usually found in remote, 
hard-to-access areas of the country. Those who live in remote areas establish &#8220;frontier 
communities&#8221;. In some instances, Governments refer to difficulties in accessing these 
areas owing to internal armed conflict, organized crime or poor transport infrastructure. 
Remoteness also contributes to lawlessness in these communities, as perpetrators of 
violence and exploitation know that they are not within the reach of the law. 
</p>
<p>81. Fourth, the lack of public awareness about the slavery conditions experienced by 
children working in this sector is another challenge. The lack of general understanding of 
what constitutes child slavery and the illegal and informal nature of some artisanal mining 
and quarrying contribute to the difficulty in collecting data and information on where and 
how many children are involved in this work. This lack of knowledge makes it difficult to

<p>prevent, address and regulate child slavery. Knowledge would allow decision-makers at 
all levels to make better choices in tackling child slavery in this sector.  
</p>
<p>82. Lastly, unregulated artisanal mines and quarries pose serious medium- and long-
term risks to food security and the environment. They are the cause of rapid deforestation, 
destruction of landscape, soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. Water, soil and air 
contamination occur as a result of: cyanide and mercury poisoning; direct dumping of 
tailings and effluents into rivers; river siltation; and river damage in alluvial areas. 
Children drinking, cooking and washing in contaminated water face immediate and long-
term risks to their health.    
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Best practices eradicating child slavery in the mining and 
quarrying sector 
</b></p>
<p>83. The examples below demonstrate that a multistakeholder approach involving the 
community, local government, NGOs and United Nations agencies is essential in 
combating the phenomenon of child slavery in mining and quarrying. 
</p>
<p>84. ILO is leading a global programme entitled &#8220;Minors out of Mining&#8221;, which 
includes at least 15 countries32 and partners from the mining industry such as the 
International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers&#8217; Unions 
(ICEM) and the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), along with 
Communities and Small-Scale Mining (CASM). The aim of the programme is to 
effectively and efficiently deal with child exploitation in the informal mining and 
quarrying sector. Projects at the national level are designed to address the root causes and 
combat child labour in small-scale mining. Governments lead the work with support from 
workers, donors, employers and communities. ILO has implemented successful projects to 
stop children working in mines in many countries, such as Mongolia and Philippines,33 
which focused on increasing the educational and vocational training opportunities for 
children. In Philippines, their project also focused on providing alternative livelihood 
schemes for the parents of children working in the mines.34  
</p>
<p>85. Another successful ILO example is the programme for the prevention and 
progressive elimination of child labour in small-scale traditional gold-mining in Latin 
America, which had regional, national and local components and was aimed at 
contributing to the elimination of child labour in small-scale mining in the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.35 Successful intervention elements identified included: 
the establishment or improvement of social services, such as education services for 
children and health services for all the population; improvement of the technology for 
mining exploitation and health conditions and job security; giving impetus for micro-
enterprises for mothers/fathers of children that had been working in mining and creation 
of income-generating alternatives for women; creation and strengthening of grass-roots 
organizations, and giving impetus to a local development processes with the participation 
of various actors.

 34 ILO, &#8220;Facts on Child Labour in small scale mining&#8221;, October 2005. 
 35 This programme was able withdraw 2,667 children from mining work and to prevent 5,845 children 
</p>
<p>from entering it. It was not able to withdraw all the children from labour because some families in the 
mining communities were still in very vulnerable economic conditions and refused to withdraw their 
children despite the programme&#8217;s efforts. </p>


<p>86. In order to influence market forces and encourage ethical demand of minerals, 
initiatives such as the Fairtrade and Fairmined Standard for Gold from Artisanal and 
Small-Scale Mining, including Associated Precious Metals have been started. This 
initiative is led by the Alliance for Responsible Mining and the world renown, Fairtrade 
Labelling Organisations International. This standard aims to promote, among other things, 
human rights, the elimination of children working in this sector, the formalization of 
artisanal and small-scale mining and traceability of the mineral produced. The standard is 
currently being used by artisanal and small-scale mining communities  in Latin America 
and scoping studies are being done to check the feasibility of using the standard in Africa 
and Asia. 
</p>
<p>87. In order to address poverty, social protection programmes that provide 
compensation to families for the loss of earnings from children&#8217;s labour can be effective. 
Programmes such as <i>Bolsa Familia</i> in Brazil, conditional cash transfer programmes which 
provide direct cash transfers to poor families who keep their children in school and under 
regular medical supervision, have significantly contributed to the reduction of child 
labour. Between 2003 and 2007, <i>Bolsa Familia </i>had successfully raised 20 million people 
out of poverty, reducing poverty from 22 to 7 per cent.36   
</p>
<p><b> IX. Key strategies in tackling child slavery in the mining and 
quarrying sector  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>A multistakeholder approach at all levels is required to combat child 
slavery in the mining and quarrying sector. States, under the leadership of a high-
ranking Government official, should establish a multistakeholder team, with 
Government officials from different ministries dealing with child slavery, 
representatives from civil society organizations (CSOs) and experts who can develop, 
coordinate, deliver and monitor well-resourced plans to eradicate child slavery in 
this sector. Such a multistakeholder approach should focus on the following: the 
enactment and enforcement of legislation prohibiting children working in the mining 
and quarrying sector; the establishment of policies and programmes to implement 
the law; compulsory primary education; poverty reduction programmes that include 
social protection programmes and alternative employment opportunities; and 
measures to address the overall welfare of the child.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>States should ensure that the best interests of the child are at all times 
paramount in any programme or policy related to children subject to child slavery in 
this sector. States should also cooperate on a bilateral, regional and international 
basis, with the assistance of CSOs, in order to eliminate child slavery in this sector. 
The areas in which child mining and quarrying occur in a country are likely to be 
geographically distinct. Therefore, programmes developed should clearly focus on 
making specific interventions adapted for each area of the country.   
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislation and its enforcement  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that States ratify fully and implement 
all relevant international legal instruments to prevent child slavery such as the 1926 
Slavery Convention, the 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of 
</b></p>
<p>  
       36   World Bank, &#8220;Lifting Families Out of Poverty in Brazil - Bolsa Familia Program&#8221;. Available from 
  http://web.worldbank.org (accessed on 1 July 2011).  </p>


<p><b>Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,</b> 
<b>the</b> <b>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
Their Families and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.   
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Governments should also sign and ratify all relevant ILO Conventions. In 
conformity with ILO Convention No. 182, Governments should adopt legislation that 
prohibits children from working in mines and quarries for both the formal and 
informal sector. Governments which have not yet established a list of hazardous 
work for children in conformity with ILO recommendation No. 190 need to do so 
urgently and include in such a list the work performed in the mining and quarrying 
sector as both types of work are by their very nature and the conditions in which 
they are performed hazardous work as defined in article 3 of ILO recommendation 
No. 190. Governments that have already established such a list need to ensure that 
work performed in the mining and quarrying sector is included or revise the list 
accordingly.   
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>In addition to the general prohibition of slavery and forced labour in 
criminal legislation, Governments should also include explicit and broad prohibition 
in their legislation on children working in all types of mining and in all the 
operations linked to the mining and quarrying process.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Governments should effectively implement all legislation that prohibits 
child slavery in mines and quarries by ensuring effective investigation, prosecution, 
and punishment that is commensurate to the crime committed. Governments should 
also proactively investigate and prosecute other crimes committed around mines and 
quarries, such as sexual exploitation of children. Compensation and adequate 
rehabilitation for victims of child slavery should also be provided for in the laws 
prohibiting child slavery in this sector. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Labour legislation also needs to be revised, where necessary, so that it 
includes an explicit prohibition of the work performed by children in the mining and 
quarrying sector. All relevant legislation regulating this sector, including the 
legislation relevant to the artisanal mining and quarrying, must include a clear 
prohibition on children working in this sector. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Governments should increase the means for enforcing the law by allocating 
sufficient resources for labour inspection services. The legislation should provide for 
regular inspections of mines and quarries, and special training and information on 
child slavery should be given to inspectors responsible for this sector. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages Governments to take inspiration from the experience of the 
Brazilian mobile inspection units that &#8211;with protection from the federal police &#8211; 
undertake inspections in remote areas. Where crimes are committed, there should be 
prompt, effective investigation and prosecution of those exploiting children. The 
criminal penalties should be commensurate with the crimes committed.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Governments should establish clear and transparent procedures for gaining 
licences in artisanal mining and quarrying that benefit both the owner and the 
miners and expressly prohibit children working in this sector.  </b></p>


<p><b> B. Institutional framework, policies and programmes  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Governments should establish effective and accessible information and 
complaints mechanisms for victims such as an ombudsperson for children and allow 
for third parties to bring forward cases on behalf of children who have been victims 
of slavery. Governments should also provide victims of child slavery with adequate 
and unconditional assistance for their protection, rehabilitation and reintegration, 
including by funding and/or working with relevant international and NGOs. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>In order to develop national policies against child labour, most States have 
created multisectoral insitutions to prevent and eradicate child labour, made up of 
governmental authorities, representatives of the workers&#8217; union, representatives of 
the employers&#8217; union, NGOs and international organizations, the main task of which 
is to articulate national action plan for the prevention and eradication of child 
labour. These institutions should have specific programmes to prevent and eradicate 
child slavery in the mining and quarrying sector.  They should also develop and 
implement policies and social programmes targeting children working in the mines 
and quarries. Such policies and programmes need to be translated for use at the 
local levels. In countries most advanced in terms of decentralization, the regional, 
municipal and local governments have an increasing role with regard to the 
education, health and protection of children and youth services. Local governments, 
policies and programmes, because of their proximity to the reality of children and 
their families, are essential for the development of sustainable and effective actions 
for the eradication of child working in the mining and quarrying sector. These plans 
should have sufficient human and financial resources to ensure that they are fully 
implemented</b>. 
</p>
<p>99. <b>Education is widely considered to be the most effective tool for tackling 
child labour as it keeps children in school and away from work. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that this tool can also be used to prevent child slavery in mining 
and quarrying.  Primary education should be made accessible and free or affordable 
for children and training programmes need to be set up for parents. Governments 
need to assign resources to build schools in artisanal mining and quarrying areas 
and adequately train teachers to identify children&#8217;s problems and needs. The 
standard of education needs to be improved at all levels and the Government must 
provide secondary schooling and vocational training which is often absent. 
Recreational facilities should also be built to occupy children out of school hours, as 
parents often see mining and quarrying as a way to keep their children busy and out 
of trouble. The Ministry of Education should be allocated the necessary budget to 
implement these programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Adult literacy or vocational training should also be provided for parents 
working within the mines so as to increase their access to better paid alternative 
livelihoods. Increased wages will also enable them to send their children to school. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Poverty reduction programmes, such as cash transfer programmes, should 
be expanded with a specific focus on geographical areas where artisanal mining and 
quarrying occurs. These programmes should benefit only those whose children 
attend school and gain regular medical care.  This would help improve their well-
being. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Economic alternatives, which provide the same income, need to be offered 
to working mining and quarrying families. Alongside the provision of economic 
alternatives, Governments should work with international organizations and CSOs 
to monitor this sector in order to transform it and ensure better pay and working </b></p>


<p><b>conditions. This could then provide an income for families based on the labour of 
adults in a relatively safe working environment.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>For adults who continue to mine and quarry, Governments should also 
provide alternative livelihoods through which they can supplement the family 
income. This would increase the economic security of the families and diminish their 
need for child labour. A proven effective strategy in fighting child slavery is to 
promote the development of other activities which diversify the local economy and 
render it less dependent on this sector.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Given that some children working in this sector are doing so with their 
families, the family needs to be the main focus of work in this area. Work needs to be 
done with families to emphasize the high risks and dangers to which children are 
exposed. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Governments should provide incentives for companies to explore 
technologies allowing minerals to be traced to their source. This information could 
then help Governments to ascertain who produced the minerals and under what 
conditions (including use of child slavery). Governments can then monitor and 
prosecute those that use child slavery. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that, although quarrying holds many of the 
same risks to children as mining, there are more programmes focused on mining 
than on quarrying and urges all actors to intervene to eliminate child slavery in 
quarrying. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Corporate responsibility  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Companies should comply with all applicable laws and respect human 
rights standards, particularly those on child labour and slavery-like practices. 
Businesses are required to comply with international agreements ratified by the 
country in which they operate and when they operate internationally.  As proposed 
by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights 
and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, companies, when 
conducting business with State or non-State entities and entities in its value chain, 
should either by action or omission: avoid causing or exacerbating adverse human 
rights impacts through their own activities, and address such impacts when they 
occur; and seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are 
directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business 
relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts (see report of the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises, A/HRC/17/31, para 13 
ff.).</b> 
</p>
<p>108. <b>Businesses should exercise due diligence and ensure that their use of natural 
resources does not result in the violation of the human rights of children. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Protecting the human rights of children 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>In order to address other human rights violations that have an effect on the 
child, the Special Rapporteur recommends that Governments adopt measures that 
respect, protect and fulfil the rights of child as stipulated in the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child.  </b></p>


<p>110. <b>Governments should provide employers with information about affordable 
and alternative methods by which to reduce the adverse environmental impact on 
water, soil and air. This would benefit the health of the children living around the 
mines and quarries. Governments should also provide incentives for employers who 
meet environmental safety standards and work with United Nations agencies such as 
UNEP and the Global Mercury Project which was set up by the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Industrial Development 
Organization (UNIDO) and the Global Environment Facility, which already have 
experience in mitigating the environmental impact of gold-mining.  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Governments should establish programmes to create awareness in frontier 
communities about the health risks they face particularly with regard to handling 
toxic chemicals such as mercury, cyanide and lead. The communities should undergo 
testing for contamination and those contaminated should be provided with medical 
care. Local health workers should be clinically trained on how to prevent, diagnose 
and treat contamination. These programmes should also extend to ensure that 
workers are made aware of the less visible and long-term negative impact on the 
environment (soil, water) which threatens food security and biodiversity. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Governments should provide frontier communities with basic services such 
as potable water and sanitary facilities. Governments should also provide health 
clinics and ensure that communities can access good-quality health services free of 
charge or at an affordable price. This would improve family living and health 
conditions and thereby diminish their expenses and their need to bring children to 
work with them. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>CSOs and international organizations should work to ensure that 
alternative childcare services are also available so that mothers are not in a situation 
in which they take children with them to the mining and quarrying sites because of 
the lack of specific places to take care of children while they are working.
