Directors’ Report 
MEC Resources Ltd and its controlled subsidiaries 
 
The  directors of MEC Resources Ltd  (“MEC” or  the  “Company”)  present their  report on the  Company 
for the financial year ended 30 June 2016. 
 
Directors 
 
The names of directors in office at any time during or since the end of the year are: 
 
H Goh  
D L Breeze 
K O Yap 
D Ambrosini  
 
Company Secretary 
 
Ms Deborah Ambrosini continues in her role of Company Secretary. She also holds the position of Chief 
Financial Officer of the company and has over 15 years’ experience in corporate accounting roles.  
 
Principal Activities  
 
MEC is registered as a Pooled Development Fund under the Pooled Development Fund  Act (1992). It 
has been formed to invest into exploration companies that are targeting potentially large energy and 
mineral resources.  
 
MEC  will  provide  carefully  selected  companies  in  the  energy  and  mineral  exploration  sectors  with 
development and exploration funding. MEC intends to identify investment opportunities with a number 
of  specific  characteristics  including:  large  targets;  a  stage  of  development  that  permits  a  strategic 
investor  or  IPO  within  several  years;  strong  and  experienced  management  team  and  a  definitive 
competitive advantage. 
 
MEC’s  current  major  investment  lies  in  unlisted  Australian  oil  and  gas  exploration  company,  Advent 
Energy Ltd.   
 
Advent Energy Ltd - Oil and Gas  
 
MEC has a controlling interest in the unlisted energy explorer Advent Energy Ltd (“Advent”) of 44.89%.  
 
Advent  has  assembled  a  range  of  hydrocarbon  permits  which  contain  near  term  production 
opportunities with pre-existing infrastructure and exploration upside.  
 
Advent’s assets include  EP386 and  RL1  (100%) in the onshore Bonaparte Basin in the north of Western 
Australia and Northern Territory and PEP11 (85%) in the offshore Sydney Basin.  
 
Advent  is  investigating  a  considerable  potential  shale  gas  resource  within  EP386  and  RL1.  Studies 
indicate  significant  potential  upside  in  prospective  shale  gas  resources  with  an  estimated  (Best 
Estimate) prospective recoverable resource of 9.8 Tcf (Low Estimate is 1.9 Tcf and High Estimate is 25.4 
Tcf) 
 
A  conventional 2C  Contingent Resource  of  11.5  Bcf  (1C is 0.3  Bcf and  3C is 45.8  Bcf) for  the Weaber 
Gas Field (RL1) has been assessed by an independent third party as a component of Advent’s drive to 
commercialise  its  100%  owned  onshore  Bonaparte  Basin  assets.   Included  in  these  assets  in  EP386 
conventional  recoverable  resource  estimates  range  from  53.3  Bcf  (Low)  to  1,326.3  Bcf  (High)  of 
Prospective  Resources,  with  a  Best  Estimate  of  355.9  Bcf  of  gas.  The  rapid  development  of  the 
Kununurra region in northern Western Australia, including the Ord Irrigation Expansion Project and
1
Directors’ Report 
MEC Resources Ltd and its controlled subsidiaries 
 
 
numerous resource projects, provides an exceptional opportunity for Advent to potentially develop its 
nearby gas resources for the benefit of the region along with Advent and its shareholders. 
 
The Sydney Basin is a proven petroleum basin with excellent potential for the discovery of gas and oil. 
Advent has demonstrated an active hydrocarbon system with seeps reported in the offshore area and 
sampling has indicated the presence of thermogenic hydrocarbon gas. This is considered to occur in 
basins  actively  generating  hydrocarbons  and/or  that  contain  excellent  migration  pathways.  Previous 
drilling has shown that the early Permian geological sequence is mature for hydrocarbons.   
 
Undiscovered  gross  prospective  recoverable  gas  resources  for  structural  targets  within  the  PEP11 
offshore  permit have  been estimated  at 5.7  Tcf  (at the  Best Estimate  level).  A  Low Estimate  of 0.3  Tcf 
and High Estimate of 67.8 Tcf has been assessed by Pangean Resources in 2010. PEP 11 lies adjacent to 
the most populous region of Australia and the major industrial hub and port of Newcastle. 
 
Operating Results 
 
The  loss  attributable  to  the  owners  of  the  Consolidated  Group  after  tax  for  the  year  was  $1,034,477 
(2015: Loss $1,767,525).  
 
Dividends 
 
The Directors recommend that no dividend be paid in respect of the current  period and no dividends 
have been paid or declared since the commencement of the period.

Remuneration Report (Audited) 
 
This  report  details  the  nature  and  amount  of  remuneration  for  key  management  personnel  of  MEC 
Resources  Ltd.  The  remuneration  report  details  the  remuneration  arrangements  for  KMP  who  are 
defined as those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the 
major  activities  of  the  Group,  directly  or  indirectly,  including  any  Director  (whether  executive  or 
otherwise) of the Group. 
 
This  information  provided  in  this  remuneration  report  has  been  audited  as  a  required  by  Section 
308(3C) of the Corporations Act 2001. 
 
The  Directors  and  other  key  management  personnel  of  the  Group  during  or  since  the  end  of  the 
financial year were:
H Goh – Non-Executive Chairman  
D L Breeze - Executive Director 
K O Yap - Non-Executive Director 
D Ambrosini – Executive Director and Company Secretary 
E H Tan – Non Executive Director of Advent
All the parties have held their current position for the whole of the financial year and since the end of 
the financial year unless otherwise stated. 
 
Remuneration Policy 
 
The  remuneration  policy  of  MEC  Resources  Ltd  has  been  designed  to  align  director  and  executive 
objectives  with  shareholder  and  business  objectives  by  providing  a  fixed  remuneration  component 
and  offering  specific  long-term  incentives  as  determined  by  the  Board  and/or  shareholders.  The 
remuneration  report,  as  contained  in  the  2015  financial  accounts  was  adopted  at  the  Company’s 
2015 annual general meeting.   Remuneration for both Executive and Non-Executive directors has not 
increased since company inception. Although remuneration is reviewed annually against local market 
levels, the Board believes this course of action to be appropriate.  
 
The  Board’s  policy  for  determining  the  nature  and  amount  of  remuneration  for  Board  members  and 
senior executives of the Company is as follows: 
 
The remuneration policy, setting the terms and conditions for the executive directors and other senior 
executives, was approved by the Board.
  All  executives  receive  a  base  salary  (which  is  based  on  factors  such  as  length  of  service  and

experience), superannuation, fringe benefits and options. 
The Board reviews executive packages annually by reference to the Company’s performance, 
executive  performance  and  comparable  information  from  industry  sectors  and  other  listed 
companies in similar industries.
5
set competitive remuneration packages to attract and retain high calibre employees; 
link executive rewards to shareholder value creation; and 
establish appropriate, demanding performance hurdles for variable executive remuneration
Directors’ Report 
MEC Resources Ltd and its controlled subsidiaries 
 
Remuneration philosophy 
 
The  performance  of  the  Company  depends  upon  the  quality  of  the  Directors  and  executives.    The 
philosophy of the Company in determining remuneration levels is to: 
 
 
 
 
The  performance  of  executives  is  measured  against  criteria  agreed  biannually  with  each  executive 
and is based predominantly on the forecast growth of the Company’s profits and shareholders’ value. 
The  Board  may,  however,  exercise  its  discretion  in  relation  to  approving  incentives,  bonuses  and 
options. Any changes must be justified by reference to measurable performance criteria. The policy is 
designed to attract the highest calibre of executives and reward them for performance that results in 
long-term growth in shareholder wealth. 
 
Executives are also entitled to participate in the employee share and option arrangements. 
 
The executives receive a superannuation guarantee contribution required by the government, which is 
currently  9.50%,  and  do  not  receive  any  other  retirement  benefits.  Some  individuals,  however,  have 
chosen to sacrifice part of their salary to increase payments towards superannuation. 
 
Shares  given  to  directors  and  executives  are  valued  as  the  difference  between  the  market  price  of 
those  shares  and  the  amount  paid  by  the  director  or  executive.  Options  are  valued  using  an 
appropriate methodology.
The Board policy is to remunerate non-executive directors at market rates for comparable companies 
for  time,  commitment  and  responsibilities.  Payments  to  non-executive  directors  are  based  on  market 
practice,  duties  and  accountability.  Independent  external  advice  is  sought  when  required  on 
payments  to  non-executive  directors.  The  maximum  aggregate  amount  of  fees  that  can  be  paid  to 
non-executive directors is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Fees for 
non-executive  directors  are  not  linked  to  the  performance  of  the  Company.  However,  to  align 
directors’  interests  with  shareholder  interests,  the  directors  are  encouraged  to  hold  shares  in  the 
Company and are able to participate in the employee option plan. 
 
A policy on Directors hedging their equity has not been implemented by the Consolidated Group.  
 
Compensation Practices 
 
The  Board's  policy  for  determining  the  nature  and  amount  of  compensation  of  key  management  for 
the Group is as follows: 
 
The compensation structure for key management personnel is based on a number of factors, including 
length of service, particular  experience  of the  individual concerned, and  overall performance  of  the 
Company. The contracts for service between the Company and key management personnel are on a 
continuing  basis,  the  terms  of  which  are  not  expected  to  change  in  the  immediate  future.  Upon 
retirement,  key  management  personnel  are  paid  employee  benefit  entitlements  accrued  to  date  of 
retirement.  Key  management  personnel  are  paid  one  months  of  salary  in  the  event  of  redundancy 
and options not exercised before or on the date of termination will lapse after one month.
The Board determines the proportion of fixed and variable compensation for each key management 
personnel.

Directors’ Report 
MEC Resources Ltd and its controlled subsidiaries 
 
Employment contracts of directors  
 
The  employment  conditions  of  the  managing  director  are  formalised  in  a  contract  of  employment.    
The employment contract stipulates a six month resignation period.   The Company may terminate an 
employment contract without cause by providing six months written notice or making payment in lieu 
of notice, based on the individual’s annual salary component together with a redundancy payment of 
six months of the individual’s fixed salary component. Termination payments are generally not payable 
on resignation or dismissal for serious misconduct. In the instance of serious misconduct, the company 
can  terminate  employment  at  any  time.  Any  options  not  exercised  before  or  on  the  date  of 
termination will lapse after one month. 
 
The  remaining  directors  are  consultants  to  MEC  Resources  Ltd  and  each  party  can  terminate  their 
services by written notice.

The  Company has an agreement  with  Trandcorp Pty Ltd  on normal commercial terms  procuring  the 
services of David Breeze. The agreement is at the rate of $65,000 per annum, commencing from the 
time  of  receiving  listing  approval.  This  is  included  in  Mr  Breeze’s  total  remuneration  above.  Board 
payments  may  be  made  up  to  a  level  of  $250,000  per  annum.    Payments  are  to  be  made  up  to 
$25,000  per  annum  per  director  and  $50,000  per  annum  for  the  Chairman.  Remuneration  to  the 
directors of Advent is included in the tables above. 
 
There  were  no  grants  of  share  based  payment  compensation  to  directors  and  senior  management

Company  performance, 
remuneration 
The following table shows the gross revenue and the operating result for the last five years for the listed 
entity,  as  well  as  the  share  price  at  the  end  of  the  respective  financial  years.  Analysis  of  the  actual 
figures shows a decrease in the operating loss in the current year from the normalised loss in the prior 
year.  The  loss  for  last  year  was  negatively  influenced  by  the  loss  incurred  on  the  sale  of  redundant 
capitalised  items.    A  book  loss  of  $1.2M  was  recorded  on  the  sale  of  these  items  however  the 
normalised  loss  was  $1.6M.  The  Board  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  decreased  loss  is  in  line  with 
expectations as efforts continue to cut the costs of the Company while navigating very difficult market 
conditions.

Accountants set by the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board.

Statement of Significant Accounting Policies
Corporate Information  
The financial report  includes the consolidated financial statements and the notes of  MEC Resources Ltd

Australia.  
 
The financial report was authorised for issue on 26 August 2016 by the Board of Directors.
Basis of Preparation   
 
The  financial  report  is  a  general  purpose  financial  report  that  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with 
Australian  Accounting  Standards,  other  authoritative  pronouncements  of  the  Australian  Accounting 
Standards Board (“AASB”) and the Corporations Act 2001. MEC Resources Ltd is a for-profit entity for the 
purpose of preparing the financial statements. 
 
Australian Accounting Standards set out accounting policies that the AASB has concluded would result 
in  a  financial  report  containing  relevant  and  reliable  information  about  transactions,  events  and 
conditions to which they apply. Material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of this financial 
report are presented below. They have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated. 
 
The financial report has been prepared on an accruals basis and is based on historical costs, modified, 
where stated below. 
 
Compliance with IFRS

Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
 
Financial Position  
 
The  Consolidated  Group  has  incurred  losses  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  of  $1,300,678  (2015: 
$2,903,730) and has a net cash outflow from operating activities of $867,633 (2015: $1,138,136).   
 
The Consolidated Group has a working capital deficit of $609,428 (Note 18b) as at 30 June 2016 (2015:

directors  have  reviewed  their  expenditure  and  commitments  for  the  Consolidated  Group  and  have 
implemented  methods  of  costs  reduction.  The  directors  as  a  part  of  their  cash  monitoring,  have 
voluntarily suspended cash payments for their directors’ fees to conserve cash resources until such time 
that the Consolidated Group has sufficient cash. 
 
The Group has total financial liabilities of $810,973 at 30 June 2016. Subsequent to year end the Group 
has received confirmation from the lender that the current financial liabilities of $810,973 (2015: $697,978) 
will not be called for a period of 12 months from the date of this financial report or until such time as the 
Group is financially independent.

Based on the cash flow forecasts, directors voluntarily suspending their payments, deferral of $697,978 in 
financial  liabilities  and  the  reduction  of  operational  costs,  the  directors  are  satisfied  that,  the  going 
concern  basis  of  preparation  is  appropriate.  The  financial  report  has  therefore  been  prepared  on  a 
going concern basis, which assumes continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets 
and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. 
 
For  further  disclosure  concerning  the  exploration  permits  and  expenditure  commitments  of  the  Group 
and the ability of the Group to realise the associated capitalised exploration expenditure please refer to

Accounting Policies 
 
(a)   Principles of Consolidation 
 
A controlled entity is any entity which MEC Resources Ltd is exposed or has rights to variable returns from 
its  involvement  with  the  entity  and  has  the  ability  to  affect  those  returns  through  its  power  over  the 
entity.  A  list  of  controlled  entities  is  contained  in  Note  25  to  the  financial  statements.  All  controlled 
entities have  a June  financial year-end.  As at reporting  date, the  assets  and  liabilities of all controlled 
entities have been incorporated into the consolidated financial statements as well as their results for the 
year then ended.  
 
The  results  of  subsidiaries  acquired  or  disposed  of  during  the  year  are  included  in  the  consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and 
up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
 
All  inter-company  balances  and  transactions  between  entities  in  the  Consolidated  Group,  including 
any  unrealised  profits  or  losses,  have  been  eliminated  on  consolidation.  Accounting  policies  of 
subsidiaries  have  been  changed  where  necessary  to  ensure  consistencies  with  those  policies  applied 
by the parent entity. 
 
Where controlled entities have entered or left the Consolidated Group during the year, their operating 
results  have  been  included/excluded  from  the  date  control  was  obtained  or  until  the  date  control 
ceased. 
 
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the statement of 
profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income,  statement  of  changes  in  equity  and  statement  of 
financial position respectively. 
 
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for 
as  equity  transactions.  The  carrying  amounts  of  the  Group’s  interests  and  the  non-controlling  interests 
are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between 
the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the company. 
 
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference 
between  (i)  the  aggregate  of  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  and  the  fair  value  of  any 
retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of 
the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests.

(a)   Principles of Consolidation (continued)
Business Combinations
Amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  in  relation  to  the  subsidiary  are 
accounted  for  (i.e. reclassified  to profit or  loss  or  transferred directly to retained  earnings) in the  same 
manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed  of. The fair value  of any 
investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value 
on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement  or,  when  applicable,  the  cost  on  initial  recognition  of  an  investment  in  an  associate  or 
jointly controlled entity. 
 
(b)  
 
Business  combinations  occur  where  control  over  another  business  is  obtained  and  results  in  the 
consolidation  of  its  assets  and  liabilities.  All  business  combinations,  including  those  involving  entities 
under common control, are accounted for by applying the purchase method.  
 
The  purchase  method  requires  an  acquirer  of  the  business  to  be  identified  and  for  the  cost  of  the 
acquisition and fair values of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities to be determined as 
at acquisition date, being the date that control is obtained. Cost is determined as the aggregate of fair 
values of assets given, equity issued and liabilities assumed in exchange for. Any deferred consideration  
payable  is  discounted  to  present  value  using  the  entity’s  incremental  borrowing  rate.  Acquisition-
related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 
 
Goodwill is recognised initially at the excess  of  cost over the  acquirer’s  interest in the  net fair  value  of 
the  identifiable  assets,  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  recognised.  If  the  fair  value  of  the  acquirer’s 
interest is greater than cost, the surplus is immediately recognised in profit or loss. 
 
(c) 
 
The  charge  for  current  income  tax  expense  is  based  on  the  profit  for  the  year  adjusted  for  any  non-
assessable  or  disallowed  items.  It  is  calculated  using  the  tax  rates  that  have  been  enacted  or  are 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is accounted for in respect of temporary 
differences  arising  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the 
financial statements. No deferred income tax will be recognised from the initial recognition of an asset 
or liability, excluding a business combination, where there is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or 
loss. 
 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is 
realised  or  liability  is  settled.  Deferred  tax  is  recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other 
comprehensive  income  except  where  it  relates  to  items  that  may  be  recognised  directly  to  equity,  in 
which case the deferred tax is adjusted directly against equity. 
 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future tax profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences  or unused tax losses and tax credits can be 
utilised. 
 
The  amount  of  benefits  brought  to  account  or  which  may  be  realised  in  the  future  is  based  on  the 
assumption that no adverse change will occur in income taxation legislation and the anticipation that 
the  Group  will  derive  sufficient  future  assessable  income  to  enable  the  benefit  to  be  realised  and 
comply with the conditions of deductibility imposed by the law.

Property, plant and equipment
(d) 
 
 Each class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost or fair value less, where applicable, any 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Plant and equipment 
Plant  and  equipment  are  measured  on  the  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  any  impairment 
losses.  
 
The  carrying  amount  of  plant  and  equipment  is  reviewed  annually  by  directors  to  ensure  it  is  not  in 
excess of the recoverable amount from these assets. The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis 
of  the  expected  net  cash  flows  that  will  be  received  from  the  asset’s  employment  and  subsequent 
disposal.  The  expected  net  cash  flows  have  been  discounted  to  their  present  values  in  determining 
recoverable amounts. 
 
Subsequent  costs  are  included  in  the  asset’s  carrying  amount  or  recognised  as  a  separate  asset,  as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to 
the  Group and  the  cost of the  item  can be  measured  reliably.  All other  repairs and  maintenance are 
charged to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income during the financial period 
in which they are incurred. 
 
Depreciation 
The  depreciable  amount  of  all  fixed  assets  including  building  and  capitalised  lease  assets,  but 
excluding freehold land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives to the consolidated 
Group  commencing  from  the  time  the  asset  is  held  ready  for  use.  Leasehold  improvements  are 
depreciated over the shorter of either the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful lives of 
the improvements. 
 
Class of Fixed Asset 
 
Plant and equipment   
 
The  assets’  residual  values  and  useful  lives  are  reviewed,  and  adjusted  if  appropriate,  at  each 
statement of financial position date. 
 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying 
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 
 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These 
gains and losses are included in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. When 
revalued  assets  are  sold,  amounts  included  in  the  revaluation  reserve  relating  to  that  asset  are 
transferred to retained earnings.
Depreciation Rate
15.00 - 33.33%
Exploration and Development Expenditure
(e) 
 
Exploration,  evaluation  and  development  expenditure  incurred  is  accumulated  in  respect  of  each 
identifiable  area  of  interest.  These  costs  are  only  carried  forward  where  right  of  tenure  of  the  area  of 
interest  is  current  and  to  the  extent  that  they  are  expected  to  be  recouped  through  the  successful 
development  of  the  area  or  where  activities  in  the  area  have  not  yet  reached  a  stage  that  permits 
reasonable  assessment  of  the  existence  of  economically  recoverable  reserves.  A  regular  review  is 
undertaken  of  each  area  of  interest  to  determine  the  appropriateness  of  continuing  to  carry  forward 
costs in relation to that area of interest. Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are

written off in full against profit in the year in which the decision to abandon the area is made. 
 
Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area 
of interest are demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are 
first  tested  for  impairment  and  then  reclassified  from  Intangible  assets  to  mining  property  and 
development assets within property, plant and equipment.  Should exploration be successful and result 
in  a  project,  costs  of  site  restoration  are  provided  over  the  life  of  the  facility  from  when  exploration 
commences and  are  included in the  costs of that stage. Site  restoration costs include  the  dismantling 
and  removal  of  mining  plant, equipment and  building  structures, waste  removal, and  rehabilitation of 
the  site  in  accordance  with  clauses  of  the  mining  permits.  Such  costs  have  been  determined  using 
estimates of future costs, current legal requirements and technology. 
 
Any  changes  in  the  estimates  for  the  costs  are  accounted  on  a  prospective  basis.  In  determining  the 
costs  of  site  restoration,  there  is  uncertainty  regarding  the  nature  and  extent  of the  restoration  due  to 
community  expectations  and  future  legislation.  Accordingly  the  costs  have  been  determined  on  the 
basis that the restoration will be completed within one year of abandoning the site.

Recognition and Initial Measurement 
Financial  instruments,  incorporating  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities,  are  recognised  when  the 
Company  becomes  a  party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of  the  instrument.  Trade  date  accounting  is 
adopted  for  financial  assets  that  are  delivered  within  timeframes  established  by  marketplace 
convention. 
 
Financial  instruments  are  initially  measured  at  fair  value  plus  transactions  costs  where  the  instrument  is 
not classified as at fair value through profit or loss. Transaction costs related to instruments classified as 
at fair value through profit or loss are expensed to profit and loss immediately. Financial instruments are 
classified and measured as set out below.
Financial Instruments
Derecognition 
Financial  assets  are  derecognised  where  the  contractual  rights  to  receipt  of  cash  flows  expires  or  the 
asset is transferred to another party whereby the  Company is no longer  has any significant continuing 
involvement  in  the  risks  and  benefits  associated  with  the  asset.  Financial  liabilities  are  derecognised 
where  the related  obligations are  either  discharged, cancelled  or  expire.  The  difference  between the 
carrying value of the financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the fair value of 
consideration paid, including the transfer of non-cash assets or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit 
and loss.  
 
Classification and Subsequent Measurement
(i)  Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit and loss when they are held for trading for 
the purpose of short term profit taking, where they are derivatives not held for hedging purposes, or 
designated as such to avoid an accounting mismatch or to enable performance evaluation where 
a  group  of  financial  assets  is  managed  by  key  management  personnel  on  a  fair  value  basis  in 
accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy. Realised and unrealised 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the profit and loss in the period in 
which they arise.

(ii)  Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that 
are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly 
attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
(iii)   Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale  financial  assets  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  that  are  either  designated  as 
such or that are not classified in any of the other categories.
The Group also has investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market but that 
are  also  classified  as  available  for  sale  financial  assets  and  stated  at  fair  value  (because  the 
directors consider that fair value can be reliably measured). Gains and losses arising from changes 
in  fair  value  are  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in  the  investments 
revaluation reserve, with the exception of impairment losses, interest calculated using the effective 
interest method, and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, which are recognised 
in profit or loss.
(iv)  Financial Liabilities
Non-derivative  financial  liabilities  (excluding  financial  guarantees)  are  subsequently  measured  at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Fair value
Fair  value  is  determined  based  on  current  bid  prices  for  all  quoted  investments.  Valuation  techniques 
are  applied  to  determine  the  fair  value  for  all  unlisted  securities,  including  recent  arm’s  length 
transactions, reference to similar instruments and option pricing models.  
 
Impairment  
At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  assesses  whether  there  is  objective  evidence  that  a  financial 
instrument  has  been  impaired.  In  the  case  of  available-for-sale  financial  instruments,  a  significant  or 
prolonged decline in the value of the instrument is considered to determine whether an impairment has 
arisen.  Impairment  losses  are  recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other    comprehensive 
income. 
 
Assets carried at amortised cost 
For  loans  and  receivables,  the  amount  of  the  loss  is  measured  as  the  difference  between  the  asset’s 
carrying  amount  and  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows  (excluding  future  credit  losses 
that  have  not  been  incurred)  discounted  at  the  financial  asset’s  original  effective  interest  rate.  The 
carrying  amount of the  asset is reduced  and  the  amount of the  loss is recognised in profit or  loss. If a 
loan  or  held-to-maturity  investment  has  a  variable  interest  rate,  the  discount  rate  for  measuring  any 
impairment  loss  is  the  current  effective  interest  rate  determined  under  the  contract.  As  a  practical 
expedient,  the  Group  may  measure  impairment  on  the  basis  of  an  instrument’s  fair  value  using  an 
observable market price. 
 
If,  in  a  subsequent  period,  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  decreases  and  the  decrease  can  be 
related  objectively  to  an  event  occurring  after  the  impairment  was  recognised  (such  as  an 
improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is 
recognised in profit or loss.

Assets classified as available-for-sale 
If there is objective evidence of impairment for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – 
measured  as  the  difference  between  the  acquisition  cost  and  the  current  fair  value,  less  any 
impairment  loss  on  that  financial  asset  previously  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  –  is  removed  from  equity 
and recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment losses on equity instruments that were recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through 
profit or loss in a subsequent period.
If  the  fair  value  of  a  debt  instrument  classified  as  available-for-sale  increases  in  a  subsequent  period 
and  the  increase  can  be  objectively  related  to  an  event  occurring  after  the  impairment  loss  was 
recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Impairment of Assets
(g)  Derivatives  
 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is entered into and 
are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain 
or  loss  is  recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income  immediately 
unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of 
the  recognition  in  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income  depends  on  the 
nature of the hedge relationship.  
 
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset; a derivative with a negative fair 
value  is  recognised  as  a  financial  liability.  A  derivative  is  presented  as  a  non-current  asset  or  a  non-
current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected 
to be  realised or  settled within 12  months. Other  derivatives are  presented  as current  assets or  current 
liabilities. 
 
(h) 
 
The  Group  reviews  non-financial  assets,  other  than  deferred  tax  assets,  at  each  reporting  date  to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  If any such indication exists, then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or 
that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time. 
 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair 
value less costs to sell.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be 
tested  individually  are  grouped  together  into  the  smallest  group  of  assets  that  generates  cash  inflows 
from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets 
(the  “cash-generating  unit”  or  “CGU”).  An  impairment  loss  is  recognised  if  the  carrying  amount  of  an 
asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.  Impairment losses are recognised in profit 
or  loss.    Impairment  losses  recognised  in  respect  of  CGUs  are  allocated  first  to  reduce  the  carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the  units, and  then to reduce  the  carrying  amounts of the  other 
assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.

(h) 
 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.  In respect of other  assets, impairment losses 
recognised  in  prior  periods  are  assessed  at  each  reporting  date  for  any  indications  that  the  loss  has 
decreased  or  no  longer  exists.    An  impairment  loss  is  reversed  if  there  has  been  a  change  in  the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent 
that  the  asset’s  carrying  amount  does  not  exceed  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
 
(i) 
 
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  cash  on  hand,  deposits  held  at  call  with  banks,  other  short-term 
highly liquid investments, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within short-term borrowings in 
current liabilities on the statement of financial position. 
 
(j) 
 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon the delivery of goods to customers. 
 
Interest revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and 
the  amount  of  revenue  can  be  measured  reliably.    Interest  revenue  is  accrued  on  a  timely  basis,  by 
reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. 
 
Dividend  revenue  is recognised when the right to receive  a dividend  has been established. Dividends 
received  from  associates  and  joint  venture  entities  are  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  the  equity 
method of accounting. 
 
Revenue from the rendering of a service is recognised  by reference to the stage of completion of the 
contract. All revenue is stated net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST). 
 
(k)  Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of 
GST  incurred  is  not  recoverable  from  the  Australian  Tax  Office.  In  these  circumstances  the  GST  is 
recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense.  
 
Receivables and payables in the statement of financial position are shown inclusive of GST. 
 
Cash  flows  are  presented  in  the  statement  of  cash  flows  on  a  gross  basis,  except  for  the  GST 
component of investing and financing activities, which are disclosed as operating cash flows. 
 
(l) 
 
Liabilities are recognized for amounts to be paid in the future for goods or services received, whether or 
not billed to the Consolidated Group. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days.  
The carrying amounts of trade and other payables are assumed to be the same as their fair values due 
to their short-term nature. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is 
not due within 12 months after the reporting period. They are recognised initially at their fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

(m)  Share based payments 
 
Share based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the Company’s Employee  Option 
plan.  
 
The  fair  value  of  options  granted  under  the  Company’s  Employee  Option  Plan  is  recognized  as  an 
employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant 
date and recognized over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to 
the options.  
 
The  fair  value  at  grant  date  is  independently  determined  using  an  appropriate  option  pricing  model 
that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the vesting and performance criteria, 
the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected volatility of the underlying share, the 
expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate for the term of the option.
Earnings per share
The  fair  value  of  the  options  granted  excludes  the  impact  of  any  non-market  vesting  conditions  (for 
example,  profitability  and  sales  growth  targets).  Non-market  vesting  conditions  are  included  in 
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to  vest. At each balance sheet date, the 
Company revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest. The employee benefit 
expense  recognised  each  period  takes  into  account  the  most  recent  estimate.  Upon  the  exercise  of 
options,  the  balance  of  the  share-based  payments  reserve  relating  to  those  options  is  transferred  to 
share capital.  
 
(n) 
 
Basic  earnings  per  share  (EPS)  is  calculated  as  net  profit/loss  attributable  to  members,  adjusted  to 
exclude costs of servicing equity (other than dividends) and preference share dividends, divided by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.  
 
Diluted earnings per share  adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to 
take  into  account  the  after  income  tax  effect  of  interest  and  other  financing  costs  associated  with 
dilutive potential ordinary shares, and the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that 
would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. 
 
(o) 
 
The  individual  financial  statements  of  each  group  entity  are  presented  in  the  currency  of  the  primary 
economic  environment  in  which  the  entity  operates  (its  functional  currency).  For  the  purpose  of  the 
consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group entity are expressed 
in  Australian  dollars  (‘$’),  which  is  the  functional  currency  of  the  company  and  the  presentation 
currency  for  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  In  preparing  the  financial  statements  of  the 
individual  entities,  transactions  in  currencies  other  than  the  entity’s  functional  currency  (foreign 
currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the 
end  of  each  reporting  period,  monetary  items  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are  retranslated  at 
the  rates  prevailing  at  that  date.  Non-monetary  items  carried  at  fair  value  that  are  denominated  in 
foreign  currencies  are  retranslated  at  the  rates  prevailing  at  the  date  when  the  fair  value  was 
determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated. 
 
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

Recoverability of the carrying amount of exploration assets is dependent on the successful exploration 
and sale of natural gas. Capitalised costs amounting to $nil (2015: $3,735) have been included in cash 
flows from investing activities in the statement of cash flows. Receipts for the sale of capitalised items of 
$62,585  (2015:  nil)  have  been  included  in  cash  flows  from  investing  activities  in  the  statement  of  cash 
flows.
The Consolidated Group has current commitments for its exploration permits of $5,150,000 over the next 
12  months.  To  assist  in  meeting  these  commitments,  the  Group  is  continually  seeking  and  reviewing 
potential sources of both equity and debt funding. Advent is currently in negotiations with a number of 
parties on the terms  of investment and  management has confidence  that a suitable  outcome  will be 
achieved  however  there  is  no  certainty  at this  stage  that those  discussions  will  result in  further  funding 
being made available. 
 
In  relation  to  the  Group’s  exploration  commitments  (which  include  Asset  Energy  Pty  Ltd  completing 
200km  of  2D  seismic  and  geotechnical  studies  within  the  PEP  11  area  by  12  August  2016),  Advent’s 
wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Asset  Energy  Pty  Ltd,  lodged  an  application  in  respect  of  Petroleum 
Exploration Permit 11 (“PEP11”) with the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator (“NOPTA”) prior 
to 30 June 2016 to vary a condition of PEP11, suspend the years 2 and 3 work commitments and request 
a subsequent extension of the PEP11 permit term.   NOPTA is currently assessing the application.   
 
Asset Energy Pty Ltd has invested over $25 million in the PEP11 title in recent history, and, along with its 
JV partner Bounty Oil and Gas NL, is committed to continuing to explore for and ultimately exploit any 
petroleum accumulations which may be identified in this title area.
32
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 
MEC Resources Ltd and its controlled subsidiaries
In addition to the 2D seismic commitment, Advent is committed to drill an exploration well and perform 
a  seismic  survey  by  the  end  of  March  2017  for  EP  386.  These  2  commitments  comprise  the  significant 
balance of $4,797,500. 
The application to vary a condition of the title and suspend the years 2 and 3 work commitments was 
prepared  following  discussions  with  NOPTA,  however  a  decision  has  not  been  received  by  the 
Company from NOPTA. 
 
The  above  conditions  indicate  the  uncertainty  that  may  affect  the  ability  of  the  Group  to  realise  the 
carrying value of the exploration assets in the ordinary course of business.

(a)
Financial Risk Management 
 
The  Group’s  financial  instruments  consist  mainly  of  deposits  with  banks,  short-term  investments, 
investments held for trading, accounts receivable and payable, and loans to and from  related 
parties.    The  main  purpose  of  non-derivative  financial  instruments  is  to  raise  finance  for  group 
operations policies.
i. Financial Risk Exposures and Management 
The  main  risks  the  Group  is  exposed  to  through  its  financial  instruments  are  interest  rate  risk, 
liquidity risk, credit risk and equity price risk.    
 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is managed with a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt. 
 
Liquidity risk 
The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast cash flows. 
 
Credit risk
39
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 
MEC Resources Ltd and its controlled subsidiaries
The maximum exposure  to credit risk, excluding the value  of any collateral or  other security, at 
balance  date  to  recognised  financial  assets,  is  the  carrying  amount,  net  of  any  provisions  for  
impairment of those assets, as disclosed in the  statement of financial position and notes to the 
financial statements. 
 
Credit risk  for  derivative  financial instruments arises from  the  potential failure  by counter-parties 
to the contract to meet their obligations.
loss
Equity Price Risk 
The  Group  is  exposed  to  equity  price  risks  arising  from  equity  investments.  The  performance  of 
equity  investments  are  reviewed  biannually  to  market.  The  Group  holds  a  diversified  portfolio 
with investments in biotech and oil & gas exploration to manage this risk. 
 
Equity Price Sensitivity Analysis 
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to equity price risks 
at the end of the reporting period. 
 
If equity prices had been 5% higher/lower: 
Net 
for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  would  decrease/increase  $5,028  (2015:

ii. Fair Values 
The fair values of: 
 


Term  receivables  are  determined  by  discounting  the  cash  flows,  at  the  market  interest 
rates of similar securities, to their present value. 
Listed  investments  have  been  valued  at  the  quoted  market  bid  price  at balance  date.  
For  unlisted  investments  where  there  is  no  organised  financial  market,  the  net  fair  value 
has been based on a reasonable estimation based on valuation techniques that are not 
based on observable market data.
  Other loans and amounts due are determined by discounting the cash flows, at market
interest rates of similar borrowings to their present value.
  Other assets and liabilities approximate their carrying value. 
 
No  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  readily  traded  on  organised  markets  in 
standardised form other than listed investments.

iv. Liquidity risk 
 The  Group  manages  liquidity  risk  by  maintaining  adequate  reserves  and  banking  facilities,  by 
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of 
financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity  is  the  risk  that  the  company  will  encounter  difficulty  in  meeting  the  obligations 
 associated  with  its  financial  liabilities  that  are  settled  by  delivering  cash  or  another  financial 
 asset.

Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent 
to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the 
fair value is observable. 

Level  1  fair  value  measurements  are  those  derived  from  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level  2  fair  value  measurements  are  those  derived  from  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices 
included  within  Level  1  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability,  either  directly  (i.e.  as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include 
inputs  for  the  asset  or  liability  that  are  not  based  on  observable  market  data 
(unobservable inputs).

The  company  received  through  an  in  specie  distribution  an  investment  in  Molecular  Discovery 
Systems  Ltd  in  January  2010.  The  investment  in  Molecular  Discovery  Systems  Ltd  was  an  arm’s 
length transaction.  
 
The fair value of the Group’s investment in MDSystems as at 30 June 2016 has been arrived at on 
the  basis  of  a  valuation  performed  at  30  June  2015  by  an  independent  expert  valuer  to  the 
company  and  reassessed  by  management  at  30  June  2016.  The  valuer  holds  the  appropriate 
qualifications and recent experience in the valuation of investments of this nature. The fair  value 
was  determined  using  the  relative  valuation  methodology.  The  approach  considers  the  value  of 
broadly comparable listed entities which are at a similar stage of biotechnology product life cycle 
to  MDSystems.  The  valuation  supported  the  carrying  value  of  MEC’s  AFS  investment  in  the 
company.
22.  Operating Segment
Identification of reportable segments
The  Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that  are  reviewed 
and  used  by  the  Managing  Director  and  his  management  team  (the  chief  operating  decision 
makers) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources.
45
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 
MEC Resources Ltd and its controlled subsidiaries
22.  Operating Segment (continued)
The operating segments are identified by management based on their investment in exploration 
companies.  Financial information of these investments is reported to the managing director and 
his  management  team  on  at  least  a  monthly  basis.  Currently,  management’s  focus  is  on  the 
exploration program  of  Advent Energy project’s  PEP 11, EP 325  and  EP 386,  which is disclosed in 
Note 12. 
 
The  Group  operates  predominantly  in  one  industry,  namely  investments  in  energy  and  mineral 
resources. These activities are predominantly in Australia.
Accounting policies and inter-segment transactions
The  accounting  policies  used  by  the  Group  in  reporting  segments  are  the  same  as  those 
contained in note 1 to the accounts and in the prior period.
23.  Events after the Balance Sheet Date
There have not been any matters or circumstances that have arisen since the end of the financial 
year, that have significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations of the company,

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
To the members of MEC Resources Limited
Report on the Financial Report
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  financial  report  of  MEC  Resources  Limited  (“the  company”),  which 
comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of 
profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income,  the  consolidated  statement  of  changes  in  equity  and  the 
consolidated  statement  of  cash  flow  for  the  year  then  ended,  notes  comprising  a  summary  of  significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration, of the Group comprising 
the company and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the financial year.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and 
fair  view  in  accordance  with  Australian Accounting  Standards  and  the Corporations Act 2001  and  for  such 
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that 
gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In  Note  1,  the  directors  also  state,  in  accordance  with  Accounting  Standard  AASB  101:  Presentation  of 
Financial  Statements,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  comply  with  International  Financial  Reporting 
Standards.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical 
requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  report,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk 
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Group’s preparation of the financial report 
that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  company’s  and  its  controlled 
 
entities’ internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and 
the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  made  by  the  directors,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall 
presentation of the financial report.
Our audit did not involve an analysis of the prudence of business decisions made by directors or management.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion. 
Independence  
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 
2001.

1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX.
Listing Rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an ASX Listing to include in its annual report either a corporate 
governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the URL of the page on its website where such a statement is located. The 
corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate 
Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has not followed a recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate 
governance statement must separately identify that recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not 
following the recommendation and what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period.
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its annual report, it must 
lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX. The corporate governance 
statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the purposes of rule 4.10.3.
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 which discloses the 
extent to which an entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during a particular reporting period.
