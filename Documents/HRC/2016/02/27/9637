<p> <i>The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights</i>, 
<i> Recalling </i>that, in its decision 2004/123 of 21 April 2004, the Commission on 
Human Rights, &#8220;taking note of Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights resolution 2003/25 of 14 August 2003, decided, without a vote, to approve the 
decision of the Sub-Commission to appoint Mr. Emmanuel Decaux special rapporteur to conduct 
a detailed study of the universal implementation of international human rights treaties&#8221;, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful </i>of General Assembly resolution 60/149 of 16 December 2005, in which the 
General Assembly stressed that &#8220;the international covenants on human rights constitute the first 
all-embracing and legally binding international treaties in the field of human rights and, together 
with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, form the core of the International Bill of 
Human Rights&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> that, in the same resolution, the General Assembly invited the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights &#8220;to intensify systematic efforts to encourage States to 
become parties to the international covenants on human rights and, through the programme of 
advisory services in the field of human rights, to assist such States, at their request, in ratifying 
or acceding to the covenants and to the optional protocols to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights with a view to achieving universal adherence&#8221;, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Sub-Commission resolution 2002/31 of 15 August 2002, entitled &#8220;Tenth 
anniversary of the World Conference on Human Rights&#8221;, as well as its resolutions 2003/35 
of 14 August 2003, 2004/26 of 12 August 2004 and 2005/4 of 8 August 2005, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the work done by the special rapporteur following the working paper

page 14 
 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Notes</i> that many States, including members of the Human Rights Council, have 
undertaken to ratify new instruments and welcomes this trend, which it hopes will be encouraged 
even more systematically; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
to disseminate the final report widely, including by officially transmitting it to the treaty bodies 
and the International Law Commission; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recommends</i> that the Human Rights Council should take into consideration the 
recommendations in the final report in the light of the tables contained in the addendum to the 
report (A/HRC/Sub.1/58/5/Add.1), particularly with regard to the need to ensure that the status 
of the international human rights instruments is periodically and systematically monitored under 
the Council&#8217;s universal periodic review procedure; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recommends</i> that technical assistance should be expanded, both within the 
United Nations and in the specialized agencies and regional organizations, so as to facilitate the 
universal ratification and effective implementation of the international human rights instruments, 
and that thought should be given to convening a seminar for this purpose with support from 
States and non-governmental organizations, as well as from the national human rights 
institutions that are directly concerned, in order to encourage dialogue with States on the 
ratification of universal treaties; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Recommends</i> that the agenda should include a sub-item on the universal 
implementation of international human rights instruments and that collective discussions on 
the nature and scope of international human rights law should continue to be held within the 
Sub-Commission or the future expert advice mechanism; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Expresses the desire</i> that the Sub-Commission or the future expert advice 
mechanism should be able to proceed with the questionnaire drawn up by the special 
rapporteur and should be in a position, with the help of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and with the cooperation of national human rights 
institutions, to produce a compilation of national legal precedents regarding the implementation 
of the international human rights instruments; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Recommends</i> that a seminar should be organized on best practices, including the 
plans and programmes of action drawn up by States at the national level, and encourages further 
reflection on the legal and other obstacles to the universal implementation of the international 
human rights instruments.

rights, as stressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and should continue to attract 
the attention of the international community, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that, through their own national legal and judicial systems, States must 
provide appropriate civil, criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> <i>also</i> that international tribunals and national judicial systems can work in a 
complementary manner to provide appropriate remedies for violations of human rights,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the numerous international standards in the field of the administration of 
justice, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing </i>that the right to access to justice as contained in applicable international 
human rights instruments forms an important basis for strengthening the rule of law through the 
administration of justice, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> of the importance of ensuring respect for the rule of law and human rights in the 
administration of justice as a crucial contribution to ensuring peace and justice and ending 
impunity, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the recommendation of the World Conference on Human Rights, held at 
Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993, that a comprehensive programme should be established within 
the United Nations with a view to helping States in the task of building and strengthening 
adequate national structures that have a direct impact on the overall observance of human rights 
and the maintenance of the rule of law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the United Nations Millennium Declaration of 8 September 2000 which, 
inter alia, called upon States to strengthen respect for the rule of law in international as well as in 
national affairs, to consider signing and ratifying the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court and to ensure implementation, by States parties, of treaties in areas such as international 
humanitarian law and human rights law,

<p> 5.<i> Reaffirms</i> the importance of combating impunity as a fundamental obstacle to the 
observance of human rights and recalls Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/35 of 
19 April 2005 by which it adopted the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy 
and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious 
Violations of International Humanitarian Law, and welcomes the efforts of States and the 
United Nations international criminal tribunals to work in a complementary manner to ensure 
that violations of human rights do not go unpunished; 
</p>
<p> 6.<i> Expresses</i> its conviction that the issue of amnesty as a means of settling conflicts 
remains a continuing concern because of the possibility that perpetrators of serious human rights 
will escape accountability for their actions and also notes the need for further study in this area;  
</p>
<p> 7.<i> Emphasizes</i> the importance of the accountability of United Nations staff in peace 
support operations and underlines the importance of further study in this area; 
</p>
<p> 8.<i> Reaffirms </i>the importance of reaching a better understanding through further study 
and debate of the relationship between human rights law and international humanitarian law, 
including issues relating to the loss by civilians of their right to protection during conflicts and 
the circumstances in which a party can open fire under international humanitarian law and 
human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 9.<i> Emphasizes</i> the importance and urgency of national and international efforts to 
restore justice and the rule of law in conflict and post-conflict situations and, where relevant, in 
the context of the transitional process, to ensure accountability and justice, to promote and 
achieve reconciliation and to restore confidence in the institutions of the State, in accordance 
with international human rights standards and the principle of non-discrimination; 
</p>
<p> 10.<i> Recalls</i> Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/70 of 20 April 2005 on 
human rights and transitional justice and the report of the Secretary-General on the rule of law 
and transitional justice in conflict and post-conflict societies (S/2004/616), and notes with 
interest the study on the right to the truth and the study on human rights and transitional justice 
activities undertaken by the human rights components of the United Nations system, 
(E/CN.4/2006/93) both by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for

integral part of all fundamental human rights, reaffirmed that the human person was the central 
subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of 
economic, social and cultural rights at the national, regional and international levels, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development 
requires effective development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic 
relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level,

and at the impact of their activities and working methods on human rights,

Enterprises and Social Policy adopted by the Governing Body of the International Labour 
Organization in November 1977,

<p><i>Recognizing </i>that the activities of the various United Nations organizations should be 
closely interrelated and that it is necessary to draw on all the efforts made in the various 
disciplines relating to the human person in order to promote all human rights effectively, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling in particular </i>its previous resolutions on the subject, the most recent being 
resolution 2005/6 of 8 August 2005, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the work done by the sessional working group on the effects of the working 
methods and activities of transnational corporations on the enjoyment of human rights and by the

<p><b>2006/9. Implementation of existing human rights norms and standards 
in the context of the fight against extreme poverty 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights</i>,  <i>Recalling</i> that, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the advent of a world in 
which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want 
was proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people, 
</p>
<p> <i>Building</i> on the efforts relating to human rights and extreme poverty accomplished by the 
United Nations since 1987, and in particular the final report (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1995/13) of the 
Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, 
Mr. Despouy, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the resolutions of the General Assembly on the issue, particularly 
resolution 59/186 of 20 December 2004, which reaffirmed (a) that extreme poverty persists in 
all countries of the world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, (b) that 
extreme poverty and exclusion from society constitute a violation of human dignity and that 
urgent national and international action is therefore required to eliminate them, (c) that it is 
essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the decision-making process 
in the societies in which they live, in the promotion of human rights and in efforts to combat 
extreme poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that situations of extreme poverty, resulting from a combination of factors of 
insecurity and affecting several aspects of people&#8217;s lives in a lasting manner, compromise the 
chances of people living in such situations to reassume their responsibilities and regain their 
rights in the foreseeable future, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> the Millennium Declaration, in which heads of State and government 
solemnly declared:  &#8220;We will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from 
the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them 
are currently subjected&#8221;, </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering also </i>the 2005 World Summit Outcome, in which heads of State and 
government stressed &#8220;the right of people to live in freedom and dignity, free from poverty and 
despair&#8221;, and recognized that &#8220;all individuals, in particular vulnerable people, are entitled to 
freedom from fear and freedom from want, with an equal opportunity to enjoy all their rights and 
fully develop their human potential&#8221;, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/16 of 14 April 2005, in 
which the Commission expressed deep concern that extreme poverty persists in all countries of 
the world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and reaffirmed that extreme 
poverty and exclusion from society constitute a violation of human dignity and that it is essential 
for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the decision-making process in the 
societies in which they live and in the realization of human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that, in resolution 2005/16, the Commission also recalled that a better 
understanding is needed of what is endured by people living in poverty, including women 
and children, and that thought must be given to the subject, drawing on the experience and 
ideas communicated by the poorest themselves and by those committed to working alongside 
them, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of the reports of the independent experts on the question of human rights and 
extreme poverty, Ms. Lizin and Mr. Sengupta (in particular E/CN.4/2004/43, E/CN.4/2005/49 
and E/CN.4/2006/43), especially the analysis carried out by Mr. Sengupta of social exclusion as 
a key and specific element of extreme poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of Commission resolution 2001/31 of 23 April 2001, in which the 
Commission requested the Sub-Commission to consider the need to develop guiding principles 
on the implementation of existing human rights norms and standards in the context of the fight 
against extreme poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> its own resolution 2001/8 of 15 August 2001, in which it entrusted a group 
of experts from the Sub-Commission with the task of preparing a joint working paper, 
without financial implications, on the need to develop, on the basis of the various relevant 
international instruments, the ongoing work in other forums, the conclusions and 
recommendations of the Expert Seminar on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty and any other 
relevant inputs, in particular those received from Governments, guiding principles on the 
implementation of existing human rights norms and standards in the context of the fight against 
extreme poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Also recalling</i> its own resolution 2005/9 of 8 August 2005, in which it requested the 
ad hoc group of experts to submit their final report to it at its fifty-eighth session, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with interest</i> the final report of Mr. Jos&#233; Bengoa, coordinator of the ad hoc group 
of experts, on the implementation of existing human rights norms and standards in the context of 
the fight against extreme poverty (A/HRC/Sub.1/58/16), 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the draft guiding principles annexed to this resolution, in particular 
insofar as the guiding principles: </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 29 
 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Are addressed to all the countries of the world and are based on the universality, 
indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Are directed towards the effective realization of all human rights for all human 
beings, including those suffering from the greatest poverty and the greatest exclusion, on the 
basis of close cooperation with the latter; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Make a significant contribution to the realization of the right to development in all 
countries and to the implementation of the Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Uphold an approach which links respect for human rights and the adoption of 
practical measures which offer the poor new opportunities; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Thanks</i> all those who contributed to the drafting of the guiding principles, in 
particular during the regional seminars held in Bangkok, Pierrelaye, France, Pune, India and 
Sao Paulo, Brazil, as well as the sessions of the Social Forum, and especially the persons in 
situations of extreme poverty, with the hope that these principles will encourage them in their 
daily efforts to preserve their dignity and regain their rights, and will foster the changes to which 
those persons legitimately aspire;

guiding principles annexed to this resolution;

page 30 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> the relevant provisions of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993, and of the Copenhagen 
Declaration on Social Development and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social 
Development, adopted by the World Summit on 12 March 1995, resolution 46/121 adopted by 
the General Assembly on 17 December 1991 and the Assembly&#8217;s subsequent resolutions on the 
issue, the Millennium Declaration, adopted by the General Assembly on 8 September 2000, and 
the development objectives set out in the Declaration, whereby States solemnly undertook to do 
their utmost to eliminate poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Also considering</i> the 2005 World Summit Outcome, in which heads of State stressed &#8220;the 
right of people to live in freedom and dignity, free from poverty and despair&#8221;, and recognized 
that &#8220;all individuals, in particular vulnerable people, are entitled to freedom from fear and 
freedom from want, with an equal opportunity to enjoy all their rights and fully develop their 
human potential&#8221;, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that, in its resolution 54/232 of 22 December 1999 and several subsequent 
resolutions on the matter, the General Assembly expressed its deep concern that women and 
children for the most part constitute the group most affected by the phenomenon of extreme 
poverty, and that, in its resolution 59/186 of 20 December 2004, the Assembly expressed deep 
concern that extreme poverty persists in all countries of the world, regardless of their economic, 
social and cultural situation, 
</p>
<p> <i>Also recalling</i> that, since adopting its resolution 47/134 on 18 December 1992, the 
General Assembly has repeatedly reaffirmed that extreme poverty and exclusion from society 
constitute a violation of human dignity, and stressed the need for a complete and in-depth study 
of the phenomenon of extreme poverty, based on the experience and ideas of the poorest sectors 
of the population, a task that has been accomplished, in particular, by the Sub-Commission&#8217;s 
ad hoc group of experts, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that those living in poverty, and particularly in extreme poverty, are the first 
to act to change their situation and that of their families, and that their efforts should be 
identified and supported as a matter of priority, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that, as the General Assembly has emphasized, the eradication of extreme 
poverty constitutes a major challenge in the process of globalization, which can be met only by 
means of a coordinated policy stemming from continuous international cooperation and decisive 
action at the national level, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i>, after the General Assembly, that widespread absolute poverty inhibits the 
full and effective enjoyment of human rights and renders democracy and popular participation 
fragile, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that the inherent dignity of all the members of the human family and their 
equal and inalienable rights demand that priority attention should be given to those suffering 
most from poverty and exclusion, </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 31 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that extreme poverty persists throughout the world, that it constitutes a 
negation of human rights and might, in some situations, threaten the right to life, and that the 
international community must continue to regard its immediate alleviation and eventual 
elimination as a major priority, 
 <i>Taking into account</i> the relevant decisions and resolutions of the Commission on Human 
Rights, which has repeatedly condemned the situation of poverty in the world and emphasized 
that it represents a negation of the fundamental rights of the individual, as well as the declaration 
on poverty and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted by 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 4 May 2001, and recalling that, in 
that context, the Commission, in its resolution 2001/31 of 23 April 2001 and its other resolutions 
on the matter, requested the Sub-Commission, with the help of an ad hoc group of experts, to 
draw up guiding principles on the implementation of human rights norms and standards in the 
context of the fight against extreme poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Adopts </i>the following guiding principles, which it submits to the Human Rights Council 
for consideration, expressing the hope that all the interested parties will engage in an in-depth 
discussion with a view to their adoption. 
</p>
<p><b>Human rights and extreme poverty:  the rights of the poor 
</b></p>
<p>1. Poverty is a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of 
resources, capabilities, choices, security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate 
standard of living and other civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>2. Extreme poverty and exclusion from society constitute a violation of human dignity; 
consequently, the inclusion in national and international plans of measures to eliminate them is a 
priority. 
</p>
<p>3. Persons living in extreme poverty are fully entitled to demand that policies and 
programmes at the national and international level aimed at the eradication of extreme poverty 
should be drawn up and effectively implemented in accordance with the principles of human 
rights and the present guiding principles. 
</p>
<p>4. Persons living in extreme poverty are entitled to the full enjoyment of all human rights, 
including the right to participate in the adoption of decisions which concern them, and to 
contribute to the well-being of their families, their communities and humankind. 
</p>

</b>  Declaration by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on poverty and 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (<i>Official Records of the 
Economic and Social Council, 2002, Supplement No. 2 </i>[E/2002/22-E/C.12/2001/17], annex VII), 
para. 8. </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>5. States, as well as all the organs of society at the local, national, regional and international 
level, have an obligation to take effective action to eliminate extreme poverty; to that end they 
must act in a structured and accountable manner, in partnership with persons living in extreme 
poverty, and must periodically report on their actions at all levels, especially the local and 
national levels, in accordance with applicable legal norms.  At the international level, States must 
account for their actions in the periodic reports they submit to the bodies monitoring compliance 
with treaties, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>6. States, intergovernmental organizations, national and transnational enterprises and 
non-governmental organizations, inter alia, have a responsibility to take into account and fully 
respect human rights, in particular the principles set out in the present document.  Infringements 
of these rights by the above-mentioned entities, whether arising from negligence or from a 
deliberate decision, should be regarded as violations of human rights and their perpetrators 
should be held responsible, with the corresponding legal consequences. 
</p>
<p><b>Section 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Participation by the poor 
</b></p>
<p>7. Persons living in extreme poverty have the right to participate in all activities which 
concern them, particularly programmes for the eradication of extreme poverty.  The 
implementation of such policies and programmes without the participation of the persons 
concerned and their associations and organizations constitutes a violation of the right to 
participate in public affairs. 
</p>
<p>8. States should foster and promote participation by the poorest people in the 
decision-making process in the societies in which they live, in the promotion of human rights 
and in efforts to combat extreme poverty.  They should also empower people living in poverty 
and vulnerable groups to organize themselves and to participate in all aspects of political, 
economic and social life, in particular the planning and implementation of policies that affect 
them, thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>9. States should take action in every sphere to combat the feminization of poverty and 
ensure the participation of women in all their anti-poverty programmes.  Every programme or 
piece of legislation aimed at eliminating extreme poverty should seek to take into account the 
different situations of women and men and to rectify inequalities between girls and boys and 
between women and men with regard to the use of resources, access to rights, the exercise of 
responsibilities and support for family life. 
</p>
<p>10. Programmes to combat poverty should be publicly available, and should set specific 
targets and specify indicators to facilitate evaluation of their implementation as well as 
mechanisms for monitoring and accountability.  The State and public and private agencies which 
</p>

 page 33 
 
</p>
<p>implement poverty reduction and eradication policies and programmes should encourage the 
establishment of forums for evaluation and monitoring in which persons living in extreme 
poverty participate. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Discrimination and stigmatization 
</b></p>
<p>11. Discrimination affecting persons living in extreme poverty must be punished as a 
violation of human rights.  The stigmatization of the poor and their associations, groups, 
neighbourhoods or places of residence, and their representation as persons without rights who 
are dangerous, violent and display other negative characteristics, must be regarded as forms of 
discrimination.  Discrimination against the poor based on their image, their dress, their physical 
appearance or any other grounds related to their situation of extreme poverty constitutes a human 
rights violation.  The State, international agencies and other parties concerned have an obligation 
to criticize and combat stigmatization of the poor and to promote a balanced and fair image of 
persons who are in a situation of extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>12. The media and education systems play a key role in the processes of discrimination and 
stigmatization, and hence in efforts to combat those phenomena. 
</p>
<p>13. Public officials, those of international organizations, personnel in humanitarian 
organizations and all those working for the elimination of poverty are expected to maintain 
relations of respect for the dignity and the fundamental rights of persons living in extreme 
poverty, particularly in human relations, in humanitarian services and in project formulation and 
implementation.  The personnel of social welfare schemes have these obligations, and the right 
to freedom from discrimination based on the circumstance of poverty is a right which must be 
guaranteed to the poor. 
</p>
<p><b>Section 2 
</b></p>
<p><b>C.  Indivisibility and interdependence of rights 
</b></p>
<p>14. All persons living in extreme poverty have the right to the enjoyment of all human rights, 
which are indivisible, interdependent and universal.  The exercise of human rights is crucial to 
the elimination of extreme poverty, because the denial of one right has an adverse impact on the 
totality of the rights of the individual.  However, the restoration of a right in isolation is not 
enough to ensure that individuals, their families and their communities will emerge from the 
situation of extreme poverty.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>15. All persons living in extreme poverty have the right to be recognized everywhere as 
persons before the law.  They have the right to participate fully in the life of the community in 
which they live, to have a domicile, to possess an identity document or any other document 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>which constitutes evidence of their citizenship or their legal status, and to enjoy all the civil 
and political rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  They should enjoy full citizenship of the State of which 
they are nationals and have the right to participate without discrimination in the political life of 
that State and to take part in public affairs.  Any denial of civil and political rights to the poor on 
the basis of their circumstances of extreme poverty, whether individual or collective, must be 
regarded as a case of serious discrimination. 
</p>
<p>16. Persons living in extreme poverty have the right to form a family, to support their 
children, to take care of them, to raise them, and to enjoy the fundamental dignity inherent in 
every human being, guaranteeing respect for privacy and family life. 
</p>
<p>17. Governments in particular have a duty to put an end to violence inflicted by State and 
non-State actors on persons living in extreme poverty, particularly women and children, and to 
provide adequate police protection.  The State must draw up education programmes for the 
population in general, and the police forces in particular, in order to promote non-discrimination 
against persons living in poverty.  Persons living in extreme poverty must enjoy the same rights 
as other persons and have access to justice free of discrimination.  Any person responsible for 
an act of violence and discrimination against persons living in conditions of poverty must be 
brought to justice and punished. 
</p><p>18. The State must in particular ensure the protection of vulnerable population groups, 
including the homeless, street children, the disabled and the elderly, who are worst affected by 
extreme poverty.  The State has an obligation to implement effective programmes for these 
particularly vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>19. States will adopt special measures to provide protection to the poor in respect of their 
dignity, their privacy, their integrity, their honour and their reputation.  This protection must be 
effective and provided free of charge on an equal footing with other subjects of law. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Right to food 
</b></p>
<p>20. Every human being has a right to adequate, appropriate, healthy food, and is entitled not 
to be exposed to the risk of hunger or starvation.  The State and the international community are 
duty-bound to accord all human beings, individually or collectively, the right of physical and 
economic access to appropriate food. 
</p>
<p>21. Poor rural inhabitants are entitled, in order to feed themselves, to acquire effective 
ownership of their land and register that ownership in good and due form.  States and the 
international community are duty-bound to uphold peasants&#8217; rights to the ownership of their land 
and to encourage agrarian reforms that will afford access to additional land and will protect and 
demarcate the lands belonging to indigenous population groups and the lands and territory 
belonging to minorities descended from slaves and protect fish resources and small-scale fishing 
communities&#8217; fishing grounds, nomadic herders&#8217; grazing rights, and the hunting rights of those 
who live by hunting. </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 35 
 
</p>
<p>22. In the event of hunger or famine and where welfare assistance is provided in the form of 
food, distributions of food or similar measures, peoples&#8217; dignity must be fully respected, 
organized arrangements being made for distribution that encourage active participation by the 
population groups concerned. 
</p>
<p>23. Corruption, food smuggling, theft of international humanitarian aid, wilful adulteration of 
food intended for the general public, distribution of perished foodstuffs and all other similar 
misconduct must be regarded as criminal behaviour of the gravest order - as a violation of poor 
peoples&#8217; and others&#8217; human rights in particular - and made subject to exemplary punishment. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>24. Persons living in extreme poverty have a right to health, and the State must guarantee the 
appropriate exercise of that right. 
</p>
<p>25. All persons living in hardship have a right to be treated with dignity, respect and 
humanity by health-care systems.  Health-care personnel must be acquainted with the day-to-day 
circumstances of highly underprivileged individuals and families and trained in forging 
partnerships with such people. 
</p>
<p>26. Poor people living in areas of extreme poverty where pandemics, epidemics and 
widespread illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy or typhus occur have a 
right to health and to active involvement in the design and execution of eradication programmes.  
The State is under an obligation to uphold the right to health of the entire population, including 
those living in extreme poverty.  Where situations overwhelm its capacity to respond, the State is 
under an obligation to seek assistance from the international community, and the international 
community must grant such assistance immediately. 
</p>
<p>27. The right to health is closely linked to the right to life.  Those responsible, nationally and 
internationally, for any negligence in the execution of preventive or health-care programmes, or 
for any ill-informed, inappropriate or ill-intentioned planning that results in human deaths, must 
be put on trial and punished. 
</p>
<p>28. Theft, corruption, trafficking, black-marketeering and any other criminal activity 
involving vaccines, medical supplies, surgical or other equipment originally intended as medical 
aid must be severely punished and, depending on the scale of the activity, regarded as a crime of 
the utmost seriousness subject to prosecution and trial before the competent courts.  Victims or 
their legal heirs and successors are entitled to reparation. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Right to drinkable water 
</b></p>
<p>29. Persons living in extreme poverty have a right to drinkable water, and the State is 
duty-bound to provide this service to them free of charge.  In areas of widespread rural poverty, 
the State must provide drinkable water whenever climatic conditions culminate in drought.  If the 
State cannot do so by itself, it is under an obligation to seek the assistance of the international 
community, and the international community is obliged to provide such assistance. </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p>30. The right to drinkable water is directly linked to the right to life.  Negligence, omission or 
planning that results in an absence of water distribution services must be regarded as action 
threatening human life.  Likewise, the destruction of the means of supplying water, the sale of 
water rights and privatization or management of water resources that results in a lack of access to 
drinkable water for groups of the population must be regarded as an encroachment upon this 
right. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Right to housing 
</b></p>
<p>31. Persons living in extreme poverty have the right to dignified housing affording suitable 
protection from the climate, enabling them to have a family life and to develop as individuals in 
dignity and decency. 
</p>
<p>32. All who live in extreme poverty have the right to private, individual, cooperative or 
collective ownership of their housing, furniture and utensils of every kind; in rural areas they 
have the right to collective or individual ownership of their land, housing, tools, animals and 
other daily necessities.  The State is under an obligation to guarantee the poor access to housing 
in a manner that will spur improvements in their living conditions. 
</p>
<p>33. As part of their poverty eradication policies, States should place especial emphasis on 
housing policy and encourage the active involvement of those living in extreme poverty in the 
design, execution, management, administration and evaluation of housing policy.  States 
should be especially attentive to the quality and suitability of any public housing that is built.  
Corruption, poor management of building materials and negligence must be severely punished 
by the judicial system and regarded as a kind of discrimination and a breach of the human rights 
of the poor. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  Right to education and culture 
</b></p>
<p>34. All who live in extreme poverty have a right to education.  They and their children are 
entitled to have access to basic education and schooling at all the levels offered by the 
education system, without being exposed to segregation or discrimination of any kind.  The 
State should most particularly ensure that children living in extreme poverty have access to 
education. 
</p>
<p>35. All who live in extreme poverty have a right of access to culture and the arts.  Special 
programmes affording access to culture, instruction, reading, art and literature and 
resource-management and administration programmes should be set up in collaboration with, 
and with the active involvement of, the poor and their families as means of eradicating hardship.  
Cultural and instructive programmes, whether designed and executed by the State or by private 
entities, should seek to uphold the dignity of the poor, promote awareness of their rights, and 
accord due recognition to their experience. </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 37 
 
</p>
<p><b>J.  Right to work 
</b></p>
<p>36. All who live in extreme poverty have a right to decent, dignified, productive, safe 
and appropriately remunerated employment.  State policy should guarantee their right to 
employment, to labour rights, to appropriate welfare provision and to security systems enabling 
them to cope with unemployment and crises.  Poverty-alleviation policies must take account of 
the right to work as a factor militating against extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>37. On the matter of access to employment, the State and society must strive to abolish any 
form of discrimination based on external impressions, physical appearance, residence, living 
conditions, race, ethnic background, sex or any other consideration stemming from extreme 
poverty.  Discrimination in employment on grounds relating to extreme poverty which are 
unrelated to good performance on the job should be duly penalized. 
</p><p>38. The State should ensure that there are fair labour codes so that wage earners, both 
permanent and, especially, temporary, and their families do not have to live in poverty despite 
going to work.  The State must eradicate child labour, prostitution, forced labour, contemporary 
forms of slavery and other activities in which those living in extreme poverty are often 
constrained to engage. 
</p>
<p><b>K.  Right to justice 
</b>39. All who live in extreme poverty have the same right of access to justice as other citizens.  
The State and the judicial system must take care to uphold equality before the law and ensure the 
administration of justice without discriminating on grounds of physical appearance, residence or 
any other consideration stemming from extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>40. The State and judicial administration must provide free, high-quality legal assistance for 
the protection of people living in extreme poverty.  Judges must explain charges and proceedings 
in a clear, comprehensible manner and, when dealing with individuals who do not speak the 
language officially used in a particular court, must call in specialist translators and interpreters 
free of charge. 
</p>
<p>41. The State should set up educational and public-information programmes to help the poor 
learn about their rights and the legal and judicial proceedings which they are entitled to bring.  
The State and judiciary should also set up training programmes for judges, defence counsel and 
judiciary officials with a view to ensuring that the justice system works for the poor. 
</p>
<p><b>Section 3 
</b></p>
<p><b>L.  State obligations and international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>42. Since human rights are universal, concerted action by the international community is 
required to give effect to them.  International cooperation is, for States, developed countries in 
particular, a duty to which they must devote a significant proportion of their resources. </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 38 
 
</p>
<p>43. International cooperation over basic human rights must be developed with a view to the 
full realization of those rights.  States and the international community are under an obligation to 
act immediately to end situations of widespread poverty, starvation and hardship.  In the case of 
long-standing situations of dire poverty and situations resulting from natural disasters, armed 
conflict, etc. which require States to make appropriate resources available at short notice it is not 
just the State that must take immediate action:  the international community must also set up 
ad hoc programmes.  International bodies at the highest level must decide upon preventive 
measures, provide assistance and set medium- and long-term development objectives for dealing 
with such situations together and effectively. 
</p>
<p>44. International cooperation must be combined with appropriate action in international 
trade, market and investment promotion, weapons dealing and labour-market regulation to 
ensure that such cooperation yields results and does not accentuate the cycle of extreme poverty.  
Cancellation of foreign debt, reduced rates of interest and similar measures should be part of 
States&#8217; international cooperation policies and obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>M. Duties and responsibilities of public and private entities 
in combating poverty 
</b></p>
<p>45. Public and private bodies working to reduce extreme poverty (whether in industrialized 
or in developing countries), provide humanitarian aid or conduct international cooperation or 
development, educational or other plans and programmes are duty-bound to make their 
programmes public, disclose their working methods and objectives as well as their funding, 
and account for their activities.  Their duties and responsibilities must be consistent with the 
international human rights system and these guidelines. 
</p>
<p>46. The staff of public and private international organizations, non-governmental 
organizations and movements and organizations working to eradicate poverty do and must 
display a high level of professionalism and moral rectitude in their conduct, and must base their 
action on the principles of international human rights law and these guidelines.  The duties and 
responsibilities of such staff, whatever their status and including those volunteering their 
services, must be subject to independent supervision and public scrutiny.  Given the 
humanitarian nature of such organizations&#8217; activities (their staff often work without pay), and in 
order to display greater solidarity with the poor and their living conditions, the organizations 
should be held strictly to ethical standards of conduct and any breach of those standards should 
be duly punished. 
</p>
<p>47. The international community must accord due recognition to, back and finance voluntary 
work in support of the poor, especially efforts to combat poverty and establish, nationally, 
regionally and internationally, a climate of solidarity; it must encourage poor people&#8217;s 
organizations and social movements seeking to eradicate poverty with a view to the attainment 
of human rights. 
</p>
<p>48. States and the international community should celebrate on 17 October the International 
Day for the Eradication of Poverty proclaimed by the General Assembly in resolution 47/196 
of 22 December 1992, which affords an opportunity to give due recognition and lend weight to 
this campaign. </p>

Mr. El-Hadji Guiss&#233;, on the realization of the right to drinking water and sanitation 
(E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/25), which contains draft guidelines for the realization of the right to

<p><b>2006/11. The rights of persons belonging to national or  
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights</i>, 
<i> Taking note</i> of the report of the Working Group on Minorities on its twelfth session 
(A/HRC/Sub.1/58/19), 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the increasing participation of minority representatives in sessions of the 
Working Group, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing appreciation</i> for the active participation of the independent expert on 
minority issues at the twelfth session of the Working Group, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> about the continued violations of minority rights in all parts of the world, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Emphasizes </i>the need to ensure adequate consideration of minority rights issues 
within the Human Rights Council and calls for the continuation of the Working Group on 
Minorities or a similar expert body to ensure the provision of specialized advice on minority 
rights issues to the Council, preferably through its subsidiary bodies in the future; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recommends</i> that such a future mechanism be convened intersessionally and for a 
duration of at least five working days, and recommends that the mechanism ensure access to and 
participation by minority representatives from all regions of the world and serve as a forum for

developing countries, in United Nations meetings; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Recommends</i> that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights continue operating the fellowship programme for minorities, as it is an excellent 
tool for building capacity among minority representatives and minority organizations on the

encourages the Office to identify possible ways of further engaging with minority fellows once 
the programme has finished;

<p><b>2006/12. Second International Decade of the World&#8217;s  
Indigenous People 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights</i>, 
 <i>Bearing in mind</i> that one of the purposes of the United Nations, as set forth in the 
Charter, is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an 
economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect 
for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language 
or religion, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 48/163 of 21 December 1993 and 59/174 of 
20 December 2004, in which the Assembly proclaimed, respectively, the International Decade of 
the World&#8217;s Indigenous People and the Second International Decade of the World&#8217;s Indigenous 
People, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> that the General Assembly established as the goal of the Second Decade 
the further strengthening of international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by 
indigenous people, by means of action-oriented programmes and specific projects, increased 
technical assistance and relevant standard-setting activities, </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 44 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking into account</i> that in resolution 59/174 the General Assembly requested the 
Secretary-General to appoint the Under Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs as 
the Coordinator for the Second Decade and to submit a report to the Assembly at its sixtieth 
session on a comprehensive programme of action for the Second Decade, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that the Second Decade and its programme of action should bring about 
positive changes in terms of achieving full respect and implementation of the rights and 
freedoms of indigenous people and a real improvement in their daily lives, since in spite of 
important achievements during the first Decade, the Commission on Human Rights, in its 
resolution 2005/51 of 20 April 2005, expressed its deep concern about the precarious levels of 
economic and social development that indigenous peoples continue to endure in many parts of 
the world and the disparities in their situation in comparison to the overall population and 
reaffirmed the need to recognize, promote and protect more effectively their rights and freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples by the Human Rights Council by its resolution 1/2 of 30 June 2006, one of the main 
objectives of the first Decade, 
 <i>Stressing</i> the importance of consultation and cooperation with indigenous peoples and 
their organizations in planning and implementing the programme of action for the Second 
Decade, as well as of the need to ensure full cooperation and consultation between the 
Coordinator for the Second Decade and other relevant bodies and mechanisms of the 
United Nations system such as the Working Group on Indigenous Populations, as recognized by 
the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 2005/49 of 20 April 2005, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that the Working Group on Indigenous Populations is a most valuable forum 
in which for more than two decades States, indigenous peoples and their organizations and 
leaders, together with numerous United Nations specialized agencies and a large number of 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, have fruitfully interacted annually, thus 
facilitating a growing awareness of international public opinion of the many aspects and the real 
dimension of the difficult situation of indigenous peoples in many parts of the world, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the invitation extended to the Working Group on Indigenous Populations by 
the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 2005/49 to submit to the Coordinator for 
the Second Decade, through the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, a list of activities to be considered for possible inclusion as part of the human rights 
component of the comprehensive programme of action for the Second Decade, and the 
appropriate way in which the Working Group complied with the request at its 
twenty-third session, 
</p>
<p> <i>Having considered</i> the report of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations on its 
twenty-third session (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/26), in particular annex IV, in which the Working 
Group suggested to the Coordinator for the Second Decade a list of activities to be undertaken at 
the international, regional and national levels for possible inclusion in the programme of action 
for the Second Decade, </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 45 
 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reiterates</i> that there is a need to continue giving particular attention to achieving 
the effective participation of indigenous peoples in the planning, organization and 
implementation of the activities of the Second International Decade of the World&#8217;s Indigenous 
People in order to fully realize the Decade&#8217;s goals; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to 
take the necessary steps to ensure the participation of her Office in the activities of the human 
rights component of the programme of action of the Second Decade, in full cooperation with the 
Coordinator for the Second Decade; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> its Working Group on Indigenous Populations to follow closely the 
activities carried out as part of the human rights component of the programme of action of the 
Second Decade on the basis of the information to be submitted regularly by the Office of the 
High Commissioner to the members of the Working Group, so as to be able to contribute to the 
midterm and end-term reviews of the Second Decade, to be carried out by the General Assembly 
in 2010 and 20l5; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its view</i> that the conclusions and recommendations adopted annually 
by the Working Group and the experience accumulated by this body during its 24 years of 
continuous work on the most diverse indigenous issues and in the evaluation of the 
implementation of the programme of action of the first Decade could be of particular value for 
the successful planning and implementation of the activities to be undertaken within the 
framework of the Second Decade; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Welcomes</i> the observance of the International Day of the World&#8217;s Indigenous 
People on 3 August 2006; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recommends</i> that the celebration of the International Day of the World&#8217;s 
Indigenous People continue to be held in Geneva, as usual, on the fourth day of the annual 
session of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations, in order to ensure as large a 
participation as possible of representatives of indigenous peoples, Governments and 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, as well as of staff of United Nations 
bodies and the specialized agencies; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reiterates</i> the recommendation that the Coordinator for the Second Decade 
appeal to Governments and other possible donors to contribute generously to the Voluntary Fund 
for the Second International Decade of the World&#8217;s Indigenous People; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Welcomes</i> the steps that have been taken and continue to be taken to establish and 
promote cooperation between the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the Working Group 
on Indigenous Populations and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, as was the case in the work to achieve a successful 
common approach that stressed the need for a second international decade.

Rights in 1993, in particular those contained in Part I, paragraph 20, and Part II, paragraphs 28 
to 32, of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful also</i> of the relevant recommendations adopted by the World Conference against 
Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in 2001, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Economic and Social Council resolution 1982/34 of 7 May 1982, in which the 
Council authorized the Sub-Commission to establish annually a Working Group on Indigenous 
Populations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with deep appreciation</i> of the report of the Working Group on Indigenous 
Populations on its twenty-fourth session (A/HRC/Sub.1/58/22) and, in particular, of its 
conclusions and recommendations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming </i>the ample discussions in the Working Group during its twenty-fourth session 
under its twofold mandate:  the review of developments pertaining to the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, including the main 
theme, &#8220;Utilization of indigenous peoples&#8217; lands by non-indigenous authorities, groups or 
individuals for military purposes&#8221;, and standard-setting, as well as on cooperation with other 
United Nations bodies in the sphere of indigenous issues, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing its deep concern </i>at the still visible sequels of the colonial era that continue to 
adversely affect the living conditions of indigenous peoples in various parts of the world, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling once again</i> Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/30 
of 5 March 1993, in which the Commission recommended to all thematic rapporteurs, special 
representatives, independent experts and working groups to pay special attention, within the 
framework of their mandates, to the situation of indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2005/49 and 2005/51 
of 20 April 2005 and Economic and Social Council decisions 2005/268 and 2005/270 
of 25 July 2005, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking into account</i>, in the context of the ongoing process of reform of the 
United Nations human rights bodies recently launched at the initiative of the Secretary-General, 
the deep interest in the continuation of its Working Group on Indigenous Populations repeatedly 
expressed by a large number of Governments and the representatives and caucuses of indigenous 
peoples in a large number of meetings held both within and outside the United Nations system, </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 47 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> its resolution 2005/23 of 11 August 2005, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses its deep appreciation</i> to all members of the Working Group for the 
important and constructive work accomplished during the session and for the new working 
methods introduced, with the purpose of facilitating a more interactive dialogue during its annual 
sessions; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Reiterates</i> its view, in the context of the ongoing process of reform of the 
United Nations human rights activities, bodies and mechanisms recently initiated by the 
Secretary-General, that in reviewing the activities, bodies and mechanisms relating to indigenous 
peoples, account should be taken of the fact that the mandates of the Working Group on 
Indigenous Populations, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues are 
clearly distinct and complementary and that consequently none of these three bodies should be 
discontinued, and invites its superior bodies to endorse this view in the light of the already 
established cooperation among the three mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Recommends</i> that the item &#8220;indigenous issues&#8221; be automatically included in the 
agenda of the Human Rights Council and stresses the need for an expert body to provide the 
Council with advice on the promotion, protection and realization of the rights of indigenous 
peoples; also recommends that the principal functions of this body should be to produce 
in-depth, action-orientated reports and studies and to engage in the elaboration of norms and 
other international standards relating to the promotion, protection and realization of the rights 
of indigenous peoples; and further recommends that the expert body should report to the 
Sub-Commission or any future expert advice mechanism; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to transmit the report of the Working Group on its 
twenty-fourth session (A/HRC/Sub.1/58/22) to the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, indigenous organizations, Governments and concerned intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations, to the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund

advise the Working Group on how they take into account, in their work and in accordance with 
their respective mandates, the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and in this 
context further invites them to take duly into account paragraphs 3 and 4 of Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 2004/58 of 20 April 2004; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests </i>the current Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group to make 
an oral presentation to the fourteenth annual meeting of special rapporteurs/representatives, 
independent experts and chairpersons of working groups of the special procedures of the Human

New Delhi on the occasion of World Leprosy Day; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also</i> w<i>elcomes </i>the recent achievement by India and Angola of the elimination 
target of less than one case of leprosy per ten thousand population, and the fact that, according to 
the World Health Organization, the number of new leprosy cases reported during the year 2005 
declined dramatically, part of the downward trend of newly detected cases of leprosy patients on 
the global level; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests </i>Governments, if they have not yet done so, to abolish legislation that 
requires forced institutionalization of leprosy patients and to provide effective, prompt and free 
treatment to leprosy patients, on an outpatient basis if they so wish; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Also requests </i>Governments to provide appropriate remedies to former patients 
forcibly hospitalized in a sanatorium, colony, hospital or community; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Further requests </i>Governments to immediately prohibit and take effective 
measures to eradicate discrimination of any type against leprosy-affected persons and their 
families; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Encourages </i>Governments to make every effort to include leprosy education in 
school curricula so as to give correct information about leprosy and leprosy-affected persons and 
their families and prevent discrimination against them; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Endorses </i>the proposals made by Mr. Yozo Yokota to organize, if independent 
funding is available, (i) two regional workshops, one in Africa and one in Asia, in order to 
encourage representatives of leprosy-affected persons and their organizations to participate 
actively in the discussions on the topic of discrimination against leprosy-affected persons and 
their families; and (ii) a consultation meeting in Geneva in order for Mr. Yokota to hear the 
views of Governments, United Nations bodies and agencies, non-governmental organizations 
and representatives of leprosy-affected persons in drafting the text of principles and guidelines 
on discrimination against leprosy-affected persons and their families; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Human Rights Council to include the topic of discrimination against 
leprosy-affected persons and their families among the studies to be conducted by the

<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>that slavery, in all its forms and practices, is a crime against humanity and 
that every woman, man and child has a fundamental right to be free from all forms of slavery and 
servitude, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the priority theme of the thirty-first session was the human rights 
dimension of prostitution, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of the report of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery on 
its thirty-first session (A/HRC/Sub.1/58/25) and in particular the recommendations contained in 
chapter VI, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its appreciation </i>for the valuable contribution made by victims of slavery and 
slavery-like practices and their representatives, whose participation in the Working Group&#8217;s 
session was facilitated by grants from the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on 
Contemporary Forms of Slavery, to authentic perspectives on the subsisting slavery and 
slavery-like practices, 
</p>
<p> <i>Having focused </i>on the mandate given to the Working Group by the Human Rights 
Council to contribute to the paper to be prepared by the Sub-Commission giving its vision and 
recommendations for future expert advice to the Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Working Group has played a leading role in focusing attention on the 
persistent need to ensure implementation of the slavery conventions, helped identify and compile 
new forms and manifestations of slavery and slavery-like practices, drawn attention to such 
practices as the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, forced marriage, 
violence against women, migrant workers and trafficking in persons, and drafted the Programme 
of Action for Prevention of Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others 
which was adopted by the Commission on Human Rights,

<p> <i>Taking note</i> of the consensus view expressed in the Working Group, particularly among 
the participating non-governmental organizations engaged in the study, investigation and 
eradication of slavery and slavery-like practices, on the maintenance of the Working Group, 
</p>

General Assembly to maintain and intensify efforts to persuade States to ratify the Slavery 
Convention of 1926, the Convention on the Suppression of Traffic in Persons and the 
Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others of 1949, the Supplementary Convention on the 
Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956,

</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recommends</i> that the Human Rights Council request the General Assembly to

Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery to enable it to facilitate the participation of a larger 
number of victims of slavery and slavery-like practices and their representatives in meetings 
of the Working Group and to provide grants for projects that assist victims of slavery and 
slavery-like practices, and recommends that a member of the Working Group, designated by it,

systematic rape and sexual enslavement directed against civilian populations, women continue 
to face widespread sexual gender-based violence during conflicts, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Secretary-General and notes once again with 
appreciation his report on women, peace and security (S/2002/1154);

Rights on systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices and takes note with great 
appreciation of her report (A/HRC/Sub.1/58/23); 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Deeply concerned</i> that systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices 
are still being used to humiliate civilians and military personnel, to destroy society and to 
diminish prospects for a peaceful resolution of conflicts and that the resulting severe physical 
and psychological trauma endangers not only personal recovery but post-conflict reconstruction 
of the whole society, as pointed out in the above-mentioned reports; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Considers</i> that the verdicts of the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia, the International Tribunal for Rwanda and the Special Court for 
Sierra Leone acknowledging that rape and, more recently, sexual enslavement are crimes against 
humanity, and the special recognition in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
that sexual violence and sexual slavery committed in the context of either an internal or an 
international armed conflict may constitute crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide 
falling within the jurisdiction of the Court, represent a significant step in the protection of 
women&#8217;s human rights as they challenge widespread acceptance that torture, rape and violence 
against women are an integral part of war and conflict and hold the perpetrators of such crimes 
accountable; </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 59

<p> 5. <i>Reiterates</i> that States should provide effective criminal penalties and 
compensation for unremedied violations in order to end the cycle of impunity with regard to 
sexual violence committed during armed conflicts;

<p> 6. <i>Encourages</i> States to promote human rights education on the issues of systematic 
rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflicts, ensuring the accuracy of 
accounts of historical events in the educational curricula, in an effort to prevent the recurrence of 
such violations and to encourage better understanding among all peoples;

</b></p>
<p> <i>The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights</i>, 
 <i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the relevant human rights instruments and international humanitarian law, in particular the 
Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 on the Laws and Customs of War on Land and the Geneva 
Conventions of 1949 on the protection of the victims of war and the Additional Protocols thereto 
of 1977, which enshrine the principles prohibiting attacks against civilians and requiring that 
attacks against military objectives and combatants not cause disproportionate harm to civilians 
and civilian property, </p>

page 64 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that, in all circumstances, the human person remains under the protection of the 
principles of humanity and the dictates of public conscience, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing </i>that human rights and international humanitarian law are complementary 
and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the right of people to struggle against foreign occupation and aggression 
and the activities of resistance groups should be exercised within the limits of international 
humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking into account</i> its responsibility to examine and draw lessons from country-specific 
situations with a view to identifying gaps in both human rights protection and monitoring in time 
of armed conflict, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> the Human Rights Council to call upon Member States to consider 
holding a meeting of the High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 on 
possible options for enhanced monitoring of compliance with their obligations under 
international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recommends</i> that regional preparatory expert meetings be held with a view 
to providing the conference of the High Contracting Parties with lessons learned from recent 
conflicts, both of a national and an international character, in different parts of the world and 
suggestions to remedy both the protection and monitoring gaps; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Recommends</i> that the Sub-Commission, or a future expert advice mechanism,

missions, with a view to establishing a culture of compliance and accountability, and to provide 
Member States with reliable tools for victim-oriented commissions of inquiry; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Emphasizes </i>the importance of distinguishing accountability for human rights 
violations from the political dimensions of a conflict and the need for human rights organs and 
bodies to address situations of gross and widespread violations of human rights on their own 
merits; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Underlines</i> the need for relevant human rights special procedures, other experts in 
human rights law and experts in international humanitarian law to conduct a structured dialogue

human rights law, as confirmed in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the jurisprudence of 
the Human Rights Committee, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> its decision 2001/120 of 16 August 2001, in which it entrusted to 
Ms. Barbara Frey the task of drafting a working paper on the questions of (a) the trade and 
carrying of small arms and light weapons; and (b) the use of such weapons in the context of

</b></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPLES ON THE PREVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
           COMMITTED WITH SMALL ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> the primacy of international human rights law as codified in the 
International Bill of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the right to life, liberty and security of the person is guaranteed in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed in the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that State agents, especially law enforcement officials, play a vital role in 
the protection of the right to life, liberty and security of person, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials provides 
that law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent 
required under the law for the performance of their duty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials adopted in 1990 by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention 
of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> that the Seventh United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime 
and the Treatment of Offenders, in its resolution 14, emphasized that the use of force and 
firearms by law enforcement agents should be commensurate with due respect for human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1986/10 
of 21 May 1986, section IX, invited Member States to pay particular attention in the 
implementation of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials to the use of force and 
firearms by law enforcement officials, and the General Assembly, in its resolution 41/149 
of 4 December 1986, welcomed the Council&#8217;s recommendation, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that paragraph 2 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions requires the strict control, 
including a clear chain of command over all officials responsible for apprehension, arrest, 
detention, custody and imprisonment, as well as those officials authorized by law to use force 
and small arms, </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 68 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> the need to promote the human rights, safety and well-being of all persons by 
preventing foreseeable small arms violence through appropriate measures to regulate small arms 
possession and use by private actors, including those suggested in paragraph 5 of Economic 
and Social Council resolution 1997/28 of 21 July 1997 and in resolution 9 of the Ninth 
United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> the need for States to promote and assist with the pursuit of negotiated 
solutions to conflicts, including by addressing their root causes as noted in the Programme of 
Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in 
All Its Aspects, section III, paragraph 4, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing also</i> the responsibility of States to promote public education and awareness 
about the root causes of violence and to promote alternative forms of dispute resolution, as 
recognized by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1997/28 and the Programme of 
Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in 
All Its Aspects, section II, paragraph 20, 
</p>
<p> <i>Solemnly proclaims</i> the human rights principles set forth below, formulated to assist 
Member States in their task of ensuring and promoting the proper action by State agents, 
especially law enforcement officials, with respect to their unequivocal role to protect the right to 
life, liberty and security of the person, as guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and reaffirmed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and urges that 
every effort be made so that the principles become generally known and respected. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Obligations with regard to State agents 
</b></p>
<p>1. Governments and State agents, especially law enforcement officials, shall not use small 
arms and light weapons to violate human rights.  All State agents have the obligation to uphold 
and affirm human rights including the right to life, liberty and security of person, as guaranteed 
in the International Bill of Human Rights.  A State agent includes any person or persons acting at 
the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official. 
</p>
<p>2. Governments and State agencies shall adopt and implement rules and regulations on the 
use of force and small arms and light weapons against persons by State agents, especially law 
enforcement officials. 
</p>
<p>3. In order to prevent the violation of human rights committed with small arms and light 
weapons, Governments and State agents shall ensure strict enforcement of the rules and 
regulations they adopt, including a clear chain of command over all officials authorized by law 
to use force and, in particular, small arms and light weapons.  Governments shall ensure that 
arbitrary or abusive use of force carried out with small arms and light weapons, including but not 
limited to force used by any State agent, is punished as a criminal offence. </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 69 
 
</p>
<p>4. In order to further prevent the violation of human rights committed with small arms and 
light weapons, Governments and State agents shall establish and maintain adequate and detailed 
procedures for the proper storage and management of small arms and light weapons, including 
ammunition.  Governments shall actively pursue the collection, safe storage, destruction and 
responsible disposal of surplus small arms and light weapons. 
</p>
<p>5. Governments and State agencies shall ensure that all law enforcement officials are 
selected by proper screening procedures, have appropriate moral, psychological and physical 
qualities for the effective exercise of their functions and receive continuous and thorough 
professional training on the acceptable conditions for the use of force in conformity with these 
principles.  Those State agents who are permitted to carry small arms and light weapons shall be 
authorized to do so only upon completion of special training regarding the limitations on their 
use.  The compliance of State agents with rules and regulations on the use of force and small 
arms and light weapons shall be subject to regular review. 
</p><p>6. In the training (at national or international level) of State agents, especially law 
enforcement officials, Governments and State agencies shall give special attention to the 
promotion and protection of human rights as a primary duty of all State agents.  Governments 
shall design training programmes to emphasize alternatives to the use of force and small arms 
and light weapons, including the peaceful settlement of disputes, the understanding of crowd 
behaviour, and the methods of persuasion, negotiation and mediation, with a view to limiting the 
use of force and small arms and light weapons. 
</p>
<p>7. In the planning of specific operations and tactical situations, Governments and State 
agents shall include alternative means of settlement without recourse to force and small arms and 
light weapons. 
</p>
<p>8. In honouring the right to life, liberty and security of person, as guaranteed in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed in the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, the intentional lethal use of small arms and light weapons may only be 
made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.  State agents, including law enforcement 
officials, shall not use small arms and light weapons against persons except in self-defence or 
defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the 
perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person 
presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only 
when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. 
</p><p>9. Governments and State agencies shall establish effective reporting and investigative 
procedures to ensure that all incidents involving the misuse of small arms and light weapons by 
State agents, including law enforcement officials, are reviewed and acted upon by independent 
and competent authorities.  There shall be a thorough, prompt and impartial investigation, and 
appropriate corrective measures taken, in all cases of death, torture, other ill-treatment or injury 
involving the use of small arms and light weapons by State agents.  In addition to determining 
the cause, manner and time of death, torture or injury, and the persons responsible, all 
investigations should identify the type of weapon(s) used in the incident. </p>

</p>
<p><b>B.  Due diligence to prevent human rights abuses by private actors 
</b></p>
<p>10. In order to ensure the protection of human rights by preventing small arms and light 
weapons violence by private actors, Governments shall enact licensing requirements to prevent 
possession of arms by persons who are at risk of misusing them.  Possession of small arms and 
light weapons shall be authorized for specific purposes only; small arms and light weapons shall 
be used strictly for the purpose for which they are authorized.  Before issuing a licence 
Governments shall require training in proper use of small arms and light weapons, and shall take 
into consideration, at a minimum, the following factors:  age, mental fitness, requested purpose, 
prior criminal record or record of misuse, and prior acts of domestic violence.  Governments 
shall require periodic renewal of licences. 
</p>
<p>11. Governments shall ensure that proper controls are exercised over the manufacturing of 
small arms and light weapons through incorporation into national law and by other measures.  
For the purpose of identifying and tracing small arms and light weapons, Governments shall 
require that at the time of manufacture, each small arm or light weapon has a unique permanent 
mark providing, at a minimum, the name of the manufacturer, the country of manufacture and 
the serial number. 
</p>
<p>12. Governments shall ensure the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the 
illegal manufacture, possession, stockpiling or transfer of small arms and light weapons.  
Governments shall impose penalties for crimes involving the misuse of small arms and light 
weapons, including to commit domestic violence, and for the unlawful possession of small arms 
and light weapons. 
</p>
<p>13. With the cooperation of the international community, Governments shall develop and 
implement effective disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, including the 
effective collection, control, storage and destruction of small arms and light weapons, 
particularly in post-conflict situations.  Governments should take steps to encourage voluntary 
disarmament.  Governments should implement public awareness and confidence-building 
programmes, in cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organizations, to prevent a 
return to armed violence and to encourage alternative forms of dispute resolution.  Governments 
should incorporate a gender perspective in their peacekeeping and public awareness efforts to 
ensure that the special needs and human rights of women and children are met, especially in 
post-conflict situations. 
</p>
<p>14. Governments shall prohibit international transfers of small arms and light weapons which 
would violate their obligations under international law, including in circumstances in which such 
arms are likely to be used to commit serious human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>15. In light of the obligation of a State, under international human rights law, to prevent 
human rights violations, States are required under international law to provide, upon request, 
assistance in the provision of information regarding the ownership or purchase of small arms and 
light weapons, inter alia, for the purposes of judicial proceedings in other States. </p>

<p><b>I.  VISION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights respectfully 
requests the Human Rights Council (the Council), to take into account the following comments 
and recommendations when undertaking the overall review of all mandates, mechanisms, 
functions and responsibilities formerly under the authority of the Commission on Human Rights 
(the Commission) and assumed by the Council on 16 June 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 
</b></p>
<p>2. In resolution 60/251 the Assembly stressed the need to preserve and to build on the 
achievements of the Commission and to redress its shortcomings.<b>1</b>  It reaffirmed the commitment 
to strengthen the United Nations human rights machinery.<b>2</b>  It requested the Council to undertake 
a two-stage process.  First, it must review all mandates, mechanisms, functions and 
responsibilities of the Commission (55 in total, in accordance with the annex to Council 
decision 1/102).  Then, on the basis of that review, which should be completed not later 
than 1 July 2007, the Council may improve and/or rationalize any of those mandates, 
mechanisms, functions and responsibilities.  Any modification to existing practices and 
procedures must have, as its ultimate purpose, &#8220;to <i>maintain</i> a system of special procedures, 
expert advice and a complaint procedure&#8221; (emphasis added), and requires a specific decision of 
the Council.  Pending the reaching of decisions under this overall process of review, a system of 
special procedures, expert advice and a complaint procedure is to be maintained in place.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>3. Council decisions during that overall review process that may imply the extinction of any 
of the components of the present system should be adopted only after the completion of a full 
review of the present status and usefulness of the mandate, mechanism, etc. in question.<b>4</b>  In this 
connection, the Secretary-General, in his statement of 23 February 2006 on the new Council, and 
the present United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in her statement of 27 March 
last 2006 before the Commission, emphasized the need to avoid any gaps in the protection of 
human rights.  In her statement, Ms. Arbour also stressed the need to prevent disruptions in 
standard-setting activities. 
</p>
<p>4. As noted above, the overall review process should be completed by the Council within a 
year of the holding of its first session.  It could be validly argued that considering the systemic 
nature of the existing network of mandates and mechanisms now under the Council&#8217;s authority,

</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Ibid. </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36

</p>
<p>all those listed in the annex to decision 1/102 should remain in existence, with their present 
functions and responsibilities, until the review process soon to be undertaken by the Council is 
completed. 
</p>
<p>5. The Council is clearly envisaged as being the pinnacle of an entire system of promotion 
and protection of human rights.  That system must work as a coherent and integrated whole. 
Fragmentation, duplication and diffusion of effort must be avoided. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Council decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Council, in paragraph 3 (b) (i) and (ii) of its decision 1/102, has requested the 
Sub-Commission to give due priority during its current session to preparing two documents to be 
submitted to the Council in 2006:  (a) a paper giving its own vision and recommendations for 
future expert advice to the Council; and (b) a list describing the status of ongoing studies and an 
overall review of its activities.  In paragraph 4 of the decision, the Council indicated that, in 
preparing the first of those two documents, the Sub-Commission should include the contributions 
that its Social Forum and working groups may deem fit to submit at the end of their 2006 
sessions. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Annex to Sub-Commission decision 2005/114 of 11 August 2005</b> 
</p>
<p>7. The Sub-Commission reaffirms the conclusions contained in the annex to its 
decision 2005/114, which was the subject of collegial discussion and negotiation and which was 
adopted by consensus. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Scope and structure of this paper 
</b></p>
<p>8. This document contains the Sub-Commission&#8217;s vision and recommendations on the 
advisability of improving and strengthening the network of expert advice mechanisms that was 
established by the Economic and Social Council during the period 1946-2006, as part of an 
action-oriented system of United Nations bodies dedicated to the promotion and protection of 
human rights under the operational primary authority of the Commission, and which included the 
existing three subsystems:  the special procedures, the Sub-Commission and its own subsystem 
of working groups (both sessional and intersessional) as well as the Social Forum, and the one 
comprising the various functional mechanisms of the confidential procedure established by 
Economic and Social Council resolution 1503 (XLVIII) of 1970 (the 1503 procedure). 
</p>
<p>9. In accordance with decision 1/102, this paper first sets out the Sub-Commission&#8217;s general 
vision on any expert advice mechanism resulting from the overall review process to be 
undertaken by the Council.  Then, in the light of the General Assembly resolution establishing 
the Council, it identifies the functions to be carried out by any standing human rights expert 
advisory body emerging from the overall review process to be undertaken by the Council, as 
well as the issues about which the Council will need advice, so as to facilitate the Council&#8217;s task 
of determining, in due course, which existing (or future) mechanism is most suitable for 
providing the advice required.  It will be necessary for the Council to consider the operation of 
all mandates and other mechanisms for which it now has responsibility, in order to ensure the </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 78 
 
</p>
<p>coherence of the system as a whole and whether all the needs for advice are met.  The role of a 
consultative body made up of independent experts cannot be determined without understanding 
the role of other parts of the United Nations human rights system. 
</p>
<p>10. Next, the paper will deal with the characteristics of any future expert advice mechanism, 
which will be referred to throughout this annex as the Human Rights Consultative Commission 
(HRCC).  There is then a section on the recommendations from the intersessional working 
groups and the Social Forum, as requested by the Council in paragraph 4 of the decision.  
Finally, the recommendations of the Sub-Commission to the Council, resulting from the 
considerations already examined, will be set out in summary form. 
</p>
<p>11. The vision and recommendations are based on the arrangements for the transitional 
period established by the Council in decision 1/102, in particular paragraphs 1 and 3, in the light 
of the provisions of Assembly resolution 60/251.  They will refer principally, of course, to how 
the existing Sub-Commission, as a collegial body, envisages the transition from a 
Commission-led network of expert advice mechanisms under the Economic and Social Council 
to one, first, under the direct leadership of the Council and, ultimately, under the final authority 
of the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>12. Nonetheless, because of the long-standing, much-needed systemic nature of 
United Nations action in the field of human rights, explicitly recognized by the 
General Assembly in paragraph 6 of resolution 60/251, and in order to secure the &#8220;fresh 
approach&#8221; that is so often mentioned as essential when considering the establishment of the new 
Council, our recommendations will necessarily have to touch upon the interaction that this 
network of mechanisms of expert advice must secure in its relations with the other two 
components of the present system, i.e. the subsystem of special procedures and the functional 
mechanisms of the 1503 procedure. 
</p>
<p>13. In order to avoid confusion, it has also been thought helpful to define the terms and 
acronyms used in the paper.<b>5</b>

</b>  Commission:  the former United Nations Commission on Human Rights.  UPR:  the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review referred to in paragraph 5 (e) of Assembly resolution 60/251.

Human Rights.  This term will be used to describe the current activities of the body and the 
views of the current members of the body.  HRCC (for Human Rights Consultative<b> </b>Committee) 
will be used to signify any future standing collegial expert advice body (including a 
&#8220;reconstructed Sub-Commission&#8221;), that may emerge from the overall review of all existing 
expert advice mechanisms referred to in paragraph 6 of Assembly resolution 60/251.  UPR

position on whether that would be provided by a separate, specialized expert body or by the 
whole or part of HRCC itself.  Special procedures:  all mechanisms under that name listed in the

</p>
<p><b>B.  The general vision of the Sub-Commission 
</b></p>
<p>14. This section addresses the vision of the Sub-Commission with regard to the motivation 
underlying the United Nations human rights system, its characteristics and its product. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Motivation underlying the United Nations human rights system 
</b></p>
<p>15. The United Nations human rights system should be inspired by faith in the inherent 
dignity and the equal rights of all human beings, committed to promotion of respect for the ideals 
and principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and convinced of the need for development and strengthening of universal 
standards and rules for the interpretation and implementation in practice of the principles of 
international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Characteristics of the United Nations human rights system 
</b></p>
<p>16. The general vision of the Sub-Commission is of a United Nations human rights system, 
based on the equal importance, interdependence and equal value of all human rights, 
characterized by coherence, objectivity, transparency, non-selectivity in the protection of rights 
and freedoms, and participation of as wide a range of actors as possible, while, at the same time, 
avoiding fragmentation, duplication of effort, double standards and political manipulation. 
</p>
<p>17. The Sub-Commission considers that the Council is to become the pinnacle of such a 
system.  Further, it is convinced that, in order to achieve maximum effectiveness, the 
Council would need to be served by a network of specialized mechanisms (i.e. working groups) 
under a standing, collegial, independent expert advice body, which would function as a meeting 
point or hub for action-oriented ideas and activities, as well as an instrument for reducing 
present mistrust and tensions by promoting cooperation, rather than confrontation, among 
member States. 
</p>
<p>18. To that end, functioning and effective cooperation of all components of the 
United Nations human rights system needs to be kept under constant review.  It is the view of the 
Sub-Commission that the body described in this document (HRCC) can be instrumental in 
enabling the Council to gain the legitimacy that in recent times was claimed to be lacking in the 
performance of the former Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Product of the United Nations human rights system 
</b></p>
<p>19. The test of the United Nations human rights system is the day-to-day experience of all 
individuals and communities.  In order to understand that experience and to contribute to 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>procedure is being referred to, that will be made clear in the text.  TMBs:  treaty monitoring 
bodies.  NHRI:  national human rights institutions.  NGOs:  non-governmental organizations.  
IGOs:  regional, subregional, extraregional, or worldwide intergovernmental organizations.  
WG:  working group, a mechanism attached to some other body higher up in the hierarchical 
order. </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 80 
 
</p>
<p>changing it, where necessary, the United Nations human rights system needs to involve NGOs, 
NHRIs, States and intergovernmental organizations in the closest possible participation in and 
cooperation with its activities. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The Council&#8217;s need for expert advice 
</b></p>
<p>20. According to General Assembly resolution 60/251, the mandate of the Council covers the 
following fields: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Promotion and implementation of human rights obligations, and follow-up to 
goals and commitments emanating from United Nations conferences and 
summits</b>.<b>6</b>  There is a role for HRCC to play in establishing guidelines with regard to 
implementation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Promotion of advisory services, technical assistance and capacity-building, in 
consultation with and with the consent of the Member States concerned</b>.<b>7</b>  
Basically, this is the function of other components of the existing United Nations 
human rights system, as well as of OHCHR.  Nonetheless, independent experts may 
provide valuable specialized know-how, useful for the most effective discharge of 
this Council function; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>UPR</b>.<b>8</b>  There is likely to be a need for the advice of independent experts at some 
stages in the process (see further below); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The complaint procedure (the 1503 confidential procedure)</b>.<b>9</b>  HRCC, sitting as a 
collegial body in plenary meeting, should be assigned once again the function of 
reviewing the decisions taken by the present Sub-Commission&#8217;s Working Group on 
Communications (as originally established by Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1503 (XLVIII)) (see further below); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The prevention of human rights violations and a prompt response to 
emergencies on a non-selective basis</b>.<b>10</b>  This function may require input from the 
special procedures and the UPR process.  It is conceivable that, should the Council so 
decide, some role could be envisaged for HRCC; 
</p>
<p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 81 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>A forum for dialogue on thematic issues regarding all human rights</b>.<b>11</b>  This is, by 
definition, a principal function of any standing expert advice body that may result 
from the overall review to be undertaken by the Council; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Making recommendations with regard to the promotion and protection of 
human rights</b>.<b>12</b>  Again, general advice might be expected to come principally from 
HRCC.  Specific advice might also come from any UPR mechanism established by 
the Council; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Making recommendations to the General Assembly for further development of 
international law in the field of human rights</b>.<b>13</b>  This could also be a principal 
function of any standing expert advice body; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Promotion of human rights education</b>.<b>14</b>  This is a responsibility shared by every 
component of the United Nations human rights system; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Working in close cooperation with Governments, regional organizations, NHRIs 
and civil society</b>.<b>15</b>  This also involves every part of the United Nations human rights 
system.  The Sub-Commission has long been regarded by NGOs as a most important 
forum for all their activities, and has long prided itself on being the most accessible 
part of the human rights system for NGOs.  That is even more true of its sessional and 
intersessional WGs and the Social Forum. 
</p>
<p><b>D. The functions to be performed by any standing human rights expert advice 
mechanism that the Council may see fit to establish to serve its needs 
</b></p>
<p>21. Basically, the ideas advanced on this issue last year by the Sub-Commission, in the 
annex to its decision 2005/114, continue to be valid after the establishment of the Council and 
the demise of the Commission.  In fact, as demonstrated, inter alia, by the lacunae of 
resolution 60/251, there is an even clearer need in 2006 &#8220;for a collegial independent expert

<p>[advice] body within the United Nations human rights machinery, because certain essential 
functions within the United Nations human rights machinery can best be fulfilled by such a 
body&#8221; (annex to Sub-Commission decision 2005/114, para. 2).<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>22. The functions include the promotion and progressive development of human rights, 
through studies and standard-setting; the protection of human rights, through the 1503 procedure 
and, possibly, through involvement in the UPR process; promoting the coherence of the human 
rights system, including by the provision of follow-up; and identifying lacunae, challenges and 
implementation needs.  These will be considered in turn.  HRCC could: 
</p>
<p> (a) At the request of the Council, or at its own initiative, undertake research and  
produce documents (in particular, thematic in-depth studies in accordance with a carefully 
established, prioritized, not-too-prolific, long-term programme of work) to facilitate the 
promotion and protection of human rights.  Essential to the discharge of this function is the 
collaborative work of specialized, ongoing, intersessional and sessional working groups; 
</p>
<p> (b) At the request of the Council, or at its own initiative, carry out standard-setting 
activities, including the process of identification of new issues that may require the adoption of 
certain norms and other types of standards (such as principles, rules, guidelines and/or practices), 
including in the field of implementation, as well as the creation of said draft norms and other 
standards for adoption by Member States, in accordance with a carefully established programme 
of work.  Essential to the discharge of this function is the collaborative work of specialized, 
ongoing, intersessional and sessional working groups; 
</p>
<p> (c) Protect human rights by means of involvement in the 1503 procedure and, 
possibly, the UPR review process: 
</p>
<p>(i) 1503 procedure.  The Sub-Commission emphasizes the need for a 
confidential complaint procedure that may provide an effective and timely

<p>

<p><b>16
</b>  The importance of the work of the Sub-Commission has been emphasized by various 
</p>
<p>commentators.  Ambassador Makarim Wibisono, Chairperson of the Commission at its 
sixty-first session, said on 25 July 2005, &#8220;[The Commission] recognized not only the valuable 
contribution made by this body [the Sub-Commission] to the work of the United Nations over 
the past 58 years but also its important contribution to the development of a better understanding 
of human rights through the study of important issues, the elaboration of international standards 
and the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world.&#8221;  Louise Arbour said 
on 25 July 2005, &#8220;Over the years, the Sub-Commission has provided the Commission on 
Human Rights with insights and ideas, based on expertise and experience of its members [and] 
helped to identify and develop new areas for further consideration.&#8221;  Mehr Khan Williams, the 
Deputy High Commissioner, said on 7 August 2006, &#8220;Since its inception, this body [the 
Sub-Commission] has devoted itself to research and discussion of new and challenging human 
rights issues.  &#8230;  The Sub-Commission did not hesitate to raise issues that were initially 
considered provocative or unwelcome but which essentially helped in shaping new thinking and 
action of the Commission.  The Sub-Commission has been a forum for the voice of the civil 
society.&#8221; </p>

<p>remedy to victims of gross violations of human rights.  The reforms 
contained in Economic and Social Council resolution 2000/3 of 
16 June 2000 have been unsuccessful and should be modified.  HRCC, 
sitting as a collegial body in plenary meeting, should be assigned once again 
the function of reviewing the decisions taken by the present 
Sub-Commission&#8217;s Working Group on Communications (as originally 
established by Economic and Social Council resolution 1503 (XLVIII)).  
A WG of the Human Rights Council, succeeding the Working Group on 
Situations of the Commission, should have a preparatory role, aimed at 
facilitating the Council&#8217;s consideration of the situations referred to it, rather 
than a filtering role; 
</p>
<p>(ii) UPR.  If so requested by the Council, HRCC could play a role, provided that 
this was not to the detriment of its thematic work (see further below);

<p>(d) Promote coherence across the human rights system as a whole, by establishing 
close cooperation and coordination between all parts of the human rights system, and other parts 
of the international system as appropriate (e.g. the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the 
International Law Commission).  It is absolutely essential for the intersessional WGs of HRCC 
to report to HRCC to ensure coherence.  In order to achieve this goal, without prejudice to other 
forms of cooperation and coordination, the expert body should meet for one meeting a year with 
the thematic special procedures established by the Human Rights Council to examine possible 
input to be provided by each subsystem to the work of the other so that the Council receives 
from both of them coherent and well-thought-out proposals, and to consider issues of common 
interest within the mandate of the expert body (e.g. the identification of thematic or procedural 
lacunae).  The special procedures would continue to report to the Human Rights Council with 
regard to the exercise of their mandates.  The expert body should be represented, on the basis of 
equal status, at coordination meetings of the special procedures; 
</p>
<p>(e) Contribute to the promotion of human rights by means of active participation not 
only in activities fostering human rights education at all levels but also by its members 
participating, in an individual capacity, in the delivery of technical assistance to Member States 
requesting such international cooperation from OHCHR; and 
</p>
<p>(f) Identify lacunae, challenges and implementation needs and provide follow-up. 
This would be facilitated by, first, assisting the widest possible participation in the work of the 
body; second, by giving HRCC the mandate to ensure the coherence of the human rights system 
as a whole; third, by ensuring that HRCC maintained a general debate, as a separate agenda item; 
fourth, by ensuring that HRCC maintained a separate agenda item entitled &#8220;Identification of 
lacunae, challenges, implementation needs&#8221; and, finally, by ensuring that HRCC maintained a 
separate agenda item on the follow-up of previous initiatives in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>23. All activities undertaken by HRCC that may have administrative and/or financial 
implications cannot be undertaken without the explicit authorization of the General Assembly, 
acting on a recommendation from the Council. 
</p>
<p>24. HRCC would submit an annual report on its activities to the Council. </p>

</p>
<p><b>E. Main characteristics of any standing human rights expert 
advice mechanism that the Council may choose to establish 
</b></p>
<p>25. This section addresses the composition of HRCC, its organization and method of work. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Composition 
</b></p>
<p>26. This subsection addresses the overall composition of the body and the qualities necessary 
for membership, nomination and election. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Overall composition 
</b>27. In comparison with the size of the Sub-Commission, HRCC should not be either 
dramatically increased or decreased, as recognized in the course of the most recent reform of the 
Sub-Commission in the year 2000, in which the Commission found that 26 experts actually was 
a suitable size.  Nonetheless, two more seats (one to be allocated to the Asian region, the other to 
the Eastern European area) could be useful.  The possible election of alternate members together 
with the titular ones should be allowed to continue, to contribute to the work of the body.  
Alternates could also, for example, assist HRCC in its work by undertaking studies. 
</p>
<p>28. There would be a need for both continuity and new members in the composition of the 
body.  The system of renewal of half of the mandates of the membership, which at present takes 
the form of elections every two years for half the members of the Sub-Commission, should be 
maintained.  That would require a mandate of an even number of years, such as the present 
four-year mandates. 
</p>
<p>29. There is agreement that, in order better to discharge its responsibilities (particularly in 
view of the period of time needed for studies), it would be advantageous if members of HRCC 
served for two terms of at least four years.  Views vary as to whether there should be any 
limitation on the number of successive mandates of a member of HRCC and, if so, what that 
number should be.  
</p>
<p>30. The body should reflect an equitable geographical and gender distribution and the experts 
should come from a range of disciplinary and professional backgrounds. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Qualities necessary for membership 
</b>31. Those nominated would require recognized expertise in human rights and commitment to 
the promotion and protection of human rights.  The nominees&#8217; curricula vitae, including 
information on their commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, should be 
placed on the OHCHR website.  All members of HRCC would be expected to have the capacity 
to undertake studies, alone or with other experts. 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Nomination and election 
</b>32. Full members of HRCC and their alternates must be elected in accordance with the 
principle of equitable geographical distribution.  Only States should be able to nominate 
candidates.  The only limitations to this sovereign capacity are:  (a) they may only nominate their </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 85 
 
</p>
<p>own nationals/citizens; and (b) the nominees shall be persons of outstanding, recognized 
integrity, solid experience in human rights issues and committed to the promotion and protection 
of human rights.  They should be elected by the Council under the same procedure now 
governing the election of members of the Sub-Commission (the rules of procedure governing the 
proceedings of the committees of the General Assembly do not seem to be applicable to this type 
of election).  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Organization and method of work 
</b></p>
<p>33. In order to discharge its mandate, HRCC should meet for 20 working days a year.  It 
could take the form of two sessions of 10 working days each, so as to adapt the expert body to 
the new organization of work of the HRC. 
</p>
<p>34. The present intersessional WGs, as well as the Working Group on Minorities and the 
Social Forum (provided that the Council accepts the proposal to keep them with their present 
mandates), would meet during different months so as to ensure that OHCHR has the capacity to 
provide the necessary logistical support for the proper discharge of their respective mandates.  
</p>
<p>35. Sessional WGs, if any, will not meet during the same hours as the plenary of HRCC. 
</p>
<p>36. The body would undertake an annual review of its programme of work, and would 
establish a long-term programme of work. 
</p>
<p>37. Every four years, the expert body should undertake a review of the continuing need for 
the intersessional WGs. 
</p>
<p>38. To enable the necessary scrutiny of studies and discussion of standard-setting proposals, 
HRCC would need to limit the number of such initiatives and prioritize its activities.  When 
considering reports and standard-setting proposals, HRCC would need to establish means to 
ensure discussion of both general issues and detailed proposals.  When determining its methods 
of work, HRCC is invited to take into account Sub-Commission resolution 2005/32 of 
11 August 2005 and the working paper on the methods of work of the Sub-Commission relating 
to reports (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/5). 
</p>
<p>39. Throughout every aspect of its work, the expert body would seek the widest possible 
participation in its activities on the part of NGOs, NHRIs, Governments and regional and 
intergovernmental organizations, including United Nations organizations and agencies. 
</p>
<p><b>F. Differences in function and method of work between HRCC and 
other mechanisms in the United Nations human rights system 
</b></p>
<p>40. As indicated in paragraph 9, the Council may have to consider the operation of all 
mandates and other mechanisms for which it now has responsibility, in order to ensure the 
coherence of the system as a whole and determine whether all the needs for advice are met.  The 
role of HRCC cannot be determined without understanding the role of other parts of the 
United Nations human rights system. </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 86 
 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Treaty monitoring bodies 
</b></p>
<p>41. It must be clarified that TMBs continue to be a free-standing part of the United Nations 
human rights system, since their activities are not subject to the authority of HRCC but to a 
treaty regime.  Only one issue appears to be relevant in this context.  There is a need for 
coordination and cooperation between TMBs and HRCC with regard to the identification of 
thematic and procedural lacunae.  To meet that need, the coordination (inter-committee) meeting 
of TMBs could be invited to consider including on its agenda an item on identification of 
thematic and procedural lacunae, and consideration could be given to a representative of HRCC 
attending that part of the meeting. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>42. The principal function of the special procedures is to monitor implementation on the 
basis of agreed standards.  It is not, generally speaking, their role to set standards, but to apply 
them.  That said, they may, over time, assist in clarifying the scope of their respective mandates. </p>
<p>43. It is necessary to distinguish between different types of special procedures.  There are 
country special rapporteurs, whose mandate is limited to a particular State; thematic special 
rapporteurs who monitor implementation of an agreed norm and thematic special rapporteurs 
who reflect upon an issue (e.g. human rights and international solidarity; the effects of economic 
reform policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, 
social and cultural rights).  Generally speaking, monitoring is probably best carried out by an 
individual, but reflective work, while it can initially be carried out by an individual, benefits 
from discussion in a wider expert group. 
</p>
<p>44. In the process of rationalization, equal weight must be given to civil and political rights 
and economic, social and cultural rights.  The WGs of the Sub-Commission and the 
Sub-Commission as a whole renew their request that all the special procedures (and also TMBs) 
should include consideration of the situation of marginalized groups, including but not limited to 
indigenous peoples and members of minorities, women, children, the elderly and the disabled, in 
the discussion of any issue under consideration. 
</p>
<p>45. Cooperation needs to be improved between the special procedures and other parts of the 
human rights system.  This has significant implications for the Council, to which the special 
procedures report.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>46. In addition, so as to improve both cooperation and coherence, it is proposed that thematic 
special procedures be invited to attend the sessions of HRCC, as and where necessary, and that a 
member of HRCC should be present, on the basis of equal status, at coordinating meetings of the 
special procedures. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  They also report to the General Assembly. </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 87 
 
</p>
<p>47. It may be possible to envisage closer cooperation with those special procedures which 
reflect upon an issue, as opposed to monitoring compliance with established norms and 
standards. 
</p>
<p>48. It would be helpful if the reports of special rapporteurs were made available to HRCC 
and its WGs, as and where relevant to their own work. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  UPR 
</b></p>
<p>49. In resolution 60/251, paragraph 5 (e), the Assembly established a general framework for 
the UPR mechanism.  It is for the Council to determine the form that UPR should take.  If the 
Council feels that it would be useful, the Sub-Commission is ready to make its own views and 
opinions available.  In the present context, the Sub-Commission will limit itself to making 
general observations regarding the functioning of UPR, insofar as they might have an impact on 
the role of HRCC or a body providing general thematic advice and proposing new standards.   
</p>
<p><b>(a) The UPR process 
</b>50. It will be necessary to gather the information to be relied upon.  That task, which could 
be performed by OHCHR, might be thought inconsistent with the impartiality of OHCHR for it 
to be involved in the process of evaluating the material compiled.  That task may therefore need 
to be undertaken by a group of independent experts (UPR expert body).<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>51. The evaluation could determine the issues and questions to be raised in the interactive 
dialogue.  The interactive dialogue could be conducted by members of the Council, assisted by 
the UPR expert body.  The UPR expert body could formulate recommendations on the basis of 
the dialogue.  Those recommendations could be transmitted to the Council, which could be 
charged with the responsibility of ensuring follow-up.  Two stages might best be performed by 
an expert body:  first, the evaluation of the material and the identification of the issues/questions 
to be raised and, second, the formulation of recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. The success of the UPR process would be compromised if it were to be an entirely 
political process.  For all these reasons, it is submitted that there is a need to involve both 
independent experts and either members of the Council or their nominees, but there should be no 
confusion between the respective roles of the two. 
</p>
<p>53. The need for an expert body does not necessarily mean that the function should be 
performed by HRCC. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  The Council may wish to consider the precedent of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights.  When the Economic and Social Council determined that there was a need for a 
committee in that field, it first chose to operate through a body of governmental experts.  It 
subsequently decided that the functions could only be performed by an independent expert body. </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 88 
 
</p>
<p><b>(b) The expert UPR body 
</b>54. It would appear that UPR will have to consider about 60 cases a year.  This represents a 
considerable caseload.  An expert UPR body would need to be large enough to handle this 
workload and would need to meet sufficiently frequently, and for sessions of sufficient length, to 
have a realistic chance of discharging its responsibilities.  It would be important for the expert 
body to be of sufficient size as to ensure the representation of views within, as well as between, 
different regions. 
</p>
<p>55. Members of the expert UPR body would need to be independent and to have recognized 
expertise in human rights law, as part of international law.  There is consensus in the 
Sub-Commission that members of an expert UPR body should be subject to election.  In that 
regard, the Sub-Commission refers to paragraphs 26-32 above. 
</p>
<p>56. There would appear to be at least two possibilities with regard to the UPR expert body.  
First, it could be completely separate from HRCC.  A second possibility would be to find a way 
for HRCC, or some of its members, to discharge both responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>57. There are two different views among members of the Sub-Commission with regard to the 
desirability of the involvement of a successor body to the Sub-Commission in the UPR process 
itself.  In view of the current uncertainty with regard to what UPR will involve and the form it 
will take, some experts do not consider it advisable that the future expert mechanism should be 
involved in the process.  Should, however, the Council consider it appropriate, the expert advice 
mechanism should make itself available to consider whether such a collegial standing body could 
be involved in UPR, its modalities, and the implications for the rest of the work of such a body. 
</p>
<p>58. Other members of the Sub-Commission are in favour of involving members of HRCC in 
the UPR process.  They think that this would be to the benefit of the coherence of the system as a 
whole and would avoid a disjuncture between country-related and thematic work, which would 
be to the detriment of both.  They suggest that HRCC be increased in size, as compared to the 
Sub-Commission, to 28 members and that four chambers, each consisting of 7 members, with 
interregional representation in each chamber, would undertake those parts of the UPR process 
which would require the input of independent experts.<b>19</b>  
</p>
<p>59. All 28 members would come together for the plenary, thematic sessions of the body.<b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>60. If HRCC were also to have some responsibility in relation to the UPR process in addition 
to its thematic responsibilities, that would have significant implications for the time during 
which members would need to be available.  It is not possible to be more specific until more is 
known of the different options for the UPR process being considered. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  It is suggested that the two additional independent experts could come from the Asian and 
</p>
<p>Eastern European groups; see above. 
<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  See paragraph 33 above. </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 89 
 
</p>
<p>61. There is consensus in the Sub-Commission that any involvement of HRCC in the UPR 
process should not be to the detriment of its thematic responsibilities.   
</p>
<p><b>4.  The 1503 procedure 
</b></p>
<p>62. The consensus view of the Sub-Commission with regard to the changes needed in 
the 1503 procedure in order to enable it to function efficiently and effectively are set out at 
paragraph 22 (c) above. 
</p>
<p><b>G. Report of the intersessional working groups and the Social Forum,  
as requested in paragraph 4 of decision 1/102 
</b></p>
<p>63. The three intersessional WGs - the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, 
the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and the Working Group on Minorities - and the 
Social Forum are unique platforms in the United Nations human rights system in terms of their 
attention to vulnerable communities and constituencies that might otherwise go unrepresented.  
The three intersessional WGs and the Social Forum provide practically the only human rights 
forums where the concerned groups and communities can effectively participate in 
United Nations meetings and bring up potential and real problems facing them. 
</p>
<p>64. The work of the three intersessional WGs and the Social Forum has several components.  
They: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Follow recent developments in all parts of the world in their designated areas of 
work; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Identify human rights issues and problems facing the affected communities; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Solicit advice from a wide range of representatives of the concerned communities, 
academia, NGOs and IGOs, as well as Governments; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Prepare working papers and propose studies on human rights topics of significance to 
the understanding and realization of human rights for the affected communities; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Call for seminars and workshops with wide participation by the communities and 
other concerned stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Initiate standard-setting activities and make suggestions on institutional and 
procedural matters; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Contribute to increasing awareness and understanding of multiple human rights issues 
of relevance to the affected communities; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Interact in a complementary fashion with debates and suggestions concerning the 
relevant special procedures, treaty bodies and OHCHR; and </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 90 
 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Facilitate dialogue with all interested parties in order to further 
and strengthen constructive and peaceful solutions to problems brought to their 
attention. 
</p>
<p>65. Meetings of the three intersessional WGs and the Social Forum are very well attended.  
They operate in a low-key manner, encouraging an exchange of views and seeking practical 
solutions.  They have identified and are in the process of dealing with highly important human 
rights issues affecting the concerned communities and constituencies.  Two of the intersessional 
WGs benefit from established voluntary funds and a proposal for a third voluntary fund is well 
advanced.  The Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery has inspired NGOs to 
increase assistance to victims of slavery-like practices. 
</p>
<p>66. For the reasons here stated, the Sub-Commission strongly recommends that, whatever the 
outcome of the ongoing reform, the three intersessional WGs and the Social Forum should 
continue their work as expert forums, with open access for the concerned communities and 
constituencies and with sufficient time at their disposal in intersessional meetings. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Summary of recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, taking into 
account General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and Human Rights Council 
decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006 and reaffirming the analysis and conclusions contained in the 
annex to Sub-Commission decision 2005/114 of 9 August 2000, submits the following summary 
of its recommendations for the consideration of the Human Rights Council: 
</p>
<p><b>A. Need for a standing, collegial, independent expert mechanism of 
general competence in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>1. Taking into account General Assembly resolution 60/251, in which the Assembly 
stipulates that, in order to function effectively and efficiently, the Human Rights Council 
requires expert advice, in a coherent and comprehensive manner, on a wide variety of 
issues, it is recommended that the Human Rights Council should maintain a standing 
collegial body of independent experts. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Mandate, functions and structure of the body resulting 
from decisions of the Council following the conclusion 
of the review process 
</b></p>
<p>2. The functions of the body include, first, the promotion and progressive 
development of human rights, including, but not limited, to studies on the basis of a 
plan of work; second, the protection of human rights, including any possible role under 
the universal periodic review, if requested by the Human Rights Council, and the 
1503 procedure; third, acting as a crossroads or hub within the human rights system, 
so as to ensure that there is coherence within the system as a whole; and fourth, the 
identification of gaps and challenges in the human rights system. </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 91 
 
</p>
<p>3. The future expert advice mechanism should retain the current powers of initiative 
of the Sub-Commission, such as the ability to make recommendations; to adopt 
resolutions, decisions and Chairperson&#8217;s statements; to create sessional working groups 
and to undertake the preparation of working papers. 
</p>
<p>4. The future expert advice mechanism requires the mandate and the resources to 
fulfil whatever functions are given to it. 
</p>
<p><b>Promotion and progressive development of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>5. The expert advice should be provided on the basis of detailed analysis, study and 
discussion.  The studies should be comprehensive and action oriented within a 
preconceived yet flexible overall work plan that corresponds to and complements issues 
on the agendas of other parts of the human rights system. 
</p>
<p>6. The advice needed includes recommendations with regard to standard-setting, 
including both norms and other standards (e.g. guidelines, principles). 
</p>
<p>7. The expert advice mechanism would undertake studies and standard-setting at the 
request of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>8. In order to meet the concerns expressed by experts, NGOs, NHRIs, Governments, 
regional and intergovernmental organizations and United Nations organizations and 
agencies, as expressed in general debate, the future expert advice mechanism requires a 
power of initiative.  When conducting research on its own initiative, a working paper 
should be produced by a member of the body.  If the body wishes to develop the work by 
means of a study, it would seek the authorization of the Human Rights Council, giving 
reasons for the need for the study. 
</p>
<p>9. OHCHR should provide all necessary assistance requested by those experts 
undertaking studies, on the same terms and conditions as special rapporteurs appointed 
by the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>10. OHCHR should provide annual accounts, accompanying the report of the expert, 
explaining how the resources allocated to a study or activity have been used. 
</p>
<p><b>Working groups and the Social Forum 
</b></p>
<p>11. Intersessional working groups and the Social Forum should be an integral part of 
the structure of the future expert advice mechanism.  They would meet between annual 
sessions, for five working days, and would provide a specialist focus on certain issues, 
such as is, or used to be, the case for indigenous issues, minority issues and contemporary 
forms of slavery, and a social forum, with the full participation of representatives of 
affected communities and peoples as well as relevant organizations and institutions. </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 92 
 
</p>
<p>12. Other intersessional working groups could be proposed by the future expert 
advice mechanism, but the establishment of such working groups would require the 
authorization of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>13. Those working groups and the Social Forum could engage in studies and 
standard-setting and should report to the plenary body, so as to ensure a systematic and 
coherent approach. 
</p>
<p>14. The future expert advice mechanism may create sessional working groups where 
necessary for the better handling of its work, provided that this is not to the detriment of 
the holding of plenary sessions of the body. 
</p>
<p><b>Protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>15. <b>Universal periodic review.  </b>The Sub-Commission is of the view, first, that the 
Human Rights Council will require input from an independent expert body as part of the 
universal periodic review process and, second, that if a successor body to the 
Sub-Commission were to be involved in the universal periodic review process, it should 
not be at the expense of the other functions, set out here, of a standing, collegial body of 
independent experts. 
</p>
<p>16. There are two different views among members of the Sub-Commission with 
regard to the desirability of the involvement of a successor body to the Sub-Commission 
in the process itself.  In view of the current uncertainty with regard to what universal 
periodic review will involve and the form it will take, some experts do not consider it 
advisable that the future expert advice mechanism should be involved in the 
UPR process.  Should, however, the Human Rights Council consider it appropriate, the 
future expert advice mechanism should make itself available to consider whether such a 
collegial standing body could be involved in universal periodic review, its modalities, 
and the implications for the rest of the work of such a body. 
</p>
<p>17. Others are of the view that involvement in the universal periodic review process 
would assist the thematic work of the independent expert body and that both functions 
should be performed by the same body.  They consider that the initial evaluation of the 
material compiled would need to be undertaken by independent experts.  They suggest 
that the future expert advice mechanism be increased in size (see further below) to 
28 members and that four chambers with 7 members in each chamber, with interregional 
representation in each chamber, undertake those parts of the UPR process which require 
the input of independent experts.  The meeting time necessary to discharge any 
responsibilities in relation to universal periodic review should not be to the detriment of 
the time required for thematic discussions within the body as a whole.  All 28 members 
would come together for the plenary, annual thematic sessions of the body. </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 93 
 
</p>
<p>18. <b>1503 procedure.  </b>The Sub-Commission emphasizes the need for a confidential 
complaints procedure that may provide an effective and timely remedy to victims of 
gross violations of human rights.  To that end, the reforms set out in Economic and Social 
Council resolution 2000/3 of 16 June 2000 should be modified so as to:  (a) restore the 
authority of a plenary body of independent experts, as envisaged in paragraph 5 of 
Economic and Social Council resolution 1503 (XLVIII), to refer to the Human Rights 
Council for consideration particular situations which appear to reveal a consistent pattern 
of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights; and (b) ensure that a working 
group of the Human Rights Council, as in the case of the Working Group on Situations of 
the Commission on Human Rights until the reform of 2000, would have a preparatory 
role, aimed at facilitating the Council&#8217;s consideration of the situations referred to it, and 
not a filtering function. 
</p>
<p><b>Coherence function 
</b></p>
<p>19. The coherence function would be discharged by establishing close cooperation 
and coordination between all parts of the human rights system, and other parts of the 
international system as appropriate, and by giving the future expert advice mechanism the 
mandate to promote the coherence of the system as a whole.  In order to achieve this 
goal, without prejudice to other forms of cooperation and coordination, the expert body 
should meet for one meeting a year with thematic special procedures established by the 
Human Rights Council to examine possible input to be provided by each subsystem to 
the work of the other so that the Council receives from both of them coherent and 
well-thought-out proposals and to consider issues of common interest within the mandate 
of the future expert advice mechanism.  The expert body should be represented, on the 
basis of equal status, at coordination meetings of the special procedures. 
</p>
<p><b>Identification of lacunae, challenges and implementation needs and follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>20. The identification of lacunae, challenges and implementation needs and follow-up 
would be facilitated by, first, assisting the widest possible participation in the work of the 
future expert advice mechanism (see paragraph 8 of the recommendations above); 
second, by ensuring that the body maintains a general debate, as a separate agenda item; 
third, by ensuring that the body maintains a separate agenda item entitled identification of 
lacunae, challenges, implementation needs and, fourth, by ensuring that the body 
maintains a separate agenda item on the follow-up of previous initiatives of the expert 
body. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Criteria for membership and election 
</b></p>
<p><b>Composition 
</b></p>
<p>21. The future expert advice mechanism should be composed of not fewer 
than 26 members (see paragraph 17 of the recommendations above) in order to ensure a 
range of disciplinary and professional backgrounds and to reflect different perspectives 
within, as well as between, different regions. </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 94 
 
</p>
<p>22. States should be encouraged to nominate alternates, in order to contribute to the 
work of the body. 
</p>
<p>23. There would be a need for both continuity and new members in the composition 
of the body.  The system of partial renewal of half the membership, which at present 
takes the form of elections every two years, should be maintained.  That would require a 
mandate of an even number of years, such as the present four-year mandates. 
</p>
<p>24. To be able to engage effectively in the work of the future expert advice 
mechanism, including in the elaboration of studies, at least two successive four-year 
terms would be a desirable minimum.  Views vary, however, as to whether there should 
be a maximum number of successive mandates. 
</p>
<p><b>Qualifications 
</b>25. Those nominated would require recognized expertise in human rights and 
commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>26. The nominees&#8217; curricula vitae, including information on their commitment 
to the promotion and protection of human rights, should be placed on the OHCHR 
website. 
</p>
<p>27. All members of the future expert advice mechanism would be expected to have 
the capacity to undertake studies, alone or with other experts.  The undertaking of studies 
should be spread as equitably as possible among the experts. 
</p>
<p><b>Nomination and election 
</b></p>
<p>28. Members of the future expert advice mechanism, and their alternates, could be 
nominated by any Member State of which they are a national. 
</p>
<p>29. The body should reflect an equitable geographical and gender distribution and the 
experts should come from a range of disciplinary and professional backgrounds. 
</p>
<p>30. The members of the body would be elected by the Human Rights Council, as 
election is the most democratic method of selection. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>31. In order to discharge its mandate, the future expert advice mechanism would 
need to meet in plenary session for 20 working days a year.  This could take the form of 
two sessions of 10 working days each, so as to adapt the expert body to the new 
organization of work of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>32. The body would undertake an annual review of its programme of work, and 
would establish a long-term programme of work. </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 95 
 
</p>
<p>33. Every four years, the future expert advice mechanism should undertake a review 
of the continuing need for the intersessional working groups. 
</p>
<p>34. To enable the necessary scrutiny of studies and discussion of standard-setting 
proposals, the future expert advice mechanism would need to limit the number of such 
initiatives and prioritize its activities. 
</p>
<p>35. The expert body, when considering reports and standard-setting proposals, would 
need to establish means of ensuring that there was discussion of both general issues and 
detailed proposals. 
</p>
<p>36. When determining its methods of work, the future expert advice mechanism is 
invited to take into account Sub-Commission resolution 2005/32 of 11 August 2005. 
</p>
<p>37. Throughout every aspect of its work, the expert body would seek the widest 
possible participation in its activities on the part of NGOs, NHRIs, Governments and 
regional and intergovernmental organizations, including United Nations organizations 
and agencies. 
</p>
<p>38. HRCC should assume responsibility for and continue ongoing studies, in 
accordance with the resolutions and decisions adopted by the Sub-Commission at its 
fifty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p><b>II. OVERVIEW OF PAST AND RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS  
OF THE SUB-COMMISSION 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Sub-Commission began its life shortly after the establishment of the United Nations 
and the Commission on Human Rights.  It has throughout been a historical provider of expertise 
and a pathfinder contributing to the policy deliberations and decisions of governmental bodies in 
developing understanding of the human rights issues facing communities and groups, elaborating 
human rights standards, advancing towards universal implementation and realization of human 
rights, and shaping insights into new problems. 
</p>
<p>69. The Sub-Commission has taken initiatives and produced pioneering studies on problems 
little understood at the time, such as inequality and discrimination, equality in the administration 
of justice, gender justice, the rights of persons belonging to minorities, the rights of indigenous 
peoples, the right of self-determination, the eradication of apartheid, the new international 
economic order and human rights, the rights of migrants, religious freedom, harmful traditional 
practices affecting the health of women and the girl child, and the relationship between peace 
and human rights, to mention only a few.  More recently, the Sub-Commission has undertaken 
many further studies, for example the studies on constructive and peaceful solutions to problems 
involving minorities, the right to restitution, compensation and rehabilitation for victims of gross 
violations of human rights, terrorism and human rights, extreme poverty, impunity, corruption, 
the right to drinking water and sanitation, and human rights and the human genome.  (A list of 
the key studies and reports of the Sub-Commission is appended.)  Through its research the 
Sub-Commission has laid the foundations for the deliberations of intergovernmental bodies and 
the development of policy prescriptions and norms. </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 96 
 
</p>
<p>70. The Sub-Commission, on the basis of its research and studies, has provided major 
contributions to standard-setting on a variety of topics, starting from the International Covenants 
on Human Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, and traversing the codification of 
international human rights law up to and including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, the Set of Principles for the protection and promotion of human rights 
through action to combat impunity, the Guidelines for the Regulation of Computerized Personal 
Data Files, and the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Remedy and Reparation for 
Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law.  In this regard, partnership between the Sub-Commission and 
intergovernmental bodies, notably the former Commission on Human Rights, has been a key 
ingredient of the successes registered by the United Nations in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>71. The Sub-Commission has contributed to reinforcing the universality, indivisibility and 
interdependence of human rights through its examination of issues and themes affecting people 
in their daily lives.  It has made major contributions to the promotion and protection of 
economic, social and cultural rights alongside civil and political rights.  The Sub-Commission&#8217;s 
work on respect for human rights during states of emergency and its work on human rights and 
terrorism are examples of the innovative insights it has provided into new human rights 
problems. 
</p>
<p>72. The Sub-Commission&#8217;s examination of the situation of vulnerable groups, such as 
national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, indigenous peoples, migrants, people living 
in slavery or slavery-like conditions, or people affected by adverse social practices, has helped 
shed light on the problems of such groups and has helped chart policies and strategies for 
remedying existing problems and preventing them in the future.  The Sub-Commission has also 
concerned itself with the role of non-State actors, in particular by elaborating principles on the 
responsibility of transnational corporations in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>73. The Sub-Commission played a pioneering role in the development of what subsequently 
became the confidential communications procedure established under Economic and Social 
Council resolution 1503 (XLVIII) by formulating, at the request of the Commission on 
Human Rights, the criteria for the admissibility of communications and spearheaded the 
application of that procedure, both through the Sub-Commission&#8217;s Working Group on 
Communications (the first stage in identifying those communications which appeared to reveal a 
consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms) and, until 2000, by determining in plenary which situations of grave violations of 
human rights should be referred to the Commission for consideration.  In the 25 years from 1975 
to 2000, the Commission was seized with some 80 country situations thus referred to it by the 
Sub-Commission. </p>

 <p> A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
 page 97 
 
</p>
<p>74. The Sub-Commission has had an invaluable partnership with NGOs in consultative status 
with the Economic and Social Council.  In intergovernmental bodies, where such NGOs 
participate, they emphasize the presentation of information about particular issues or situations.  
In the Sub-Commission, NGOs have joined with its members in awareness-raising exercises 
aimed at the development of understanding, insights, policies, norms and strategies and the 
mobilization of conscience.  There is no other United Nations human rights body where such 
in-depth joint brainstorming on human rights takes place. 
</p><p>75. The Sub-Commission&#8217;s Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery has 
unearthed practices and policies the world over that called for remedial action.  No other body 
has made such a sustained contribution in that area of human rights.  Its highlighting of the plight 
of large numbers of human beings living and working in conditions tantamount to slavery has 
been of major importance for the promotion and protection of their rights. 
76. The Sub-Commission&#8217;s Working Group on Indigenous Populations, building on a 
historic global study on the issue by its Special Rapporteur, brought indigenous peoples to 
the United Nations for the first time in large numbers, and continues to do so.  The 
Sub-Commission&#8217;s patient and persistent efforts to draft international standards on the 
promotion and protection of the human rights of indigenous peoples finally resulted in the 
adoption of the United Nations Declaration.  The deliberate human rights focus of the work of 
the Sub-Commission and its Working Group, through its studies, deliberations and hearings in 
this area, is unmatched by any other United Nations body. 
</p>
<p>77. The Sub-Commission&#8217;s continuing work, in plenary and through its Working Group on 
Minorities, on the protection of minority rights has sought to buttress international and regional 
norms on this topic.  The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to 
National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities was built on the study by and normative 
inputs of the Sub-Commission. 
</p>
<p>78. The Sub-Commission&#8217;s Social Forum has been another pivotal forum for alerting the 
international community to problems affecting the realization of the human rights of those living 
in poverty and for the promotion of dignity and basic economic, social and cultural rights, as 
well as civil and political rights, for the poor.  The Social Forum has helped bring human rights 
closer to the needs of the masses of the people. 
</p>
<p>79. The feature that distinguishes the Sub-Commission from any other human rights body in 
the United Nations system is its assembling of the shared insights and expertise of experts and 
practitioners from all parts of the world.  The Sub-Commission has not been without its 
imperfections, but throughout its history it has been distinguished by its capacity for detached, 
expert examination of issues, in partnership with civil society, and its contribution of insights 
and proposals for further deliberation and decision in intergovernmental bodies. </p>

 <p>A/HRC/Sub.1/58/36 
page 98 
 
</p>
<p>80. The value of the Sub-Commission as a venue for the gathering of ideas can be seen in its 
historic work on issues such as human rights and scientific and technological developments, 
human rights and biodiversity, human rights and the human genome, and human rights in the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  Without the input from a group of experts 
from all regions of the world, it is hard to see how the United Nations could have cultivated an 
understanding of ongoing, or emerging, human rights issues, or have developed policies, 
prescriptions and norms for addressing them. 
</p>
<p>81. The partnership between a group of experts and governmental bodies is also 
reflected in the fact that when the original system of periodic reporting by Member States on 
human rights was consolidated in 1965 by the Economic and Social Council in its 
resolution 1074 C (XXXIX), the Sub-Commission, then called the Sub-Commission on the 
Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, was requested to undertake the initial 
study of the materials submitted and to make comments and recommendations thereon to the 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>82. In its annual deliberations on developments relating to the prevention of discrimination, 
equality between men and women, the protection of minorities, and the promotion and 
protection of human rights, the Sub-Commission has benefited from inputs received from other 
United Nations bodies, specialized agencies, intergovernmental bodies and regional 
organizations, national human rights institutions and NGOs.  This expert global review, 
undertaken together with partner institutions, has made the Sub-Commission a leading forum for 
discussion and debate on a broad spectrum of human rights issues.  The world of human rights 
insights and expertise has assembled at the Sub-Commission. 
</p>
<p>83. It may also be recalled that the Sub-Commission made major contributions, both to the 
preparation of world conferences on human rights as well as through active participation in and 
follow-up to these conferences.  Foremost among these were the International Conference on 
Human Rights held in Tehran in 1968, the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna 
in 1993, and the two World Conferences Against Racism in 1978 and 1983 in Geneva, and the 
World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance 
in Durban, South Africa, in 2001. 
</p>
<p>84. Recently concluded and ongoing studies of the Sub-Commission also address important 
and emerging issues, such as administration of justice through military tribunals, responsibilities 
of non-State actors, and the links between human rights law and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>85. In recalling the past, reflecting on the present and contemplating the future, and in the 
light of this overview, it would be reasonable to conclude that the intergovernmental human 
rights bodies, in particular the Human Rights Council, will continue to require the input of a 
body of qualified independent human rights experts such as the Sub-Commission on the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. </p>

</b></p>
<p> The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights begins its 
fifty-eighth session at a tragic moment when a brutal and barbarous war has already deprived a 
thousand men, women and children of their inherent right to life, several thousands have been 
injured and maimed and a million innocent people displaced from their homes. 
 Bound by its mandate to promote and protect respect for human rights, the 
Sub-Commission: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Expresses its deep grief and outrage at the massive violations of human rights in 
Lebanon; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Extends its condolences and sympathy to all the victims of the war and their families; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Voices the hope that the Security Council, acting in discharge of its primary 
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, will bring 
about cessation of the war without further delay and promote an urgent settlement of 
the conflict in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, 
including the Charter of the United Nations and international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Calls upon all parties to ensure the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance, 
including water, food and medical assistance. </p>
