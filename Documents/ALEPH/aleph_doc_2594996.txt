Overview
With the Company’s release of its second quarter results, President and CEO of Forbes Energy
Services, John Crisp, commented, “We continue to see an incremental decline in revenue and
gross margin as indicated by the company’s second quarter performance. Consolidated
revenues decreased nearly 11.0% from the first quarter, while gross margins decreased 11.6%
quarter-over-quarter. The bright spot during this time was our management’s ability to do more
with less and their continued efforts to reduce overhead costs and gain efficiencies in operations,
which translated into a slightly higher gross margin percentage.
“As we move into the third quarter, market behavior is erratic, but as expected considering the
lack of stability in commodity prices. From a broad scale perspective, there may be a more
positive attitude coming from geo-specific upticks in utilization, but pricing is expected to remain
stagnant at depressed levels through the remainder of the year. We are learning to operate in a
new paradigm and are adjusting our organizational and cost structure to align with the
constricted market. A significant advantage we have is our loyal and dedicated employee base,
including our frontline operators all the way through our senior management. Our team’s
execution has been beyond expectation and we are very appreciative of their efforts.”
Recent Developments
On June 15, 2016, the Company elected not to make the $12.6 million semi-annual interest
payment due on the 9% senior notes due 2019, or the 9% Senior Notes. The indenture governing
the 9% Senior Notes, or the 9% Senior Indenture, provides that the failure to make such interest
payment constitutes an event of default after a 30-day cure period. The Company has not paid
the interest payment. Accordingly, an event of default under the 9% Senior Indenture occurred,
which would give the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of principal amount of 9% Senior
Notes the option to declare all the 9% Senior Notes due and payable immediately. Additionally,
such failure to make the interest payment within the 30-day cure period also constituted an event
of default under the Company’s existing loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement,
with certain lenders and Regions Bank, as agent for the secured parties, or the Agent, which
would allow the Agent to declare the Company’s obligations under the Loan Agreement
immediately due and payable and to exercise the Agent’s and the lenders other rights under the
Loan Agreement.
    
On July 15, 2016, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries, or the Guarantor Subs, entered
into a forbearance agreement with holders of a majority of the 9% Senior Notes pursuant to the
9% Senior Indenture. That forbearance agreement has subsequently been joined by other
holders of the 9% Senior Notes such that 62.1% of the holders of the 9% Senior Notes, or the
Forbearing Holders, are now parties to the forbearance agreement, or the Indenture Forbearance
Agreement. Pursuant to the Indenture Forbearance Agreement, the Forbearing Holders have
agreed to forbear, during the Indenture Forbearance Period (as defined below), from exercising
default remedies or accelerating any indebtedness under the 9% Senior Indenture resulting from
the Company’s failure to make its semi-annual interest payment due on June 15, 2016 on the 9%
Senior Notes. The forbearance period, or the Indenture Forbearance Period, under the Indenture
Forbearance Agreement will expire on the earlier to occur of (i) 11:59 p.m. prevailing Central
Time on September 16, 2016 and (ii) certain other specified events under the terms of the
Indenture Forbearance Agreement.
Additionally, on July 15, 2016, FES Ltd. and the Guarantor Subs, entered into a forbearance
agreement and an amendment, or the Loan Forbearance Agreement, to the Loan Agreement.
Pursuant to the Loan Forbearance Agreement, the Agent and the lenders, or the Loan Forbearing
Parties, have agreed to forbear, during the Loan Forbearance Period (as defined below), from
exercising default remedies or accelerating any indebtedness under the Loan Agreement
resulting from the Company’s failure to make its semi-annual interest payment due on June 15,
2016 on the 9% Senior Notes. The forbearance period, or the Loan Forbearance Period, under
the Loan Forbearance Agreement will expire on the earlier to occur of (i) 5:01 p.m. prevailing
Dallas, Texas time on October 14, 2016 and (ii) certain other specified events under the terms of
the Loan Forbearance Agreement. In connection with the Loan Forbearance Agreement, the
Company is required to maintain cash on deposit of no less than $17.5 million with Agent, and
the lenders under the Loan Agreement are not obligated to make additional advances.
The Company and the Guarantor Subs entered into the Indenture Forbearance Agreement and
the Loan Forbearance Agreement, or the Forbearance Agreements, to provide the Company and
the Guarantor Subs with time to continue discussions with the
Forbearing Holders and the Loan Forbearing Parties with respect to a proposed capital
restructuring of the Company, which are ongoing.
Impairment
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company experienced a triggering event resulting from
the continuing decline in operating revenues due to an industry-wide slowdown, which began in
the second half of 2014. As a result, the Company assessed all of its long-lived assets for
impairment and an impairment loss of $14.5 million was recorded relating to the intangibles in
the fluid logistics segment.
Results of Operations
Revenues for the Company declined 11.0% from $31.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 to $28.4
million in the current reporting quarter as a result of the continued decline in oil and gas drilling
and production activity.
Year-over-year, the weekly U.S. land rig count fell approximately 51.0% from 859 at the end of
the second quarter of 2015, to 421 at the end of the second quarter of 2016. Rig counts in the
state of Texas dropped 46.3% over the same period, from 361 at the end of the second quarter of
2015, to 194 at the end of the second quarter of 2016. As a result, utilization and pricing
continued a downward trend in the second quarter of 2016.
Gross margin decreased to $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $2.1 million
in the first quarter of 2016. Gross margin, as a percent of revenues, was 6.4% in each quarter.
Gross margin dollars decreased at a slightly lower rate than the decrease in revenues, while
gross margin percentage remained flat, which reflects continued cost-reduction efforts.
Well Servicing and Fluid Logistics hours increased by 7.3% and 9.1%, respectively, from the first
quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2016. This increase in utilization was offset by continued
pricing pressures and mix of work performed, which resulted in lower revenues for the current
quarter.
Management continues to analyze and reduce labor and non-core expenses and close and
consolidate certain operating locations. The Company intends to continue its efforts to reduce
costs, streamline administrative and operations functions and re-size and re-allocate the asset
base to adapt to market demand.
Consolidated direct operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016, were $26.6
million, compared to $29.9 million in the prior quarter.
Uses of capital have been limited to funding critical operations and the absorption of previously
leased equipment.
Well Servicing Segment
The Well Servicing segment comprised 59.1% of consolidated revenues for the three months
ended June 30, 2016. Segment revenues decreased by $1.9 million, or 10.2%, to $16.8 million,
compared to $18.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. Rates continued to decrease through the
quarter ended June 30, 2016, as a result of pricing pressure.
 
Well Servicing gross margin decreased to $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, from $2.0
million in the first quarter of 2016. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin decreased to 6.7%
in the second quarter of 2016, compared to 10.6% in the first quarter of 2016. This decrease in
margin was primarily driven by lower pricing, as well as revenues decreasing more quickly than
variable costs.
The Company recorded 40,459 well service hours in the second quarter of 2016, compared to
37,703 hours in the first quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures in the Well Servicing segment for
the quarter ended June 30, 2016, were $720 thousand and consisted of purchases of previously
leased vehicles.
 
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had a fleet of 173 well service rigs, six coiled tubing spreads
and related equipment.
Fluid Logistics Segment
The Fluid Logistics segment comprised 40.9% of consolidated revenues for the three months
ended June 30, 2016. Segment revenues decreased by $1.6 million, or 12.1%, to $11.6 million
compared to $13.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. The revenue decrease between the
quarters resulted from a lower composite rate, which was partially offset by increased hours.  The
lower composite rate resulted from a larger percentage of revenues generated from fluid hauling
as compared to revenues from other higher-priced heavy trucks.
Fluid Logistics gross margin increased to $684 thousand in the second quarter of 2016, from $57
thousand in the first quarter of 2016. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin increased to
5.9% in the second quarter of 2016, compared to 0.4% in the first quarter. This increase was
primarily driven by management’s continued focus on cost savings, consolidation of locations,
and resource optimization.
The Company recorded 106,015 truck hours during the second quarter of 2016, compared to
97,195 hours in the first quarter of 2016. The Company’s heavy truck fleet totaled 556 at June 30,
2016, which included 447 vacuum trucks. Capital expenditures for the Fluid Logistics segment
were approximately $2.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, and consisted primarily of
purchases of previously leased heavy trucks and other vehicles.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had $68.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $298.8
million in contractual debt and capital leases. The $298.8 million in contractual debt was
comprised of $277.2 million in senior notes ($280 million face amount) net of deferred financing
costs, $6.6 million in capital leases on equipment and insurance notes, and $15.0 million drawn
on its revolving credit facility. Of the total debt, $1.3 million was classified as long-term debt and
$297.5 million was classified as current debt. The $6.6 million in equipment and insurance notes
consisted of $5.0 million in equipment notes and $1.6 million in insurance notes related to the
Company’s general liability, workers compensation, and other insurances.
As of August 10, 2016, the Company had $54.4 million in unrestricted cash. In addition to the
$15.0 million drawn on its secured credit facility, the Company has letters of credit outstanding in
the amount of $10.7 million primarily related to insurance policies. Pursuant to the Loan
Forbearance Agreement, the Company is required to cash collateralize such letters of credit.
Also pursuant to the Loan Forbearance Agreement, the Company is required to maintain cash on
deposit of no less than $17.5 million with Agent, and the lenders under the Loan Agreement are
not obligated to make additional advances.
Absent the effect of the event of default resulting from the non-payment of interest due on June
15, 2016, on the 9% Senior Notes and the related Loan Forbearance Agreement, the borrowing
availability under the credit facility would be $49.3 million.
Net cash used in operating activities totaled $5.3 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $7.5 million in the previous
quarter. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a combination of a
larger net loss in the second quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2016, coupled with a
reduction in cash provided by the change in accounts receivable. This was largely offset by the
Company's election not to make its $12.6 million semi-annual interest payment due on the 9%
Senior Notes on June 15, 2016.
Cash used in investing activities was $2.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to $3.0 million in the previous quarter. As noted above, capital expenditures during the
three months ended June 30, 2016, amounted to $3.2 million, which was comprised of
expenditures in the Company’s Fluid Logistics segment of approximately $2.4 million and $720
thousand for the Well Servicing segment.
Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended June 30, 2016, and for the previous
quarter was $1.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, consisting primarily of payments on
equipment notes.
