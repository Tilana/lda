<p><b>  Mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo</b>** 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Special Rapporteur visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 5 to 15 
October 2009 to investigate allegations of unlawful killings. His investigations focused on 
political killings in Kinshasa and Bas Congo; killings by rebels and the Congolese army in 
the Kivus and in Province Orientale; and deaths in prisons. He also investigated incidents 
of sexual violence leading to death; the killing of accused &#8220;witches&#8221;; the killing of human 
rights defenders and journalists; and vigilante killings. 
 In separate conflicts in the Kivus and Province Orientale, many hundreds of 
civilians were killed in 2009 by rebel groups, including the Forces d&#233;mocratiques de 
lib&#233;ration du Rwanda (FDLR) and the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army (LRA), as well as by 
Government forces. In both areas, there have been a series of poorly planned military 
operations by the Government and the United Nations which, while having the laudable 
aim of neutralizing rebel forces, have achieved far too little and at a catastrophic civilian 
cost. The rebels have responded to the military operations by launching devastating revenge 
attacks on the insufficiently protected civilian Congolese population, committing 
widespread sexual violence, forced labour, kidnapping, looting, village burning and 
killings. Not only have the Government and the United Nations failed to plan effectively 
for civilian protection in their operations, but the Government forces have themselves

<p><b>2</b> GE.<footnote name="1">8. The FDLR leadership is well known, and the group has a strong command and 
control structure. While many of its most senior leaders are based outside the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, they are in regular contact with commanders on the ground in the 
Kivus. At the time of my mission, known leaders of the FDLR residing in Germany 
remained free. However, in November 2009, two leaders (Ignace Murwanashyaka, 
President of the FDLR, and Straton Musoni, Vice-President) were arrested in Germany on 
suspicion of responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. This is a significant step, and I will continue to monitor the 
progress of the German investigations and prosecutions. Similar efforts should also be 
made by France, Belgium and other countries with respect to alleged FDLR leaders 
residing in their territories. </footnote>0-14371 
</p>
<p>actively abused the civilian population. In some cases, army abuses have been small scale 
and motivated by the poor pay and rations provided to soldiers. In others, Congolese 
soldiers have massacred civilians in the Kivus perceived to support the rebels, or otherwise 
seen to be ethnic or political rivals. The rapid and poorly conceived integration of former 
Congr&#232;s national pour la d&#233;fense du peuple (CNDP) rebels, including senior commanders 
accused of grave war crimes, into the Congolese army has been a primary cause of these 
large-scale killings. 
</p>
<p> Despite Government claims that it has pushed the LRA out of Province Orientale, 
the group continues its brutal attacks on civilians. Indeed, at the time of writing, LRA 
attacks, often resulting in the disfigurement of victims&#8217; faces and death, were on the 
increase. In addition, the deployment of units of ex-CNDP members into Province 
Orientale has also been accompanied by a rise in reports of army abuses against the 
population. With military and rebel abuses encouraging the growth of local self-defence 
groups, long-term stability in the province will be under serious threat unless the 
Government and the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo (MONUC) work to promote an accountable and effective security presence in 
Orientale. 
</p>
<p> In the west of the country, unaccountable and politicized security forces in Kinshasa 
and Bas Congo killed hundreds of opposition supporters in 2007 and 2008. Despite the 
very real threat of further violence as the next election approaches, little international 
attention is paid to the issue, and the Government has taken no steps to reform the security 
sector. 
</p>
<p> Across the country, many people die in detention from hunger and atrocious prison 
conditions. Most prisons receive no Government budget, and prisoners are fed by their 
families. The interior of most facilities is controlled by the prisoners themselves and, not 
surprisingly, escapes and violence are common. Records and monitoring are so poor that 
the Government does not even know how many prisons and prisoners there are in the 
country. 
</p>
<p> Children and women accused of being witches are also killed in the country, with 
officials all too often turning a blind eye to the violence. Similarly, private acts of &#8220;justice&#8221; 
against suspected criminals are common, and the police response is slow or non-existent. 
Human rights defenders and journalists are also regularly threatened, and some have been 
killed for their efforts to promote respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p> Impunity for all forms of killings is the norm. This is in part due to systemic 
problems in the justice system, especially corruption at all levels, regular political 
interference and severe resource constraints. While there have been some recent 
improvements in the military justice system in the east of the country, impunity for senior 
commanders remains pervasive. The Government refuses to investigate and arrest 
suspected war criminals, including Bosco Ntaganda, who is wanted by the International 
Criminal Court. At the time of writing, MONUC was still yet to publish a clear 
conditionality policy for its support to Congolese army operations and, despite widespread 
army abuses, the United Nations had withdrawn support from only one Congolese unit. 
</p>
<p> At the end of the mission in October 2009, the Special Rapporteur recommended six 
achievable key reforms to reduce killings and promote accountability in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. These included (a) that United Nations assistance be pre-
conditioned on the Government providing uniforms to soldiers that identify their name and 
rank; (b) the indictment of senior commanders accused of war crimes; (c) vastly improved 
preventative and protection measures for civilians; (d) the integration of the Republican 
Guard into the Congolese army; (e) a census of the prison population and the establishment 
of a budget for each prison; and (f) and improvements to United Nations monitoring and </p>

<p>GE.<footnote name="1">3. Most of the large-scale attacks occurred in the context of attempts by all sides to the 
conflict to exert control over villages or other strategic locations. Unable to successfully 
engage the FARDC militarily, the FDLR devised a deliberate campaign of intimidation and 
revenge against civilians. The campaign&#8217;s central pillars were brutal rapes, killings and 
village burnings. The aims were two-fold. First, in order to gain an information and civilian 
support-base advantage vis-&#224;-vis the army and the Government, the FDLR sought to control 
civilians by punishing those accused of supporting the Government of the Democratic </footnote>0-14371 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>reporting. At the time of writing, no real progress on implementing any of these reforms 
seems to have been achieved. In the report, the Special Rapporteur analyses in detail the 
urgent need for their implementation. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.<footnote name="3">7. On 16 October 2009, MONUC announced that it would &#8220;withdraw support from 
battalions that show a blatant disregard for international humanitarian law&#8221;.<footnote name="1">2. FDLR killings have been recorded every year since its arrival in the Kivus, but the 
numbers increased dramatically under operations Umoja Wetu and Kimia II. In 2008, there 
was an average of 10 civilian killings per month by the FDLR. In 2009, killings increased 
five-fold.

machetes, raping women so brutally that they died from their injuries, and shooting and 
burning families in their homes. Some of these killings were individual and opportunistic 
(for example, in the course of stealing money from civilians), but many were systematic 
large-scale revenge killings.

<p> I. Introduction and applicable international law.........................................................  1&#8211;<footnote name="5">4. Indeed, the threat has now assumed regional dimensions, affecting the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, southern Sudan and Uganda. In 
particular, increasing LRA activity has been reported in the south-east of the Central 
African Republic, a region with little State presence and which receives almost no 
international attention. It is occasionally reported that Ugandan forces have captured or 
killed a small number of LRA members in the Central African Republic or elsewhere. Such 
efforts do little to address the nature of the LRA threat. There is an urgent need for regional 
strategic military action, together with measures to facilitate LRA desertions and escapes. </footnote> 6 
</p>
<p> II. Extrajudicial executions in the Kivus .....................................................................  6&#8211;<footnote name="4">8. The LRA moved from Uganda into Garamba National Park in Province Orientale in 
the north-east in 2005 and 2006. Since then, there have been a series of poorly planned and 
implemented Government and United Nations military operations against the LRA. A 
January 2006 MONUC operation failed to neutralize or push back the LRA, and resulted 
instead in the deaths of MONUC forces. In September 2008, the FARDC and MONUC 
jointly launched Operation Rudia I, but it again had little effect on the LRA. In December 
2008, the Congolese, Ugandan and Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation armies, with the logistical 
support of the United States of America, carried out Operation Lightning Thunder, but it 
was also a failure and LRA commanders remained free. In addition, these operations failed 
to plan adequately for the protection of civilians, and predictably &#8212; given the conduct of 
the LRA over its 20-year history &#8212; the group responded to these military offensives with 
coordinated revenge massacres of civilians. </footnote>6 7 
  A. Killings by the Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration du Rwanda.....................  11&#8211;<footnote name="2">5. Individual killings have generally occurred in the context of looting or sexual 
violence, or for other purely subjective reasons. Soldiers have, for example, retaliated when 
civilians resisted attempts by soldiers to steal their food, motorcycles or other goods. I 
received numerous testimonies of soldiers opening fire on crowds of civilians who had 
refused to hand over food. In other cases, soldiers have shot at their commanders or 
civilians when rations or pay were delayed. I also received testimony of soldiers forcing </footnote>3 7

</p>
<p> III. Extrajudicial executions in Province Orientale .......................................................  47&#8211;<footnote name="6">7. However, the truth is that rape is pervasive. The United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA) coordinates and compiles statistics on sexual violence, although its staff 
emphasize that their numbers are an undercount.<footnote name="2">9. Since my visit, further evidence has emerged of other similar FARDC killings, 
including killings near Shalio, in Bunyarwanda and Marok; two other massacres in August 
2009 in Mashango and Ndoruma; and frequent killings throughout 2009 on the Nyabiondo-
Pinga axis.13 Information provided to me indicates that many of these killings were also 
committed by ex-CNDP members, and that they likely took place to punish civilians 
perceived to be rebel &#8220;collaborators&#8221;, to destroy non-Tutsi populations and possibly to gain 
access to mineral resources. 
</footnote>3 According to information provided to me 
by UNFPA, there were 13,404 incidents in 2006, 13,<footnote name="2">8. For example, I received reliable evidence of a massacre on 27 April 2009, in which 
the FARDC attacked a makeshift refugee camp in Shalio. Some 50 Rwandan Hutu 
refugees, presumed to be aligned with the FDLR, were immediately killed &#8211; either shot, cut 
or beaten to death. Another group of 50 were taken by the FARDC, most of whom were 
subsequently also killed; a group of some 40 women were raped and beaten; a further group 
taken from Shalio remains unaccounted for. The commander responsible for the attacks 
appears to have been Lt. Col. Innocent Zimurinda, an ex-CNDP leader known for his Tutsi 
extremism.12 
</footnote>47 in 2007, and 14,<footnote name="2">7. In addition to opportunistic killings, I obtained credible evidence that FARDC 
soldiers carried out large-scale targeted massacres of civilians in the Kivus. These killings 
appear to have been primarily carried out by units composed of ex-CNDP members 
integrated into the FARDC in the early stages of Kimia II, and led by CNDP commanders 
with sometimes extensive records of prior abuses. The massacres often took place against 
civilians located near suspected rebel group locations, or against civilians presumed to have 
supported the FDLR. 
</footnote>45 in 2008. From </footnote>2 13 
  A. Killings by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army ........................................................  48&#8211;<footnote name="5">3. After my October mission, I continued to receive documentation of LRA violence in 
Province Orientale. Shortly before Christmas 2009, the LRA distributed letters to civilians, 
warning of forthcoming attacks. I have been provided photographic and testimonial 
evidence from multiple sources on the ground that the LRA killed civilians and mutilated 
others, including by cutting off their lips and ears. While the number of victims since 
December 2009 has been difficult to ascertain because of poor communications with the 
attacked areas, I have been provided credible data that at least 80 civilians were killed in 
December 2009, and over 100 in January 2010. It is clear from the planned nature of the 
attacks and their intent to spread fear that the LRA continues to pose a serious threat in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</footnote>8 13 
</p>
<p>  B. Killings by the Congolese Armed Forces .......................................................  59&#8211;<footnote name="6">6. Despite the political attention that sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo has garnered, key officials continue to deny the extent of the problem. When I asked 
one senior military official in the eastern part of the country about sexual violence in the 
area under his command, he replied that only 15 per cent of rapes alleged by non-
governmental organizations and others actually occurred, that most cases were 
&#8220;imaginary&#8221;, and that it was in the nature of women to be unfaithful. 
</footnote>2 15 
</p>
<p> IV. Sexual violence and extrajudicial executions..........................................................  63&#8211;<footnote name="6">5. Evidence from a variety of sources indicates that rape and related killing are 
particularly vicious when either the FARDC or FDLR retaliate against communities they 
suspect of collaborating with the opposing force. FARDC soldiers, for example, have 
engaged in widespread rape as punishment for alleged collaboration with rebel groups. 
FARDC soldiers have also raped women during the course of raids to steal food or other 
goods. FDLR attackers have also engaged in a campaign of rape, repeatedly telling victims 
the rape was &#8220;punishment&#8221; for alleged cooperation with MONUC or the Government. 
</footnote>8 16 
 V. Political killings in Kinshasa and Bas Congo .........................................................  69&#8211;<footnote name="8">5. Prison overcrowding is also endemic across the country. The Goma Prison was built 
for 150, but at the time of my visit there were 793 detainees, including 11 women and 8 
children. The prison director stated that there was a permanent shortage of food. Detainees 
reported the complete absence of medical services, leading to frequent preventable deaths </footnote>1 17 
</p>
<p>  A. Killings in Kinshasa .......................................................................................  70&#8211;<footnote name="73">. MONUC and non-governmental organizations encountered serious obstacles in 
attempting to investigate the March events. Government officials tried to block external 
investigators from visiting sites such as morgues, detention facilities and the river to collect 
evidence. Family members seeking information about their relatives were intimidated, and 
sometimes arbitrarily detained. Compelling reports by the United Nations and non-
governmental organizations detailing security agency abuses26 have not resulted in any 
Government response to investigate or hold its officials to account. </footnote> 17 
</p>
<p>  B. Killings in Bas Congo ....................................................................................  74&#8211;<footnote name="7">8. There are credible reports of various Government agencies having carried out 
unlawful killings and other serious human rights abuses, especially arbitrary detentions, in 
the west. They include the National Congolese Police (especially the Simba Battalion, the 
Integrated Police Unit, and the Services sp&#233;ciaux), the National Intelligence Agency, the 
Republican Guard and the army&#8217;s military intelligence agency (often referred to by its 
former name, DEMIAP). The Republican Guard especially has been at the centre of abuse 
allegations. Tasked with protecting the President, it is believed to include some 10,000 to 
15,000 soldiers. During the transition period in the country, there were attempts to integrate </footnote>7 18 
</p>
<p>  C. Likely security forces&#8217; abuses during the next election period.......................  78&#8211;<footnote name="8">4. At Goma Central Prison I interviewed authorities and detainees. Like the vast 
majority of Congolese prisons, it is controlled by the prisoners themselves; State authorities 
only act as guards outside the facility.28 Internal prison violence is thus predictably 
common. Independent monitoring is heavily restricted since the security of visiting 
monitors cannot be assured. In June 2009, there was a mutiny and escape attempt at the 
prison. Security was so poor that male prisoners broke into the female section of the prison, 
raped some 20 female detainees, and killed a police officer and a prisoner. Before this 
incident, Fran&#231;ois Gacaba, a prisoner who had been convicted of rape by a military tribunal, 
was freed by 60 armed men who attacked the prison. 
</footnote>1 18 
</p>
<p> VI. Deaths in prisons.....................................................................................................  82&#8211;<footnote name="8">3. The central Government provides only one prison in the entire country with a 
budget. The rest are required to support themselves. Some receive assistance from the 
provincial authorities, but many rely completely on private support extracted by individual 
prison directors. Most prisoners survive on food brought to them by their families. Those 
without family assistance slowly starve. 
</footnote>7 19 
</p>
<p> VII. Killings of &#8220;witches&#8221;...............................................................................................  88&#8211;<footnote name="91">. There is almost total impunity for such killings; witnesses or family members are 
reluctant to report such incidents to authorities, and officials all too often turn a blind eye to 
preventing or investigating the violence. </footnote> 20 
</p>
<p> VIII. Killings of human rights defenders and journalists.................................................  92&#8211;<footnote name="9">8. Corruption and political interference are key problems. Accused individuals with 
money or connections can escape punishment with relative ease. Corruption extends 
through the entire justice system: police request money to arrest or release alleged 
perpetrators; judges take bribes to decide cases; and registrars and other officials request 
money to enforce judgements. Magistrates told me of frequent attempts to bribe them, and 
of threats against their careers and lives. Political interference also frequently affects the </footnote>3 21 
 IX. Vigilantism and mob justice ...................................................................................  94&#8211;<footnote name="9">7. I held many meetings with military and civilian judges and other experts on the 
criminal and military justice systems. The institutional, financial, resource and structural 
problems in those systems are generally well acknowledged.<footnote name="3">0. One of the most significant causes of these large-scale killings by the FARDC were 
the failures to appropriately plan the integration of the CNDP into the regular armed forces, 
and to vet during that process, especially at senior command levels. This resulted in a 
context ripe for grave abuses, especially against non-Tutsi civilians. It should come as no 
surprise that members of the CNDP terrorized civilians when integrated into the FARDC, 
given that (a) the CNDP has long been known to abuse civilians; (b) most CNDP members 
had little formal military training, and were provided no serious training or discipline upon 
integration; (c) mass rapid integration and poor record-keeping resulted in confused 
command structures in the FARDC; (d) the ex-CNDP were deployed to fight in areas 
inhabited by the rebels they had previously fought, or inhabited by civilians perceived to 
support those rebels or simply of a rival ethnicity; and (e) the units were led by 
commanders with extensive records of serious human rights abuses. </footnote>6 As the Ministry of Justice&#8217;s 
recent Roadmap to Justice itself states &#8220;the background, the causes and the diagnosis of the 
ills and dysfunctions that plague our system of justice have been the objects of numerous 
reports, studies, workshops, colloquia and seminars&#8221;.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction and applicable international law 
</b></p>
<p>1. On my mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 5 to 15 October 
2009, I visited North Kivu (Goma), South Kivu (Bukavu and Minova), Province Orientale 
(Dungu and Doruma), Kinshasa, and Bas Congo (Kisantu). 
2. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in accordance with my mandate to 
investigate killings that violate international human rights or humanitarian law, I looked 
specifically at: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Killings by Government forces and non-stated armed groups in the context of the 
Kimia II military operation in the Kivus, and by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army (LRA) 
and the Congolese army in Province Orientale 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Political killings by Congolese security forces in the west of the country 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Killings by private actors which the Government fails to adequately prevent, 
investigate, prosecute and punish, including vigilante killings, and killings of human 
rights defenders, journalists and alleged &#8220;witches&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Deaths in custody and prison conditions 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The extent and causes of impunity for killings 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The civilian protection responsibilities of the United Nations Organization Mission 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its legal responsibilities with respect 
to killings by the Congolese army 
</p>
<p>3. As a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
Government is obligated to respect the right to life and to show due diligence in preventing 
and responding to violations by others.1 The Government&#8217;s military operations are also 
governed by the Geneva Conventions and the two Additional Protocols thereto, which 
oblige it to prevent civilian casualties in accordance with the requirements of 
discrimination, proportionality, necessity and precaution.2 Non-State actors in armed 
conflict with the Government, such as the Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration du Rwanda 
(FDLR), also have obligations under international humanitarian law, including, for 
example, not to deliberately attack civilians.  
</p>
<p>4. MONUC is also involved in military operations in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. Its operations are governed by the Security Council resolutions, which set out the 
mission&#8217;s mandate, customary international humanitarian law and the relevant rules of 
engagement. The existing Security Council mandate, renewed to May 2010, obligates 
MONUC to use all necessary means to ensure the protection of civilians under imminent 
threat of physical violence, in particular violence emanating from any of the parties 
engaged in the conflict3 and only permits its participation in operations that comply with 
international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law.4 
</p>
<p>5. I am very grateful to the Government for the many comments it has provided on a 
draft of the present report. A number of the concerns raised have been taken into account in 
what follows. Many of the comments, however, simply refute my assessment of the 
situation. The Government suggests that more than one third of the report contains 
information which it considers to be false or not demonstrated. However, no detailed 
information is provided in order to rebut any of the contested statements. Since the 
comments thus reflect the Government&#8217;s views on the report, rather than a correction of 
factual or other errors, it seems appropriate for the reply to be included in the original 
language as an appendix to the present report in order to ensure that the Government&#8217;s 
views are given full consideration by the Human Rights Council. </p>

<p><b> II. Extrajudicial executions in the Kivus

hostilities. Throughout 2009, hundreds of civilians were killed unlawfully by rebel groups, 
including the FDLR, and Government forces.

<p>7. The history of conflict that has plagued North and South Kivu for over a decade is 
well known, as are the evolution of the FDLR and the Congr&#232;s national pour la d&#233;fense du 
peuple (CNDP) rebel groups, the shifting alliances of various armed groups and the 
Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC) over the years, and the many attempts at peace.<footnote name="5">2. However, my investigations in Province Orientale revealed clearly that the LRA 
remains a serious threat in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While the LRA has not 
repeated the massacres of Christmas 2008, it does continue to kill, rape, loot and kidnap, 
and the risk of further massacres remains high. In the six months before my visit, from 
April to September 2009, there were at least 186 recorded attacks, with 233 civilians killed, 
and 603 adults and 97 children kidnapped.20 
</footnote> The 
complex negotiations between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and the 
CNDP in late 2008 and early 2009 have also been examined in detail elsewhere.<footnote name="6">0. In mid to late 2009, however, the Republican Guard began to be replaced by 
FARDC units from North Kivu, including those composed of ex-CNDP members. Not 
surprisingly, allegations of looting, sexual violence and other violence by the FARDC 
increased. At least 15 killings were committed by the FARDC in Haut-U&#233;l&#233; in the latter 
half of 2009. Most were part of FARDC attempts to steal from civilians. Women resisting 
gang rape by soldiers were also killed. Impunity for FARDC abuses is common, partly 
because of the military justice system&#8217;s weaknesses (see paragraphs 96&#8211;108 below), but 
also because people are unaware of the possibility of lodging complaints about the FARDC. 
A military prosecutor was sent to Dungu for the first time only in October 2009. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>8. These negotiations led to a joint Democratic Republic of the Congo-Rwanda 
military operation against the FDLR from 20 January to 25 February 2009 (<i>Umoja Wetu</i>). It 
initially pushed the FDLR back from some key areas, but achieved few sustainable 
outcomes. The operation neither broke the group&#8217;s structure nor destroyed its leadership; 
when it ended, the FDLR reoccupied many of their former strongholds. Most significantly, 
the FDLR responded to the operation by retaliating against civilians, killing at least 100 in 
late January and early February. 
</p>
<p>9. Following the withdrawal of Rwanda from the Congo in February 2009, the 
Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo launched Kimia II, a second military 
effort similarly intended to &#8220;neutralize&#8221; the FDLR.<footnote name="7">2. Following the initial clashes, the FARDC, the Republican Guard and other 
Government security forces carried out targeted killings of actual and presumed Bemba 
supporters, and tortured and killed those they had unlawfully detained at Republican Guard-
controlled detention facilities like the one at Camp Tshatshi, or the Services sp&#233;ciaux 
facility at their Kin Mazi&#232;re base. Individuals were removed from detention and executed, 
and their bodies were buried or dumped in a nearby river. United Nations officials at the 
time found at least 30 to 40 bodies in the river. 
</footnote> The operation involved &#8220;significant 
joint planning&#8221;<footnote name="8">2. Prison conditions do not, per se, come within my mandate. The atrocious state of 
prisons across the Democratic Republic of the Congo, however, leads to frequent deaths of 
detainees. The Minister for Justice acknowledged to me that prison conditions are 
&#8220;horrible&#8221; and that many people in detention die of hunger. The Government is failing in its 
duty to ensure even minimum detention conditions. As a result, prisoners die from 
preventable causes, and there are regular riots and escapes. Almost non-existent records and 
monitoring mean that it is not known how many deaths in prisons there actually are, 
although information provided by one source recorded 23 deaths in 2009 at one prison in 
Kinshasa alone.

provided &#8220;considerable means to support the FARDC&#8221;,<footnote name="9">6. The Government&#8217;s failure to hold perpetrators to account is the central factor driving 
continued human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The justice 
system is in a shambles, and impunity is widespread for all forms of killings. Alleged war 
criminals continue to hold senior command positions in the armed forces, massacres are 
committed without sanction or investigation, and nearly all extrajudicial executions remain 
unpunished. 
</footnote> including transport, rations, fuel 
and medical evacuation to selected FARDC battalions in the Kivus.10 
</p>
<p>10. In early 2009, the CNDP, together with other armed groups such as the Mayi-Mayi, 
underwent an accelerated integration into the FARDC. Over 12,000 individuals were 
integrated, without vetting for criminal activity, and with little retraining or planning 
directed at breaking down the armed groups&#8217; own structures. Many of these new Congolese 
soldiers were deployed to fight the FDLR as part of Kimia II.

</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo or of cooperating with the FARDC. The FDLR applied little 
distinction, however, and accused whole villages of &#8220;cooperation&#8221;, punishing them with 
village-wide destruction. In various locations, the FDLR sent letters to villagers threatening 
to burn their villages and make civilians &#8220;suffer endlessly&#8221; if the FARDC continued its 
attacks. Letters directed civilians to tell the FARDC to stop fighting the FDLR, and warned 
civilians against supporting Kimia II. Second, to discourage future Congolese army 
operations and reduce international support for Kimia II, the FDLR planned horrific and 
deadly attacks on civilians. Their intention was to make the civilian cost of military action 
intolerably great.  
</p>
<p>14. Many of the FDLR revenge attacks followed a pattern. First, as part of the Kimia II 
effort to increase Government control over territory, the FARDC would take over a rebel-
controlled village. Open combat was invariably minimal, and the rebels broke into smaller 
groups and retreated to surroundings forests. The FARDC would then move on to the next 
location to expand their territorial control, often leaving the previous village poorly- or 
unprotected. The FDLR could then easily return and would brutalize the remaining 
civilians. 
</p>
<p>15. One witness described how his village was initially Mayi-Mayi/FDLR controlled, 
and was then taken over by the FARDC in the early stages of Kimia II. When the FARDC 
left two months later, the FDLR attacked, killing large numbers of civilians. Another 
witness, from Ufumandu, explained that his area had been controlled by the FDLR for 
years. When the FARDC came to the area, they managed to largely drive the FDLR out. 
However, the FDLR came back, looted, burned down homes and killed the villagers in 
retaliation. The witness&#8217;s brother and nephew were burned inside their home. Most 
witnesses to such attacks lost numerous relatives, and were living in camps for internally 
displaced persons when I met them, too afraid to return because they did not know who was 
in control or how they would be treated. One 34-year-old female had fled Masisi territory 
after her husband and three of her children were burned to death when they tried to defend 
their home from an FDLR attack, following FDLR-FARDC disputes over the territory. 
Another 37-year-old female&#8217;s husband and children were killed when the FDLR attacked 
her village after the FARDC had taken it over and then left it unprotected. 
</p>
<p>16. The FDLR also carried out massacres in retaliation for killings by the FARDC of 
Rwandan Hutus. The Shalio massacre (see also paragraph 28 below), in which the FARDC 
killed at least 100 civilians, was quickly followed by a massacre in Busurungi on 9 May 
2009, in which the FDLR killed at least 50 civilians and burned down 700 homes. 
</p>
<p>17. On a smaller scale, the FDLR also killed civilians who refused to hand over goods 
or money. In one emblematic instance, a witness&#8217;s younger brother was killed in his home 
by the FDLR when he refused to hand over his family&#8217;s savings. 
</p>

<p>GE.10-14371 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Militarized mines in the Kivus 
</b></p>
<p>19. Many mining sites (gold, cassiterite, coltan, wolframite) in the Kivus are militarized. 
They are illegally controlled by the FDLR, Mayi-Mayi groups and even the FARDC. In 
some areas, the rebel groups and the army cooperate to profit mutually from their unlawful 
activities. Demilitarization has not been a high priority, and Kimia II had little impact on 
mine militarization. Continued militarized control diverts valuable resources from the State 
into private hands, and fuels human rights abuses around mining areas, including forced 
labour, stealing and unlawful &#8220;taxation&#8221;, as well as life-threatening working conditions. It 
also exacerbates the conflict by funding violent activities. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Protection of civilians from retaliation attacks 
</b></p>
<p>20. In planning and implementing Kimia II, neither the Government nor MONUC paid 
sufficient attention to protecting civilians from retaliation attacks by the FDLR. The latter, 
of course, bears direct responsibility for the killings it has committed; but both the 
Government and MONUC also have international legal obligations to protect civilians and 
to plan military operations so as to minimize the loss of civilian life.11 This is particularly 
important when, as here, both parties were on notice of the FDLR&#8217;s practice of retaliation 
killings. 
</p>
<p>21. The difficulties in achieving such civilian protection cannot be overstated. They 
include difficult terrain, sometimes inaccessible villages, severe resource constraints and 
rebels bent on destruction. 
</p>
<p>22. The nature of FDLR attacks, together with the scale and depth of violence against 
civilians, however, indicates that much more should have been done to protect civilians. 
Civilians were rarely killed in the context of open FDLR-FARDC combat. Instead, in 
village after village, the FDLR attacked them when there was no FARDC or MONUC 
presence. Such opportunities for attack often resulted from poor military planning or 
operational deficiencies. The FDLR attacks in January and February 2009 fitted the pattern 
perfectly and should have sounded alarm bells. FDLR revenge attacks following 
subsequent Government military operations were foreseeable and perhaps even inevitable 
in the absence of an adequate protection presence. 
</p>
<p>23. At a minimum, in such contexts, the civilian protection obligations of the 
Government and MONUC required them to take into account the risk of FDLR revenge 
attacks in their military planning, especially with respect to troop movements and 
maintaining proximity to civilian areas. In particular, humanitarian law principles of 
discrimination, proportionality, necessity and precaution would require decisions about 
whether to move into new territory or to vacate villages to be taken in the light of balancing 
any anticipated military advantage against the expected harm to civilians. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings by the Congolese Armed Forces 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC) have also committed both opportunistic 
killings and targeted massacres of civilians in the context of Kimia II. 
</p>

<p>civilians to carry rations and other goods for them over long distances, because the soldiers 
do not have any other method of transport. Civilians have been ordered to do this under 
threat of death. Looting by the FARDC in villages they have taken over from the FDLR has 
also been common. Such problems are due both to the central Government&#8217;s failure to 
provide funds and the rampant embezzlement of pay by commanders, combined with often 
poorly trained and ill-disciplined soldiers. 
</p>
<p>26. Victims or witnesses have difficulty in attributing responsibility for abuses because 
soldiers&#8217; uniforms do not identify their name and unit number. The rapid and unvetted 
integration of former rebels into the FARDC in early 2009 compounded these problems. 
The failure to support soldiers appropriately in the field led soldiers to prey on the local 
population, and resulted in the range of predictable parasitic abuses against civilians that 
were well documented by humanitarian organizations throughout 2009. Available evidence, 
including that provided to me by military commanders, strongly suggests that these types of 
abuses are reduced where soldiers are provided adequate pay and rations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Targeted massacres 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14371 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>31. Killings by the FARDC continued throughout 2009 because of the Government&#8217;s 
failure to adequately respond to evidence of abuse and to hold perpetrators to account (see 
paragraphs 96&#8211;108 below). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The role of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>32. MONUC serves a crucial role in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I met with 
MONUC officials across the country, and was impressed with the level of their dedication 
to the mission and the skill with which they carried out their functions. In the Kivus 
especially, the presence of MONUC has provided important protection to civilians over the 
years. However, its involvement in Kimia II raised serious human rights questions. 
</p>
<p>33. As described above, MONUC provided substantial support to the Congolese army in 
Kimia II, and also has a significant role in the Amani Leo Operation, launched in January 
2010. The seriousness and extent of abuses committed by the Congolese army in the 
context of Kimia II brings into question whether MONUC carried out its mission in 
accordance with its mandate, and whether it met its international legal obligations. 
</p>
<p>34. The Security Council set out the MONUC mandate and priorities for 2009 in its 
resolution 1856 (2008), which authorized its deployment. Its mandate included 
coordinating with the FARDC and supporting its operations in the Kivus. However, and as 
legal advice from the Office of Legal Affairs has clarified,14 MONUC could not participate 
in or support operations by Congolese units where there were &#8220;substantial grounds for 
believing there to be a real risk of [those units] violating international humanitarian law, 
human rights law or refugee law&#8221;.15 The Office also clarified that, if the FARDC did violate 
international law, MONUC would need to take a range of measures, including, if the 
violations were &#8220;widespread or serious&#8221;, to end its &#8220;participation in the operation as a 
whole&#8221;.16 The Office stated that, if the FARDC violated international law, MONUC would 
need to immediately &#8220;intercede with the FARDC &#8230; to dissuad[e] the units concerned from 
continuing in such violations&#8221;. If the violations continued, MONUC would need to 
&#8220;reassess its relations&#8221; with the relevant units. In some cases, MONUC would need to take 
other actions, including the use of force, to stop violations by the FARDC. 
</p>
<p>35. Some interlocutors questioned the appropriateness of the initial decision to involve 
MONUC in FARDC operations given the immediate history of FDLR retaliation attacks; 
known abuses by the FARDC and its lack of discipline and inadequate pay and rations; the 
poorly planned CNDP integration; and resource constraints on MONUC troops. In any 
event, once involved in Kimia II, MONUC&#8217;s ability to fulfill its mandate and legal 
obligations was certainly compromised by its failure to design and implement from the 
outset a comprehensive civilian protection strategy, incorporating a strong conditionality 
policy based on monitoring and investigating allegations against FARDC units. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Conditionality 
</b>36. FARDC units were supported by MONUC despite credible reports of widespread 
human rights violations. I was told by MONUC military officials that, when it received 
such reports, they were usually raised with the FARDC command. This is entirely 
appropriate, but it can only be a first step in a graduated response. A clear and credible 
conditionality policy was necessary to ensure that MONUC was not implicated in FARDC 
abuses. At the time of writing, MONUC had not yet published a formal policy setting out 
how and when it would condition support for FARDC units or the operation as such. I 
understand that the drafting of such a policy only began in September 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-14371 
</p>
<p>and operational support from the 213th Brigade, a unit implicated in the killings of 62 
civilians near Lukweti in North Kivu. This positive step was long overdue, although many 
other units credibly accused of abuses continue to be supported. 
</p>
<p>38. During my visit, some MONUC officials argued that withdrawing support from 
FARDC units implicated in abuses would be counterproductive, because regular pay and 
rations to soldiers tends to reduce abuses. A distinction must be drawn, however, between 
opportunistic abuses caused by the abysmal conditions in which soldiers are deployed, and 
large-scale massacres motivated by ethnic hatred or a desire to punish &#8220;collaborating&#8221; 
civilians. The former are indeed likely, at least in part, to be addressed through the 
provision of adequate rations and pay to soldiers. However, the large-scale massacres in the 
Kivus were predominantly committed by ex-CNDP members against their perceived 
enemies or those supporting them. Shalio-type violence did not result from insufficient pay. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Investigating and monitoring 
</b>39. An effective conditionality designed to counter FARDC impunity requires MONUC 
to monitor adequately the Congolese forces it supports and to investigate alleged violations. 
</p>
<p>40. MONUC took a number of important steps to improve monitoring and civilian 
protection in 2009. Its military officials in the Kivus told me that the number of military 
bases had nearly doubled in some areas in 2009, and that MONUC set up early warning and 
rapid-response teams to monitor FARDC units. In addition, joint protection teams formed 
to provide early warning on security threats and improve military-civilian relationships 
were an important initiative in civilian protection, and undertook some 50 missions in 2009. 
However, officials involved in the teams informed me that they lacked resources and staff, 
that their on-site investigations were truncated and that their recommendations were often 
ignored. 
</p>
<p>41. There is no doubt that the task of monitoring the FARDC is extraordinarily difficult, 
a point stressed to me by MONUC military officials. The areas where many FARDC 
killings occur are remote and difficult to access. The command structure of the FARDC is 
not always clearly known by MONUC; troops move and unit composition changes without 
notice, and an individual soldier&#8217;s deployment is not easily tracked. MONUC also suffers 
from resource restrictions (including staff levels and a lack of necessary equipment, such as 
helicopters) that inhibit its ability to investigate incidents. While significant, these obstacles 
are not insurmountable, and they do not justify continuing to support military units known 
to be engaging in widespread human rights abuses. The mission&#8217;s obligation to only 
support operations that comply with human rights law requires it to exercise due diligence 
in verifying that supported units are, in fact, complying with the law. 
</p>
<p>42. As a party to the conflict, the real or perceived ability of MONUC to independently 
and effectively investigate allegations of abuses by its FARDC counterparts or by its own 
forces is compromised. In the circumstances, the United Nations should consider creating a 
mechanism to monitor and investigate rights violations independently, effectively and 
credibly. 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Reporting on human rights abuses 
</b>43. The human rights presence of the United Nations in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo comes under the authority of the overall United Nations peacekeeping mission. It is 
almost inevitable in such contexts that tensions arise between the human rights imperatives 
of investigating and reporting abuses and the political pressures to bolster the Government 
and minimize frictions. Finding the right balance is never easy, but it is clear that the 
human rights side of the equation must be accorded a degree of autonomy if it is not to be 
consistently kept on an overly tight leash. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14371 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>44. The MONUC Joint Human Rights Office has achieved a considerable amount. Its 
officers work in extraordinarily difficult circumstances, and many take substantial personal 
risks in order to investigate abuses, and prepare detailed and sophisticated reports. Timely 
publication, however, is rare. Reports on political killings in the west were delayed by 
many months, and investigations into September&#8211;December 2008 Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army 
massacres were not reported until December 2009. There are no monthly human rights 
reports. 
</p>
<p>45. In addition, initial investigations by human rights officers have not always received 
the support and resources necessary. With regard to Shalio, for example, it appears that 
MONUC was aware early on of possible killings in the area, but human rights 
investigations were certainly never prioritized. 
</p>
<p>46. The United Nations has documented abuses in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo from the period 1993&#8211;2003 as part of a significant mapping project. Publishing that 
report is an indispensable step towards accountability for serious past violations. The report 
appears to have been completed in early 2009 but has still not been made public. This is 
highly problematic. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Extrajudicial executions in Province Orientale 
</b>47. Over 1,300 Congolese civilians have been killed by the LRA Ugandan rebel group 
since September 2008. The LRA, led by Joseph Kony, against whom the International 
Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant in 2005, has committed some of the most calculated 
and horrific killings I have encountered during my nearly six years as Special Rapporteur.18 
Over a 20-year period, the LRA terrorized many tens of thousands of victims; it has 
kidnapped children and forced them to become soldiers, hacked civilians to death or left 
them with mutilated limbs and faces, and it has engaged in frequent looting, pillaging and 
sexual violence, including sexual slavery. By some estimates, the LRA has killed over 
65,000 civilians and abducted some 40,000 children. It poses a threat to civilians across the 
central African region. Yet regional Governments and the international community devote 
far too little attention to what is one of the most brutal armed groups active in the world 
today. Insufficient steps have been taken to protect civilians, and the various small-scale 
and ill-conceived military efforts launched by Governments in the region have achieved 
little. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Killings by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Targeted revenge massacres 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-14371 
</p>
<p>49. Reliable estimates indicate that the LRA massacred some 800 civilians in the five-
month period from September 2008 to January 2009.19 The most concentrated and deadly 
set of attacks were over Christmas 2008, during which the LRA attacked entire villages, in 
some cases beating to death over 50 civilians in one day. In Dungu and Doruma, I spoke 
with witnesses to these attacks, as well as civilians who had been kidnapped and former 
child soldiers. Witnesses watched their neighbours and family members killed with 
machetes and sticks. In some attacks, the LRA tricked or forced residents to gather together 
so that they could maximize civilian casualties. One witness with whom I spoke described 
an attack on 25 December 2008 in Batande village, after which he found 50 to 60 corpses in 
the village&#8217;s church, and more bodies in the surrounding woods. He and other witnesses 
testified that a number of the women showed signs of having been raped before they were 
killed. 
</p>
<p>50. These killings were not carried out to achieve territorial control or to steal food and 
goods. The LRA did not remain for longer than a day or two in the villages it attacked, and 
victims reported relatively minimal looting or kidnapping. The massacres were committed 
simply to terrorize and punish Congolese civilians for the military operations mounted 
against the LRA in late 2008. The attacks spread fear through Province Orientale, and 
drove hundreds of thousands to flee their villages. Many internally displaced persons I met 
near Dungu had been living in makeshift shelters for nearly a year, too afraid to return to 
their still unprotected homes. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. A continuing threat 
</b></p>
<p>51. In March 2009, the FARDC and MONUC launched Operation Rudia II, a new 
operation intended to contain the LRA. During my mission, the Government contended that 
the LRA threat had been significantly reduced as a result of this operation. The FARDC 
commander of Operation Rudia II based in Dungu told me that they had accomplished their 
mission, and that there were &#8220;no more LRA in the Congo&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14371 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Civilian protection obligations 
</b></p>
<p>55. The direct responsibility for killings in Province Orientale lies first and foremost 
with the LRA. However, as described above with respect to the Kivus, both the 
Government and MONUC have protection obligations towards civilians. 
</p>
<p>56. I spoke with many humanitarian actors, United Nations and Government officials, 
and military commanders in Province Orientale. There is no doubt that effectively 
protecting civilians from the LRA is a daunting task. Many villages are remote and 
sometimes inaccessible without days of travel or the use of helicopters, and State presence 
through the region is negligible. Communication systems are poor or non-existent, and 
villagers must sometimes run for days to deliver warnings of impending, or news of 
ongoing, LRA attacks. The LRA often conduct well-planned and sudden attacks, and the 
Government and MONUC face resource constraints that limit their capacity to have troops 
on the ground where needed, or to respond rapidly to attacks. 
</p>
<p>57. Despite these very real obstacles, significantly more can and should be done to 
protect civilians. Given the high likelihood of LRA retaliation massacres, military attacks 
on the LRA should not be launched without sufficient consideration given to planning for 
the presence of troops near villages expected to be targeted by the LRA. The regularly 
reported LRA attacks through 2009 also indicate the importance of increasing the number 
and range of FARDC/MONUC military bases and patrols. Information provided to me 
strongly suggests that the LRA presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will 
increase if the military presence decreases. MONUC should strongly consider increasing its 
troops in the province, expanding its rapid response capacity and implementing more 
actively its robust civilian protection mandate. 
</p>
<p>58. MONUC and the Government should work together to establish a community-based 
communications network so that warnings of attacks are more quickly received. In addition, 
effective communication between MONUC and the population has at times been lacking, 
and this has had negative protection consequences. MONUC has not always taken the 
necessary steps to explain its role to the population, resulting in misunderstanding, poor 
coordination and sometimes hostility. MONUC should also make a stronger effort to bring 
tangible benefits to the province, including by restoring electricity in population centres and 
extending radio coverage. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings by the Congolese Armed Forces 
</b></p>
<p>59. For much of 2009, there were relatively few allegations of abuses by the FARDC in 
Province Orientale. This is largely because the comparatively better trained and supported 
Republican Guard were posted to the area. Unlike the FARDC in the Kivus, they had few 
reasons to prey on the civilian population, and the ethnic and territorial issues motivating 
FARDC massacres in the Kivus were absent. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.10-14371 
</p>
<p>61. Unless significant steps are taken with respect to training, discipline and impunity, 
abuses by FARDC integrated brigade soldiers from the Kivus deployed to Province 
Orientale will continue and increase. 
</p>
<p>62. A further likely consequence of the Government&#8217;s failure to ensure an accountable 
and effective security presence is the strengthening and reorientation of village self-defence 
groups. Many such groups initially formed to protect themselves from the LRA. In the 
absence of Government protection, they were often the only form of security for local 
communities. Some disbanded when FARDC operations began in Province Orientale. 
Others have engaged in minor skirmishes with the FARDC, or attacked police stations to 
obtain weapons. If FARDC abuses continue, there is a very real risk that self-defence 
groups will take up arms against Government forces and/or evolve into militias or criminal 
bands. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Sexual violence and extrajudicial executions 
</b>63. Sexual violence in the Congo, and especially in the Kivus, falls squarely within my 
mandate because it has reached such levels of brutality that women have literally been 
raped to death.21 Many others have died subsequently. Women and girls, including babies,22 
have been gang-raped, had guns, wood, sand or glue inserted into their bodies, and had their 
genitals mutilated. Some pregnant women have had foetuses ripped out of their wombs by 
perpetrators. I received multiple accounts in the Kivus of gang rapes so vicious that women 
died from bleeding or from ruptured uteruses. I also received numerous accounts of severe 
rape-related injuries (e.g., gunshots to a woman&#8217;s vagina) that resulted in death days or 
weeks later. Such deaths are especially likely in remote areas where victims have little or 
no access to health services. Those who survive are often left with debilitating physical 
injuries, such as fistula or displaced uterus, and deep psychological harm. 
64. Victims have, additionally, been killed when they resist rape, or murdered 
immediately following a rape. Victims are sometimes taken into sexual slavery and then 
killed when their captors are no longer able to rape them (because of the victim&#8217;s injury or 
illness). Family members attempting to stop a rape have been killed, as have men who 
refuse the perpetrators&#8217; orders to rape female family members. Those working to assist rape 
victims have also been attacked and threatened and, in some instances, also raped.

<p>January to June 2009, it provided a preliminary count of 6,433 incidents, and reports I 
received suggest that the annual total will exceed the deplorable heights reached in 2008. 
</p>
<p>68. Despite the prevalence and horrific nature of sexual violence atrocities, there is a 
shocking lack of accountability in the country&#8217;s domestic legal system, both military and 
civilian. Although there is generally strong substantive law, it is rare for cases to be 
prosecuted. Between February and August 2009, less than 100 rape cases were prosecuted 
by the military justice system in North and South Kivu, and most of the prosecutions were 
of low-ranking officers.24 MONUC human rights officials have made commendable efforts 
to assist in investigations and thus support the few prosecutions that have been made, but 
much more needs to be done by MONUC as a whole. MONUC launched a comprehensive 
strategy to address the sexual violence epidemic in April 2009, but its implementation has 
been delayed by staffing issues. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Political killings in Kinshasa and Bas Congo 
</b>69. The serious problem of politically motivated human rights abuses in the west of the 
country, including killings of opposition supporters, receives disturbingly little attention. 
Hundreds of civilians were killed by the Congolese security forces in 2007 and 2008 in 
attempts to counter the threat posed by political opposition. It appears that no one has been 
held criminally responsible for any of these killings, and nothing has been done to reform 
the security agencies to prevent similar abuses in the future. At the time of my visit, 
intimidation and arbitrary detentions of presumed opposition supporters were ongoing. 
There is a very high risk of further violence during the next election period if urgent steps 
are not taken to reform the security sector. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Killings in Kinshasa 
</b></p>
<p>70. In March 2007, over 300 people were killed in Kinshasa in politically motivated 
violence in the context of an attempt by the Congolese security forces (under the control of 
President Kabila) to end the threat posed by the private armed guards of then Senator Jean-
Pierre Bemba.25 
</p>
<p>71. In late 2006, Bemba lost the presidential elections to Kabila, but he continued to 
maintain at least 400 of his own guards. Bemba refused to integrate his soldiers into the 
regular Congolese army and, in March 2007, a street battle erupted between Bemba&#8217;s 
guards and FARDC soldiers. Hundreds of civilians were killed during these clashes, with 
indiscriminate and excessive force used by both sides.

</p>
<p><b> B. Killings in Bas Congo 
</b></p>
<p>74. In Kinshasa, I met with victims and witnesses of security force violence against 
members of the political-religious group Bunda dia Kongo (BDK), as well as those who 
had investigated the incidents. In early 2007, security forces killed at least 100 BDK 
supporters following elections in Bas Congo, in which BDK-aligned candidates lost to 
Kabila supporters. There were widespread allegations of fraud, made especially by BDK 
supporters, and the BDK organized general strikes. In the ensuing police response, there 
were some killings on both sides. The army was then called in, and the police and soldiers 
killed over 100 people. While several security force officials were suspended as a result, no 
criminal charges were ever brought against the perpetrators. In February 2008, the 
Government launched a three-week, heavily armed police operation against the BDK. 
Homes and places of worship were attacked and burned, and an estimated 100 to 200 
people were killed. 
</p>
<p>75. The Government argued that its forces were lawfully attempting to restrain BDK 
violence. It is true that there have been a small number of credible allegations of violence 
and killings (especially against so-called &#8220;witches&#8221;) by BDK members, and that the BDK 
organized large public protests. However, the security force response was grossly 
disproportionate to any threat, and it was targeted to suppress the BDK as a political 
opposition force, not to protect victims of BDK violence. The police who carried out the 
operation had largely military backgrounds, with little anti-riot or crowd-control training, 
and were armed with heavy weaponry (such as grenades and machine guns). Investigations 
by both the United Nations and non-governmental organizations carried out shortly after 
the operation documented the excessive force used by the security forces.27 
</p>
<p><b>Government attempts to block my investigations 
</b></p>
<p>76. In order to further investigate these political killings, I travelled to Kisantu in Bas 
Congo. I had arranged to meet a large number of witnesses and family members of victims 
in a secure location. However, when I arrived, I was prevented by the mayor of Kisantu, 
backed by armed security officials, from holding these or any meetings. These orders 
apparently came from the Governor of Bas Congo. 
</p>
<p>77. As I left Kisantu, a Congolese lawyer who had assisted me with arranging witness 
meetings was detained by police. I returned to Kisantu. The police initially denied having 
him in custody, but after lengthy negotiations his release was secured. I formally protested 
to the Government but received no response. I remain deeply concerned about the security 
of this lawyer and others working to expose Government abuses against the BDK. The 
lengths to which Government officials went to prevent me from investigating political 
killings is indicative of the extent of the Government&#8217;s repression of its critics and political 
opponents. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Likely security forces&#8217; abuses during the next election period 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3

<p>GE.10-14371 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>the Republican Guard into the FARDC, but it continues to operate outside of the command 
structures of the army and reports directly to the President. 
</p>
<p>79. These forces are able to kill with impunity. They are subject to no independent 
oversight, there is little clarity with regard to their respective roles, and political elites have 
been able to command them outside of formal structures. The Government has shown no 
appetite for reform, and the international community has not always spoken out strongly 
against abuses, despite numerous incidents of large-scale killings. 
</p>
<p>80. I spoke with numerous individuals who had been arrested, accused of being Bemba 
party supporters and detained for long periods. Some had been released only a few weeks 
before my mission took place. A number of those I interviewed provided credible evidence 
of having been tortured during questioning of their political allegiances. They were 
subjected to lengthy and arbitrary detention in inhumane conditions without access to legal 
counsel or a judge. These cases are serious violations in their own right. But they also 
sound alarm bells ahead of the next national elections, because they highlight the security 
forces&#8217; ability to operate outside the law and to intimidate the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>81. Because political activity in Bas Congo is seen to threaten the Government, one may 
expect targeted killings designed to intimidate BDK supporters and suppress the opposition, 
as well as deaths from excessive use of force in quelling BDK demonstrations, as the next 
election approaches. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Deaths in prisons 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-14371 
</p>
<p>due to illnesses such as diarrhoea. They also reported significant inter-prisoner violence, 
and stated that, while food was received once a week from the director, the strongest 
prisoners took the bulk of it. Many of the prisoners had never seen a judge or prosecutor. 
86. The prison system is in such disarray that even the number of prisons and prisoners 
in the country is unknown. Accurate records of the prison sentences of convicted criminals 
are not maintained. As judges from the Supreme Court explained, monitoring and record-
keeping is so poor in the criminal justice system that people can serve years beyond their 
sentence simply because the authorities do not know to release them, greatly contributing to 
overcrowding, resentment and prison violence. 
</p>
<p>87. In addition, security and intelligence agencies, including the Republican Guard and 
army military intelligence, operate detention facilities, although they have no legal 
authority to detain. Their goal is to suppress political opposition, and their operations are 
unchecked. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Killings of &#8220;witches&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>88. Significant numbers of children and women are accused of being witches in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and are subjected to torture, harsh beatings and other 
cruelty as a result.29 Some have been killed, or have died following cruel treatment. This 
violence is one outcome of a widespread social phenomenon in which vulnerable members 
of the community are blamed for misfortunes, such as the loss of a job or illness. According 
to international and local non-governmental organizations, tens of thousands of children 
abandoned on the streets of Kinshasa and other major cities are especially vulnerable to 
witchcraft accusations. Unsurprisingly, this phenomenon is most prevalent in poverty-
stricken communities, which lack access to education and social services, and the victims 
are often individuals with physical or mental disabilities who are perceived to have 
&#8220;brought defects&#8221; into a family or community. 
</p>
<p>89. Because of the remoteness of many communities and a level of secrecy around the 
practice, victim numbers are hard to ascertain. According to the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund, at least 12 accused child witches were killed in three provinces (Orientale, Maniema 
and Katanga) from September 2008 to early October 2009, mostly by their own family 
members. In Kasai Occidental, there are credible accounts of over 21 children subjected to 
harsh beatings and cruel treatment for alleged witchcraft. 
</p>
<p>90. Churches and cults that practice exorcism play an especially pernicious role, often 
condoning victimization and subjecting children to &#8220;exorcisms&#8221; or &#8220;deliverance&#8221; 
ceremonies in which they are forcibly isolated and deprived of food and water. In one 
emblematic case from Province Orientale, one of the wives of a polygamous man accused 
her husband&#8217;s young son of trying to kill her. The father took the son to be exorcised and a 
church deacon bound the child while the father and his wife poured boiling water on him. 
The wife submerged the child in water heated to over 90 degrees. He died of second degree 
burns. In another case in Katoko, Maniema, an 8-year-old boy died in October 2009 after a 
local pastor imprisoned him in a &#8220;prayer chamber&#8221; for seven days without food. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14371 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Killings of human rights defenders and journalists 
</b>92. Journalists and human rights defenders have been routinely harassed and intimidated 
because of their work on human rights violations and impunity.30 Those working in the 
eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo appear to be particularly vulnerable 
to attack, as are those supporting the work of the International Criminal Court.31 
Government officials have stigmatized human rights defenders for their advocacy, 
especially where it concerns violations by State actors, and officials have been implicated 
in a number of cases of harassment, death threats and killings of activists. 
</p>
<p>93. The intimidation aims to silence individual activists, prevent investigations and instil 
widespread fear among civil society. Threats and attacks against human rights defenders 
have gone largely unpunished, as local authorities often fail to adequately investigate and 
prosecute those responsible. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Vigilantism and mob justice 
</b>94. Vigilante killings and mob justice are widespread, and on the rise.32 In 2008, over 20 
such killings were recorded in Bukavu (South Kivu) alone.33 There are, however, no clear 
national statistics on the numbers of such killings. Victims are usually suspected thieves, 
rapists or witches.34 Often they are beaten or killed with machetes, and then set on fire, 
sometimes while still alive.35 Local populations often appear to view this as a legitimate 
means of securing justice, in large part owing to the absence of a functioning criminal 
justice system. 
95. The response from local police and other authorities to incidents of vigilante justice 
is often slow or non-existent; cases of investigation, prosecution and punishment of 
perpetrators are rare. At a policy level, little attention is paid to the issue. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Impunity for killings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Systemic problems 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> GE.10-14371 
</p>
<p>appointment, career path and removal of judges, although judges rarely speak publicly of 
such matters for fear of retaliation. The newly established High Council of Judicature is a 
positive measure to increase oversight of judges and to promote independent appointments, 
although at the time of writing it was not yet fully operational. 
</p>
<p>99. Additional serious problems that require long-term planning and commitment from 
the Government, the international community and civil society include severe 
underfunding; a shortage of judges and prosecutors, sometimes so severe that courts cannot 
sit; the lack of adequate training for judges, support staff and investigators; a lack of basic 
resources for judicial officials, such as office space or even paper; and the lack of any 
forensic capacity. In the military justice system, resource deficiencies mean that judges 
often do not have their own transport, and so must rely on the armed forces to facilitate 
investigations (including reliance upon the very units under inquiry). 
100. Many victims are justifiably afraid to complain to police or prosecutors. There is a 
very real risk that doing so would open them up to retaliation, especially because there is no 
witness protection programme. MONUC itself provides for witness protection for a small 
number of individuals and their families, but its limited resources and reach, and small staff 
size, mean only a small number are protected. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Recent limited improvements in military justice  
</b>101. Increased Government and international attention to impunity, especially in the 
Kivus since 2008, has brought some limited improvements. 
</p>
<p>102. The Kimia II commander in South Kivu informed me of 12 cases of extrajudicial 
executions sent to the courts between May and October 2009. They have so far resulted in 
one acquittal and two convictions (one death penalty sentence and one life sentence). In 
North Kivu, between October 2008 and August 2009, 16 soldiers appeared before the 
Goma court (in relation to nine separate killings, five of which were classified as suspected 
war crimes). Seven soldiers accused of one murder were acquitted; five accused of five 
separate killings were sentenced to death, and three to life imprisonment; one case was 
transferred. 
</p>
<p>103. In addition, five commanders named by the Security Council as responsible for 
sexual offences have been removed from command, although it seems that only two are 
under arrest. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Continued impunity for senior military commanders 
</b></p>
<p>104. Despite these limited improvements, impunity for senior commanders remains 
pervasive. The cause is not significantly related to the resource and institutional obstacles 
facing the Government described above; rather, it is a lack of political will to investigate, 
arrest or prosecute senior officers accused of grave abuses. The Government has even 
ordered that some legal proceedings against suspected war criminals be discontinued. The 
Minister for Justice confirmed to me that he addressed a letter on 9 February 2009 to 
military justice authorities in the Kivus, ordering them not to prosecute CNDP or ex-CNDP 
members. 
</p>
<p>105. On 5 July 2009, the Government took the positive step of announcing a &#8220;zero  </p>
<p>tolerance&#8221; policy with respect to ill-discipline and criminal activity by FARDC members. 
However, it has not been seriously implemented, and known perpetrators have not been 
arrested. When I publicly reported in October 2009 on the Shalio massacre, the Minister for  </p>
<p>Communications and Information announced that the Government was already aware of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14371 <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>FARDC&#8217;s responsibility for the massacre. He also stated, however, that Lieutenant Colonel 
Zimurinda would not be arrested, purportedly because they did not want to cause 
instability. 
</p>
<p>106. The most brazen example of impunity was the role of Bosco Ntaganda as a senior 
commander in the Kimia II operation. Ntaganda is wanted by the International Criminal 
Court for enlisting and using child soldiers in Ituri in 2002 and 2003, and has been accused 
of command responsibility for further war crimes, including those committed during the 
2008 Kiwanja massacre. Although the Minister for Defence addressed a letter to the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 29 
May 2009 stating that General Bosco Ntaganda was not involved in Kimia II, his current 
command role is widely acknowledged and not seriously disputed. Other FARDC Kimia II 
commanders suspected of responsibility for killings in violation of international 
humanitarian and human rights law include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Colonel Sultani Makenga (suspected involvement in massacres in Pinga and 
Lukweti in 2003 and 2004; the killing of children in Nyamilima in 2005; command 
responsibility for Buramba massacre; killings near Katwiguru, Kiseguru, Rubare) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Colonel Innocent Zimurinda (suspected command responsibility for killings in 
Rutshuru; Buramba massacre; Kiwanja killings; Shalio massacre) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Colonel Bernard Byamungu (suspected responsibility for killings in Kindu; 
massacres in Songwe, Route Camp Luama, Nyonga, in 2002; Kisangani massacre in 
2002) 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  Lieutenant Colonel Salumu Mulenda (suspected involvement in Mogwalu attack in 
2002; killings in Lipri and Bambu areas) 
</p>
<p>107. I asked officials why the above-mentioned individuals had not been arrested, despite 
their records of abuse and their whereabouts generally being well known. The 
Government&#8217;s stated position is that arresting senior commanders, especially ex-CNDP 
members, would potentially destabilize CNDP integration, provoke the splintering of armed 
groups and result in further violence to civilians. 
</p>
<p>108. The complexity of the security situation in the Kivus is vast, and the barriers to 
peace cannot be underestimated. But the Government&#8217;s blanket argument for &#8220;peace&#8221; over 
&#8220;justice&#8221; is profoundly mistaken. While it is not practical to immediately arrest every 
perpetrator, targeted arrests of key senior figures, planned so that they do not jeopardize 
civilian security, are realistic. The rapes, looting and massacres committed by FARDC 
soldiers throughout 2009 show only too clearly that peace does not come if justice is 
compromised, to allow those accused of serious human rights abuses to command military 
units. The continued leadership role of individuals such as Ntaganda sends a clear message 
to all soldiers that power and violence will outweigh the rule of law and respect for human 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b> XI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Extrajudicial executions in the Kivus 
</b>109. <b>Large numbers of civilians have been killed in the Kivus, either in revenge 
attacks by rebel groups, or in opportunistic attacks or massacres committed by the

<p><b>24</b> GE.10-14371 
</p>
<p><b> (a) All FARDC soldiers should be provided, and be required to wear, 
uniforms that identify their name and relevant unit. The Security Council should 
make this a precondition for United Nations assistance to Congolese military 
operations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Government should fully implement its &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy, and 
investigate, arrest, and prosecute FARDC members responsible for abuses. This 
especially includes the following senior commanders suspected of involvement in war 
crimes: General Bosco Ntaganda, Colonel Sultani Makenga, Colonel Innocent 
Zimurinda, Colonel Bernard Byamungu and Lieutenant Colonel Salumu Mulenda; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Senior leaders of the FDLR based outside the country, including in 
Germany and France, should be investigated for their role in war crimes and crimes 
against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and arrested and 
prosecuted accordingly; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) FDLR commanders should immediately issue orders to their soldiers to 
comply with human rights and humanitarian law at all times; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The conditionality policy of MONUC, setting out the terms on which it 
provides support to the Congolese Armed Forces, should be made public. It should be 
strictly adhered to, and the steps taken under it made public at an appropriate time; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The United Nations should consider creating an independent mechanism 
to monitor and investigate rights violations in accordance with the principles of 
impartiality, effectiveness and credibility; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The United Nations should ensure that its human rights reports are 
made public within a reasonable time period after investigations take place, and take 
steps to publish regular human rights situation updates; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) It is of the utmost importance that the United Nations release the results 
of its mapping project investigations.

<p><b> B. The Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army and killings in Province Orientale  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The LRA continues to present a serious threat to Province Orientale, as well as 
to the region generally: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) The Government and MONUC military presence in Province Orientale, 
and its ability to respond to LRA attacks, should be strengthened; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Governments of countries affected by the LRA, including Uganda, 
the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Sudan 
should, with international support, renew their regional military strategy with respect 
to the LRA. This should include measures to facilitate desertions from the LRA;

<p><b> (c) MONUC and the Government should work together to establish a 
community-based communications network in Province Orientale, with a view to 
receiving and responding quickly to warnings of LRA attacks on civilian populations;

</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Sexual violence is a significant cause of death of women, especially in the Kivus:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) The comprehensive MONUC strategy against sexual violence should be

</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Far too many prisoners die in a prison system that falls well below even the 
most basic standards of organization, monitoring and health:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Government, with international support, should immediately 
conduct a comprehensive census of the prison population. Any prisoners arbitrarily 
detained should be released;

 (c) Prison officials should record the details of any deaths in prisons, and 
regularly report to the Ministry of Justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Election-related violence 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>With regard to election-related violence: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) MONUC and the international community should consider the risk of 
violence by Government security forces during the next election period to be high. The 
security situation in the west of the Democratic Republic of the Congo should be 
closely monitored, and contingencies put in place for civilian protection; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Republican Guard should be fully integrated into the regular 
Congolese army;

<p><b>  Programme of the visit 
</b></p>
<p> I visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) at the invitation of the 
Government from 5&#8211;15 October 2009. I travelled to Kinshasa, Bas Congo (Kisantu), North 
Kivu (Goma), South Kivu (Bukavu and Minova) and Province Orientale (Dungu and 
Doruma).   
 I met with central Government, provincial and local officials, including: the Minister 
for Justice; the Minister for Human Rights; the President of the Senate; judges from the 
Supreme Court; the military Advocate-General; military and civilian judges in the 
provinces; the Minister for Public Works for South Kivu; army commanders, including 
commanders from Kimia II; prison officials, including the Director of the Central Prison of 
Goma; the Administrator of Dungu territory; and police officials. 
</p>
<p> I met with many civilian and military MONUC officials, including the MONUC 
Force Commander; the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the 
DRC, Ross Mountain; the Director of the Joint Human Rights Office; military commanders 
in Province Orientale, North Kivu, and South Kivu; officials from Political Affairs; and 
human rights officials in the provinces I visited. 
</p>
<p> I also met with international, national and local NGOs across the country, as well as 
representatives from humanitarian agencies, journalists and other country experts.   
 I met with a large number of witnesses to human rights abuses, and family members 
of victims. I met with former combatants, including former child soldiers, from the Lord&#8217;s 
Resistance Army, and the Forces D&#233;mocratiques pour la Lib&#233;ration du Rwanda. I met with 
prison detainees and former detainees. </p>

</p>
<p> Journalistes en Danger (which campaigns on behalf of detained/threatened 
journalists and for press freedom) launched a campaign about the murder of Bruno Koko 
Chirambiza, and then received threats and intimidation.  
</p>
<p> During the Kabila-Bemba clashes in 2006&#8211;2007, numerous journalists received 
death threats, were intimidated, and some went into hiding. This was especially the case for 
journalists working for media owned by Bemba (Canal Congo TV, Canal Kin TV, Radio 
Liberte &#8211; RALIK). Journalists en Danger&#8217;s staff also received death threats, allegedly from 
military and other Government officials.  
</p>
<p> In September 2009, three Bukavu-based journalists, Delphi Namuto and Caddy 
Adzouba from Radio Okapi and Jolly Kamuntu from Radio Maendeleo, faced death threats.  
</p>
<p> G&#233;g&#233; Katana, the founder and president of the Solidarity Movement of Women 
Human Rights Activists based in Uvira, has been arbitrarily arrested on several occasions 
and regularly receives death threats. Her movements are routinely under surveillance and 
between 1996 and 2003 she was completely banned from travelling.  
</p>
<p> In March 2008, Ms. Th&#233;r&#232;se Kerumbe, member of the association Women&#8217;s 
Solidarity for Peace and Integrated Development (SOFEPADI), received threats while she 
was in Europe to take part in an advocacy mission organized by FIDH on the fight against 
impunity and sexual violence in the DRC. Requests for protection to the local authorities 
went unanswered. She fled Bunia in the DRC after further threats, and is unable to return. 
In November 2008, SOFEPADI Coordinator Ms. Noella Usumange Aliswa and her family 
were attacked at their home in Bunia. She was seriously injured and had to be evacuated to </p>

SOFEPADI&#8217;s work in support of women conflict victims.  
</p>
<p> In July 2008, the staff of the Psychological and Medical Centre for the 
Rehabilitation of Torture Victims (Centre psycho-m&#233;dical pour la r&#233;habilitation des victims 
de la torture &#8211; CPMRVT/Kitshanga) were threatened by the CNDP, which sought medical 
registers containing the identities of victims of sexual violence. </p>

Alston (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3) &#224; l&#8217;issue de sa mission en 
R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo du 5 au 15 octobre 2009 
</b>1. Au niveau du R&#233;sum&#233; 
</p>
<p>- Il est incorrect de dire que &#171;les autorit&#233;s congolaises et l&#8217;ONU n&#8217;ont pas planifi&#233; 
correctement la protection des civils dans le cadre de leurs op&#233;rations&#187;. Cette assertion doit 
&#234;tre &#233;lagu&#233;e du rapport. 
</p>
<p>- L&#8217;expression &#171;les Forces de s&#233;curit&#233; politis&#233;es &#233;chappant &#224; tout contr&#244;le ont tu&#233; des 
centaines des partisans de l&#8217;opposition&#187; ne correspond &#224; aucune r&#233;alit&#233;. Cette phrase doit 
&#234;tre supprim&#233;e du rapport. 
</p>
<p>- Plusieurs autres affirmations gratuites se retrouvent dans le r&#233;sum&#233; du rapport, notamment 
&#171;les pouvoirs publics ne savent m&#234;me pas combien le pays compte de prisons et de 
d&#233;tenus&#187;; &#171;L&#8217;impunit&#233; est la r&#232;gle pour toutes les formes d&#8217;homicide&#187;. 
</p>
<p>2. Au niveau de diff&#233;rents paragraphes 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;18: cette grave all&#233;gation doit &#234;tre &#233;lagu&#233;e: &#171;Dans certaines zones, les groupes rebelles 
et l&#8217;arm&#233;e s&#8217;entendent entre eux pour tirer mutuellement profit de leurs activit&#233;s ill&#233;gales&#187; 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;20, 21 et 22: il est faux d&#8217;affirmer que les repr&#233;sailles &#233;taient pr&#233;visibles , voire 
in&#233;vitables: des trois paragraphes sont &#224; &#233;laguer car si responsabilit&#233; des meurtres il y a , ce 
sont les seuls FDLR identifi&#233;s qui en sont auteurs directs. 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;24: le rapport impute impun&#233;ment aux FARDC la mise &#224; sac de certains villages, sans 
pouvoir citer ces villages: &#224; &#233;laguer. 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;27: le rapport cite clairement le nom du commandant responsable des massacres alors 
qu&#8217;au &#167;17 il se tait intentionnellement sur les noms des commandants FDLR domicili&#233;s en 
France. 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;30: il est fauxd&#8217;affirmer que &#171;le gouvernement n&#8217;a pas mis en demeure les auteurs&#8230;.&#187; 
car la lutte contre l&#8217;impunit&#233; est une priorit&#233; du gouvernement et la politique tolarance z&#233;ro 
est pron&#233;e; le gouvernement ne cesse de rappeler les troupes &#224; l&#8217;ordre et d&#8217;organiser des 
proc&#232;s dans le cadre de la Cour op&#233;rationnelle &#224; Goma avec des proc&#232;s. A &#233;laguer. 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;46: en citant Joseph Kony, le rapport doit ajouter clairement qu&#8217;il fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un 
mandat d&#8217;arr&#234;t international (&#224; l&#8217;instar du contenu du &#167;105). 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;48 et 52: il y a des incertitudes sur les chiffres sur le nombre de civils tu&#233;s. C&#8217;est 
mieux de parler au conditionnel. 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;54: si des tueries il y a , la responsabilit&#233; incombe &#224; leurs auteurs, &#233;laguer la tendance &#224; 
faire porter la responsabilit&#233; au gouvernement qui s&#8217;&#233;vertue &#224; travers son action &#224; 
rechercher la paix sur le territoire, &#224; traquer les rebelles par ses diff&#233;rents programmes. Au 
lieu de f&#233;liciter le gouvernement, on cherche &#224; l&#8217;incriminer. La protection des civils est 
toujours sa priorit&#233;. Elaguer la 2&#232;me partie du paragraphe. 
</p>
<p>- &#167;59: &#233;laguer l&#8217;affirmation selon laquelle les actes restent impunis. Le paragraphe affirme 
m&#234;me qu&#8217;un procureur a &#233;t&#233; envoy&#233; &#224; Dungu, ce qui d&#233;montre la volont&#233; de lutter contre 
l&#8217;impunit&#233; et de sanctionner. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14371 <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>- &#167;65: &#201;laguer ce paragraphe: car les autorit&#233;s ont conscience du ph&#233;nom&#232;ne, m&#234;me une 
strat&#233;gie nationale de lutte contre les violences li&#233;es au genre a &#233;t&#233; adopt&#233;e en novembre 
2009 par le Gouvernement et la lutte contre l&#8217;impunit&#233; des violences occupe le premier 
volet et le Minist&#232;re de la Justice et droits Humains a une feuille de route de lutte contre 
l&#8217;impunit&#233; de ces violences sexuelles. Ce qui est vrai, le ph&#233;nom&#232;ne n&#8217;a plus la m&#234;me 
ampleur comme du temps de la guerre. 
</p>
<p>- &#167;67: &#224; corriger car contient des contradictions en son sein: affirme &#224; la fois qu&#8217;il y a des 
poursuites mais qu&#8217;il y en a que pour les officiers subalternes. C&#8217;est faux, il ya des 
poursuites pour tous car il y a des officiers sup&#233;rieurs &#224; la prison de Makala &#224; Kinshasa 
pour cela. Il y a des poursuites selon le mot d&#8217;ordre Tol&#233;rance z&#233;ro. Du reste, le paragraphe 
102 le confirme. Donc, les autorit&#233;s aussi sont poursuivis e pas seulement les subalternes. 
</p>
<p>- &#167;68: &#224; &#233;laguer: pas des tueries par les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; contre l&#8217;opposition. Il ya eu c&#8217;est 
vrai des affrontements &#224; Kinshasa apr&#232;s les &#233;lections qui ont fait des morts. 
</p>
<p>-  Au &#167;69: ce paragraphe doit &#234;tre supprim&#233; car il est inadmissible, dans le contexte du 
Conseil des Droits de l&#8217;Homme, organe non politis&#233;e, de tenter de relier certains faits 
all&#233;gu&#233;s (et non prouv&#233;s) &#224; un Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique(en citant avec d&#233;sinvolture son 
nom). 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;71: ce paragraphe contient des all&#233;gations graves et mensong&#232;res qui doivent &#234;tre 
&#233;lagu&#233;es du rapport. En effet, quels sont les noms de ces opposants qui &#233;taient d&#233;tenus et 
qui auraient &#233;t&#233; tu&#233;s? Quels sont les noms de ceux-l&#224; qui auraient &#233;t&#233; jet&#233;s dans des 
rivi&#232;res? 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;73: Le rapport semble pr&#233;senter le BDK comme un parti politique pacifique, &#233;voluant 
dans les normes et soucieux du bien-&#234;tre de la population. Alors que nul n&#8217;ignore qu&#8217;il 
s&#8217;agit d&#8217;un mouvement qui &#233;voluait en toute ill&#233;galit&#233; et qui a caus&#233; la mort et la d&#233;solation 
dans le Bas-Congo au sein de la population civile, dans les rangs de la Police nationale et 
m&#234;me au sein de certaines &#233;glises traditionnelles. 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;76: les plaintes se font au parquet qui enqu&#234;te 
- Au &#167;78: il faudrait supprimer cette all&#233;gation grave: &#171;Ces Forces ont la possibilit&#233; de tuer 
</p>
<p>en toute impunit&#233;&#187; 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;80: c&#8217;est tr&#232;s n&#233;gatif de projeter d&#233;j&#224; une fausse imputation au gouvernement quant &#224; 
l&#8217;organisation de prochaines &#233;lections: &#224; supprimer. 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;81: Les d&#233;clarations imput&#233;es au Ministre de la Justice doivent &#234;tre mod&#233;r&#233;es et 
situ&#233;es dans le temps car l&#8217;autorit&#233; cit&#233;e avait en outre d&#233;crit les nombreux efforts r&#233;alis&#233;s 
par le Gouvernement dans le cadre de la r&#233;forme p&#233;nitentiaire avec le concours des 
partenaires. En outre, le rapport dans son enti&#232;ret&#233; n&#8217;ayant cit&#233; personne, il serait mieux de 
s&#8217;abstenir de citer les autorit&#233;s mais des documents comme fait au paragraphe 96 parce que 
on ne sait pas v&#233;rifier l&#8217;all&#233;gation. 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;85: Il est incorrect et al&#233;atoire d&#8217;affirmer que &#171;la d&#233;sorganisation du syst&#232;me carc&#233;ral 
est telle que le nombre d&#8217;&#233;tablissements de d&#233;tention et de d&#233;tenus dans le pays n&#8217;est pas 
connu&#187;. Chaque &#233;tablissement p&#233;nitentiaire affiche ses statistiques journaliers et les 
transmets au secr&#233;tariat g&#233;n&#233;ral du minist&#232;re de la justice et droits humains. 
</p>
<p>- Aux &#167;87 &#224; 90: le rapport ne mentionne pas l&#8217;engagement du Gouvernement de la 
R&#233;publique de r&#233;primer s&#233;v&#232;rement les meurtres des personnes soup&#231;onn&#233;es de sorcellerie. 
De plus, en date du 10 janvier 2009, le Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique a promulgu&#233; la loi 
portant protection de l&#8217;enfant qui, en son article 160 al.2, r&#233;prime les accusations de 
sorcellerie. </p>

le Conseil Sup&#233;rieur de la magistrature qui est l&#8217;organe de nomination. Elaguer cette 
affirmation; 
</p>
<p>- Au &#167;103: cette d&#233;claration est &#224; v&#233;rifier. Le ministre s&#8217;est-il prononc&#233; dans ces termes? 
Comme dit au paragraphe 81, il serait mieux de s&#8217;abstenir de citer les autorit&#233;s dans le 
rapport mais de citer les documents. En outre, il est faux d&#8217;affirmer que l&#8217;impunit&#233; demeure

machine judiciaire d&#8216;agir.

<p>The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Kony in 2005. He is charged with 33 counts of crimes against 
humanity and war crimes, including enlisting children, cruel treatment, pillaging, enslavement, 
murder, and inhuman acts against civilian populations.

 There does not appear to be any study to track how many women have died as a result of sexual 
</p>
<p>violence. The difficulties of collecting information on sexual violence are exacerbated when victims 
have died. This is in large part because the data currently gathered is based on services provided to 
survivors, and also because more deaths likely take place in remote areas to which NGOs do not have 
access &#8211; and in which victims do not have life-saving medical support. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>22
 According to UNFPA statistics, between January and June 2009, 57% of victims were minors and 
</p>
<p>there were 460 cases against children less than 10 years old. UNFPA recorded 17 incidents against 
women older than 65 during the same period. There is anecdotal evidence that male rape is 
increasingly being used by both the FARDC and the FDLR, but because of the stigma and associated 
lack of formal reporting, I was not able to obtain exact numbers. Based on credible reports, at least 
two male rape victims have died as a result of their injuries. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>23
 The UNFPA&#8217;s statistics are an undercount and better used as trend analysis. Although a large number 
</p>
<p>of NGOs provide statistics to the UNFPA, participation in reporting is not mandatory and the 
involvement of NGOs varies widely. Survivors and family members often do not report rape because 
of fear of reprisal, the social stigma attached to rape, and lack of access to support facilities.

 Bemba was arrested in Belgium on 24 May 2008, following the lifting of a sealed arrest warrant 
</p>
<p>issued by the ICC. Bemba is accused of crimes committed in the Central African Republic, including 
torture, rape and murder. He is currently in custody, awaiting trial at the ICC.
