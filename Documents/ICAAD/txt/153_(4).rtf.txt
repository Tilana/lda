Analysis of Evidence Placed Before the Court

15.     
 Evidence by the Valuer, Mr Ramesh Behari from Fair View Valuations:

(a)     
Valuation report dated 30th July 2012 was marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit P1;

(b)     
He stated that he saw the building dwelling made out of concrete, wooden floor;

(c)     
He stated building was valued at $27,000 which was stated in the report and he further stated with the land it would have been further $15,000 increase of the value (it is noted that no valuation was available for the land);

(d)     
In replying during the cross examination it was admitted there were two flats and one was occupied by Ms Keola and other flat was vacant.

It is important to note in the valuation report, it was stated that Mr Vijay Prasad, the Plaintiff in this case instructed Mr Behari to value the property. I also considered the Valuation Report which does not give any basis of the valuation and method of valuation. Accordingly, I cannot concede to accept the valuation given in Plaintiff's exhibit P1, as it is.

16.     
Evidence by Ms Keola Wati was filed prior to the hearing by way of brief of evidence which was filed on 24th August 2012 and witness Ms Keola sworn the counsel for the Plaintiff read out the evidence in brief and the Ms Wati admitted that same was signed by her at the office of M.C. Lawyers Solicitors for the Plaintiff.

17.     
Ms Wati stated in her evidence in brief:

(a)     
Vijay Prasad is her sister's son and she knew the Plaintiff since he was born. Until 1969 she was living with her husband until his demise at Wailoku;

(b)     
She had moved to the Plaintiff's residence at Baulevu, Nausori the subject land in 1971 to live with the Plaintiff's family;

(c)     
She stated when she moved in the house was built on the land consisting of five bedrooms, two sitting rooms, one kitchen, toilet and bathroom and other amenities. Partially house was built of concrete and partially of wood;

(d)     
House was divided in two flats occupied by the family of the Plaintiff and his brother Jagdishwar Prasad;

(e)     
Both brothers were engaged in farming and subject house was built by her brother Bhagwan Din (deceased) more than 60 years ago;

(f)     
The wife of Bhagwan Din is living with her son in United States with the Plaintiff;

(g)     
The witness was living in the house over 40 years and continued to live in the property after the Plaintiff migrated to United States in 2006;

(h)     
The Plaintiff had advised her to live in the property and look after it before his departure to United States. He was awaiting the lease to be issued to him by Lands Department;

(i)     
She had not received any notice from the Lands Department to vacate the property and she has no place to go since she doesn't have children and she will be homeless;

(j)     
She stated that she continued with farming by getting one Avinesh Chand who is the son of her brother;

(k)     
She alleged that in 2007, 2nd Defendant forcefully took the land only remaining is the house valued at 27,000 and stated Land Department should compensate the Plaintiff. Alternatively the house with land on which the house is built should be given to the Plaintiff;

(l)     
The witness was aware that the Plaintiff was paying the rent to the Lands Department until the 2nd Defendant took over the land and the Plaintiff paid $5000 to his lawyers and said sum should be reimbursed.

18.     
Under the cross examination by the counsel the witness stated that she was not paying any rent for 40 years.

19.     
In the Agreed Bundle of documents Lease document dated 25th November 1959 states:

1)      
The right to occupy the land is not Transferrable;

2)      
Land may be used for solely for the agricultural purposes and no building may be erected thereon after the date hereof;

3)      
The Tenant should vacate the land on receipt of notice to that effect and the letter dated 25th November 1959 does not operate to create a tenancy;

4)      
The letter also stated the classification:


	Classification	Acres	
	Cane farm	10.0	
	House site	 0.3	


This document is admitted by the Parties in their Statement of Claim and Statement of Defence.

20.     
On perusal of the document, I find that although the letter says land may be used solely for agricultural purpose by inserting house site as 0.3 acres and the Director of Lands was aware the lessee had the permission to build a house.

21.     
The Statement of Defence paragraph 7 stated that the land was leased out solely for the agricultural purpose. No evidence adduced by the Defendants to prove this position. Only document available to the court to consider was the Crown Lease and I conclude for the reasons set out in the paragraph 19 the 1st Defendant was well aware that the Plaintiff was permitted to have a house in the site.

22.     
As I stated in the preceding paragraph 14, the Plaintiff was only pursuing the claim for damages. Already I have concluded that the 1st Defendant was at the time of the issue of the Crown Lease there was a housing site and the Plaintiff's deceased father constructed the house. It is also evident that tenancy created by the First Defendant by letter dated 25th November 1959 Ref. L.D. 4/14/1403 para 5 states:

"................compensation being payable for improvement as such the Plaintiff is entitled for compensation as damages". 

23.     
The document marked P1 and tendered in these proceedings through the Valuer, Mr Ramesh Behari was not contested by the 1st and 3rd Defendants. As I stated earlier, I am not satisfied with the valuation report since the valuation do not give any basis only statement made therein is "improvements made thereon as at date of valuation at Twenty Seven Thousand Dollars ($27,000)":

(a)     
The witness Keola Wati gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff stated the house is over 40 years old and no depreciation was calculated by the Valuer as at the date of valuation 30th July 2012;

(b)     
The only reason to award damages by me on this valuation is that it was not disputed by the Defendants and no evidence placed before me to the contrary. However, I use the inherent jurisdiction of this court to arrive at a figure considering depreciation of the value on improvements and conclude depreciating the value by 25% of the P1:


	Valuation 	$27,000.00	
	Less 25% for depreciation	 6,750.00	
		(27000 x 25/100)	
	Value     
$20,250.00		


(c)     
The Defendants should have paid for the improvements on the above value soon after the cancellation of the Tenancy created by the Crown Lease on the Plaintiff by letter dated 16/7/2007. The 1st Defendant failed to do so. I award interest to the Plaintiff at 4% per annum from the date of the cancellation up to the date of this Judgment considering loss of income on the compensation as at 3rd April 2013.

Amount payable as compensation/damages:

1)      
$20,250 from 16.7.2007 to 15.7.2012 (5 years) 

(20,250 x 4 x 5)        
 = $ 4050.00
100

2)      
Interest for 261 days 20250 x 4 x 261 = $ 579.20 100 365

Total compensation to be paid: 

Compensation = 20,250.00

1)      
Add interest for 5 years =      
 4,050.00

2)      
Add interest for 261 days= 579.20

$24,879.20

The damages arisen due to the action of the 1st Defendant and I conclude the First Defendant should pay the compensation as Special Damages, there is no liability of damages being proven against the 2nd Defendant. 3rd Defendant is added as the legal representative of the Government of Fiji only and awarding damages does not arise.

24.     
Accordingly, I order:

(i)     
The 1st Defendant to pay the Plaintiff the total sum of $24,879.20 as at the date of this Judgment i.e. 3rd April 2013 together with interest at the rate of 4% per annum on the said Judgment the sum of $24,879.20 until the payment is made;

(ii)    
Claim for general damages is refused;

(iii)   
Interest awarded under item (i) above;

(iv)    
The 1st Defendant should pay summarily assessed costs of $2,500.00 to the Plaintiff within 14 days from this Judgment.

Delivered at Suva this 3rd Day of April, 2013.
