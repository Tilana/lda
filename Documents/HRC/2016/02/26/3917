<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 14/13, the Human Rights Council (HRC) requested the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to submit to the Council an annual report on the question 
of the realization in all countries of economic, social and cultural rights (ESCRs). The 
present report refers to activities relevant to the promotion and protection of these rights, 
with a particular focus on the activities of United Nations treaty bodies, special procedures 
mandates holders, and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). 
The present report includes a number of illustrative examples of the activities undertaken 
by OHCHR headquarters and field presences in the area of economic, social and cultural 
rights. 
</p>
<p>2. The year under review witnessed an important development in the field of ESCRs. 
On 28 July 2010, the United Nations General Assembly (GA) adopted a resolution 
recognizing <b>water and sanitation</b> as rights. On 30 September 2010, the HRC unanimously 
adopted a resolution affirming &#8220;that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is 
derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right 
to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as the right to life 
and human dignity&#8221;, thereby anchoring it in article 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic Social and Cultural Rights. In November 2010, at its forty&#8211;fifth session, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted a statement on the right to 
sanitation in which it highlighted the need for the full recognition of this right by States 
parties. In addition to the support provided to the Independent Expert on the issue of human 
rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation and to the above-
mentioned resolutions, in 2010, OHCHR, in collaboration with World Health Organization 
(WHO) and United Nations Human Settlement Programme (UN-HABITAT), issued a fact 
sheet on the right to water in order to raise awareness on the content of this right. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Leadership in human rights 
</b></p>
<p>3. The 2010 annual report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to the 
Economic and Social Council focused on the economic, social and cultural rights of 
<b>migrants</b> in host countries (E/2010/89). Based on international instruments, the work of 
treaty bodies and special procedures mandate holders, as well as international and regional 
case law, the report highlighted the human rights obligations of States with regard to all 
migrants, including irregular migrants. 
</p>
<p>4.  As Chair of the Global Migration Group (GMG) for the second half of 2010, 
OHCHR promoted and mainstreamed a human rights-based approach to migration within 
the United Nations system and beyond, thus contributing to increased responsiveness to 
migrants&#8217; rights on the part of the international community. On 30 September 2010, the 
Principals of GMG adopted a landmark joint statement on the human rights of irregular 
migrants, stressing the principle of non-discrimination and States&#8217; obligations to respect, 
protect and fulfil, inter alia, the economic, social and cultural rights of migrants under 
international law, including the right to the highest attainable standard of health, adequate 
food, adequate housing, just and favourable conditions of work.  
</p>
<p>5.  OHCHR also conducted and submitted to the Human Rights Council a study on 
migrant children&#8217;s rights, including their rights to health, education, adequate housing and </p>


<p>family reunion. In March 2010, OHCHR supported and participated in the Global 
Consultation on Migrants&#8217; Health organized by WHO and the International Organization 
for Migration (IOM) in Madrid, Spain.  
</p>
<p>6.  In relation to the <b>food crisis</b>, OHCHR actively participated in the Secretary&#8211;
General&#8217;s High&#8211;Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis. In particular, 
OHCHR contributed to updating the Comprehensive Framework for Action, as a common 
strategic framework for United Nations agencies, international financial institutions and the 
World Trade Organization (WTO). The Updated Comprehensive Framework for Action 
(UCFA) recognizes the right to food and the human rights-based approach as strategic entry 
points for addressing world food security and nutrition. Human rights considerations are 
integrated throughout the recommendations formulated in the UCFA as cross&#8211;cutting 
issues. 
</p>
<p>7.  OHCHR continued its advocacy for the use of <b>indicators</b> to strengthen human rights 
policies and monitoring systems on economic, social and cultural rights at country, regional 
and international levels. On the occasion of the first World Statistics Day (20 December 
2010), the High Commissioner highlighted how data enable more effective promotion, 
monitoring and implementation of human rights standards, and noted that the framework 
developed by OHCHR1  makes available precise and up-to-date data to help States assess 
progress in human rights implementation and capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>8.  Drawing from this methodology, which was endorsed by the treaty bodies in 2008, 
field presences in <b>Ecuador</b>, <b>Mexico </b>and <b>Nepal</b> have continued working towards 
strengthening the capacity of national authorities for developing indicators to be used as a 
tool to monitor economic, social and cultural rights. For example, in Mexico, OHCHR, the 
National Institute for Statistics and Geography, and the National Human Rights 
Commission have achieved prominent advances in their work on indicators, especially for 
the rights to health and education. Indicators for the right to health were subject to 
validation involving over 70 experts, including governmental institutions, civil society 
organizations and human rights local commissions, which contributed to improving the 
indicators and enabling more systematic monitoring of the right. In Nepal, OHCHR 
continued its support to the Government, national human rights institutions and civil 
society organisations to identify and contextualize indicators for monitoring ESCRs. One of 
the outcomes was the integration of human rights indicators into the National Human 
Rights Action Plan that outlines the Government&#8217;s plans and priorities for 2010-2012, in a 
number of areas, including health, education, administration of justice and institution 
building, and addresses targeted programmes for marginalized and vulnerable groups. In 
Ecuador, OHCHR, the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, the National Institute of 
Statistics and Census, the National Secretary of Planning and Development, the 
Ombudsman and United Nations agencies were involved in the design of a national plan for 
developing the use of indicators to promote and monitor the implementation of human 
rights, including economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>9.  Given the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&#8217; request to States 
parties to identify statistical indicators and related national benchmarks for each right 
provided for in the Covenant, OHCHR conducted training workshops on the conceptual and 
methodological framework for indicators developed with the treaty bodies at the request of 
national stakeholders, including Governments, national human rights institutions, and 
United Nations Country Teams. Technical assistance on human rights indicators was also 
provided by OHCHR to a number of countries, including <b>Guatemala, Kenya </b>and the 
<b>United Kingdom</b>. OHCHR started developing practical tools to help disseminate and 
</p>

<p>operationalize the adopted framework. An expert meeting organized by OHCHR in June 
2010, and attended by members of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
and other treaty bodies, help to validate the preliminary draft of a practical guide on the 
methodology for developing indicators. OHCHR's methodology for developing human 
rights indicators also contributed to the framework for action of the High-Level Task Force 
on the Global Food Security Crisis, which provided illustrative indicators for assessing, 
monitoring and evaluating food and nutrition security situations. 
</p>
<p>10.  Further to Human Rights Council resolution 11/8, OHCHR prepared a thematic 
study on <b>preventable maternal mortality and morbidity</b> and human rights 
(A/HRC/14/39), which was considered in a panel discussion on 14 June 2010. Following   
During the discussion, 108 countries issued a joint statement requesting the High 
Commissioner to take the study to the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) to demonstrate the need to integrate a human rights 
perspective to achieving all MDGs, in particular Goal 5 on maternal health. On 30 
September 2010, the Council adopted, by consensus, a resolution welcoming OHCHR's 
report, and requesting the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare an analytical 
compilation on good and effective practices to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity. 
That request, which was supported by 96 co&#8211;sponsors, indicated the international 
community&#8217;s increasing responsiveness to the issue which previously had been addressed 
outside the human rights arena. 
</p>
<p>11.  The year 2010 marked an important milestone in the process towards achieving the 
<b>Millennium Development Goals</b>, which are intimately linked and instrumental to the 
progressive realization of human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights. The 
OHCHR substantively contributed to the General Assembly&#8217;s High-level Plenary Meeting 
on the MDGs (MDG Summit) by advocating a stronger position for human rights in the 
deliberations and in the outcome of the Summit, and promoting greater understanding of 
the linkages between human rights and development. As part of its communication strategy, 
the United Nations and OHCHR have developed complementary and linked 
communications tools, including websites.2 In August 2010, an article on human rights and 
the MDGs, entitled &#8220;MDGs: Time is Running Out&#8221;, signed by the High Commissioner, was 
published in 16 media outlets in 13 countries in 8 languages. Such efforts have succeeded 
in the earning recognition by Heads of States of the central importance of human rights for 
achieving the MDGs, by spelling out human rights commitments in concrete terms to 
illustrate how commitments can be translated into action. These commitments highlight the 
practical implications of key human rights principles, such as equality, non-discrimination, 
participation, accountability and transparency, in both national development strategies and 
international development partnerships. Furthermore, the outcome document of the MDG 
Summit made more explicit the alignment of MDG targets with specific sets of human 
rights standards as a pre-requisite for formulating and implementing more integral human 
rights-sensitive development strategies. 
</p>
<p>12.  On 20 October 2010, the High Commissioner delivered her statement at the 65th 
session of the General Assembly, in which she referred, inter alia, to the financial crash, the 
economic recession and the MDG Summit. With regard to the latter, she noted that the 
outcome document provided &#8220;a framework for filling gaps that invariably open up when 
abuses of human rights take place, including economic, social and cultural rights 
violations.&#8221;

</p>
<p>http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/MDG/Pages/MDGIndex.aspx.  </p>


<p>13.  During the period under review, OHCHR continued to identify areas where further 
human rights analysis was needed. OHCHR organized a first consultation (Geneva, 29 
November-1 December 2010) to discuss <b>land </b>issues &#8211; an emerging issue of concern &#8211; from 
a human rights perspective, and to inform the work of the Office. Discrimination, 
inequalities and poverty are often closely linked to land issues, and heavily impact a large 
number of human rights, many of which are economic, social and cultural rights, and the 
situation of many marginalized groups, such as women, indigenous peoples, minorities, 
internally displaced persons (IDPs), and urban and rural poor. 
</p>
<p>14.  In 2010, OHCHR stepped up its research and strategic advocacy within the United 
Nations system, and with external stakeholders, in order to bring visibility to the critical  
human rights situation of<b> older persons</b>. OHCHR organized an Expert Group Meeting 
(Geneva, 25-26 May 2010), jointly with UNDESA, and contributed to the Secretary-
General&#8217;s report, Follow&#8211;up to the Second World Assembly on Ageing (A/65/157), which 
provided a comprehensive overview of the social situation, well-being, development and 
rights of older persons the world over. OHCHR also contributed to two key developments 
relating to the economic, social and cultural rights of older persons, namely the report of the 
Independent Expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty to the Human 
Rights Council on social pensions and older persons (A/HRC/14/31), and General 
Recommendation No. 27 on older women and protection of their human rights of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, adopted in October 2010.  
</p>
<p>15.  In December 2010, the General Assembly adopted resolution 65/182 establishing an 
open-ended working group aimed at strengthening protection of the human rights of older 
persons by considering the existing international framework, identifying possible gaps and 
how best to address them, including by considering, as appropriate, the feasibility of further 
instruments and measures. 
</p>
<p>16.  OHCHR continued to deliver various training courses on economic, social and 
cultural rights. A pilot course on strategies and skills to monitor and protect economic, 
social and cultural rights was offered to OHCHR staff in all regions and types of field 
presences, including headquarters. This course is intended to be a regular feature of the 
OHCHR learning and training courses offered to staff and stakeholders as a part of the 
training programme based on the OHCHR Human Rights Monitoring Manual. Budget 
monitoring is particularly pertinent to monitoring the realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights in relation to the maximum use of available resources. Therefore, OHCHR 
published a training package and a guide on human rights and budget monitoring, in 
partnership with the International Human Rights Internship Program (IHRIP) for member 
States and other national partners, and trained 28 OHCHR staff to support follow-up 
initiatives at the regional and country levels.  
</p>
<p>17.  OHCHR continues to prioritize the development, publication and dissemination of 
tools and materials to enhance knowledge about economic, social and cultural rights. In 
2010, OHCHR published several fact sheets, including on the right to adequate food, in 
collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). OHCHR continues to 
produce the OHCHR ESCR Bulletin for in-house circulation, and since October 2010, for 
public distribution. The Bulletin is a bi&#8211;monthly information tool summarizing key 
developments, materials, tools and case law on ESCRs around the world. 
</p>
<p>18.  OHCHR also used public information<b> </b>to promote economic, social and cultural 
rights worldwide and to inform various target audiences of their rights. During 2010, 
OHCHR issued 49 press releases and 37 feature stories relating to economic, social and 
cultural rights, organized media briefings, interviews and press conferences, including for 
the presentation of special procedures mandate holders reports to the United Nations 
General Assembly. </p>


<p><b> B. Country engagement and field presence 
</b></p>
<p>19.  In 2010, OHCHR continued to strengthen its country engagement efforts through 
awareness-raising and monitoring activities, research on specific issues, technical 
cooperation and assistance, collaboration with various stakeholders, as well as increased 
deployment of human rights staff to countries, regional offices and peace missions. 
Technical staff working on ESCRs at headquarters undertook over 20 missions in 2010 to 
offer assistance and support to Governments, Parliaments, United Nations Country Teams 
(UNCTs), field presences and civil society on rights such as the right to the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, adequate housing, adequate food, 
education, and on the legal protection and justiciability of economic, social and cultural 
rights. The following sections give a non-exhaustive illustration of some of the activities 
undertaken by OHCHR field presences around the world.  
</p>
<p>20.  In <b>Moldova</b>, OHCHR Human Rights Adviser (HRA) assisted the Government with 
ratifying the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 
September 2010, and continues to support the implementation of the Convention with the 
Ministry of Labour, Social Protection and the Family, the Ministry of Health and the State 
Chancellery. In March 2010, OHCHR assisted the Ministry of Health in establishing a 
Health and Human Rights Working Group to review law, policy and practice in the health 
field for its human rights compliance. Subgroups were subsequently established on 
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, sexual and reproductive health, and mental health. During 2010, a 
number of regulations in this field were revised, including those addressing the detention of 
persons with tuberculosis, and access to personal data about persons living with HIV/AIDS. 
OHCHR also provided the Supreme Court with relevant international law guidance with 
regard to mandatory HIV testing of foreigners as justification for refusing residence. The 
December 2010 Supreme Court ruling paved the way for legal reform in this area. In 
addition, OHCHR assisted the Government in preparing a comprehensive anti&#8211;
discrimination law, provided advice on a draft Education Code, and worked with the 
Bureau on Inter-ethnic Relations to prepare a new Action Plan on Roma Inclusion. 
Throughout the period, the HRA also worked with Moldovan civil society and national 
human rights institutions (NHRIs) and UNCT to strengthen knowledge of economic, social 
and cultural rights, by organizing training sessions on the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and processes for monitoring the treaty. 
</p>
<p>21.  In May 2010, the OHCHR HRA in <b>Serbia,</b> in collaboration with the Ministry of 
Human and Minority Rights, and with the support of United Nations Roma Theme Group 
and OHCHR Geneva organized two workshops on the right to adequate housing and the 
nature of State obligation at the local and national levels. The workshops were held in 
Belgrade on 19 and 20 May 2010, and participants included representatives of six local 
self-governments, namely Kragujevac, Kraljevo, Nis, Vranje, Leskovac and Novi Sad, 
representatives of various national institutions, such as line ministries, Office of the 
Ombudsman, Serbian Roads public company, national Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) 
team, as well as representatives of the City of Belgrade.  
</p>
<p>22.  The OHCHR field presence in <b>Kosovo3</b> introduced the OHCHR human rights 
indicators framework, particularly those relating to economic, social and cultural rights, in a 
training course for 50 government officials responsible for human rights policymaking and 
implementation, and advocated for more effective implementation of the Anti&#8211;
Discrimination Law in this context. Between 2005 and 2010, the field presence monitored 
the cases of about 700 Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian internally displaced persons in northern 
</p>
<p>  
 3 See reference on page 1. </p>


<p>Kosovo who had been affected by lead-poisoning, advocated their relocation to safer 
conditions, and supported the special procedures mandate holders in monitoring the 
situation. In October 2010, relocation was successfully completed, following combined or 
separate actions of United Nations agencies, United Nations Interim Administration in 
Kosovo, Kosovo institutions, the European Commission and bilateral donors. 
</p>
<p>23.  The OHCHR-<b>Regional Office for Central Asia</b> translated a number of international 
human rights instruments and tools into national languages, including the Optional Protocol 
to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Basic principles and 
guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement. The translations were printed 
for further distribution among Government bodies, judges, NGOs, universities and United 
Nations agencies. 
</p>
<p>24.  OHCHR continued raising awareness in the <b>Russian Federation</b> through the 
reprinting and dissemination of ESCR-related publications, co-sponsoring human rights 
promotional activities, and holding discussions with ombudspersons. In Moscow, OHCHR 
contributed to the celebration of World Habitat Day with a presentation on the right to 
adequate housing.   
</p>
<p>25.  In 2010, the OHCHR-<b>Pacific Regional Office</b> increased its engagement on human 
rights and trade, and contributed to raising the profile of the link between human rights and 
trade in the Pacific region, which impacts on a number of economic, social and cultural 
rights. The Regional Office (RO) also assisted UNCTs in Fiji and Samoa with developing 
and implementing a strategy on human rights with 14 Governments in the region. The RO 
coordinated the finalization of a strategy on human rights prepared by a UNCT, which was 
adopted in January 2010. Both strategies included the promotion of economic, social and 
cultural rights. The strategy resulted in the issuance of invitations to visit to several special 
procedures mandate holders by State authorities. The RO also supported the establishment 
of the Pacific Humanitarian Protection Cluster, and has worked actively to increase its 
membership. The RO, together with partners, provided training on protection in 
emergencies in three countries, and supported human rights integration into plans in four 
countries. The RO supported the creation of human rights protection working groups in 
Samoa and Fiji, advocated for long-term displacement situations in Solomon Islands and 
Papua New Guinea, and will release (in 2011) the report of a pilot study entitled, &#8220;Human 
rights monitoring of persons internally displaced by the 2009 tsunami in Samoa&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>26.  In <b>Papua New Guinea,</b> OHCHR undertook an assessment mission on the right to 
adequate housing in Port Moresby, Goroka, Madang and Lae in July 2010. The mission 
team, made up of the regional representative for the Pacific, the HRA in Papua New Guinea 
and a housing rights expert from headquarters, held consultations with relevant 
Government officials at the national and local levels, and civil society organizations. In 
each location, workshops were held to raise awareness among stakeholders of international 
standards on the right to adequate housing, with particular focus on forced evictions. The 
mission visited settlements in all of the cities to consult with victims of forced evictions and 
people living in informal settlements. The findings were presented to UNCT, which has 
since increased dialogue on the issue with the Government. A report including a proposal 
for programming on forced evictions and the right to adequate housing from 2011 onwards 
is being finalized. In December 2010, the HRA actively contributed to the organization of a 
film festival and debates on, inter alia, ESCRs and the right to adequate housing. A large 
portion of the audience was constituted by people living in informal settlements. 
</p>
<p>27.<b>  Timor Leste</b> is finalizing its National Strategic Development Plan for the next 10 
years, following consultations in all sub&#8211;districts, and has set national priorities which are 
in line with the Government&#8217;s commitment to furthering the MDGs, with a strong focus on 
economic and social rights, in particular poverty eradication, food security, housing, water 
and sanitation, and employment. In November 2010, at an OHCHR-funded event to </p>


<p>celebrate International Children&#8217;s Day, the right to food was actively discussed by 
representatives of the Ministries of Health, Education, and Social Solidarity and a Member 
of the National Parliament, among others. In November 2010, the United Nations 
Integrated Mission in Timor Leste (UNMIT) Human Rights and Transitional Justice 
Section (HRTJS) completed a survey on the challenges faced by the Mental Health Focal 
Points (MHFP) of the Ministry of Health&#8211;of which there are 16 in the country&#8211;and which 
have reported that they are responsible for providing medical care to more than 3,000 
persons with mental disabilities, nationwide. The main challenges reported by the MHFPs 
included the lack of specialized training and information, insufficient human resources, lack 
of access to specialized doctors in the districts, lack of transport and basic communication 
equipment, shortage of medicines, and families objecting to modern medical treatment, 
instead of traditional medicine. 
</p>
<p>28.  The National Parliament of Timor Leste celebrated International Human Rights Day 
with an extraordinary session on economic, social and cultural rights, during which 
different speakers, including the President of the Republic, the President of Parliament and 
Party leaders, stressed the importance of realizing economic, social and cultural rights. 
During the reporting period, UNMIT-HRTJS provided seven Timorese civil society 
organizations and networks with micro-grants from OHCHR&#8217;s Technical Cooperation 
Project to monitor the right to education, health, adequate housing and food. As a result, the 
NGOs have produced reports that are being used for advocacy with the Government at the 
local and national levels. UNMIT-HRTJS also launched a pilot project on ESCRs in a 
remote village in Bobonaro District, with a view to strengthening the capacity of the 
community to claim rights, and that of duty bearers to realize rights. The community, which 
was involved in every step of the project, identified its priorities, and work was started to 
improve sanitation in the village. The project will continue until mid 2011. 
</p>
<p>29.  On 30 March 2010, OHCHR released a report based on field research and entitled, 
&#8220;The Human Rights Dimension of Poverty in <b>Afghanistan</b>&#8221;. The report emphasizes the 
importance of integrating human rights concerns, such as those relating to the right to food, 
health, adequate housing and education, among others, into Afghanistan&#8217;s poverty 
reduction policies and strategies, in order to address the root causes of poverty. As a follow-
up to the report, OHCHR and United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan 
(UNAMA) is conducting extensive research on the right to health, with focus on human 
rights principles, including equality and non-discrimination, in health-sector policies and 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>30. In 2010, OHCHR-<b>Nepal,</b> in cooperation with the National Human Rights 
Commission, organized three major workshops on monitoring economic, social and cultural 
rights for local government officials, civil society organisations and community-based 
groups. These workshops resulted in the creation of local networks to monitor economic, 
social and cultural rights violations in various districts. The Office also advocated increased 
protection of economic, social and cultural rights in the new Constitution, through the 
provision of inputs and comments to the Committee on Fundamental Rights and Directive 
Principles of the Constituent Assembly. OHCHR-Nepal continued to monitor forced 
evictions of landless people in the Far Western Region, as well as the process of liberation 
and rehabilitation of <i>haliyas (</i>bonded labourers working as land tillers) and <i>kamlaris</i> 
(bonded child labourers) through advocacy with the Government, and support to local 
NGOs in their efforts to improve access to justice and basic services for these groups. A 
positive development was the completion by the Government of official national statistics 
on the <i>haliya</i> population<i>,</i> following the survey that was conducted in 2009. 
</p>
<p>31.  In May 2010, OHCHR-<b>Regional Office for West Africa</b>, in cooperation with the 
International Labour Office (ILO) Regional Office for the Sahel, organized a two-day 
regional conference on the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights for </p>


<p>Parliamentarians, State representatives, national human rights institutions, trade unions and 
civil society organizations from Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Mali and Senegal. As a follow-
up to the conference, the RO supported the publication of leaflets explaining the purpose of 
the Optional Protocol to ICESCR, and encouraged its ratification by, among others, 
organizing national seminars, including in Mali and Burkina Faso in December 2010. In 
October 2010, OHCHR provided training sessions on reporting under ICESCR in Senegal 
and Cape Verde. It also organized training and awareness-raising activities for internal staff 
and external partners in West Africa, with a view to increasing knowledge on key issues 
affecting women's access to justice, economic, social and cultural rights and participation in 
decision-making. A training workshop on women's human rights, and gender 
mainstreaming was organized in Niamey, Niger, for 10 Heads of field presences in West 
Africa and 20 United Nations and national partners. 
</p>
<p>32.  The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office (UNJHRO) in the <b>Democratic 
Republic of Congo </b>(DRC) continued to monitor the violations of economic, social and 
cultural rights, and the illegal exploitation of natural resources, with particular attention to 
the case of mass rape in Walikale. It also conducted capacity-building activities for 
Governmental and non-governmental actors on the topic, including a round table with the 
Parliamentarian Network for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights, held on 25 
and 26 October 2010. Moreover, UNJHRO, in collaboration with the International 
Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), organized a workshop on economic, 
social and cultural rights and exploitation of natural resources in DRC on 17 and 18 August 
2010. The workshop paid particular attention to the relation between the exploitation of 
natural resources and the ongoing conflict in the eastern part of the country. It was 
recommended that DRC strengthen the fight against impunity, and ratify the protocols on 
certification and traceability. 
</p>
<p>33.  OHCHR-<b>Middle East Regional Office</b> continued to advocate for Palestinians&#8217; right 
to work in Lebanon through its participation in the United Nations Integrated Working 
Group on Palestinian Issues, the Protection Working Group in North Lebanon, and its 
cooperation with the Committee for the Employment of Palestinians in Lebanon. A first 
positive step in 2010 was the decision made by the Lebanese Ministry of Labour exempting 
Palestinian refugees from application of a law restricting certain professions to Lebanese 
citizens only. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Partnerships with civil society and United Nations agencies 
</b></p>
<p>34.  OHCHR continued its close partnership and collaboration with various United 
Nations agencies, regional human rights mechanisms, and civil society organizations 
working on issues related to the promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural 
rights, the MDGs and poverty reduction. 
</p>
<p>35.  OHCHR participated as a panellist in an Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights (IACHR) thematic hearing of 23 March 2010 on discrimination against women in 
the exercise of their economic and social rights. In addition, on 18 and 19 October 2010, 
OHCHR participated in the IACHR working meeting aimed at identifying ways to 
overcome the barriers currently limiting the economic, social and cultural rights of women 
in the Americas.   
</p>

<p>link human rights principles and standards to programming in the areas of, inter alia, sexual 
and reproductive health, gender, and youth. 
</p>
<p>37.  In 2010, OHCHR and WHO strengthened their partnership and increased the areas 
of mutual collaboration. New areas of cooperation include the Tuberculosis and Human 
Rights Task Force, co-chaired by WHO and UNAIDS, which OHCHR has joined, and 
increased focus on non-communicable diseases from a human rights perspective. WHO 
provided technical inputs and guidance on a number of issues, including social pensions 
and older persons, the High Commissioner&#8217;s report on maternal mortality and morbidity, 
the report to the Human Rights Council by the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone 
to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which 
examines the criminalization of same-sex conduct and sexual orientation, sex-work, and 
HIV transmission (A/HRC/14/20), as well as the Committee on ESCR day of general 
discussion on sexual and reproductive health. OHCHR has also provided substantive input 
to WHO&#8217;s ongoing work on a Public Health Law Manual, the WHO-led year-long 
consultations for an Interagency4 Statement on gender-biased sex selection, and several 
training courses. A number of joint publications were issued, including an information 
sheet on a human rights-based approach to health, and a document entitled, &#8220;Human Rights 
and Gender Equality in Health Sector Strategies &#8211; How to Assess Policy Coherence&#8221;, 
prepared in close collaboration with the Swedish International Development Cooperation 
Agency and intended for use primarily by national multi-disciplinary teams of health 
planners, policy makers and human rights practitioners. 
</p>
<p>38.  OHCHR continued its close partnership with the Joint United Nations Programme 
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and other partners in preparing the Report of the Secretary-
General on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of HIV and AIDS, 
pursuant to HRC resolution 12/27. The report identified protection gaps and human rights 
concerns which require programmatic responses in order to reduce HIV infection rates and 
ensure equitable access to HIV services. It also highlighted the need for community 
empowerment and meaningful participation in decision-making by people living with HIV 
and affected populations. On the capacity-development and awareness-raising fronts, a 
Handbook on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights was rolled out to some 35 national human 
rights institutions from Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Central and West Africa, 
in a series of regional workshops organized by the Danish Institute for Human Rights, with 
co-sponsorship and support of OHCHR, UNAIDS and UNDP. 
</p>
<p>39.  In September 2010, OHCHR and FAO co-organized a panel discussion on the right 
to food as a side event of the 15th session of the Human Rights Council. The discussion 
was aimed at raising awareness on the practical implication of the implementation of the 
right to food at the country level, and sharing tools made available to the relevant 
stakeholders. 
</p>

<p>together with UNDP and other United Nations agencies, will strive to fully operationalize 
this mechanism, and ensure that its priorities and work plans are implemented efficiently so 
as to produce greater results. This will include, among others, the provision of necessary 
support to Resident Coordinators and UNCTs. 
</p>
<p>41. OHCHR is participating in the Secretary-General's Global Pulse initiative which, in 
the wake of the recent food, fuel and financial crises, seeks to establish a monitoring system 
to better track the impact of compound crises on vulnerable populations. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Work with United Nations human rights bodies 
</b></p>
<p>42. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 13/17, OHCHR organized the 
2010 Social Forum on climate change and human rights from 4 to 6 October 2010, which 
gave rise to outcome recommendations on the right to life and economic, social and cultural 
rights, as well as measures and actions to address the impact of climate change on the full 
enjoyment of human rights at the local, national, regional and international levels. 
</p>
<p>43. Pursuant to HRC resolution 12/24, OHCHR convened an expert consultation in 
Geneva on 11 October 2010, which focused on access to medicines as a fundamental 
element of the right to health, emerging issues, existing obstacles to providing access to 
medicines, and ways forward. The consultation contributed to gathering expert opinions on 
these issues, and highlighted the need for increased policy coherence between human rights 
obligations and other areas of government policymaking, as well as the need to strengthen 
global partnerships for development, institutional coordination and collective action so as to 
enhance access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>44. In 2010, OHCHR continued its support to the Human Rights Council Advisory 
Committee to advance its normative work on economic, social and cultural rights. Pursuant 
to Council resolution 6/10, a preliminary draft of a United Nations Declaration on Human 
Rights Education and Training was developed for consideration by the HRC at its 16th 
session. In addition, pursuant to Council resolutions 8/13 and 12/7, the Advisory 
Committee formulated a set of principles and guidelines on the elimination of 
discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members. The HRC 
noted with appreciation the principles and guidelines (resolution 15/10), and the General 
Assembly encouraged Governments, the United Nations system, other international 
organizations and national human rights institutions to give due consideration thereto in the 
formulation and implementation of policies (resolution 65/215). 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Activities of treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>

<p>general discussion on the Right to sexual and reproductive health on 15 November 2010, 
during which views were exchanged, and insights were gathered from practitioners and 
experts on topic. Office-wide support was received for the initiative, to which experts from 
the United Nations, civil society and academia were invited as panellists, and numerous 
participants contributed to the discussions, presenting a broad range of views on the topic. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>47. As of February 2011, 98 States had ratified, and 147 States had signed the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CPRD), while its Optional Protocol 
had 90 signatories and 60 ratifications. The rapidly growing number of ratifications 
throughout 2010 triggered an expansion of the Committee, which held its second elections 
in New York in September 2010, and increased its membership from 12 to 18 persons. 
</p>
<p>48. The question of accessibility impacts many aspects of economic, social and cultural 
rights. At its fourth session, the Committee held a day of general discussion on 
Accessibility on 7 October 2010, to which States parties, intergovernmental organizations 
(IGOs), NGOs, academics and individual experts contributed written submissions and 
statements. The Committee subsequently established a Working Group which will draft a 
general comment on Accessibility in due course. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Committee against Torture 
</b></p>
<p>49. In the context of considering State party reports, the Committee against Torture 
continued to address the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in relation to the 
rights of detained persons, including women and children, as well as in relation to the rights 
of minorities, indigenous people, migrant workers, non-citizens, asylum-seekers, victims of 
trafficking, and other individuals or groups made vulnerable by discrimination or 
marginalization and who are especially at risk of torture or ill&#8211;treatment. The Committee 
reiterated that facilitating the exercise of these rights, and protection of these individuals or 
populations are part of States parties&#8217; obligations. The Committee also continued to express 
concern that economic, social or cultural factors affect the right of victims of torture and 
other forms of violence, including of women and girls, to lodge complaints and have their 
cases examined promptly, thoroughly and impartially, as well as obtain redress and fair and 
adequate compensation, including rehabilitation and social reintegration. The Committee 
recalled that States parties should also adopt positive measures to ensure the protection of 
these persons or groups. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Activities of special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>50. In her annual report to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on 
<b>adequate housing</b> focused on the impact of mega-events by considering the positive and 
negative legacy of mega sports events, such as Olympic and World Cup games, and the role 
of the sponsors in the selection processes for host countries and cities. The Special 
Rapporteur also submitted reports on missions to the Maldives and the United States, as 
well as on the follow-up to recommendations from previous missions to Brazil, Cambodia 
and Kenya. In 2010, the Special Rapporteur undertook two country visits to Croatia and 
Kazakhstan, and visited the World Bank to discuss issues related to post-conflict and post-
disaster housing reconstruction, housing policies, land titling and involuntary resettlements. 
The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report to the 65th session of the General Assembly in October 
2010 was devoted to migration and the right to adequate housing. During the reporting 
period, the Special Rapporteur also led a project on post-disaster and post-conflict </p>


<p>reconstruction, with a view to assessing housing reconstruction strategies in countries 
affected by disasters or conflicts in the last 10 to 15 years.  
</p>
<p>51. The Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to 
safe drinking <b>water and sanitation</b> presented a statement to the General Assembly in 
October 2010 on how the rights to water and sanitation can contribute to achieving the 
MDGs. The Independent Expert&#8217;s thematic report to the Human Rights Council in June 
2010 focused on the issue of non-State service provision of water and sanitation in an 
attempt to address the heated debate in water and sanitation circles concerning the 
involvement of the private sector in the provision of these basic services, and the resulting 
impact on human rights. The report offered an analysis of the reality of water and sanitation 
service provision, developing on States&#8217; obligations, as well as of the responsibilities of the 
private sector.  
</p>
<p>52. In her first report to the Human Rights Council, the Independent Expert in the field 
of <b>cultural rights</b> developed her preliminary views on the conceptual and legal framework 
of her mandate and developed her initial thoughts on the interaction of the principle of 
universality of human rights, recognition and implementation of cultural rights, and the 
need to respect cultural diversity. The Independent Expert also selected a list of priority 
themes for her work programme, including the issue of cultural rights, globalization of 
exchanges and information, and development processes, as well as participation, access and 
contribution to cultural life without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>53. The Independent Expert on the effects of<b> foreign debt</b> and other related 
international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights submitted a report to the fourteenth session 
of the Human Rights Council in April 2010 on vulture funds and human rights. Prior to the 
publication of the report, the Independent Expert issued a press statement in which he 
expressed regret that a British court had ordered Liberia to pay its debt from 1978 to a 
vulture fund. Civil society organizations in the United Kingdom referenced the statement in 
their advocacy work to urge the United Kingdom Parliament to pass the Debt Relief 
(Developing Countries) Act, which prohibits profiteering by vulture funds. The 
Independent Expert also submitted a report to the sixty-fifth session of the General 
Assembly on international trade, debt and human rights, which cautions against the current 
approach to trade and debt by the World Trade Organization and the Bretton Woods 
institutions, as it does not take into account their human rights obligations, and may 
undermine human development in development countries.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur on the right to<b> food</b> submitted a report to the sixty-fifth 
session of the General Assembly in April 2010 on access to land and the right to food, in 
which he explored the threats posed by the increasing pressures on land, with focus on 
indigenous peoples, smallholders and special groups, such as herders, pastoralists and fisher 
folk. This report, as well as his report to the thirteenth session of the Human Rights Council 
entitled, &#8220;Large-scale land acquisitions and leases: a set of minimum principles and 
measures to address the human rights challenge&#8221;, respond to emerging concern over land 
issues and provide guidance from the right to food perspective. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental <b>health</b> submitted a report to the sixty&#8211;fifth 
session of the General Assembly in April 2010 on drug control and the right to health, 
which questioned the current international drug control efforts that have focused on 
creating a drug-free world through, almost exclusively, law enforcement and criminal 
sanctions. The Special Rapporteur suggested that approaches that reduce harm associated 
with drug use and the decriminalization of certain laws would improve the health and 
welfare of people who use drugs and benefit society. He also submitted a report to the 
fourteenth session of the Human Rights Council, focusing on the right to health and </p>


<p>criminalization of same-sex conduct and sexual orientation, sex-work and HIV 
transmission. 
</p>
<p>56. The Independent Expert on the question of human rights and <b>extreme poverty</b> 
continued to examine public policies in the area of social protection. Her 2010 thematic 
report to the Human Rights Council focused on older persons, poverty and the importance 
of social protection. She drew attention to the phenomena of ageing, and the need to devise 
strategies to protect older persons from poverty. Her report to the General Assembly 
addressed the contribution of social protection to the attainment of the MDGs, and 
indicated the key features of a gender-sensitive approach to social protection. In September 
2010, the Independent Expert presented a report on guiding principles on human rights and 
extreme poverty. In 2010, the Expert conducted a mission to Zambia, and a joint mission 
with the Independent Expert on water and sanitation to Bangladesh. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur on the right to <b>education</b> devoted his annual report to the 
fourteenth session of the Human Rights Council to the question of the right to education of 
migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. The report aimed to inform and assist Governments 
and interested parties in their efforts to address these matters and develop best practices so 
as to ensure the enjoyment of the currently unfulfilled right to education of migrants, 
refugees and asylum-seekers. In his report to the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur 
addressed the issue of sexual education, including the interdependence of sexuality, health 
and education and the relationship of this right to other rights from a gender and diversity 
perspective. He also discussed the right to sexual education in the context of international 
human rights law. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur conducted a mission 
to Mexico. 
</p>
<p>58. In his last report to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on adverse 
effects of the movement and dumping of <b>toxic and dangerous products and wastes</b> on the 
enjoyment of human rights, Okechukwu Ibeanu, reviewed the scope of the mandate in 
respect of norms, standards and principles in the field of environmental law regulating 
production and management of dangerous products and wastes. In order to further expand 
and strengthen the mandate, the Special Rapporteur recommended the monitoring of the 
adverse effects of dangerous products and wastes during their whole life cycle, from 
production to disposal, and the development of a set of guidelines on a human rights-based 
approach to the sound management of dangerous products and wastes. Calin Georgescu 
was appointed Special Rapporteur at the 14th session of the HRC. 
</p>
<p>59. The Independent Expert on <b>minority issues</b> guided the work of the third Forum on 
Minority Issues which was held on 14 and 15 December 2010, pursuant to Human Rights 
Council resolution 6/15. The theme of the Forum was &#8220;Minorities and effective 
participation in economic life&#8221; which covered issues such as land, property and housing 
rights, the right to work and social security, meaningful consultation and participation of 
minorities in economic development plans and national budget allocation, the MDGs, 
national development strategies including Poverty Reduction Strategy papers (PRSPs); and 
affirmative action in the workplace. 
</p>
<p>60. In June 2010, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of <b>slavery</b>, including 
its causes and consequences organized an expert consultation on domestic servitude, which 
contributed to her 2010 thematic report to the HRC. The report outlined the various ways in 
which domestic workers are economically exploited, and provided recommendations on 
how to prevent domestic servitude through the realization of economic, social and cultural 
rights. The Special Rapporteur also provided substantive input to the ILO Draft Convention 
on Decent Work for Domestic Workers. She made a number of recommendations with 
regard to non-discrimination of domestic workers on the basis of gender, ethnicity, race, 
skin tone or caste. The Special Rapporteur also highlighted the need for domestic workers 
to be given the same rights and obligations as workers in other sectors.  </p>


<p>61. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of <b>migrants</b> devoted his annual report 
to the Human Rights Council to the question of the enjoyment of the rights to the highest 
standards of health and adequate housing by migrants. The report aimed to inform and 
assist Governments and interested parties in their efforts to effectively address these matters 
so as to ensure the enjoyment of these rights for migrants. He recalled the applicable 
international legal framework and discussed the main challenges encountered by migrants 
in the enjoyment of these rights, with particular attention to the situations of migrant 
women, girls and children. The Special Rapporteur also highlighted a number of good 
practices, and made a number of recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> The present overview indicates that the international community is increasingly 
aware of the importance of economic, social and cultural rights as demonstrated, inter 
alia, by recent resolutions on the rights to water and sanitation, and the call for 
greater inclusion of human rights in the MDGs in the outcome document of the 
General Assembly High-level Plenary Meeting on MDGs.  
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> Yet, 2010 ended tragically in North Africa particularly, where a series of self&#8211;
immolations underscored the desperation and frustration felt by many worldwide at 
the denial of their economic, social and cultural rights, and associated freedoms. 
These actions and the accompanying social protests clearly point to the indivisibility 
and interdependence of civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural 
rights. They highlight that freedom of expression, independent civil society 
organizations, the right to participate in decision-making, accountability, and the fight 
against corruption are essential for all human rights. Therefore, it is of utmost 
importance that States implement a number of actions, including the following:  
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> States should address violations of human rights, including economic, social 
and cultural rights, in particular violations linked to State obligations of immediate 
effect, including discrimination in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights, and attacks on human rights defenders.   
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> States should take immediate and concrete steps to establish legal and policy 
frameworks towards the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights, with 
clear allocation of responsibilities, time-bound benchmarks and indicators to measure 
progress, and the provision of maximum available resources to implement such laws, 
policies and strategies.   
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> States should end inequality in access to remedies, and strengthen the legal 
protection of economic, social and cultural rights by, inter alia, legally recognizing 
these rights, making economic, social and cultural rights effectively justiciable, 
building the capacity of the judiciary and other institutions, establishing various 
mechanisms to deal with grievances relating to economic, social and cultural rights, 
and swiftly ratifying the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> States should ensure consultation and participation of right-holders in 
designing, adopting, implementing, monitoring and evaluating laws and policies 
relevant to the implementation of economic, social and cultural rights, including 
through guaranteeing free participation in public debate and decision-making 
processes. 
</b></p>
