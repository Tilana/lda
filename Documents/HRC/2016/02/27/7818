<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on the 
promotion of a democratic and equitable 
international order, Alfred-Maurice de Zayas</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Independent Expert submits this progress report in accordance with Human 
Rights Council resolutions 18/6 and 21/9. It summarizes activities undertaken from August 
2012 to June 2013, and addresses the spectrum of issues inherent in the mandate. For ease 
of reference, 14 documents and declarations have been included as annexes to the report. 
The Independent Expert understands the mandate as universal, aiming at the convergence 
of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights into a coherent synthesis necessary 
for the process of achieving an international order that is more democratic and equitable. 
The vast scope of the resolutions manifest the Council&#8217;s vision and call for the formulation 
</p>
<p>of pragmatic recommendations to States, civil society, National Human Rights Institutions 
and the Council itself. A peaceful and just international order can be achieved when 
stakeholders collaborate to change paradigms and apply international law uniformly, in 
keeping with the United Nations Charter and human rights treaties

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. &#8220;The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will 
shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal 
suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.&#8221; Article 
21(3), Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>2. &#8220;All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely 
determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural 
development.&#8221; Article 1, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). 
</p>
<p>3. &#8220;Democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their 
own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all 
aspects of their lives.&#8221; Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, paragraph 8. 
</p>
<p>4. This report of the Independent Expert is submitted to the Human Rights Council 
pursuant to Council resolutions 18/6 and 21/9, covering multiple aspects of the mandate, 
with emphasis on the fostering of full, equitable and effective participation. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p>5. In the period from 1 August 2012 to 14 June 2013, the Independent Expert deployed 
manifold activities directly associated with the different aspects of the mandate. He 
forwarded two questionnaires to States, intergovernmental organizations, national human 
rights institutions and non-governmental organizations. He expresses thanks for all 
responses received.  
</p>
<p>6. On 16 May 2013, he convened an expert consultation in Geneva with the aim of 
gathering inputs for this report. On 6 June 2013, he convened a consultation on global 
enforcement mechanisms as a means to achieve an international order, which will be 
subject of his report to the General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>7. He was invited to and participated in numerous events pertinent to the mandate 
during the twenty-first, twenty-second and twenty-third sessions of the Council. While in 
New York to present his first report to the General Assembly in October 2012, he had the 
opportunity to meet with numerous Permanent Missions, United Nations Special 
Procedures mandate holders and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>8. He further took part in other events related to his mandate: 
</p>
<p>(a) From 1&#8211;3 October 2012, he delivered a paper on democratic governance at 
the Council&#8217;s Social Forum on people-centered development and globalization.1 
</p>
<p>(b) From 4&#8211;5 December 2012, he participated in the first annual Forum on 
Business and Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>(c) As a follow-up to a closed expert meeting on the Advisory Committee 
Declaration on the right to peace held 26&#8211;27 November 2012 in Caux-Sur-Montreux, 
Switzerland, which he attended, he took part in the first session of the Open-ended 
Intergovernmental Working Group on a Draft United Nations Declaration on the Right to 
Peace in February 2013.

<p>(d) On 5 April 2013, he contributed a paper to the Workshop on the impact of 
unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights.2 
</p>
<p>9. Furthermore, he participated, <i>inter alia</i>, in: 
(a) A conference hosted by Earth Focus in Geneva, on 10 December 2012, on the 
</p>
<p>occasion of 2012 Human Rights Day. 
</p>
<p>(b) A panel discussion commemorating the 10th anniversary of the International 
Day of Zero Tolerance to Female Genital Mutilation, organized by several missions and 
UNICEF on 6 February 2013.  
</p>
<p>(c) A meeting analysing the Declaration on the right to peace, organized by the 
CSO Coalition on the Human Right to Peace, on 11 March 2013. 
</p>
<p>(d) A lecture on the scope of his mandate at the University of Middlesex 7&#8211;8 
March 2013; and two lectures at the University of Nottingham, on 8 and 9 March 2013.  
</p>
<p>(e) A seminar, entitled &#8220;A Democratic New International Economic Order&#8221;, 
organized by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, in Paris, 23&#8211;24 May 
</p><p>2013. 
</p>
<p>10. In light of Council resolution 21/9, the Independent Expert interacted with academia, 
think tanks and research institutes, including the South Center, the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union, the Committee for a Democratic United Nations, the Kofi Annan Foundation, the 
International Commission of Jurists, and CETIM. On 11 October 2012 he held a working 
session with the Executive Director of South Center and also met with the Secretary 
General of the Geneva-based Inter-Parliamentary Union. On 25 February he met with 
professors of the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights 
concerning the Swiss Initiative to Commemorate the 60th Anniversary anniversary of the 
Universal of Human Rights, and on 6 March with representatives of the International 
Commission of Jurists on the World Court on Human Rights.3  
</p>
<p>11. In December 2012 he published, together with Ms. Aurea Roldan, an analysis of the 
Human Rights Committee&#8217;s General Comment 34 on &#8220;Freedom of Opinion and Freedom of 
Expression&#8221; in the <i>Netherlands International Law Review</i> (vol. LIX, pp. 425-455), and the 
role of access to information and freedom of the media in ensuring a democratic 
international order. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Democratic and equitable deficits 
</b></p>
<p>12. A democratic and equitable international order is inherent in the fundamental human 
rights that humanity shares.4 It is achievable, step-by-step, when every country and people 
act at the local, regional and international levels, aware that such an international order 
must be based on the United Nations Charter and the human rights treaties, which together 
make up what we can safely call the Constitution of the modern world, subject, of course,

Institution&#8217;s Managing Global Order project, 29&#8211;30 November 2012. </p>


<p>to necessary reforms. The Preamble and articles 1 and 2 of the Charter lay down the 
intention of the &#8220;peoples of the United Nations&#8221; to build an international order of peace, 
</p>
<p>human rights and development. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to an international democratic and equitable order, it is obvious that 
such international order depends on the sovereign equality of States, the right of peoples to 
self-determination and on a commitment to sharing the riches of the planet in a spirit of 
international solidarity.5 While self-determination is closely related to the idea of 
democracy, participation in international decision-making is still far from equal or even 
equitable. Indeed, the United Nations Security Council is not democratic, nor are the 
Bretton Woods institutions. There are other players which are not democratic in their 
structure or in their <i>modus operandi, </i>including certain elitist organizations such as the 
Trilateral Commission, the Atlantic Council and the Bilderberg Group, as well as better-
known conferences of the G-8, G-20, the World Economic Forum, and military alliances 
such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Meanwhile, transnational 
corporations exert increasing influence on global decision-making and impact on the 
options of sovereign States and on the enjoyment of human rights.6 Corporations &#8211; whether 
national or multinational &#8211; do not operate on the basis of democratic principles but seek 
primarily profit, and their decisions affect the international order. Reforms are necessary so 
as to ensure the equitable participation of States, large and small, in global decision-
making, especially concerning decisions on peacekeeping, the environment, trade relations 
and the common heritage of humankind.  
</p>
<p>14. In a democracy, it is the people who are sovereign. Therefore, with regard to the 
promotion of democracy at the local, country and regional levels, civil society must have a 
stronger voice in all political processes. The situation in some countries is grave, since 
freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, and free and fair elections, are 
not ensured; opposition leaders are arrested or killed; journalists, whistleblowers and 
bloggers are harassed, intimidated and detained; public demonstrations are prohibited; 
peaceful demonstrators massacred, elections are reduced to masquerades, etc. Several 
Rapporteurs have documented these violations,7 the Human Rights Council has adopted 
pertinent resolutions, and the Human Rights Committee has adopted important 
jurisprudence thereon.8 The Independent Expert is highly concerned about such situations 
where the rule of law and the respect for key principles such as free, fair and competitive 
elections are blatantly violated. 
</p>
<p>15. It is crucial that electoral systems be free and fair, ensure the free formation and 
operation of political parties, in accordance with best practices related to freedom of 
association,9 and respect the principle of non-discrimination so that all groups, including 
opposition groups or groups promoting dissenting views, can take part in the electoral 
process. These rules should apply not only for general or important elections, but also in

<p>local consultations. Participation is more than casting votes: it implies the ability for 
individuals and people to freely express their views, and for this voice to be heard &#8220;to shape 
</p>
<p>the decisions that affect their community&#8221;.10 
</p>
<p>16. But even in ostensibly democratic States, there is no reason for complacency. 
Although formally free elections are held, the electoral process in many countries is 
dysfunctional and election results do not always correspond to the wishes of the electorate. 
In order to satisfy democratic requirements, there must be consultation of the public and the 
choice of candidates must be free and transparent. Methods to determine the will of the 
people, for instance, through frequent opinion polling and through referenda, should be put 
in place. As many observers note, representative democracy frequently manifests a 
disconnect between parliamentarians and the people, so that parliamentarians have agendas 
that do not correspond with the wishes of the electorate. This has led in many countries to 
apathy, cynicism and large-scale absenteeism in elections. What is needed is not only 
parliaments, but parliamentarians who genuinely represent the wishes of the electorate. In 
almost all countries, women are underrepresented and in many countries women are 
essentially disenfranchised.11 Such disenfranchisement is undemocratic and demands 
corrective measures. Women must be empowered so that they can meaningfully participate 
in decision-making.12 
</p>
<p>17. This second report to the Council, which covers multiple aspects of Council 
resolutions 18/6 and 21/9, focuses primarily on the issue of participation. It is not a 
compilation of facts and figures, but an attempt at defining concepts and identifying 
obstacles. The concept of democracy &#8211; whether we mean international democracy or 
domestic democracy &#8211; can be defined. Yet, international organizations that call themselves 
democratic are not, and some countries that invoke democracy reveal themselves as 
autocratic or oligarchic in practice. &#8220;Representative democracy&#8221; betrays the electorate when 
laws have no roots in the people but in oligarchies. Studies on the concept and modalities of 
direct democracy are therefore becoming more topical.13 
</p>
<p>18. Democracy entails a correlation between the public interest as expressed by a 
majority of the population and the governmental policies that affect them. The term 
encompasses various manifestations, including direct, participatory and representative 
democracy, but Governments must be responsive to people and not to special interests such 
as the military-industrial complex, financial bankers and transnational corporations. 
Democracy is inclusive and does not privilege an anthropological aristocracy. It requires 
that the basic rules establishing and organizing the State and its relationship with society be 
put in place and accepted by the citizens. It requires consultation with the people and

<p>respect of the will of the voters. Although founded on majority rule, a democratic society 
must recognize and apply individual, minority and group rights. In other words, majority 
rule must be understood within the context of the rule of law and human dignity. As 
highlighted by the European Court of Human Rights, &#8220;Pluralism, tolerance and 
</p>
<p>broadmindedness are hallmarks of a &#8216;democratic society&#8217;. Although individual interests 
</p>
<p>must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean 
that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures 
the fair and proper treatment of people from minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant 
position.&#8221;14 This resolves the tension between populism and human rights, since democracy 
must not be abused to diminish human rights, e.g. by legitimizing torture or capital 
punishment, even if public opinion could be invoked or manipulated to demand it. Thus, it 
is necessary to strengthen the enforcement of national and regional bills of rights to provide 
a process and atmosphere for democracy to flourish, ensured by an independent judiciary 
that provides the necessary protection of both majority and minority interests. 
</p>
<p>19. Democracy has an old evolutionary history and has been adjusted to the needs of 
many different societies and cultures. There is no single &#8220;model&#8221; of democracy,15 and no 
one should pretend that &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; and that one particular manifestation of 
</p>
<p>democracy should be exported to countries that function differently, where the political 
process corresponds to other traditions. When approaching the concept of democracy, one 
should look beyond the label and ask the crucial question: What is the correlation between 
the needs and the will of the people and the political decision-making affecting them? A 
corollary to that question is: To what degree was truthful, reliable and pluralistic 
information available to facilitate genuine participation by the people in the development of 
law and practice? Democracy is not the end product, but the means to the end, which is the 
enjoyment of human rights by all. 
</p>
<p>20. In order to test the existence or otherwise of international democracy in recent times, 
one may ask whether States and peoples, including non-represented peoples, have had a 
democratic opportunity of participating in decisions concerning important issues, such as 
war and peace, global warming, the environment, trade relations, access to medicine and 
the common heritage of humankind. More concretely, would a majority of States approve 
the application of sanctions regimes selectively and not uniformly? Would they have 
approved the use of force against Serbia in 1999, against Iraq in 2003 and against Libya in 
2011? Should the international community have had a voice in determining whether all 
avenues of peaceful negotiation had been exhausted? Should civil society be allowed a 
degree of participation on &#8220;technical&#8221; decisions on free trade and other agreements that 
</p>
<p>result in widespread unemployment? And with regard to regional arrangements and 
regional constitutional law, should the citizens of the countries concerned be allowed to 
vote directly in favour or against treaties entailing a significant restriction of national 
sovereignty, e.g. should the citizens of the European Union have had an opportunity to vote 
by referendum on the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon? Should they have had a say in 
decisions to impose or lift embargoes in situations of civil war? With regard to the 
reunification of the island of Cyprus, would a constitutional convention in which all 
Cypriot communities would have had an opportunity to negotiate a grass-roots constitution 
have resulted in a democratic instrument that could have bridged the impasse by involving 
all stakeholders?16 This non-exhaustive list of international disorder illustrates that

</i> </p>


<p>consultation has been flawed or entirely missing, precisely in cases where public 
participation would have been most necessary. 
</p>
<p>21. In order to test the existence or otherwise of domestic democracy in recent times, it 
may be instructive to explore how decisions such as those on the increasing electronic and 
video surveillance of individuals, arrest, indefinite detention, social security, health care, 
employment, marriage, abortion, etc. have been taken and are being taken, and the degree 
of genuine public participation in these decisions. More concretely, would a majority of the 
population accept the grave restrictions of human rights following the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001? Would it accept the priorities imposed by Governments with regard to 
so-called &#8220;austerity measures&#8221;? Would it approve the bailout of the banks? Would it 
approve increasing militarization and the enormous slice of the budget allocated to the 
&#8220;defence&#8221; industry? Would it consent to the participation of their respective countries in 
military adventures not supported by resolutions of the Security Council and not allowed 
under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter? Would it consent to the sale of weapons to 
belligerents in foreign civil wars? Would it consent to the use of drones regardless of 
civilian casualties and collateral damage? Would the citizens of the 54 nations that 
cooperated with the system of rendition, secret prisons, &#8220;black holes&#8221;, etc. have approved 
illegal acts committed in the name of the &#8220;war against terrorism&#8221;?17 Would they consent to 
the use of military commissions to try civilians? What has been the role of some media in 
creating an atmosphere of imminent threat and fear through disinformation and skewed 
reporting, in contravention of the prohibition of war propaganda stipulated in article 20 
ICCPR? Would a public referendum approve adoption of infants by same-sex couples? 
What does it mean when mass protests demanding democratic reforms and human rights 
are met with excessive use of force by police? Can laws be adopted top-down without 
public debate and in spite of widespread protest by the population? Are populations hostage 
of parliamentarians and incapable of influencing policy until the next elections, which may 
or may not allow a choice of policies but only of candidates whose decisions are sometimes 
a surprise to the electorate? Many of these issues demand public debate and consultation 
and should not be short-circuited and decided over the heads of the people. 
</p>
<p>22. Undoubtedly, there is room for improvement in each and every country. No country 
has a perfect report card. While some countries have strong points in specific areas, they 
may have serious lacunae in other areas. For instance, some countries have made enormous 
progress on civil and political rights, but lag in the implementation of economic, social and 
cultural rights. In some States and territories there are minorities, indigenous populations, 
people under occupation, unrepresented people and persons living in extreme poverty,18 
who lack the possibility to effectively participate in decision&#8211;making19. Effective measures, 
including a judicial system of enforceable rights, should be adopted to empower women, 
minorities, indigenous populations, unrepresented peoples, persons with disabilities, etc., so 
that they can meaningfully participate in the political process and in the decisions affecting 
them, their right to self-determination, their traditional environment, their culture and 
beliefs.

<p>23. Each country has the responsibility to make improvements to its economic, judicial, 
political and social systems. Civil society should be given every opportunity to contribute 
to this process. If every country takes a step forward, all populations will benefit and 
international solidarity will be served.  
</p>
<p>24. Many observers have exposed the democracy deficits of the international and 
domestic order; identified threats to international peace; warned against the military-
industrial complex; and denounced the retrogression in social justice and the crisis of 
democracy, which some see in the absence of public participation, and the imposition of a 
kind of lobby-democracy, post-democracy or pseudo-democracy, democratic only in name, 
because real decisions are taken by corporations and financial institutions that are not 
elected and not accountable to the people. Among them: Samir Amin,20 Francis Boyle,21

<p>Zamora,50 Jean Ziegler51 and Howard Zinn.52 The diagnosis is clear, but changing the <i>status 
quo</i> has proven difficult, because often those who are elected do not govern, and those who 
do govern are not elected. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>25. Numerous answers to the questionnaires, presentations at the consultations of 16 
May and 6 June 2013, as well as communications received by the Independent Expert 
reveal dysfunctions in the democratic and equitable participation of stakeholders both at the 
international and the national levels.  
</p>
<p>26. Obstacles to genuine participation in decision&#8211;making in the international arena are 
many. A democratic and equitable international order entails a commitment to dialogue 
without preconditions in which all States and peoples have an opportunity to participate in 
global decision-making. War constitutes a breakdown of the friendly relations among States 
stipulated in General Assembly Resolution 2625, and a violation of Articles 2(3) and 2(4) 
of the United Nations Charter. The war industries in many countries and the enormous trade 
in weapons of all kinds generate corruption and fuel conflict throughout the world, since 
there is profit to be made. The existence of an immensely powerful military-industrial 
complex constitutes a danger to democracy, both internationally and domestically, because 
it follows its own logic and operates independently of popular participation. United States 
President Dwight Eisenhower signaled this danger on 17 January 1961.53 The huge 
proportion of budgets devoted to the activities of the armaments and other war industries 
leaves little space for the promotion of human rights. Moreover, in a time of weapons of 
mass destruction, there is no alternative to peaceful coexistence. Unilateralism is by its very 
nature incompatible with an international democratic order. In spite of the will of the 
international community and in violation of nearly unanimous General Assembly 
resolutions, some States continue to rely on unilateralism with total impunity.  
</p>
<p>27. The reality of economic, political and military imbalance leads to pressures on the 
weak that have little choice but to bend to various forms of coercion, threats, sanctions or 
carrot-and-stick practices. This asymmetry has led to the organization of the Non-Aligned 
movement, and numerous regional organizations (ALBA, CELAC, MERCOSUR, OIC), 
whose members do not always apply democratic rules, that attempt to balance out the 
overwhelming economic and political power of a few nations.  
</p>
<p>28. During the expert consultation convened by the Independent Expert in Geneva on 16 
May 2013, participants expressed the hope for reform in the way decisions on global issues 
are taken, including decisions on war and peace, trade imbalances, commodity prices, 
financial markets, the environment and international peacekeeping. In the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, voting systems are not equitable insofar as the 
majority of the votes are given to developed country governments, which results in 
favouring the financial interests of elites at the expense of the disadvantaged. The reform of

<p>these institutions54, the Security Council55, and the World Trade Organization is necessary. 
Maybe alternative institutions should be devised.56  
</p>
<p>29. In the domestic arena, there are as many obstacles. Communications received from 
civil society organizations claim that, for a variety of reasons, which vary from country to 
country, some people cannot participate in decision-making. As highlighted by the Working 
Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice, structural and 
social discrimination against women prevent them from taking part in political and public 
life in all almost all countries in the world.57 It is unacceptable that a number of women 
who have taken part in peaceful protests in some parts of the world have met with violence, 
including sexual violence. States must demonstrate determination in putting an end to 
structural violence, and implementing positive measures to ensure the participation of more 
than half of the Earth&#8217;s population in public and political life. 
</p>
<p>30. Indigenous groups58 maintain that they have been denied effective representation 
and that their participation is essentially pro forma, since, regardless of their views, 
governments pursue their own agendas and only perfunctorily listen to them. In particular, 
some indigenous claim material breaches of treaties59 made by their ancestors with the 
European powers, others claim deception when the treaties were made. They maintain their 
right to self-determination, autonomy and identity, including sovereignty over their natural 
resources, which have been taken from them without their consent and without appropriate 
compensation, in contravention of common article 1 of the ICCPR and ICESCR. A 
fundamental issue to many indigenous is that of their status as peoples, since they do <i>not</i> 
want to have the citizenship of the country which colonized them; in some cases, they 
challenge self-determination referenda in which they claim they had little or no possibility 
to manifest their will.60 They maintain that the right of self-determination cannot be 
exercised against the will of the population concerned, and that self-determination 
referenda should only allow the indigenous to vote and not the colonizers.  
</p>
<p>31. Many other groups at risk &#8211; including human rights defenders, students, minorities 
and people living in poverty &#8211; suffer from a lack of genuine participation in society and in 
decision-making. It is crucial that States take appropriate measures to ensure that obstacles

<p>do not &#8220;exacerbate their exclusion and often perpetuate the privilege of elites who are able 
</p>
<p>to influence policy directly&#8221;.61  
</p>
<p>32. The concerns of mass protesters demanding democratic reforms as well as of the 
<i>Indignados </i>and Occupy movements deserve greater democratic attention and corrective 
action. Democratic participation cannot mean only elections; it implies direct influence in 
the democratic process, however that is achieved. Dictatorial regimes that conduct no 
elections, semi-democratic regimes with rigged elections and dysfunctional democracies 
with pro forma elections hinder the international democratic order. Electoral systems 
should be gradually improved and electoral monitoring worldwide should be welcomed by 
Governments62. But genuine participation starts at the grassroots and must include a reliable 
system of selecting candidates who are truly representative of the voters. When the 
candidates are selected by party machines and the only persons who are ever selected are 
the elites, then the system is dysfunctional, producing candidates who are not committed to 
their constituents but to party discipline and to those who finance the party.  
</p>
<p>33. By definition, democracy is oriented toward the public interest, not toward 
shareholder profit or the market. Aspects of unregulated capitalism and privatization are 
simply incompatible with the idea of democracy &#8211; because they are demonstrably not what 
the <i>demos</i> wills or even needs, but what a handful of investors want in order to maximize 
profits with the excuse that the &#8220;trickle down&#8221; effect will ultimately help the poor. But do 
the people agree to the trickle down philosophy, which mostly does not work? How can the 
financial institutions be held to account when unregulated markets fail and general 
unemployment ensues? Yet, Governments have &#8220;rescued&#8221; the banking industry, bailed out 
at the expense of the &#8220;trickle down&#8221; poor, who are defenceless against the generalized 
abuse of power.  
</p>
<p>34. Privatization of public functions constitutes an attack on democracy, because the 
public interest can only be protected by a public entity, whether a municipal administration 
or parliament, and not by a board of directors of a corporation oriented toward profit and 
expanding markets.  
</p>
<p>35. My initial report to the Council identified a number of obstacles, including those of 
a semantic nature. Undoubtedly, language itself interferes with the proper analysis of social 
and economic issues, when the terminology used is vague or misleading, or when different 
countries and media use the words &#8220;democracy&#8221;, &#8220;freedom&#8221;, &#8220;rule of law&#8221;, &#8220;international 
</p>
<p>community&#8221;, &#8220;consensus&#8221;, &#8220;globalization&#8221;, &#8220;peace&#8221;, &#8220;terrorism&#8221;, etc. with different 
</p>
<p>meanings. There are also generic obstacles such as hubris, self-righteousness, moral 
cynicism, moral nihilism, and those artificial, self-imposed thinking barriers such as the 
idea that only positivistic law is law, only positivistic rights are rights. Another obstacle is 
the lack of solidarity among civil society representatives, who should demonstrate a 
commitment to the equality in human dignity of all victims and reject media focus on 
&#8220;politically correct&#8221; victims and systematic blackout of others. Competition among victims 
is a sad phenomenon manifesting double standards. Civil society has not only rights but 
also duties, which it must exercise ethically and responsibly. States, National Human Rights 
Institutions, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations must 
demonstrate the same commitment to the brotherhood of humankind and the universality of 
human rights &#8211; not just to rights <i>&#224; la mode</i>. 
</p>
<p>36. One premise of this report is that democracy requires a free press that informs the 
public, enabling it to exercise conscientious judgment, free of government censorship and 
</p>
<p>  
 61  A/HRC/23/36, para. 14.

</i></p>
<p><i>Improving the Integrity of Elections Worldwide</i>.  </p>


<p>corporate&#8211;media manipulation. There is a legitimate democratic expectation that the media 
will have not only diversity of ideas but also diversity of ownership. Domestically, each 
government should take a close look at its telecommunications legislation, at the 
concentration of ownership in the media, and utilize anti-trust legislation to break up 
conglomerates that hinder open debate and diversity. What passes for journalism in many 
countries actually leaves the population indoctrinated, not informed. Too often journalism 
reflects a structural bias for the elites, the government and corporate interests.  
</p>
<p>37. Whereas freedoms of opinion, the media, peaceful assembly and association are 
absolutely essential to every democracy, these rights are lacking in some countries and 
hollowed out elsewhere. State censorship constitutes an obvious violation of article 19 of 
ICCPR, but censorship is also practiced by the private sector, engendering the same 
undemocratic result: a manipulated public. State interference with the media and Internet is 
a worldwide problem. On 17 July 2011, the Human Rights Committee adopted General 
Comment 34, in which it addressed the threats to freedom of opinion and expression, 
including defamation laws, blasphemy laws, and memory laws, which interfere with the 
free flow of ideas and necessary debate thereon: 
</p>
<p>(a) &#8220;Defamation laws must be crafted with care to ensure that they &#8230;do not 
serve, in practice, to stifle freedom of expression. All such laws, in particular penal 
defamation laws, should include such defences as the defence of truth &#8230;&#8221; (paragraph 47); 
</p>
<p>(b) &#8220;Prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief 
system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant&#8230;&#8221; (paragraph 48). 
</p>
<p>(c) &#8220;Laws that penalize the expression of opinions about historical facts are 
incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant imposes on States parties in relation to 
the respect for freedom of opinion and expression. The Covenant does not permit general 
prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past 
events&#8230;&#8221; (paragraph 49). 
</p>
<p>38. Such laws have totalitarian implications and consequences, violate human dignity, 
the right to open debate, academic freedom, and ultimately lead to intellectual stagnation 
and self-censorship63, which have adverse consequences on the ability of people to 
participate in decision&#8211;making. 
</p>
<p>39. Access to truthful and reliable information from diverse sources is indispensable to a 
responsible citizenry and to the exercise of the vote. Freedoms of expression and peaceful 
assembly are not only rights but also civic duties that should be exercised freely and openly 
in every democracy. Freedom of expression is not just the right to echo politically correct 
ideas, but the right to express one&#8217;s personal convictions, which necessarily includes the 
right to be wrong. In some countries, the right to demonstrate is significantly curtailed and 
plagued by red tape; in others, demonstrators are arrested or even killed. 
</p>
<p>40. Increasingly, it seems that some media carry primarily the views of the elites. Even 
on controversial issues, there is lack of balance and little competitive opportunity for views 
other than those of the advertisers. Relentless advertising and hyper-commercialization of 
the media also have the effect of misleading the public, distracting their attention from real 
issues and making the audience addicted to sensationalist, trivial or trash news. A corporate 
media that only seeks profit and neglects public interest fails the test of a democratic media.

<p>Quite generally, it must be recognized that the profit system all too frequently trumps civil 
society. 
</p>
<p>41. A democratic and equitable international order cannot be achieved as long as civil 
society lacks mechanisms to ensure change, e.g. by democratically enforcing a shift in 
priorities away from military expenditures and toward general disarmament, away from 
surveillance of citizens and toward the prosecution of corruption and criminality, away 
from &#8220;austerity measures&#8221; and toward social justice.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Independent Expert welcomes a number of legislative measures adopted by 
numerous States aimed at enhancing participation, and encourages States to put these into 
practice. 
</p>
<p>43. Among good practices, the Independent Expert hails the ratification by States of the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
and its entry into force on 5 May 2013, as well as the ratification of the African Charter on 
Democracy, Elections and Governance,64 which entered into force on 15 February 2012. He 
encourages further ratifications. He recalls the entry into force on 3 May 2008 of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, pursuant to which States parties 
undertake to &#8220;Ensure that persons with disabilities can effectively and fully participate in 
</p>
<p>political and public life on an equal basis with others, directly or through freely chosen 
representatives&#8230;&#8221;65 The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is already 
establishing important jurisprudence through its Concluding Observations and examination 
of individual cases through its Optional Protocol procedure.66  
</p>
<p>44. Several initiatives endeavour to advance a democratic and equitable international 
order by providing judicial and constitutional review as well as enforcement mechanisms, 
in particular the proposal of the Tunisian Government to establish an International 
Constitutional Court.67 Proposals for the establishment of a World Court of Human Rights 
have been endorsed by the Swiss Initiative to Commemorate the 60th anniversary of the 
Universal of Human Rights,68 the International Commission of Jurists and the International 
Bill of Rights Association.69 The Initiative of the United Nations University for Peace70 and 
the Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future aimed at the creation of an International 
Court for the Environment71 were discussed at Rio+20.

<p>45. Progress toward the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the 
ongoing efforts to make the post-2015 sustainable development agenda meaningful are 
commendable. The summit of the Peoples of Latin American and the Caribbean and Europe 
in January 2013 on the theme &#8220;For social justice, international solidarity and sovereignty of 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8221; rejected the commercialization of nature and life, and led to the adoption of the 
</p>
<p><i>Declaraci&#243;n de Santiago de Chile</i>. 
</p>
<p>46. He welcomes the <i>Quito Communiqu&#233;</i> of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, adopted on 
27 March 2013 by the 128th IPU Assembly, stipulating in part, &#8220;well-being policies require 
<i>all</i> citizens, and particularly vulnerable groups such as women, youth, indigenous peoples 
and the poor, to participate in decision-making. Being able to participate in the decisions 
that affect our lives and the social and environmental context around us is in itself a key 
dimension of well-being. Inversely, well-being is also necessary for citizens to participate 
effectively in the management of public affairs. Participation and its attendants of 
transparency and accountability are in turn key pillars of democracy and of the way 
democracy applies to the functioning of government at all levels - global, national and local 
- and in response to citizens&#8217; needs.&#8221;72 All parliaments worldwide should act in accordance 
with this declaration.  
</p>
<p>47. Public initiatives and referenda that lead to democratic change should be applauded, 
e.g. the Swiss referendum on executive pay of 3 March 2013, aimed at a more equitable 
domestic order. This is direct democracy in action.73 
</p>
<p>48. He welcomes the fact that civil society is becoming increasingly vocal in advancing 
initiatives. An example of a civil society initiative that has grown universal, leading to the 
adoption of the <i>Declaraci&#243;n de Santiago de Compostela</i>74 of 10 December 2010, <i>Oswiecim 
Declaration
</i></p>
<p>75 of 16 May 2013 and workshops throughout the world,76 is the Declaration on 
the Right to Peace. Worldwide participation in this movement has placed the imperative of 
peace-making on the agenda of the Human Rights Council77 and its Advisory Committee,78 
and will no doubt lead to an increased awareness of the core value of peace as a condition 
for a just and sustainable world order.  
</p>
<p>49. For many decades, the idea of a World Parliamentary Assembly79 or a United 
Nations Parliamentary Assembly has been under discussion. The idea is to address 
democracy deficits by giving expression to global public opinion and including citizens in 
global decision-making through elected officials. Such an Assembly could be set up by a 
vote of the United Nations General Assembly under Article 22 of the United Nations 
Charter, or it could be created on the basis of a new international treaty between 
governments, followed by an agreement linking it to the United Nations. Neither

<p>mechanism requires Charter reform. Former United Nations Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali has been an advocate of such an assembly. In a comment published at 
OpenDemocracy, Boutros-Ghali made the case for the establishment of a Parliamentary 
Assembly at the United Nations. In order to solve global crises more effectively, a &#8220;direct 
democratic connection between the world&#8217;s citizens and the world&#8217;s governance needs to be 
created&#8221;. He welcomed the expansion of democracy at the national level throughout the 
world, observing that emerging States are increasingly included in global intergovernmental 
deliberations. He noted, &#8220;a third dimension of democratization is almost completely 
neglected: Developing global democracy beyond States&#8221;.80 Johan Galtung, founder of the 
Peace Research Institute in Oslo, wrote &#8220;For anyone who believes in democracy &#8212; rule by 
the consent of the ruled &#8211; a world democracy is part of it. A democratic United Nations 
with an evolving world parliamentary assembly is the way to go.&#8221;81 Indeed, global 
decisions would have greater legitimacy through citizen input and involvement, if the 
General Assembly represented people as well as States.

<p><i>Parliamentary Assembly</i>, &#8220;Our increasingly interdependent world can no longer function without an 
effective UN system. But for a variety of reasons &#8211;mainly related to the obsolescent mindsets and 
dubious diplomatic practices of a world still guided mainly be <i>Realpolitik</i>&#8212;a large proportion of the 
human family has lost faith in the UN&#8230; A democratically constituted WPA will go far toward 
correcting these deficiencies and would do much to promote more legitimate, transparent, 
representative, accountable and responsive governance at the national, as well as at the international 
level. Providing the diverse strands of humankind, in whose interests the UN was founded, with a 
meaningful voice in making the decisions that will shape their destiny will do more to legitimize the 
global organization than any other reform I can think of&#8221; (p. 96). Saul Mendlovitz and Barbara

<p>52.<b> It would be good to report that States and civil society are advancing in the 
promotion of a culture of democratic thinking, democratic <i>feeling </i>and democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>acting. Unfortunately, most areas of human activity seem to be locked into their own 
</b></p>
<p><b>logic and dynamic, where democracy is conjured to legitimize the <i>status quo</i>, while 
</b></p>
<p><b>doing little to give life to the concepts of participation and consultation or to core 
</b></p>
<p><b>values of the United Nations, including transparency and accountability. Yet, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>spirit of democracy resides in the minds of women and men, and step by step each 
</b></p>
<p><b>community, State, and region can claim and reclaim it. This culture of democracy 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be home-grown and cannot be exported or imposed top-down. Crucial remains 
</b></p>
<p><b>the conviction that the government should serve the people and that its powers must 
</b></p>
<p><b>be circumscribed by a Constitution and the rule of law. </b>Juvenal&#8217;s question <b><i>quis 
</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>custodiet ipsos custodes </i>(who guards the guardians?) remains a central concern of 
</b></p>
<p><b>democracy, since the people must always watch over the constitutional behaviour of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the leaders and impeach them if they act in contravention of their duties. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitutional courts must fulfil this need and civil society should show solidarity with 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights defenders and whistleblowers who, far from being unpatriotic, perform 
</b></p>
<p><b>a democratic service to their countries and the world. 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> </b>The &#8220;vital interests&#8221; of States must be made to conform to the Purposes and 
<b>Principles of the United Nations, while respecting the sovereignty of States and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>self-determination of peoples. The problem remains that, although there is talk on 
</b></p>
<p><b>reforms, vested interests prevent their implementation; although there are <i>Indignados</i> 
</b></p>
<p><b>and occupy movements, there is no effective mechanism to translate public protest 
</b></p>
<p><b>into concrete reform. Soon everything returns to business as usual and the public 
</b></p>
<p><b>remains irrelevant. Since access to information, freedom of expression and the media 
</b></p>
<p><b>are indispensable to carry out reforms, it is crucial to ensure the democratization of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the media, so that it exercises its watchdog function. An unfree media controlled by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the State or held hostage by corporate interests undermines democracy. And whereas 
</b></p>
<p><b>media hype can negatively impact decision-making, responsible media can advance a 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights agenda through information and education. The gap between 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutionalized power and the people must be bridged. It bears repeating: 
</b></p>
<p><b>Democracy means participation. </b>&#8220;Formal democracy&#8221; <b>is no democracy.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations to States 
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> The Independent Expert recalls the language of article 28 of the Universal 
</b>Declaration of Human Rights, which stipulates &#8220;<b>Everyone is entitled to a social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can 
</b></p>
<p>be fully realized.&#8221; <b> 
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> With regard to participation at the international level: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States should cooperate to reform the Security Council, so as to expand 
</b></p>
<p><b>its membership and give all States, large and small, rich and poor, greater democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation in global decision</b>&#8211;<b>making. In the dynamic context of an ever-changing 
</b></p>
<p><b>world, regular reforms are a condition of stability. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To the extent that the Security Council is blocked by the use or 
</b></p>
<p><b>threatened use of the veto power by one of the P5 States, State members and observers 
</b></p>
<p><b>at the General Assembly should revitalize the General Assembly, so that it henceforth 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercises a greater role in international decision-making. For instance, the General 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assembly should urge States to impose economic sanctions on States that refuse to 
</b></p>
<p><b>abide by Security Council, General Assembly, and Human Rights Council resolutions. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The General Assembly should also refer legal questions to the International Court of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Justice for advisory opinions on matters relating to democracy, participation, </b></p>


<p>equitable distribution of the world&#8217;s resources, the common heritage of <b>humankind 
</b></p>
<p><b>and self-determination of peoples.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) States should ensure more democratic and equitable participation of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>States in the financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization (WTO),</b>87<b> for instance by placing 
</b></p>
<p><b>them under the authority of the United Nations and subordinating them to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Purposes and Principles of the United Nations Charter, pursuant to Articles 57 and 63 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Charter. Moreover, membership in WTO could be conditioned upon 
</b></p>
<p><b>acceptance of an international bill or rights, much as, for instance, membership in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council of Europe is conditioned on acceptance of the European Convention on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) States should apply international law uniformly and abandon over-
</b></p>
<p>reliance on &#8220;positivism&#8221; and efforts to circumvent obligations stipulated in human 
</p>
<p><b>rights treaties. </b>There are no &#8220;legal black holes&#8221; in <b>human rights, since all human 
</b></p>
<p><b>beings are entitled to all rights deriving from human dignity.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) States should ratify the core United Nations human rights treaties and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their protocols, the relevant complaints mechanisms, the Statute of the International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Criminal Court, and relevant International Labour Organization Conventions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including convention 169. States should allow full participation of individuals, civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society and national human rights institutions in the preparation of reports to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations </b>treaty bodies and to the Council&#8217;s <b>Universal Periodic Review (UPR). 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) States should practice what they preach and test their actions, in good 
</b></p>
<p><b>faith, for consistency with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations, knowing 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the end does not justify the means, and that international law is by definition 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal and must not be applied <i>&#224; la carte</i>. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Most importantly, States should rigorously observe the obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>contained in Article 2, paragraph 3, of the United Nations Charter, which enjoins all 
</b></p>
<p><b>States to settle disputes by peaceful means, and in Article 2, paragraph 4, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>prohibits the threat of or the use of force.</b>88<b> States must negotiate in good faith and 
</b></p>
<p>refrain from bullying, drawing &#8220;red lines&#8221; or formulating &#8220;ultimatums&#8221;. Stat<b>es 
</b></p>
<p><b>should recognize a right and a duty to peace and to solidarity in their Constitutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and statutes. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) States should abandon reliance on unilateral measures, particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>when such measures hinder international cooperation and give rise to unnecessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>tensions in the international community; in particular, States should refrain from 
</b></p>
<p><b>direct and indirect interference in other countries.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i)  States should impose controls on financial and commodity markets, 
</b></p>
<p>prohibit &#8220;shadow banking&#8221; and regulate speculati<b>on. An international conference to 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolve the problem of financial domination should be convened.

Cogens</i>.&#8221; </p>


<p>56.<b> Concerning participation at the domestic level: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States should strengthen the rule of law and implement the principle of 
</b></p>
<p><b>separation of powers. In particular, States should take all necessary legislative and 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrate measures to make civil society participation in decision-making more 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective, in particular by allowing more direct democracy through the instruments of 
</b></p>
<p><b>popular initiative, referenda, recall and impeachment. Moreover, not only the law but 
</b></p>
<p><b>also the actual practice must be assessed. Empowerment of the public requires 
</b></p>
<p><b>education programmes on human rights, including the right to peace. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) States should adopt the necessary legislative, administrative and judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to give effect to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and States 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties to the ICCPR should implement articles 2, 19, 21, 22 and 25 ICCPR, consistent 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the principle expressed in the Advisory Opinion of the Permanent Court of 
</b></p>
<p>International Justice, &#8220;according to which a State which has contracted valid 
</p>
<p><b>international obligations is bound to make in its legislation such modifications as may 
</b></p>
<p>be necessary to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations undertaken&#8221;<b>.</b>89<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) States are invited to go beyond the provisions of article 25 ICCPR to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure pluralism in elections and enhanced consultation with stakeholders. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular, States should implement the participation and consultation 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations in the relevant General Comments of the United Nations treaty 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Multiparty electoral systems and the establishment of political parties 
</b></p>
<p><b>representing a wide diversity of points of view should be facilitated. States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>review their legislation on the establishment and prohibition of political parties. One-
</b></p>
<p><b>party systems suffer from an obvious democratic deficit, and if only one political party 
</b></p>
<p><b>is allowed to operate, provision should be made to facilitate and encourage public 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation in the formulation of policies and the possibility or articulating a 
</b></p>
<p><b>diversity of views within the party. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) States should ensure access to public information</b>90<b> and repeal legislation 
</b></p>
<p><b>that is incompatible with articles 18 and 19 ICCPR; in particular, blasphemy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>memory laws and any laws that hinder open discussion of political and historical 
</b></p>
<p><b>events. States should refrain from misusing anti-terror legislation to intimidate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>suppress dissent and thus undermine participation in the democratic process.</b>91<b> States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should ensure freedom of expression online and refrain from censorship except for 
</b></p>
<p><b>reasons of health and morals. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) States should never impose reprisals against human rights defenders and 
</b></p>
<p><b>repeal laws that hinder the right to peaceful assembly in public and private spheres, 
</b></p>
<p><b>impose unreasonable fines or imprisonment on demonstrators, or restrict the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>association and collective bargaining.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) States should ensure accountability of all State organs, and revitalize 
</b></p>
<p><b>elected parliaments so that the executive power cannot circumvent the democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>process through directives or executive agreements not subject to advice and consent.

<p><b>(h) States should bear in mind the significant risks related to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>privatization of essential public services. Privatized services must observe human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights standards including on non-discrimination, accessibility, affordability, quality 
</b></p>
<p><b>and adequacy, bearing in mind that when non-State actors are involved in service 
</b></p>
<p><b>provision, there is a shift to an even stronger focus on the obligation of the State to 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States should ensure access to truthful and reliable information by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>population, encourage pluralism and the democratization of the media, online and 
</b></p>
<p><b>offline, if necessary through the use of anti-trust legislation to break down cartels and 
</b></p>
<p><b>media conglomerates, which undermine the diversity of opinion and debate 
</b></p>
<p><b>indispensable to the democratic process.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) States should build spaces and create conditions conducive to free debate 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the expression of diverse views on issues of public concern. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations to the Council 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> The Independent Expert makes the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Independent Expert welcomes the progress made by the Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Council in discussing the Draft Declaration on the Right to Peace elaborated 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Advisory Committee, and encourages the Council to continue its deliberations 
</b></p>
<p><b>as a constructive step toward a democratic and equitable international order. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>declaration should be referred to the General Assembly for adoption. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Independent Expert notes that the self-determination item was a 
</b></p>
<p><b>permanent item on the agenda of the Commission on Human Rights. Bearing in mind 
</b></p>
<p><b>that self-determination is a pillar of the Charter and that it has not been achieved by 
</b></p>
<p><b>many indigenous peoples, minorities, unrepresented peoples, and peoples under 
</b></p>
<p><b>occupation, the Council should resume consideration of self-determination as part of 
</b></p>
<p><b>items 3 and 4 of its agenda. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Council should consider holding a workshop on self-determination 
</b></p>
<p><b>and genuine participation. A democratic deficit is ultimately a deficit in self-
</b></p>
<p><b>determination.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The Council should consider assigning to its Advisory Committee (i) an 
</b></p>
<p><b>update of the 1999 Treaty study conducted by the Sub-Commission</b>92<b>; (ii) the 
</b></p>
<p><b>elaboration of a strategy to revitalize the 2004 Cardoso report on United Nations-Civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>Society Relations (A/58/817), with a view to enhancing the role of civil society in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>work of the Council, and granting non-governmental organizations at least as much 
</b></p>
<p><b>time and opportunity to participate in its work as in the former Commission on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights; (iii) a study on how a World Parliamentary Assembly may advance 
</b></p>
<p><b>genuine participation; (iv) a study on strengthening the enforcement of its own 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolutions, UPR recommendations, as well as decisions and views of the treaty bodies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by ensuring Special Procedures mandate holders can provide advisory 
</b></p>
<p><b>services and technical assistance to States in the drafting of enabling legislation; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) a study on the added value of establishing a World Court of Human Rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The Council should recommend to the General Assembly the adoption of 
</b></p>
<p><b>a resolution streamlining the procedure for granting consultative status to non-

<p><b>governmental organizations so as to eliminate politicization and enhance civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to the Council. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) The Council should consider recommending to the General Assembly to 
</b></p>
<p><b>bring specific legal questions concerning self-determination, war, peace, democracy, 
</b></p>
<p><b>corporate social responsibility and debt cancellation to the International Court of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Justice for advisory opinions. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Recommendations to Civil Society and National Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Institutions 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> Article 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates, </b>&#8220;<b>Everyone 
has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his 
</b></p>
<p>personality is possible.&#8221;<b> The Independent Expert is aware that in many countries 
</b></p>
<p><b>there is little space for civil society to operate and articulate legitimate demands. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nevertheless, he encourages civil society to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Take on this challenge as a civic duty and reclaim its rights, demand 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation and effective participation in decision-making, reliable opinion polling 
</b></p>
<p><b>and referenda as a right, in particular on matters of State-ordered surveillance, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>affects civil and political rights, and on matters of retrogression</b>93<b> in social services, 
</b></p>
<p>including &#8220;austerity measures&#8221;, privatization of essential public responsibilities, etc. 
</p>
<p><b>Civil society should take advantage of new digital technologies and social media to 
</b></p>
<p><b>revitalize democracy, e.g. by demanding social services, regulation of the financial 
</b></p>
<p><b>markets, denouncing war mongering and human rights violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Invoke United Nations procedures, including the new Optional Protocol 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ICESCR. They should call their representatives to account and engage domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>and international tribunals, including regional instances of examination and 
</b></p>
<p><b>settlement, and United Nations treaty bodies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Engage in peaceful resistance against structural violence imposed on 
</b></p>
<p><b>them by governments and corporations. The right to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b>and of association should be invoked in order to restore democratic participation</b>94<b>; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Insist on accountability of government officials and expose violations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights by their governments. In particular, civil society should investigate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>take action on the revelations by whistleblowers, when it becomes apparent that 
</b></p>
<p><b>democratically elected governments have acted or are acting <i>ultra vires</i> and in 
</b></p>
<p><b>contravention of international law, including United Nations human rights treaties, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the 1949 Geneva Conventions and 1977 Additional Protocols. Civil society should 
</b></p>
<p><b>reject impunity for crimes committed by their political leaders and for white-collar 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes of financiers and corporate magnates; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Make greater use of direct democracy, if available, or demand that its 
</b></p>
<p><b>representatives elaborate, discuss and adopt appropriate legislation to facilitate public 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiative, referenda, recall and impeachment. Civil society should demand frequent 
</b></p>
<p><b>opinion polling at both the international and national levels. Crucial is the right to 
</b></p>
<p>  
 93 Article 2(1) of the ICESCR establishes the principle of non-retrogression. The Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights also recognizes the &#8220;<i>obligacion de progresividad</i>&#8221; in article 26 of the 
American Convention on Human Rights

<p><b>choose policies and not just the right to vote for a particular candidate, when the 
</b></p>
<p><b>possibility of influencing the nomination of candidates is more formal than real; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Discuss the pros and cons of establishing, as a consultative body, a world 
</b></p>
<p><b>parliamentary assembly of directly elected representatives, which could operate 
</b></p>
<p><b>within or without the United Nations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Vindicate its right to access to truthful and reliable information and 
</b></p>
<p><b>insist that their governments implement articles 19 and 25 ICCPR and practice 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparency. Civil society should demand media reform, so as to ensure pluralism 
</b></p>
<p><b>and respect of the watchdog function of journalism. Disinformation and manipulation 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be exposed. In particular, grassroots participation and interaction should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilitated, including in the allocation of the airwaves, which belong to the people, not 
</b></p>
<p><b>to multinational corporations or media magnates. The linkage of news and advertising 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be revisited, since the public has a democratic right to truthful information and 
</b></p>
<p><b>a variety of interpretations. They should demand that news services be neutral, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>that news be separated from commentary. When broadcasting depends on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>advertisers, objectivity is compromised; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Denounce media dissemination of propaganda for war in contravention 
</b></p>
<p><b>of article 20 ICCPR, or in apology of war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Moreover, civil society could call for the adoption of effective anti-trust legislation or 
</b></p>

<p><b> I. Universal Declaration on Democracy, Declaration adopted without a 
</b></p>
<p><b>vote by the Inter-Parliamentary Council at its 161st session, Cairo, 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 September 1997 (excerpts)</b>1<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. Democracy is a universally recognised ideal as well as a goal, which is based on 
common values shared by peoples throughout the world community irrespective of cultural, 
political, social and economic differences. It is thus a basic right of citizenship to be 
exercised under conditions of freedom, equality, transparency and responsibility, with due 
respect for the plurality of views, and in the interest of the polity. 
</p>
<p>2. Democracy is both an ideal to be pursued and a mode of government to be applied 
according to modalities which reflect the diversity of experiences and cultural 
particularities without derogating from internationally recognised principles, norms and 
standards. It is thus a constantly perfected and always perfectible state or condition whose 
progress will depend upon a variety of political, social, economic, and cultural factors. 
</p>
<p>3. As an ideal, democracy aims essentially to preserve and promote the dignity and 
fundamental rights of the individual, to achieve social justice, foster the economic and 
social development of the community, strengthen the cohesion of society and enhance 
national tranquillity, as well as to create a climate that is favourable for international peace. 
As a form of government, democracy is the best way of achieving these objectives; it is also 
the only political system that has the capacity for self-correction. 
</p>
<p>4. The achievement of democracy presupposes a genuine partnership between men and 
women in the conduct of the affairs of society in which they work in equality and 
complementarity, drawing mutual enrichment from their differences. 
</p>
<p>5. A state of democracy ensures that the processes by which power is acceded to, 
wielded and alternates allow for free political competition and are the product of open, free 
and non-discriminatory participation by the people, exercised in accordance with the rule of 
law, in both letter and spirit. 
</p>
<p>6. Democracy is inseparable from the rights set forth in the international instruments 
recalled in the preamble. These rights must therefore be applied effectively and their proper 
exercise must be matched with individual and collective responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>16. Individual participation in democratic processes and public life at all levels must be 
regulated fairly and impartially and must avoid any discrimination, as well as the risk of 
intimidation by State and non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>17. Judicial institutions and independent, impartial and effective oversight mechanisms 
are the guarantors for the rule of law on which democracy is founded. In order for these 
institutions and mechanisms fully to ensure respect for the rules, improve the fairness of the 
processes and redress injustices, there must be access by all to administrative and judicial 
remedies on the basis of equality as well as respect for administrative and judicial decisions 
</p>
<p>

<p>both by the organs of the State and representatives of public authority and by each member 
of society. 
</p>
<p>22. The institutions and processes of democracy must accommodate the participation of 
all people in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous societies in order to safeguard 
diversity, pluralism and the right to be different in a climate of tolerance. 
</p>
<p>23. Democratic institutions and processes must also foster decentralised local and 
regional government and administration, which is a right and a necessity, and which makes 
it possible to broaden the base of public participation. 
</p>
<p>24. Democracy must also be recognised as an international principle, applicable to 
international organisations and to States in their international relations. The principle of 
international democracy does not only mean equal or fair representation of States; it also 
extends to the economic rights and duties of States. 
</p>
<p>25. The principles of democracy must be applied to the international management of 
issues of global interest and the common heritage of humankind, in particular the human 
environment. 
</p>
<p>26. To preserve international democracy, States must ensure that their conduct conforms 
to international law, refrain from the use or threat of force and from any conduct that 
endangers or violates the sovereignty and political or territorial integrity of other States, and 
take steps to resolve their differences by peaceful means. 
</p>
<p>27. A democracy should support democratic principles in international relations. In that 
respect, democracies must refrain from undemocratic conduct, express solidarity with 
democratic governments and non-State actors like non-governmental organisations which 
work for democracy and human rights, and extend solidarity to those who are victims of 
human rights violations at the hands of undemocratic r&#233;gimes. In order to strengthen 
international criminal justice, democracies must reject impunity for international crimes and 
serious violations of fundamental human rights and support the establishment of a 
permanent international criminal court. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Inter-Parliamentary Union Quito Communique, Adopted by the 128th 
</b></p>
<p><b>IPU Assembly, Quito, 27 March 2013 (excerpts)</b>2<b> 
</b></p>
<p>By definition, well-being policies require <i>all</i> citizens, and particularly vulnerable groups 
such as women, youth, indigenous peoples and the poor, to participate in decision-making. 
Being able to participate in the decisions that affect our lives and the social and 
environmental context around us is in itself a key dimension of well-being. Inversely, well-
being is also necessary for citizens to participate effectively in the management of public 
affairs. Participation and its attendants of transparency and accountability are in turn key 
pillars of democracy and of the way democracy applies to the functioning of government at 
all levels - global, national and local - and in response to citizens&#8217; needs. 
</p>
<p>Participation, transparency and accountability constitute the core of <i>democratic 
governance, </i>which is an end in itself and an enabler of sustainable development. There can 
be no true prosperity without respect for the universal values of democracy, the rule of law 
and human rights. Democratic governance should therefore be a stand-alone goal among 
the new Sustainable Development Goals, as well as a dimension of other goals that will be 
part of the future development framework. This is further supported by the results of a 
survey of hundreds of members carried out during the Assembly. 
</p>
<p>  
 2  http://www.ipu.org/conf-e/128/quito-comm.htm </p>


<p>To help steer sustainable development on a new course, a rebalancing of the role of the 
market and that of government is called for. Effective ways to help reconcile market needs 
with social imperatives include the development of private-public partnerships, community-
based enterprises and other forms of cooperative models. Government intervention to 
guarantee the rights of the very poor and to safeguard the natural resource base will also be 
needed. The interdependent challenges of sustainable development require a concerted 
approach that only governments can initiate and help implement. 
</p>
<p>To this end, it will be more important than ever for parliaments to assert their legitimate 
place in the decision-making process at the national and international levels. The institution 
of parliament is pivotal to the entire architecture of democratic governance and needs to be 
strengthened virtually everywhere in the world, with greater oversight capacities and 
legislative authority. More specifically, stronger parliaments will have to play a central role 
in the implementation of the future Sustainable Development Goals. This will include 
ensuring that development policies and plans are drawn up through participatory and 
inclusive processes, and with regular progress reports submitted to parliament for review. 
</p>
<p>This debate should continue in national parliaments as a way of engaging them in the global 
consultations foreseen in the Rio outcome document, aptly called <i>The Future We Want</i>.

<p><b> III.  Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 12 August 1992 
</b></p>
<p><b>(excerpts)</b>3<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, 
</p>
<p>Having met at Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June 1992, 
</p>
<p>Reaffirming the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, 
adopted at Stockholm on 16 June 1972, and seeking to build upon it, 
</p>
<p>With the goal of establishing a new and equitable global partnership through the creation of 
new levels of cooperation among States, key sectors of societies and people, 
</p>
<p>Working towards international agreements which respect the interests of all and protect the 
integrity of the global environmental and developmental system, 
</p>
<p>Recognizing the integral and interdependent nature of the Earth, our home, 
</p>
<p>Proclaims that: 
</p>
<p><i>  Principle 10 
</i></p>
<p>Environmental issues are best handled with participation of all concerned citizens, at the 
relevant level. At the national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to 
information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities, including 
information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities, and the opportunity 
to participate in decision-making processes. States shall facilitate and encourage public 
awareness and participation by making information widely available. Effective access to 
judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided. 
</p>
<p><i>  Principle 20 
</i></p>
<p>Women have a vital role in environmental management and development. Their full 
participation is therefore essential to achieve sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>  
 3 http://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126-1annex1.htm </p>


<p><i>  Principle 22 
</i></p>
<p>Indigenous people and their communities and other local communities have a vital role in 
environmental management and development because of their knowledge and traditional 
practices. States should recognize and duly support their identity, culture and interests and 
enable their effective participation in the achievement of sustainable development. 
</p>
<p><b> IV.  ILO Declaration on Social Justice, 10 June 2008 (excerpts)</b>4<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Scope and principles 
</i></p>
<p>The Conference recognizes and declares that: 
</p>
<p>A. In the context of accelerating change, the commitments and efforts of Members and 
the Organization to implement the ILO&#8217;s constitutional mandate, including through inter-
national labour standards, and to place full and productive employment and decent work at 
the centre of economic and social policies, should be based on the four equally important 
strategic objectives of the ILO, through which the Decent Work Agenda is expressed and 
which can be summarized as follows: 
</p>
<p>(i) promoting employment by creating a sustainable institutional and economic 
environment in which: 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  individuals can develop and update the necessary capacities and skills they 
need to enable them to be productively occupied for their personal fulfilment 
and the common well-being;  
</p>
<p>&#8226;  all enterprises, public or private, are sustainable to enable growth and the 
generation of greater employment and income opportunities and prospects for 
all; and societies can achieve their goals of economic development, good 
living standards and social progress; 
</p>
<p>(ii) developing and enhancing measures of social protection &#8211; social security and 
labour protection &#8211; which are sustainable and adapted to national circumstances, 
including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  the extension of social security to all, including measures to provide basic 
income to all in need of such protection, and adapting its scope and coverage 
to meet the new needs and uncertainties generated by the rapidity of 
technological, societal, demographic and economic changes; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; healthy and safe working conditions; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; policies in regard to wages and earnings, hours and other conditions of work, 
designed to ensure a just share of the fruits of progress to all and a minimum 
living wage to all employed and in need of such protection; 
</p>
<p>(iii) promoting social dialogue and tripartism as the most appropriate methods for: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; adapting the implementation of the strategic objectives to the needs and 
circumstances of each country;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; translating economic development into social progress, and social progress 
into economic development;  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>094042.pdf </p>


<p>&#8226; facilitating consensus building on relevant national and international policies 
that impact on employment and decent work strategies and programmes; and 
making labour law and institutions effective, including in respect of the 
recognition of the employment relationship, the promotion of good industrial 
relations and the building of effective labour inspection systems; and 
</p>
<p>(iv) respecting, promoting and realizing the fundamental principles and rights at 
work, which are of particular significance, as both rights and enabling conditions 
that are necessary for the full realization of all of the strategic objectives, noting: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; that freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to 
collective bargaining are particularly important to enable the attainment of 
the four strategic objectives; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; that the violation of fundamental principles and rights at work cannot be 
invoked or otherwise used as a legitimate comparative advantage and that 
labour standards should not be used for protectionist trade purposes.  
</p>
<p>B. The four strategic objectives are inseparable, interrelated and mutually supportive. 
The failure to promote any one of them would harm progress towards the others. To 
optimize their impact, efforts to promote them should be part of an ILO global and 
integrated strategy for decent work. Gender equality and non-discrimination must be 
considered to be cross-cutting issues in the abovementioned strategic objectives.  
</p>
<p>C. How Members achieve the strategic objectives is a question that must be determined 
by each Member subject to its existing international obligations and the fundamental 
principles and rights at work with due regard, among others, to:  
</p>
<p>(i) the national conditions and circumstances, and needs as well as priorities 
expressed by representative organizations of employers and workers; 
</p>
<p>(ii) the interdependence, solidarity and cooperation among all Members of the 
ILO that are more pertinent than ever in the context of a global economy; and 
</p>
<p>(iii) the principles and provisions of international labour standards. 
</p>
<p><i>  Method of implementation 
</i></p>
<p>The Conference further recognizes that, in a globalized economy: 
</p>
<p>A. The implementation of Part I of this Declaration requires that the ILO effectively 
assist its Members in their efforts. To that end, the Organization should review and adapt its 
institutional practices to enhance governance and capacity building in order to make the 
best use of its human and financial resources and of the unique advantage of its tripartite 
structure and standards system, with a view to: 
</p>
<p>(i) better understanding its Members&#8217; needs, with respect to each of the strategic 
objectives, as well as past ILO action to meet them in the framework of a recurring 
item on the agenda of the Conference, so as to:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; determine how the ILO can more efficiently address these needs through 
coordinated use of all its means of action;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; determine the necessary resources to address these needs and, if appropriate, 
to attract additional resources; and  
</p>
<p>&#8226; guide the Governing Body and the Office in their responsibilities;  
</p>
<p>(ii) strengthening and streamlining its technical cooperation and expert advice in 
order to: </p>


<p>&#8226; support and assist efforts by individual Members to make progress on a 
tripartite basis towards all the strategic objectives, through country 
programmes for decent work, where appropriate, and within the framework 
of the United Nations system; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; help, wherever necessary, the institutional capacity of member States, as well 
as representative organizations of employers and workers, to facilitate 
meaningful and coherent social policy and sustainable development;  
</p>
<p>(iii) promoting shared knowledge and understanding of the synergies between the 
strategic objectives through empirical analysis and tripartite discussion of concrete 
experiences, with the voluntary cooperation of countries concerned, and with a view 
to informing Members&#8217; decision-making in relation to the opportunities and 
challenges of globalization;  
</p>
<p>(iv) upon request, providing assistance to Members who wish to promote 
strategic objectives jointly within the framework of bilateral or multilateral 
agreements, subject to their compatibility with ILO obligations; and 
</p>
<p>(v) developing new partnerships with non-state entities and economic actors, 
such as multinational enterprises and trade unions operating at the global sectoral 
level in order to enhance the effectiveness of ILO operational programmes and 
activities, enlist their support in any appropriate way, and otherwise promote the 
ILO strategic objectives. This will be done in consultation with representative 
national and international organizations of workers and employers.  
</p>
<p>B. At the same time, Members have a key responsibility to contribute, through their 
social and economic policy, to the realization of a global and integrated strategy for the 
implementation of the strategic objectives, which encompass the Decent Work Agenda 
outlined in Part I of this Declaration. Implementation of the Decent Work Agenda at 
national level will depend on national needs and priorities and it will be for member States, 
in consultation with the representative organizations of workers and employers, to 
determine how to discharge that responsibility. To that end, they may consider, among 
other steps: 
</p>
<p>(i) the adoption of a national or regional strategy for decent work, or both, 
targeting a set of priorities for the integrated pursuit of the strategic objectives;  
</p>
<p>(ii) the establishment of appropriate indicators or statistics, if necessary with the 
assistance of the ILO, to monitor and evaluate the progress made;  
</p>
<p>(iii) the review of their situation as regards the ratification or implementation of 
ILO instruments with a view to achieving a progressively increasing coverage of 
each of the strategic objectives, with special emphasis on the instruments classified 
as core labour standards as well as those regarded as most significant from the 
viewpoint of governance covering tripartism, employment policy and labour 
inspection;  
</p>
<p>(iv) the taking of appropriate steps for an adequate coordination between 
positions taken on behalf of the member State concerned in relevant international 
forums and any steps they may take under the present Declaration;  
</p>
<p>(v) the promotion of sustainable enterprises;  
</p>
<p>(vi) where appropriate, sharing national and regional good practice gained from 
the successful implementation of national or regional initiatives with a decent work 
element; and </p>


<p>(vii) the provision on a bilateral, regional or multilateral basis, in so far as their 
resources permit, of appropriate support to other Members&#8217; efforts to give effect to 
</p>
<p>the principles and objectives referred to in this Declaration.  
</p>
<p>C. Other international and regional organizations with mandates in closely related 
fields can have an important contribution to make to the implementation of the integrated 
approach. The ILO should invite them to promote decent work, bearing in mind that each 
agency will have full control of its mandate. As trade and financial market policy both 
affect employment, it is the ILO&#8217;s role to evaluate those employment effects to achieve its 
</p>
<p>aim of placing employment at the heart of economic policies.  
</p>
<p><i>  Final provisions 
</i></p>
<p>A. The Director-General of the International Labour Office will ensure that the present 
Declaration is communicated to all Members and, through them, to representative 
organizations of employers and workers, to international organizations with competence in 
related fields at the international and regional levels, and to such other entities as the 
Governing Body may identify. Governments, as well as employers&#8217; and workers&#8217; 
</p>
<p>organizations at the national level, shall make the Declaration known in all relevant forums 
where they may participate or be represented, or otherwise disseminate it to any other 
entities that may be concerned.  
</p>
<p>B. The Governing Body and the Director-General of the International Labour Office 
will have the responsibility for establishing appropriate modalities for the expeditious 
implementation of Part II of this Declaration.

<p><b> VI.  The Dar Es Salaam Declaration on budget transparency, accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b>and participation, 18 November 2011 (excerpts)</b>6<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The world we want.  
</p>
<p>It is often the case that citizens, and particularly those most marginalized, are excluded 
from participating in public budget decisions. It is both essential and possible to transform 
this current paradigm, by adhering to the following core principles: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Public budgets must be transparent, meaning that all information related to the way 
in which public money is raised, allocated, spent and accounted should be made 
available to the general public in an accessible, timely and comprehensible way. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Budget processes must be inclusive, ensuring open and ample opportunities for all 
citizens to fulfill their right to know about, participate in, and influence all decisions 
with regard to the collection, allocation and management of public funds. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Budgets must be raised and spent efficiently, effectively, and equitably and must 
ensure that public resources achieve the greatest impact possible, in the elimination 
of poverty and the achievement of equity.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Budget data must be accurate, relying on publicly known estimates and ensuring that 
governments spend public monies on the priorities for which they were approved, 
thereby reducing the room for leakages, corruption and inefficiencies. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Budgets have to be comprehensive, encompassing all revenues and expenditures,  
regardless of their origin -- including international aid, para-statal funds and the 
management of internal and external debt. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Budgets have to be sustainable, ensuring that public finances serve common 
objectives over the long term, for current and future generations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Budgets have to be regularly and consistently reported against by all levels of  
government.

<p> 1. Recognize, legislate, enact and operationalize the right to information 
generally and to public budget information specifically; 
</p>
<p> 2. Actively engage citizens and all other stakeholders in setting public budget 
priorities-- including para-statal and para-fiscal funds-- as early and inclusively as possible,  
</p>
<p> 3. Produce, and publicly discuss, in a timely fashion, at least eight key budget 
documents: re-budget statement, executive&#8217;s budget proposal, enacted budget, citizens 
budget, in-year report, mid-year review, end-year report, audit report;  
</p>
<p> 4. Comprehensively report on all public financial flows and institutions, 
including those that are managed outside of the formal budget process;  
</p>
<p> 5. Include all resources used for the implementation of public, fiscal and 
economic policies, regardless of their origin, in their public budget documents and 
processes;  
</p>
<p> 6. Ensure that legislatures and auditors are independent of government and have 
sufficient resources to increase their capacity and thus fulfill their oversight mandates 
effectively. 
</p>
<p> 7. Publish and disseminate budget information in easy and accessible formats 
through all possible means, including digital open data formats through the internet, public 
libraries, information centers, etc.

<p><b> VII. European Grid Declaration on Transparency and Public Participation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>5 December 2012 (excerpts)</b>7<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1.1 The Parties aim to improve the public acceptability of grid development to 
accommodate renewable energy in Europe, by increasing transparency and enabling public 
participation. Trustful cooperation is the basis to deliver solutions jointly for best practice 
in grid planning processes. 
</p>
<p>1.2 The Parties recognise the need to undertake suitable initiatives to improve public 
acceptability, and jointly to communicate the necessity of grid development in the transition 
towards renewable energy. These steps are needed so that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; renewable electricity generation is not constrained by bottlenecks in the transmission 
system; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; plans and investments to accommodate renewable energy enjoy greater 
understanding, provoke less public opposition and encounter fewer delays. 
</p>
<p>1.3 The Parties recommend adapting planning and permitting practices so that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; investments are planned, consented and undertaken in a more transparent way;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; stakeholders have access to all relevant information that they need to form and 
express their views; 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>grid.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/Files_RGI/European_Grid_Declaration_2nd_Part.pdf  </p>


<p>&#8226; there are opportunities for dialogue and participation as well as formal consultation  
processes in place for stakeholders&#8217; and the public&#8217;s knowledge and views to be 
</p>
<p>expressed, at a point in time when their input can still be taken into account; 
</p>
<p>3.1 Coherent need definition at EU and national levels 
</p>
<p>3.1.1 The Parties agree it is desirable to establish the need for new infrastructure 
development through consistent, coherent and transparent methodologies and 
participation/consultation processes, including at EU and national levels. 
</p>
<p>3.1.2 They also recognise the benefits of public participation and consultation at 
these levels, in order to build support for later, more local planning procedures.  
</p>
<p>3.6 Early and continuous involvement to allow substantial participation. 
</p>
<p>3.6.1 Ensuring that stakeholder and local knowledge are brought into the 
discussions at an early stage can lead to decisions which are supported by a broader 
community. In addition, the involvement of stakeholders, including relevant 
authorities at an early stage can reduce later disagreements and delays.  
</p>
<p>The Parties therefore agree on the desirability and need to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; engage with stakeholders and the public at an early point in the process so that 
their contributions can be taken into account and plans modified accordingly where 
appropriate, without risking another loss in time; this may require engagement 
before official procedures are initiated.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; ensure that in time of public consultation phases, sufficient information and time 
</p>
<p>are provided to enable substantial input, and that time is allocated to discuss and to 
explain resulting decisions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; support the implementation of decision-making processes that enable and promote 
the consideration of reasonable alternatives suggested by the public, where these are 
relevant to the stage of decision-making in question. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; promote opportunities to engage in ways that are convenient and effective for as 
many as possible in society; this can be achieved by developing a &#8220;concept for 
</p>
<p>public participation&#8221; for each project, with detailed stakeholder mapping and 
</p>
<p>identifying channels and formats to involve them from an early stage. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; promote the establishment, where necessary, and support the work of (i) strategic 
multistakeholder working groups to deal with questions of general relevance for grid 
development, and (ii) project-specific working groups specifically to find solutions 
on topics of local concern. 
</p>
<p>3.7 Dialogue as a means to enhance relationships and build trust 
</p>
<p>3.7.1 The Parties recognise that a culture of dialogue, debate and collaboration is 
necessary to find solutions that are widely acceptable. They therefore seek to:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; promote a culture of dialogue and debate, e.g. by including elements of direct 
dialogue and deliberation in participation concepts, and improving 
communication of the solutions found through participation and consultation 
procedures. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; professionally organise dialogue and, especially in situations of conflict or 
high potential forconflict, consider the use of independent facilitation to help 
ensure deliberations are as constructive as possible. </p>


<p><b> VIII.  Declaration of the Social Movements Assembly of the World Social 
</b></p>
<p><b>Forum, Tunisia, 29 March 2013 (excerpts)</b>8<b> 
</b></p>
<p>People all over the world are suffering the effects of the aggravation of a profound crisis of 
capitalism, in which its agents (banks, transnational corporations, media conglomerates, 
international institutions, and governments complicit with neoliberalism) aim at increasing 
their profits by applying interventionist and neocolonial policies. 
</p>
<p>War, military occupations, free-trade neoliberal treaties and &#8220;austerity measures&#8221; are 
expressed in economic packages that privatise the common good and public services, cut 
wages and rights, increase unemployment, overload women's care work and destroys 
nature. 
</p>
<p>Such policies strike the richer countries of the [global] North harder and are increasing 
migration, forced displacement, evictions, debt and social inequalities such as in Greece, 
Cyprus, Portugal, Italy, Ireland and the Spanish state. 
</p>
<p>They reinforce conservatism and the control over women&#180;s bodies and lives. In addition, 
they seek to impose&#8221;green economy&#8221; as a solution to the environmental and food crisis, 
which not only exacerbates the problem, but leads to commodification, privatisation and 
financialisation of life and nature. 
</p>
<p>We denounce the intensification of repression to people&#180;s rebellions, the assassination of 
the leadership of social movements, the criminalisation of our struggles and our proposals. 
</p>
<p>We assert that people must not continue to pay for this systemic crisis (...) This is why we, 
social movements, struggle: 
</p>
<p>Against transnational corporations and the financial system (IMF, WB and WTO), which 
are the main agents of the capitalist system, privatising life, public services and common 
goods such as water, air, land, seeds and mineral resources, promoting wars and violations 
of human rights. Transnational corporations reproduce extractionist practices endangering 
life and nature, grabbing our lands and developing genetically modified seeds and food, 
taking away the peoples&#8217; right to food and destroying biodiversity. 
</p>
<p>We fight for the cancellation of illegitimate and odious debt which today is a global 
instrument of domination, repression and economic and financial strangulation of people. 
We reject free trade agreements that are imposed by States and transnational corporations 
and we affirm that it is possible to build another kind of globalisation, made from and by 
the people, based on solidarity and on freedom of movement for all the human beings. 
</p>
<p>For climate justice and food sovereignty, because we know that global climate change is a 
product of the capitalist system of production, distribution and consumption. Transnational 
corporations, international financial institutions and governments serving them do not want 
to reduce greenhouse gases. We denounce &#8220;green economy&#8221; and refuse false solutions to 
</p>
<p>the climate crisis such as biofuels, genetically modified organisms and mechanisms of the 
carbon market like REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest 
Degradation), which ensnare impoverished peoples with false promises of progress while 
privatising and commodifying the forests and territories where these peoples have been 
living for thousands of years. 
</p>
<p>We defend the food sovereignty and support sustainable peasant agriculture which is the 
true solution to the food and climate crises and includes access to land for all who work on 
</p>
<p>  
 8 http://occupywallst.org/tag/global%20solidarity/  </p>


<p>it. Because of this, we call for a mass mobilisation to stop the landgrab and support local 
peasants struggles. 
</p>
<p>Against violence against women, often conducted in militarily occupied territories, but also 
violence affecting women who are criminalised for taking part in social struggles. We fight 
against domestic and sexual violence perpetrated on women because they are considered 
objects or goods, because the sovereignty of their bodies and minds is not acknowledged. 
We fight against the traffic of women, girls and boys. 
</p>
<p>For peace and against war, colonialism, occupations and the militarisation of our lands. We 
denounce the false discourse of human rights defence and fight against fundamentalism, 
that often justifies military occupations such as in Haiti, L&#237;bia, Mali and Syria. We defend 
the right to people&#8217;s sovereignty and self-determination such as in Palestine, Western 
Sahara and Kurdistan. We denounce the installation of foreign military bases to instigate 
conflicts, to control and ransack natural resources, and to foster dictatorships in several 
countries.

<p><b> IX.  Universal Declaration for the Common Good of Humanity (excerpts)</b>9<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Article 7 </b>(To promote dignified and non-exploitative labor) 
</p>
<p>Processes of production and circulation should ensure workers a dignified, participatory job 
that is adaptive to family and cultural life,that fosters their skills and ensures them an 
adequate material existence. All modern forms of slavery, servitude and labor exploitation, 
especially of children, for the purposes of individual profit or private accumulation of 
surplus value as well as limitations on labor organizing are inconsistent with the Common 
Good of Humanity and Good Life (Buen Vivir) and are therefore prohibited. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 8 </b>(To reconstruct territories) 
</p>
<p>Facing &#8220;globalization&#8221; which has favored a unipolar economy, the concentration of 
</p>
<p>decision-making powers, the hegemony of financial capital and the irrational circulation of 
goods and services, it is indispensible to reconstruct territories as a base for food, energetic 
sovereignty and for the main exchanges, to regionalize economies and base them on 
principles of complementarity and solidarity; and for the peripheral regions, to &#8220;disconnect&#8221; 
</p>
<p>from the hegemonic economic center, in order to assure commercial, financial and 
productive autonomy. The constitution of monopolies and oligopolies, whatever their area 
of productive or financial activity is, is inconsistent with the Common Good of Humanity 
and are therefore prohibited. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 9 </b>(To guarantee access to common goods and universal social protection) 
</p>
<p>There are certain common goods that are indispensible for the collective life of individuals 
and peoples and that constitute inalienable rights. These are: food, housing, health, 
education, and material and immaterial communication. Various forms of citizen control or 
social property exist for the effective organization of access to these goods. &#8220;Universal 
</p>
<p>protection&#8221; is a right of all peoples and individuals, a responsibility of public authorities 
that should be assured by an adequate fiscal policy. The privatization of public services in 
order to contribute to capital accumulation is inconsistent with the Common Good of 
Humanity and is therefore prohibited. The following are susceptible for sanctions:

<p>speculating on food, housing, health, education, communication as is corruption while 
exercising these rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 10 </b>(To generalize democracy and the construction of the subject) 
</p>
<p>All peoples and human beings are subjects of their histories and have the right to a 
collective social and political organization that guarantees this. This organization must 
ensure harmony with nature and access to the material needs of life trough production and 
circulation systems built on social justice principles. To achieve these goals, collective 
organization should allow everyone&#8217;s participation in the production and reproduction of 
</p>
<p>the life of the planet and human beings, i.e., of the Common Good of Humanity. The 
organizing principle of this goal is to spread democracy into all social relationships: family, 
gender, work, political authority, between peoples and nations and in all social, political, 
economic, cultural and religious institutions. Along with political forms of participatory 
democracy, participation should be organized in all sectors of common life, economic, 
social, cultural. 
</p>
<p>All non-democratic forms of organizing society&#8217;s political, economic, social and cultural 
life are inconsistent with the Common Good of Humanity and the Good Life (Buen Vivir) 
and are therefore prohibited. Genocides are condemned as irreparable acts of 
discrimination. Susceptible to sanctions are all discriminations based on gender, race, 
nation, culture, sexual orientation, physical or mental capacity, religion or ideological 
affiliation. Along with political forms of participatory democracy, participation should be 
encouraged in all sectors of common life. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 11 </b>(To build equality between men and women) 
</p>
<p>Particular importance will be given to relations between men and women, unequal since 
time immemorial in the various types of societies that have existed during human history. 
All institutions and all social and cultural systems should recognize, respect and promote 
the right to a life in plenitude for women in equality with men. Social and economic 
practices, institutions and cultural or religious systems that defend discrimination or 
actively discriminate against women are inconsistent with the Common Good of Humanity. 
All forms of masculine domination, particularly differences in wage income and the non-
recognition of family domestic work linked to the reproduction of life, are susceptible to 
sanctions. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 12 </b>(To prohibit war) 
</p>
<p>Democratic international relations do not allow the use of war to resolve conflicts. In this 
day and age, peace is not guaranteed by an arms race. The availability of nuclear, 
biological, chemical weapons directly jeopardizes the life of Humanity. Arms have become 
a business. Their production causes an enormous waste of energy, natural resources and 
human talents; their use means, aside from the loss of lifes, serious environmental 
destruction. 
</p>
<p>The manufacture, possession and use of weapons of mass destruction, the accumulation of 
conventional weapons to guarantee regional hegemony and control of natural resources, 
hegemonic regional pacts, military solutions to solve internal political problems are 
inconsistent with the Common Good of Humanity and are therefore prohibited. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 13 </b>(To build the State on the basis of Common Good) 
</p>
<p>The role of the State, as collective administrator, is to guarantee the Common Good, i.e. the 
public interest, as compared to individual or private interests. Democratic participation is 
therefore needed to define the Common Good (constitutions) and how it will be applied. All </p>


<p>peoples and communities of the earth, in the plurality of each of their members, 
organizations and social movements, have the right to political systems of direct or 
delegated participation with a revocable mandate. Regional governments and international 
organizations, particularly the United Nations, must be constructed on democratic 
principles. The same is true for all institutions that represent specific interests or business 
sectors, such as industrial companies, estates, financial or commercial organisms, political 
parties, religious institutions or trade unions, NGOs, sports or cultural groups, humanitarian 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>All dictatorial or authoritarian forms of exercising political or economic power, where no 
representative minorities, formal or informal, monopolize decisions without participation, 
initiative or popular control, are inconsistent with the Common Good of Humanity and are 
therefore prohibited. Also prohibited are public subsidies for organizations, social 
movements, political parties or religious institutions that do not respect democratic 
principles or that practice gender or racial discrimination.

<p><b> X. Paris Appeal for a New Democratic International Economic Order, 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Association of Democratic Lawyers, 25 May 2013 
</b></p>
<p><b>(excerpts)</b>10<b> 
</b></p>
<p>We, democratic lawyers, recognize the United Nations Charter along with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Conventions on Human Rights constitute the 
Constitution of the modern world. These important documents prohibit the threat of and use 
of force, recognize the sovereign equality of states and the right of self-determination, and 
guarantee that everyone has the right to a social and international order in which the rights 
and freedoms in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully realized. 
</p>
<p>The United Nations Charter in its Preamble replaced the old vertical logic of power over 
peoples by horizontally organizing power of the peoples based on the exercise of and 
respect for self-determination and their exclusive mastery over their own affairs in equality 
and universality. However, the economic management of the world has been &#8220;entrusted&#8221; by 
</p>
<p>the Bretton Woods agreements to international financial institutions, but these institutions 
are based on the old vertical logic of power over the peoples that do not comply with the 
principal of equality and universality. This has allowed the peoples of the world to be 
diverted from their mission as States with the economic power of these institutions being 
used as instruments of domination and policing in their own self-interest and the interest of 
large economies. 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; power requires not only the first generation of civil and political rights but also the 
</p>
<p>second generation of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Peoples&#8217; Power cannot be 
complete without economic power. 
</p>
<p>The conclusion from the experience of decolonization necessitated the adoption of the 
United Nations Resolution of 1971 proclaiming peoples&#8217; sovereignty over their natural 
</p>
<p>resources. However, it became clear that even with such resolutions peoples remain 
dependent because of the so-called &#8220;laws&#8221; of the market with its domination by industrial 
and financial monopolies, continue undermine the Human Rights Covenants and raise 
public debt. 
</p>
<p>We have been denouncing for decades not only the injustice and illegitimacy of the public 
debt of developing countries but also its illegality and nullity. 
</p>
<p>  
 10 http://www.iadllaw.org/  </p>


<p>Today the inequality bequeathed by colonialism and maintained by the post colonialism 
remains unbearable, the public debt is now a heavy burden on the economies of the 
majority of states and leads them to inflict austerity policies on their people to the detriment 
of the necessary satisfaction of their most basic economic, social and cultural rights as 
proclaimed by the United Nations Covenant in 1966. These policies violate the social 
development goals defined by Articles 55 <i>et seq.</i>, of the United Nations Charter and 
confirmed by U.N. General Assembly Resolution of 4 December 1986 on the Right to 
Development. 
</p>
<p>The result is a fundamental economic political and societal crisis on a scale constituting a 
crisis of civilization, posing the most serious dangers to humanity. 
</p>
<p>However, this situation is not an accident of fate. It is the result of the management of the 
world&#8217;s economy, based on the savagery of economic liberalism and the resulting 
dictatorship of financial markets. The world&#8217;s economy is governed by a system which 
</p>
<p>exploits the world&#8217;s resources, not as a function of their value to humanity but of their value 
</p>
<p>as profit for finance capital. 
</p>
<p>Even the so-called &quot;local conflicts&quot; are in fact conflicts between the powers that compete 
for resources and markets, in which the arms trade plays a particularly burdensome role. 
Massive violations of human rights that appear as purely internal are most often the work of 
dictatorships established by the neo-colonizer guaranteeing them economic mastery and 
security of access to resources and markets. 
</p>
<p>The future of Humanity is at stake as long as the political power of the peoples is not 
completed by their economic power. This completion will permit placing the organization 
of world economic management under international universal and egalitarian law of the 
United Nations Charter and replacing non-egalitarian International financial institutions by 
people&#8217;s instruments of cooperation allowing the planet&#8217;s resources to be directed to the 
</p>
<p>exclusive satisfaction of peoples&#8217; and the environments respective and common needs. 
</p>
<p>We believe that the world&#8217;s lawyers should serve the people in the front line of this 
struggle, which calls on them to use and improve their professional skills in the service of 
peoples to achieve the common goal of Peoples&#8217; Power. We have therefore decided to 
</p>
<p>establish a permanent consultative working group to define those steps which should be 
taken immediately to counter effectively the malfunctioning of the current order and 
towards establishing a new democratic international economic order. 
</p>
<p><b> XI. Appel de Blois, Libert&#233; pour l'histoire, 2008 (full text)</b>11<b>  
</b></p>
<p>Concerned about the retrospective moralization of history and intellectual censure, we call 
for the mobilization of European historians and for the wisdom of politicians. 
History must not be a slave to contemporary politics nor can it be written on the command 
of competing memories. In a free state, no political authority has the right to define 
historical truth and to restrain the freedom of the historian with the threat of penal 
sanctions. 
</p>
<p>We call on historians to marshal their forces within each of their countries and to create 
structures similar to our own, and, for the time being, to individually sign the present 
appeal, to put a stop to this movement toward laws aimed at controlling history memory. 
We ask government authorities to recognize that, while they are responsible for the 
maintenance of the collective memory, they must not establish, by law and for the past, an

<p><b> XII. Declaration on Digital Freedom, Adopted by the PEN International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Congress Gyeongju, South Korea, September 2012 (full text)</b>12<b> 
</b></p>
<p>PEN International promotes literature and freedom of expression and is governed by the 
PEN Charter and the principles it embodies unhampered transmission of thought within 
each nation and between all nations. 
</p>
<p>PEN recognizes the promise of digital media as a means of fulfilling the fundamental right 
of free expression. At the same time, poets, playwrights, essayists, novelists, writers, 
bloggers, and journalists are suffering violations of their right to freedom of expression for 
using digital media. Citizens in many countries have faced severe restrictions in their access 
to and use of digital media, while governments have exploited digital technologies to 
suppress freedom of expression and to surveil individuals. The private sector and 
technology companies in particular have at times facilitated government censorship and 
surveillance. PEN therefore declares the following: 
</p>
<p>1. All persons have the right to express themselves freely through digital media 
without fear of reprisal or persecution.  
</p>
<p>a. Individuals who use digital media enjoy full freedom of expression 
protections under international laws and standards 
</p>
<p>b. Governments must not prosecute individuals or exact reprisals upon 
individuals who convey information, opinions, or ideas through digital media. 
</p>
<p>c. Governments must actively protect freedom of expression on digital media 
by enacting and enforcing effective laws and standards.  
</p>
<p>2. All persons have the right to seek and receive information through digital media. 
</p>
<p>a. Governments should not censor, restrict, or control the content of digital 
media, including content from domestic and international sources. 
</p>
<p>b. In exceptional circumstances, any limitations on the content of digital media 
must adhere to international laws and standards that govern the limits of freedom of 
expression, such as incitement to violence. 
</p>
<p>c. Governments should not block access to or restrict the use of digital media, 
even during periods of unrest or crisis. Controlling access to digital media, 
especially on a broad scale, inherently violates the right to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>d. Governments should foster and promote full access to digital media for all 
persons. 
</p>
<p>3. All persons have the right to be free from government surveillance of digital media.  
</p>
<p>a. Surveillance, whether or not known by the specific intended target, chills 
speech by establishing the potential for persecution and the fear of reprisals. When 
known, surveillance fosters a climate of self-censorship that further harms free 
expression. 
</p>
<p>  
 12 http://www.pen-international.org/pen-declaration-on-digital-freedom/ </p>


<p>b. As a general rule, governments should not seek to access digital 
communications between or among private individuals, nor should they monitor 
individual use of digital media, track the movements of individuals through digital 
media, alter the expression of individuals, or generally surveil individuals. 
</p>
<p>c. When governments do conduct surveillance in exceptional circumstances and 
in connection with legitimate law enforcement or national security investigations&#8212;
any surveillance of individuals and monitoring of communications via digital media 
must meet international due process laws and standards that apply to lawful 
searches, such as obtaining a warrant by a court order. 
</p>
<p>d. Full freedom of expression entails a right to privacy; all existing international 
laws and standards of privacy apply to digital media, and new laws and standards 
and protections may be required. 
</p>
<p>e. Government gathering and retention of data and other information generated 
by digital media, including data mining, should meet international laws and 
standards of privacy, such as requirements that the data retention be time-limited, 
proportionate, and provide effective notice to persons affected. 
</p>
<p>4. The private sector, and technology companies, in particular, are bound by the right 
to freedom of expression and human rights.  
</p>
<p>a. The principles stated in this declaration equally apply to the private sector. 
</p>
<p>b. Companies must respect human rights, including the right to freedom of 
expression, and must uphold these rights even when national laws and regulations 
do not protect them. 
</p>
<p>c. Technology companies have a duty to determine how their products, services, 
and policies impact human rights in the countries in which they intend to operate. If 
violations are likely, or violations may be inextricably linked to the use of products 
or services, the companies should modify or withdraw their proposed plans in order 
to respect human rights. 
</p>
<p>d. Technology companies should incorporate freedom of expression principles 
into core operations, such as product designs with built-in privacy protections. 
</p>
<p>e. If their operations are found to have violated the right to freedom of 
expression, technology companies should provide restitution to those whose rights 
were violated, even when governments do not provide remedies.

<p><b> XIII. Final Report of the Sub-Commission</b>&#8217;<b>s Special Rapporteur on Treaties 
with Indigenous Peoples, Miguel Alfonso Martinez, 1999 (excerpts)</b>13<b> 
</b></p>
<p>306. Earlier in the present report (para. 261) the Special Rapporteur noted the generalized 
opinion that, in the light of the situation endured by indigenous peoples today, the existing 
mechanisms, either administrative or judicial, within non-indigenous spheres of 
government have been incapable of solving their difficult predicament. This forces him to 
advance a number of recommendations on this subject. 
</p>
<p>307. He first recommends the establishment within States with a sizeable indigenous 
population of an entirely new, special jurisdiction to deal exclusively with indigenous 
issues, independent of existing governmental (central or otherwise) structures, although 
</p>
<p>  
 13 http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/696c51cf6f20b8bc802567c4003793ec </p>


<p>financed by public funds, that will gradually replace the existing 
bureaucratic/administrative government branches now in charge of those issues. 
</p>
<p>308. This special jurisdiction, in his view, should have four distinct specialized branches 
(permanent and with adequate professional staffing): 
</p>
<p>(i) an advisory conflict-resolution body to which all disputes, including those 
relating to treaty implementation, arising between indigenous peoples and non-
indigenous individuals, entities and institutions (including government institutions) 
should be mandatorily submitted, and which should be empowered to encourage and 
conduct negotiations between the interested parties and to issue the 
recommendations considered pertinent to resolve the controversy; 
</p>
<p>(ii) a body to draft, through negotiations with the indigenous peoples concerned: 
(a) new juridical bilateral, consensual, legal instruments with the indigenous peoples 
interested and (b) new legislation and other proposals to be submitted to the proper 
legislative and administrative government branches in order gradually to create a 
new institutionalized legal order applicable to all indigenous issues and that accords 
with the needs of indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p>(iii) a judicial collegiate body, to which all cases that after a reasonable period of 
time have not been resolved through the recommendations of the advisory body, 
should be mandatorily submitted. Such a body should be empowered to adjudicate 
these cases and should be capable of making its final decisions enforceable by 
making use of the coercive power of the State; 
</p>
<p>(iv) an administrative branch in charge of all logistical aspects of indigenous/non-
indigenous relations. 
</p>
<p>309. The Special Rapporteur is fully aware of many of the obstacles that such an 
innovative, far-reaching approach might encounter. To mention only one, it is not difficult 
to appreciate the many vested interests that might be affected by the redundancy of the 
structures now existing to deal with indigenous issues in many countries. Only strong 
political determination, particularly on the part of the leadership of the non-indigenous 
sector of the society, can make this approach viable. One other essential element is also 
clear: the effective participation of indigenous peoples - preferably on a basis of equality 
with non-indigenous people - in all four of the recommended branches is absolutely central 
to the &quot;philosophy&quot; presiding over the Special Rapporteur's overall approach to this 
question. 
</p>
<p>310. It is obvious that the above is a mere sketch of the new institutionality 
recommended. Much lies ahead in terms of filling in its quite visible lacunae. While the 
Special Rapporteur does not lack ideas on how to fill some of the gaps, he has considered it 
wise to allow for the required fine-tuning to be done at a later stage, around a negotiating 
table, by the interested parties themselves in the different countries. The way in which such 
a negotiation process is organized and conducted may well be the true litmus test eventually 
of the merits of his recommendation and of the viability of the structure proposed in a given 
socio-political context. 
</p>
<p>311. In advancing the recommendations set forth above, the Special Rapporteur has 
benefited from the highly interesting ideas on the same subject formulated in the final 
report (1996) of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples established by the 
Government of Canada. (71) 
</p>
<p>312. While it is generally held that contentious issues arising from treaties or constructive 
arrangements involving indigenous peoples should be discussed in the domestic realm, the 
international dimension of the treaty nevertheless warrants proper consideration. </p>


<p>313. A crucial question relates to the desirability of an international adjudication 
mechanism to handle claims or complaints from indigenous peoples, in particular those 
arising from treaties and constructive arrangements with an international status. 
</p>
<p>314. The Special Rapporteur is quite familiar with the reticence expressed time and again, 
by States towards the question of taking these issues back to open discussion and decision-
making by international forums. In fact, he might even agree with them that for certain 
issues (for example, disputes not related to treaty implementation and observance) it would 
be more productive to keep their review and decision exclusively within domestic 
jurisdiction until this is completely exhausted. 
</p>
<p>315. However, he is of the opinion that one should not dismiss outright the notion of 
possible benefits to be reaped from the establishment of an international body (for example, 
the proposed permanent forum of indigenous peoples) that, under certain circumstances, 
might be empowered - with the previous blanket acquiescence, or acquiescence on an ad 
hoc basis, of the State concerned - to take charge of final decision in a dispute between the 
indigenous peoples living within the borders of a modern State and non-indigenous 
institutions, including State institutions. 
</p>
<p>316. At any rate, the Special Rapporteur recommends that a United Nations-sponsored 
workshop be convened, at the earliest possible date and within the framework of the 
International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, to open an educated discussion on 
the possible merits and demerits of the establishment of such an international body. 
</p>
<p>317. One last point on the subject: with the growing international concern about all 
human rights and related developments, one element appears very clear in the mind of the 
Special Rapporteur: the more effective and developed the national mechanisms for conflict 
resolution on indigenous issues are, the less need there will be for establishing an 
international body for that purpose. The opposite is also true: the non-existence, 
malfunctioning, anti-indigenous discriminatory approach or ineffectiveness of those 
national institutions will provide more valid arguments for international options. This may 
be one of the strongest arguments possible for the establishment (or strengthening) of 
proper, effective internal channels for the implementation/observance of indigenous rights 
and conflict resolution of indigenous-related issues. 
</p>
<p>318. Another recommendation which it seems timely to address to State institutions 
empowered to deal with indigenous issues is that, in the decision-making process on issues 
of interest to indigenous peoples, they should apply and construct (or continue to do so) the 
provisions of national legislation and international standards and instruments in the most 
favourable way for indigenous peoples, particularly, in cases relating to treaty rights. In all 
cases of treaty/agreement/constructive arrangement relationships, the interpretation of the 
indigenous party of the provisions of those instruments should be accorded equal value with 
non-indigenous interpretation of the same provisions. 
</p>
<p>319. The Special Rapporteur also recommends the fullest possible implementation in 
good faith of the provisions of treaties/agreements between indigenous peoples and States, 
where they exist, from the perspective of seeking both justice and reconciliation. In the 
event that the very existence (or present-day validity) of a treaty becomes a matter of 
dispute, a formal recognition of that instrument as a legal point of reference in the State's 
relations with the peoples concerned would contribute greatly to a process of confidence-
building that may bring substantial benefits. In this context, the completion of the 
ratification process of draft treaties/agreements already fully negotiated with indigenous 
people is strongly recommended by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>320. In the case of obligations established in bilateral or multilateral treaties concluded by 
States - to which indigenous peoples are third parties - that may affect those peoples, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the State parties to such instruments seek the free and </p>


<p>educated acquiescence of the indigenous parties before attempting to enforce those 
obligations.

<p><b>submitted by Mr. Danilo T&#252;rk, Special Rapporteur,

<p>177. Decades of pleas for increasing levels of participation in the development process, 
principles about which are included, for instance, in the 1986 Declaration on the Right to 
Development, have clearly yet to bear fruit. 
</p>
<p>178. According to one commentator: &quot;Though the World Bank claims that 'it seeks to 
meet the needs of the poorest people', at no stage in what it refers to as 'the project cycle', 
however, does it actually take time to ask the poor themselves how they perceive their 
needs; neither does it canvass their views on how they feel these needs might best be met. 
Indeed, from the identification of a possible Bank project right through to its ex post 
evaluation, the poor are entirely left out of the decision-making process - almost as if they 
did not exist&quot;.  
</p>
<p>179. Even the Bank itself has recognized this inadequacy, admitting in 1988 that: &quot;the 
principles guiding beneficiary participation in Bank-financed projects have been quite 
abstract and of limited operational impact. Beneficiaries were not assigned a role in the 
decision-making process, nor was their technological knowledge sought prior to designing 
project components&quot;. Though non-governmental organization participation in World Bank 
projects has increased in the past three years, by far the greatest share of this &quot;participation&quot; 
was in project implementation, with substantially smaller emphasis being placed on design, 
advice, monitoring and evaluation.  
</p>
<p>180. The declining capacities of the State and the resolute inability of the market or 
private sector, coupled with measures of adjustment, and an overall global economic 
decline have led to the evolution of new citizen movements, new coalitions and new 
political processes, all but ignored in the literature of the international financial agencies 
and by much of the United Nations system. Within these new movements is where real 
participation occurs, where much of real development takes place and where the legitimate 
needs of people are increasingly being demanded. 
</p>
<p>181. Much debate has taken place recently about the obvious relationship between 
development, democracy and human rights, implying, of course, the issue of citizen 
participation in all political processes associated with development. One United Nations 
agency has provided support in the following terms: &#8220;An essential part of any political 
process to benefit the poor is a high degree of participation. Encouraging the autonomy of 
citizens is, indeed, an end in itself. And participation is a means to ensure the efficient 
provision and more equitable distribution of goods and services. If people are involved in 
decision-making, policies and projects tend to be more realistic, more pragmatic and more 
sustainable.&#8221;
