ARTICLE II
SECURED DEBT
2.01  Debt Secured Hereby.  All Secured Debt Obligations shall be secured by and entitled to the benefits of this
Agreement and the security interests granted pursuant to this Agreement and each other Security Document.  Each
Initial Senior Lender, the Initial Senior Lender Group to which such Initial Senior Lender belongs, such Initial Senior
Lender’s Senior Loan Commitment, the Initial Senior Loan Agreements relating to each Initial Senior Lender Group and
each Initial Hedge Bank are each identified in Appendix B.
2.02  Secured Debt Pari Passu.  All Secured Debt shall rank pari passu without any preference among Secured Debt
by reason of date of incurrence, currency of payment or otherwise; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed
to permit any Hedge Bank to vote more than its Eligible Guaranteed Apex Metals Amount with respect to any vote to
be conducted pursuant to this Agreement or any other Financing Document.
2.03  Secured Debt and Disbursements.  The failure of any Senior Lender to make any Senior Loans required to be
made by it under its respective Senior Loan Agreement shall not relieve any other Senior Lender of its obligations
under such Senior Loan Agreement; provided that the Senior Loan Commitments of the Senior Lenders are several
and neither any Senior Lender nor any Agent shall be responsible for any other Senior Lender’s failure to make Senior
Loans as required under its respective Senior Loan Agreement.
2.04  Prepayment of Senior Loans.
(a)           Mandatory Prepayments.  The Borrower shall make mandatory prepayments (each, a “Mandatory
Prepayment”) of the Senior Loans in the amounts and at the times specified in Section 5.05(c)(ii), Section 5.08(c)(ii)
and (iii) and Section 9.02.
(b)           Voluntary Prepayments.
(i)            The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time, subject to prior notice and otherwise as
set forth below in this Section 2.04(b), to prepay all or part of the principal amount then outstanding of Senior Loans
(each such prepayment, a “Voluntary Prepayment”); provided that the Borrower shall not have the right to prepay any
Senior Loans held by CAF prior to January 1, 2007 .
3
(ii)           Voluntary Prepayments shall not be subject to the payment of any premia (except as otherwise specified in
the Senior Loan Agreements) or penalties; provided that the Borrower shall be required to pay any breakage costs with
respect to the early termination of Interest Periods to the extent required under and in accordance with the applicable
Senior Loan Agreement.
(iii)          The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any Voluntary
Prepayment hereunder not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, not less than ten Business Days before the
date of prepayment.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal
amount of Senior Loans to be prepaid (and, upon the date specified in any such notice of prepayment, the amount to
be prepaid together with accrued interest and other amounts payable in connection therewith shall become due and
payable hereunder).  Promptly following receipt of any such notice (and in any event by the Business Day after receipt
thereof) the Administrative Agent shall advise the Senior Lenders of the contents thereof.
(iv)          Each Voluntary Prepayment of Senior Loans shall be in a total amount of not less than the lesser of (A)
$5,000,000 and integral multiples of $2,000,000 in excess thereof and (B) the remaining principal amount then
outstanding.
(v)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the Borrower notifies the Administrative
Agent that it shall make a Voluntary Prepayment prior to January 1, 2007 and makes such a prepayment, such a
prepayment may only be applied to Senior Loans other than Senior Loans held by CAF.  Any such prepayment may
be made on a non-Pro Rata Payment basis as between CAF (on the one hand) and the other Senior Lender Groups
(on the other), and the Senior Lenders entitled to such prepayment shall not have any obligation to share the proceeds
thereof with CAF.
(c)           All Prepayments.   Each prepayment under this Section 2.04 shall be applied in inverse order of maturity to
the remaining installments of the Senior Loans and shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the date of
prepayment on the amounts prepaid and any other amounts as required by the applicable Senior Loan Agreements.
2.05  Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment.
(a)           Each payment or prepayment by the Borrower to a Senior Lender in respect of Senior Loan Obligations shall
be a Pro Rata Payment, other than (i) prepayments as set forth in clause (b) of this Section 2.05, (ii) payments or
prepayments in accordance with Section 2.07 and (iii) prepayments referred to in Section 2.04(b)(v) (but only to the
extent set out therein).
(b)           The Borrower may prepay in whole, but not in part, Senior Loan Obligations owed to any Senior Lender
without making a Pro Rata Payment to the other Senior Lenders if (i) such prepayment is made with the proceeds of
Sponsor Funding contributed no more than ten Business Days prior to such prepayment, (ii) such prepayment is made
with the proceeds of Replacement Secured Debt incurred in compliance with the requirements of
4
Section 2.06 or (iii) such prepayment is made from funds available for Restricted Payments pursuant to Section 9.01
and, in each case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), either (A) in the case of any Senior Lender, (1) such Senior Lender would
be entitled to or has received compensation from the Borrower for increased costs incurred by such Senior Lender in
connection with making or maintaining its Senior Loans under its Senior Loan Agreement materially in excess of costs
incurred generally by the other Senior Lenders, (2) it becomes unlawful for such Senior Lender to honor its obligation
to make or maintain its Senior Loans under its Senior Loan Agreement and it has not become unlawful generally for
the other Senior Lenders to honor their obligations to make or maintain their Senior Loans under their Senior Loan
Agreements or (3) any change in law after the date hereof results in the Borrower becoming liable to pay taxes in
respect of such Senior Lender’s (but not others’) Senior Loans at a rate or in an amount materially greater than that
which would apply had no such change in law occurred or (B) in the case of a Commercial Bank Senior Lender, such
prepayment is made in accordance with Section 5.01, 5.03, 5.04 or 5.05 of the Commercial Bank Senior Loan
Agreement.
(c)           If at any time at which any Senior Loan Obligations are payable to a Senior Lender, such Senior Lender
receives insufficient funds to pay in full all Senior Loan Obligations payable to such Senior Lender at such time
pursuant to its Senior Loan Agreement, this Agreement or the Completion Agreement, the funds so received by such
Senior Lender at such time shall be deemed to be applied in order of priority, for purposes of computations hereunder
and under the Senior Loan Agreements or the Completion Agreement, as follows:  first, to fees, commissions,
indemnities, expenses and all amounts (other than principal of and interest on the Senior Loans) payable to such
Senior Lender; second, to interest (including post-default interest) on the Senior Loans of such Senior Lender; and
third, to principal of Senior Loans of such Senior Lender; provided that, if the Senior Loans of a Senior Lender have
been accelerated, funds may be applied in any order of priority as such Senior Lender may determine; and provided,
further, that any Senior Lender may apply such funds in a different order, but any such application shall not affect in
any way the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any Senior Loan Agreement.
(d)           Each payment by the Borrower to the Hedge Banks in respect of Guaranteed Apex Metals Net Payment
Amounts shall be made on a pro rata basis to each Hedge Bank based on the proportion of Guaranteed Apex Metals
Net Payment Amounts owed to such Hedge Bank to the total amount of Guaranteed Apex Metals Net Payment
Amounts due to all Hedge Banks on such date.  Each payment by the Borrower to the Hedge Banks in respect of
Guaranteed Apex Metals Early Termination Amounts shall be made on a pro rata basis to each Hedge Bank based on
the proportion of Guaranteed Apex Metals Early Termination Amounts owed to such Hedge Bank to the total amount
of Guaranteed Apex Metals Early Termination Amounts due to all Hedge Banks on such date.
2.06  Replacement Secured Debt.
(a)           At any time and from time to time the Borrower may enter into commitments to incur, and may incur,
without the consent of Senior Lenders, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, Indebtedness for Borrowed
Money secured by and entitled to the benefits hereof for the purpose of (w) paying, in the case of an acceleration by a
Senior Lender or Senior Lender Group of its Secured Debt Obligations under Section 2.07, such Secured Debt
5
Obligations, (x) replacing any part of a Senior Loan Commitment cancelled by a Senior Lender or Senior Lender Group
under Section 2.07, (y) prepaying Secured Debt in accordance with Section 2.05(b) or (z) replacing all or any part of
an unutilized Senior Loan Commitment in accordance with Section 2.08(d) (“Replacement Secured Debt”), subject to
each of the following conditions:
(i)            the maximum principal amount of the replacement Senior Loan Commitment is no greater than the principal
amount of Senior Loans being paid (in the case of an acceleration by a Senior Lender or Senior Lender Group, as the
case may be, of its Secured Debt Obligations under Section 2.07) or prepaid and/or the unutilized or cancelled part of
the Senior Loan Commitment being replaced;
(ii)           the Replacement Secured Debt has an amortization schedule substantially similar to (or longer than) that of
the Senior Loan(s) being replaced such that, after giving effect to the incurrence of the Replacement Secured Debt,
the aggregate principal amount of Senior Loans scheduled to be due on or before any particular date is not more than
the aggregate principal amount of Senior Loans that would have been scheduled to be due on or before such date had
such Replacement Secured Debt not been incurred;
(iii)          the Replacement Secured Debt is or will be incurred for the purpose of (A) paying, in the case of an

Secured Debt Obligations, (B) replacing all or any part of a Senior Loan Commitment cancelled by a Senior Lender or
Senior Lender Group under Section 2.07, (C) prepaying Secured Debt in accordance with Section 2.05(b) or (D)

(vii)         the lender of the Replacement Secured Debt shall have executed and delivered to the Collateral Agent and

2.07  Senior Lender Suspension or Termination.
(a)           If any one Senior Lender (an “Accelerating Lender”) or any Senior Lender Group (an “Accelerating Lender
Group”) shall have suspended, cancelled or terminated its Senior Loan Commitment, in whole or in part, accelerated
the maturity of the Secured Debt Obligations held by it or declared that all or part of the Secured Debt Obligations held
by it must be then prepaid in accordance with the terms of its Senior Loan Agreement and the event or circumstance
giving rise to such suspension, cancellation, termination, acceleration or declaration of prepayment shall have been
an event or circumstance the occurrence of which does not of itself (i) constitute a Default or an Event of Default
under Section 10.01 (except under Section 10.01(dd)) or (ii) give each other Senior Lender or other Senior Lender
Group, under the terms of this Agreement or its respective Senior Loan Agreement (other than terms providing for
disbursements or payments or prepayments pro rata to those made to other Senior Lenders), the right to suspend,
cancel or terminate its Senior Loan Commitment, accelerate the maturity of the Secured Debt Obligations held by it,
or declare all or part thereof to be prepayable, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (other than
clause (b) of this Section 2.07) or any Senior Loan Agreement, the Borrower may pay or prepay the Secured Debt
Obligations owed to such Accelerating Lender or Accelerating Lender Group, as applicable, without making a Pro Rata
Payment to the other Senior Lenders or other Senior Lender Groups, and if any Senior Loan Commitments then
remain available and undrawn, the obligation of such other Senior Lenders to make additional Senior Loans (to the
extent no other event has then suspended their obligations to make additional Senior Loans) shall not be affected by
reason of such event or circumstance.  Any prepayment made pursuant to this paragraph 2.07(a) shall (A) be made

deposit in the Equity Account or Contingent Support Account) contributed no more than 10 Business Days prior to
such prepayment, or (2) be made with the proceeds of Replacement Secured Debt incurred in compliance with the
requirements of Section 2.06, or (3) be made from funds available for
7
Restricted Payments pursuant to Section 9.01 and (B) if there is an Accelerating Lender Group, be made in a manner
such that all other Secured Debt Obligations of Senior Lenders in such Accelerating Lender Group are prepaid.

Group, as the case may be, shall have first given notice to the Borrower of a suspension, cancellation, termination,
acceleration or declaration of required prepayment referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.07, (i) such
Accelerating Lender or Accelerating Lender Group, as the case may be, shall not have rescinded the action described
in such notice or (ii) such Accelerating Lender or Accelerating Lender Group, as the case may be, shall not have been
paid or prepaid in accordance with paragraph (a) above, then, at such time, (A) Majority Lenders (not including such
Accelerating Lender or Accelerating Lender Group, as the case may be, and disregarding the outstanding Senior Loan
Obligations owed to such Accelerating Lender or Accelerating Lender Group and unutilized Senior Loan Commitment
of such Accelerating Lender or Accelerating Lender Group for purposes of calculating the requisite number and
interest that constitute Majority Lenders) may suspend their obligations to make Senior Loans and (B) the Default then
continuing under Section 10.01(dd), if any, shall become an Event of Default.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement or the terms and conditions of any Senior Loan Agreement, Senior Lenders (other than such
Accelerating Lender or Accelerating Lender Group, as the case may be) agree not to take any action by reason of
such suspension, cancellation, termination, acceleration or declaration of required prepayment (x) until the termination
of such 180-day period or (y) unless, prior to the termination of such 180-day period, it becomes unlawful for such
Senior Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain its Senior Loans under its Senior Loan Agreement (provided
that the foregoing shall not restrict other Senior Lenders from refusing to make disbursements of Senior Loans in the
event that the conditions to disbursement cannot be satisfied due to such suspension, cancellation, termination or
declaration of required prepayment).

(b)           The Borrower shall have the right at any time or from time to time to terminate or reduce the aggregate
unused amount of the Senior Loan Commitments; provided that no Senior Loan Commitment shall be reduced

(i)            the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice of each such termination or reduction as provided in
clause (c) of this Section 2.08;
(ii)           each partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000 and integral multiples of
$2,000,000 in excess thereof;
(iii)          either:
(A) the Borrower cancels all Senior Loan Commitments in whole and prepays all outstanding Secured Debt

delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(c),  (2) an Officer’s Certificate of the Borrower certifying that (I) all information

achieve Completion on or prior to the Limit Completion Date, (III) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing or could reasonably be expected to result from the contemplated reduction of the Senior Loan
Commitments and (IV) no Material Adverse Effect has occurred or could reasonably be expected to result from the
contemplated reduction of the Senior Loan Commitments and (3) an Officer’s Certificate of the Sponsor certifying the
Completion Agreement is in full force and effect;

reduction of the Senior Loan Commitments.
(c)           The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Senior Loan
Commitments under clause (b) of this Section 2.08 at least ten Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any
such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Senior Lenders of its contents.  Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be irrevocable.  Any termination or reduction of the Senior Loan
Commitments shall be permanent.  Commitment fees payable in respect of terminated or reduced Senior Loan
Commitments shall cease to accrue, or shall be reduced as appropriate, upon such termination or reduction.  Accrued
commitment fees on the Senior Loan Commitments terminated or reduced hereunder shall be payable on the date of
such termination or reduction.
(d)           Terminations and reductions of Senior Loan Commitments shall be pro rata among Senior Lenders based on
the aggregate amount of unutilized Senior Loan Commitments then outstanding, provided that the Borrower may,
without making a pro rata termination or reduction of the other Senior Loan Commitments, terminate or reduce all
outstanding Senior Loan Commitments of any Senior Lender, if (i) such Senior Loan Commitments are replaced with
Replacement Secured Debt in accordance with Section 2.06 or Sponsor Funding (excluding Sponsor Funding from the
proceeds of amounts on deposit in the Equity Account or Contingent Support Account) and (ii) either (A) in the case of
any Senior Lender (I) such Senior Lender would be entitled to or has received compensation from the Borrower for
increased costs incurred by such Senior Lender in connection with making or maintaining its Senior Loan Commitment
under its Senior Loan Agreement materially in excess of costs incurred generally by the other Senior Lenders, (II) it
becomes unlawful for such Senior
9
Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain its Senior Loan Commitment under its Senior Loan Agreement and
it has not become unlawful generally for the other Senior Lenders to honor their obligations to make or maintain their
Senior Loan Commitments under their Senior Loan Agreements or (III) any change in law after the date hereof results
in the Borrower becoming liable to pay taxes in respect of such Senior Lender’s (but not others’) Senior Loans at a
rate or in an amount materially greater than that which would apply had no such change in law occurred or (B) in the
case of a Commercial Bank Senior Lender, such termination or reduction is made in accordance with Section 5.01,
5.03, 5.04 or 5.05 of the Commercial Bank Senior Loan Agreement.

New York, New York (the “New York Equity Expropriation Account”) established in the name of the Collateral Agent
(such account being a “securities account” as such term is defined in Section 9-501(a) of the UCC) or, if such Project
Equity Expropriation Compensation is paid, originated or received in Bolivia and not permitted under applicable law to
be paid directly to the New York Equity Expropriation Account, it shall be deposited in a segregated custody account

Expropriation Account, and (iii) the Collateral Agent has notified the Borrower that it has been instructed to commence

and the balance, if any, shall be paid to Apex Luxembourg, Apex Metals, Apex Sweden, Affiliates thereof or any other
Person entitled thereto, pro rata to the amount of Project Equity Expropriation Compensation deposited by it in the
Equity Expropriation Account.

Shares and all such other shares, securities, property, warrants, subscriptions, interests and rights in Apex Sweden
which it may acquire after the Initial Disbursement Date, as security for the Secured Debt Obligations and the CGSA
Secured Obligations, promptly upon the receipt thereof, and to make or cause to be made any filings, registrations or

necessary in the State of New York, Bolivia, Luxembourg or Sweden and in any jurisdiction in which it is organized
and has its principal place of business, to perfect the pledge of such Apex Sweden Shares and all such other shares,
securities, property, warrants, subscriptions, interests and rights in Apex Sweden.  Apex Luxembourg shall
defend, all at its own cost and expense, its title to, and the existence, perfection and priority of the

interest which it has or may at any time hereafter acquire in and to the Intercompany Debt and each Intercompany
Note at any time payable to or owned or held by it, and all claims resulting from any failure of performance or
compliance with such Intercompany Notes by the obligor thereon, together with full power and authority, in its own
name or otherwise, to enforce such Intercompany Notes against such obligor, provided, however, that (i) such
security interest shall not affect an Intercompany Lender’s rights to obtain and retain, free of any security interest
created by this Section 3.12(a), reimbursement or repayment in accordance with Article IX and Section 5.17 of the
Cross Guarantee and Security Agreement (if applicable) of amounts owed to it in respect of
20
any such Intercompany Debt and (ii) such security interest shall terminate, with respect to such Intercompany Debt,
as provided in Section 15.01.

instruments of endorsement without recourse, to be held by the Collateral Agent for the benefit and on behalf of each
Secured Party.
(c)           If any Intercompany Lender receives any payment by an obligor of principal or interest on Intercompany
Debt during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default (or at any time when such payment would not be
permitted under Article IX and Section 5.17 of the Cross Guarantee and Security Agreement (if applicable), or the
subordination provisions applicable thereto, if any), such party shall receive the same (without, if possible,
intermingling such payment with other funds) in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and promptly following
receipt thereof remit the same to the Collateral Agent for deposit in the Apex Metals Account.

the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties agrees that as long as Intercompany Debt is outstanding, unless
a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, it shall take such action as an Intercompany
Lender may direct to allow such party to exercise with respect to any Intercompany Note evidencing such
Intercompany Debt the rights retained by it in respect thereof, provided that the Collateral Agent shall not in any case
be obligated to surrender possession of such Intercompany Notes unless, simultaneously with such surrender, such
Intercompany Lender, delivers to the Collateral Agent one or more Intercompany Notes with an aggregate principal
amount equal to or greater than the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the Intercompany Notes being
surrendered by the Collateral Agent, together with appropriate endorsement or duly executed instruments of transfer or
assignment in blank.  Upon receipt of such replacement notes the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to (and shall, if so
directed by the Administrative Agent at the request of such Intercompany Lender) cancel the original notes and
surrender such notes to such Intercompany Lender.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Collateral Agent shall, if directed by an Enforcement Direction, (i) to the extent permitted by law, transfer title of the
Intercompany Notes to the Collateral Agent, the Secured Parties or any other Person, (ii) receive, subject to the
subordination provisions applicable thereto (if any) and to Article IX and Section 5.17 of the Cross Guarantee and
Security Agreement (if applicable), all principal, interest or other payments in respect of the Intercompany Notes (and
if an Intercompany Lender receives any such payment after Enforcement Action shall have been taken, or at any time
when such payment would not be permitted under Article IX and Section 5.17 of the Cross Guarantee and Security
Agreement (if applicable) or the subordination provisions, if any, applicable thereto, it shall receive and hold the same
(without intermingling any such payment with other funds) in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and, promptly
following receipt, remit such payment to the Collateral Agent for deposit to the Apex Metals Account), (iii) amend,
supplement or replace the Intercompany Notes, (iv) make endorsements to the schedules attached thereto,
21
(v) freely sell and dispose of such Intercompany Notes, and (vi) do any and all things that could be done by an
Intercompany Lender theretofore.
(e)           Each obligor on an Intercompany Note that is a party hereto acknowledges receipt of notice of and
consents to the grant of security interests under this Section 3.12, agrees (where such Intercompany Note is a
Subordinated Note) to observe the subordination terms applicable to Subordinated Debt set forth in Appendix A-1 to
the Transfer Restrictions Agreement, agrees (where such Intercompany Note is an Apex Metals Subordinated Note) to
observe the subordination terms applicable to Subordinated Debt set forth in Appendix A-2 to the Transfer Restrictions
Agreement, and each obligor on an Intercompany Note agrees upon request of the Collateral Agent (at the direction of
any Secured Party) from time to time to deliver further acknowledgements and consents specifically identifying the
Intercompany Debt (and the instruments and agreements relating thereto) covered by this Section 3.12.  Each
Intercompany Lender shall defend, all at its own cost and expense, its title to, and the existence,
perfection and priority of the Collateral Agent’s security interest in, the Intercompany Debt held by
it and the other Collateral referenced in Section 3.12(a) against all adverse claims.

hereafter acquire in and to (i) the quotas of Apex Metals (the “Apex Metals Quotas”), (ii) all other quotas, securities or
other property constituting or representing a right to receive a dividend on such Apex Metals Quotas or constituting or
representing a right to receive a distribution or return of capital upon or in respect of such Apex Metals Quotas or
constituting or representing warrants or any subscription or other purchase rights with respect to such Apex Metals
Quotas, and (iii) any other interest in Apex Metals which, by reason of notice or lapse of time or the occurrence of
other events, may be converted into a direct equity interest in Apex Metals.  Apex Metals hereby acknowledges
notice of the assignment of the Apex Metals Quotas accomplished hereby and shall register the assignment of the
Apex Metals Quotas on its register of members on or prior to the Initial Disbursement Date. Each of Apex
Luxembourg and Apex Sweden shall deliver to the Collateral Agent the certificates (if any) representing Apex Metals
Quotas on or prior to the Initial Disbursement Date and, promptly following receipt, shall deliver to the Collateral Agent
certificates or other relevant documentation (if any) representing any of such other quotas, securities, property,

held by the Collateral Agent for the benefit and on behalf of the Secured Parties pursuant to the pledge made hereby. 
Each of Apex Luxembourg and Apex Sweden agrees that except as contemplated by the Transfer Restrictions
Agreement it shall not permit the Organizational Documents of Apex Metals to be amended or modified in any manner
that would deprive the holders of the Apex Metals Quotas of control of Apex Metals.
(b)           On or prior to the Initial Disbursement Date, each of Apex Luxembourg and Apex Sweden shall, as security

Apex Metals.  Each of Apex Luxembourg and Apex Sweden shall defend, all at its own cost and expense,
its title to, and the existence, perfection and priority of the Collateral Agent’s security interest in,

(i)            each of the Borrower, Apex Luxembourg, Apex Sweden and Apex Metals shall give, execute, file or record

(ii)           the Borrower will give, execute, file or record any notice, financing statement, continuation statement, public
deed, instrument, document or agreement and use all reasonable efforts to obtain such Government Approvals,

necessary or desirable, and shall take all other reasonable action as required or advisable, to create, preserve,
continue, perfect or validate any security interest in any written agreement to which the Borrower is a party.
(b)           Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the Collateral Agent, on behalf of each Secured Party, is authorized to file or cause to be filed under the Uniform
Commercial Code of any state of the
23
United States of America or under other applicable law financing statements, continuation statements or other

creation, perfection, validity or enforceability of any security interest created or intended to be created hereby or
pursuant hereto or for the maintenance or perfection of any such security interest, provided, however, that the
Collateral Agent shall execute all public deeds or other documents as required by applicable law and regulation and as
requested by the Secured Parties to duly create and register security interests in accordance with this Article III.  The
Collateral Agent shall notify the Borrower following the taking by it of such respective action.  The Collateral Agent
may delegate the performance of some or all of its rights and obligations under this Section 3.14, subject to

powers of attorney granting the Collateral Agent, as the Borrower’s attorney-in-fact, the power and right, in its name or
on its behalf, without notice or assent, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to take any action and execute any
instruments, in each case consistent with this Agreement and in compliance with Section 13.03, which the Collateral
Agent (as may be determined pursuant to Section 13.06) or any other Secured Party may deem reasonably necessary
or advisable to create, preserve, continue, perfect or validate any security interest granted or purported to be granted
by it under or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Security Document.
(e)           Any Security Document governed by the laws of Bolivia or Chile referred to in this Article III required to be

Apex Sweden, as the case may be, prior to or concurrently with the time or times that any Persons (including
successors, transferees and assigns of Secured Parties) become holders of Secured Debt secured by and entitled to
the benefits of this Agreement, shall, to the extent necessary or advisable and as directed by the Administrative
Agent, amend each of the Security Documents to which it is a party solely to identify specifically such additional

24
the Secured Debt held by such additional Secured Parties shall have the benefit of the security interests referred to
therein.

deficiency.
3.18  Private Sale and Waivers.  This Section 3.18 applies with respect to all Collateral over which a Lien is granted
hereby or by other Security Documents pursuant to the laws of the State of New York.  The Collateral Agent and the
Secured Parties shall incur no liability as a result of the sale of the Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private sale
where permitted pursuant to applicable law conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, provided that the
Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Luxembourg or Apex Sweden, as the case may be, is notified of the time and place of
such sale at least ten days in advance thereof.  Subject to the
26
immediately preceding sentence, each of the Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Luxembourg and Apex Sweden hereby
waives any claims against the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party arising by reason of the fact that the price
at which the Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price that might have been
obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured Debt Obligations, even if the
Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree.  Each of
the Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Luxembourg and Apex Sweden waives, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law (a) any claim that, as to any part of the Collateral, a public sale, should the Collateral Agent elect so to
proceed (pursuant to written direction of the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties pursuant to Section 10.05),
is, in and of itself, not a commercially reasonable method of sale for the Collateral; (b) except for any damages which
are the result of the Collateral Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, NOTICE OR JUDICIAL HEARING IN
CONNECTION WITH THE COLLATERAL AGENT’S TAKING POSSESSION OR DISPOSITION OF ANY OF THE
COLLATERAL INCLUDING ANY AND ALL PRIOR NOTICE AND HEARING FOR ANY PREJUDGMENT REMEDY
OR REMEDIES AND ANY SUCH RIGHT THAT THE BORROWER, APEX LUXEMBOURG,  APEX SWEDEN OR
APEX METALS WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY
STATUTE OF THE UNITED STATES OR OF ANY STATE, AND ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS AS TO THE TIME,
PLACE AND TERMS OF SALE OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE
COLLATERAL AGENT’S RIGHTS HEREUNDER; (c) all rights of redemption, appraisement, valuation, stay and
extension or moratorium; and (d) all other rights the exercise of which would, directly or indirectly, prevent, delay or
inhibit the enforcement of any of the rights or remedies of the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties under
this Agreement and the other Security Documents or the absolute sale of the Collateral, now or hereafter in force
under any applicable law, and each of the Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Luxembourg and Apex Sweden, in each case
for itself and all who may claim under it, insofar as it or they now or hereafter lawfully may, hereby waive the benefit of
all such laws and rights.
3.19  Obligations Absolute.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of Apex Luxembourg,
Apex Metals and Apex Sweden under this Agreement and the other Security Documents to which they are a party are
absolute, irrevocable and unconditional and will remain in full force and effect without regard to, and will not be
released, suspended, discharged, terminated or otherwise affected by, any circumstance or occurrence whatsoever
(other than termination pursuant to Section 15.01), including:
(a)           any renewal, extension, amendment, or modification of, or addition or supplement to or deletion from, any of
the Transaction Documents or any other instrument or agreement referred to therein, or any assignment or transfer of
any thereof;
(b)           any waiver of, consent to or departure from, extension, indulgence or other action or inaction under or in
respect of any of the Secured Debt Obligations, this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or other instrument
or agreement relating thereto, or any exercise or non-exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under or
27
in respect of the Secured Debt Obligations, this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any such other
instrument or agreement relating thereto;
(c)           any furnishing of any additional security for the Secured Debt Obligations or any part thereof to the
Collateral Agent or any other person or any acceptance thereof by the Collateral Agent or any other person or any
substitution, sale, exchange, release, surrender or realization of or upon any such security by the Collateral Agent or
any other person or the failure to create, preserve, validate, perfect or protect any other Lien granted to, or purported
to be granted to, or in favor of, the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party;
(d)           any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the Secured Debt Obligations, any other
Transaction Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto or any security therefor;
(e)           the acceleration of the maturity of any of the Secured Debt Obligations or any other modification of the time
of payment thereof; or
(f)            any other event or circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge
of a surety or a guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 3.19 that the obligations of Apex Luxembourg and Apex
Sweden hereunder and under the other Security Documents shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any
and all circumstances.
3.20  Subrogation.  Apex Luxembourg, Apex Sweden and, with respect to the Borrower Shares pledged by it, Apex
Metals shall not exercise, and each of Apex Luxembourg and Apex Sweden hereby irrevocably defers the exercise of,
any claim, right or remedy that it may now have or may hereafter acquire against the Borrower or Apex Metals arising
under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Security Document, including, without limitation, any claim,
right or remedy of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, exoneration, indemnification or participation arising under
contract, by applicable law or otherwise in any claim, right or remedy of the Collateral Agent or the other Secured
Parties against the Borrower, Apex Metals or any other Person or any Collateral which the Collateral Agent or any
other Secured Party may now have or may hereafter acquire, until the indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full of
all Secured Debt Obligations.  If, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any amount shall be paid to Apex
Luxembourg, Apex Sweden or Apex Metals on account of such subrogation rights at any time when any of the
Secured Debt Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Person in trust for the
Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Person and be turned over to the
Collateral Agent in the exact form received by such Person (duly endorsed by such Person to the Collateral Agent, if
required), to be applied against the Secured Debt Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the
Financing Documents.
3.21  Designation of Local Banks.  As a condition to being a Local Bank, any financial institution designated by the
Borrower as a Local Bank shall enter into a local bank agreement in a form mutually satisfactory to the Majority
Secured Parties and the Borrower.  Each Local Bank shall deliver a signed copy of such agreement to the
Administrative Agent.  No
28
Local Bank shall continue to serve as a Local Bank if such bank ceases to satisfy the definition of “Local Bank”.
3.22  First Priority.  As used in this Article III, a reference to a “first priority” pledge or security interest shall be
deemed to be subject to Permitted Liens to the extent that such Permitted Liens are granted priority on a mandatory
basis under applicable Government Rules.
ARTICLE IV
ACCOUNTS
4.01  Accounts.
(a)           Establishment of Accounts.  The Borrower (and in the case of the Apex Metals Account, Apex Metals) shall
direct the Collateral Agent to, and the Collateral Agent shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, direct JPMorgan Chase

of the Collateral Agent in its capacity as Collateral Agent hereunder as “securities accounts” (as such term is defined
in Section 8-501(a) of the UCC), denominated in Dollars and separately established and maintained by the Securities
Intermediary (which shall act as “securities intermediary” (as such term is defined in Section 8-102(a)(14) of the UCC)
with respect to the New York Accounts) at its offices located in New York City:
(i)            a “Loan Proceeds Account”, into which deposits shall be made in accordance with Sections 4.02(a), 4.08(a)
and 4.08(b);
(ii)           an “Apex Metals Account”, into which deposits shall be made in accordance with Sections 4.02(c), 4.02(d),

All moneys held in the New York Accounts shall be trust funds held by the Collateral Agent solely for the purpose of
making payments therefrom in accordance with this Agreement; and only the Collateral Agent shall have the right to
make withdrawals and payments therefrom as and to the extent provided in this Agreement.  Regardless of any
provision in any other agreement, for purposes of the UCC, the “securities intermediary’s jurisdiction” with respect to
the New York Accounts for the purposes of Section 8-110(e) of the UCC is the State of New York.
(c)           Acknowledgements of Securities Intermediary.  The Collateral Agent, the Borrower, Apex Metals and the
Securities Intermediary hereby agree and confirm that (i) the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties will
be the “entitlement holder” (within the meaning of section 8-102(a)(7) of the UCC) of the “security entitlements” (within
the meaning of section 8-102(a)(17) of the UCC) in respect of the “financial assets” (within the meaning of section 8-
102(a)(9) of the UCC) credited to the New York Accounts and any instruction or direction from the Collateral Agent as
described in this Article IV or elsewhere in this Agreement relating to the transfer or redemption of a financial asset
(as so defined) shall constitute an “entitlement order” (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(8) of the UCC), (ii) all property
delivered to the Collateral Agent (in such capacity) pursuant to this Agreement or any other Financing Document for
deposit in the New York Accounts will be held by the Securities Intermediary and promptly credited to a New York
Account by an appropriate entry in its records in accordance with this Agreement, (iii) all financial assets (as so
defined) in registered form or payable to or to the order of and credited to any such New York Account shall be
registered in the name of, payable to or to the order of, or indorsed to, the Collateral Agent or in blank, or credited to
another securities account maintained in the name of the Collateral Agent, and in no case will any financial asset
credited to any such New York Account be registered in the name of, payable to or to the order of, or indorsed to, the
Borrower or Apex Metals, as the case may be, except to the extent the foregoing have been subsequently indorsed
by the Borrower or Apex Metals, as the case may be, to the Collateral Agent or in blank, and (iv) each item of
property (including any security, instrument or obligation, share, participation, interest, cash or other property
whatsoever) credited to any New York Account shall be treated as a financial asset (as so defined).  In the event that
the Securities Intermediary receives conflicting entitlement orders or written instructions from the Collateral Agent,
any Affiliated Obligor or any other Person, the Securities Intermediary shall comply with the entitlement orders or
written instructions, as applicable, originated by the Collateral Agent.  The Securities Intermediary is not party to and
shall not execute and deliver, or otherwise become bound by, any agreement under which the Securities Intermediary
agrees with any Person other than the Collateral Agent and the Borrower or Apex Metals to comply with entitlement
orders or written instructions originated by such Person relating to any of the New York Accounts or the security
entitlements that are the
30
subject of this Agreement.  The Securities Intermediary shall not grant, permit or suffer to exist any Lien in any
financial asset that is the subject of any security entitlement that is the subject of this Agreement.
(d)           Account Names and Numbers.  The Securities Intermediary shall not change the name or account number
of any New York Account without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent (acting in accordance with Section
13.06); provided, however, that in the case of any change in account number that is a result of any reconfiguring of
the systems of the Securities Intermediary, the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent shall not be required so
long as the Collateral Agent shall have received prior written notice of such change.  The Securities Intermediary shall
give the Borrower and Apex Metals prior written notice of any change in the account number or name of any New York
Account.
(e)           Waiver of Lien; Subordination.  In the event that the Securities Intermediary has or subsequently obtains by
agreement, operation of law or otherwise a Lien on any New York Account, any financial asset carried therein or
credited thereto or any security entitlement related thereto, the Securities Intermediary agrees that such Lien shall
(except to the extent provided in the last sentence of this Section 4.01(e)) be subordinate to the Liens of the Collateral
Agent.  The financial assets standing to the credit of the New York Accounts will not be subject to deduction, set-off,
banker’s lien, or any other right in favor of any Person other than the Collateral Agent (except to the extent of returned
items and chargebacks either for uncollected checks or other items of payment and transfers previously credited to
one or more of the New York Accounts, and the Borrower, Apex Metals and the Collateral Agent hereby authorize the
Securities Intermediary to debit the relevant New York Account(s) for such amounts).
(f)            No Other Agreements.  None of the Securities Intermediary, the Collateral Agent, the Borrower or Apex
Metals have entered or will enter into any agreement with respect to any New York Account or any security
entitlements, financial assets or amounts carried in or credited to any New York Account, other than this Agreement,
the other Security Documents and account agreements and similar documentation relating to any New York Account
(provided that in the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any such account agreement or
similar documentation, the terms of this Agreement shall control).  The Securities Intermediary has not entered into
any agreement with the Borrower, Apex Metals or any other Person purporting to limit or condition the obligation of the
Securities Intermediary to comply with entitlement orders or written instructions originated by the Collateral Agent in
accordance with Section 4.01(c).
(g)           No Adverse Claims.  Except for the claims and interest of the Collateral Agent and the Securities
Intermediary and, to the limited extent provided herein, the Borrower and Apex Metals in each of the New York
Accounts, the Securities Intermediary does not know, as of the date hereof and as of each date on which any New
York Account is established in connection with this Agreement, of any claim to, or interest in, any New York Account
or in any security entitlement, financial asset or amounts carried therein or credited thereto.  If the Securities
Intermediary obtains knowledge that any Person has asserted any Lien (including any writ, garnishment, judgment,
warrant of attachment, execution or similar process) against any New York Account or in any security entitlement,
financial asset or amounts carried therein or
31
credited thereto, the Securities Intermediary will promptly notify the Collateral Agent, the Borrower and Apex Metals.
(h)           Perfection of Lien.  The rights and powers granted to the Collateral Agent by the Secured Parties have been
granted in order to perfect its Lien in the New York Accounts and the security entitlements, financial assets and
amounts carried therein or credited thereto, are powers coupled with an interest and will not be affected by the
bankruptcy of the Borrower, the bankruptcy of Apex Metals or the lapse of time.  Without limiting the intent of the
parties that the New York Accounts be treated and maintained as securities accounts and the funds on deposit
therein be treated as financial assets, in the event that any of the New York Accounts is deemed to be a deposit
account then the following provisions shall apply with respect to such New York Accounts:  (i) each such New York
Account will be treated as a “deposit account” (within the meaning of Section 9-102(a)(29) of the UCC); (ii) the
Securities Intermediary agrees to act as a “bank” (within the meaning of 9-102(a) of the UCC) with respect to such
New York Accounts that are “deposit accounts” and credit balances therein not constituting financial assets credited
thereto; (iii) the Collateral Agent will be treated as the “customer” (within the meaning of Section 4-104(e) of the UCC)
with respect to such Accounts that are “deposit accounts”; (iv) the Collateral Agent shall have “control” (within the
meaning of Section 9-104(a) of the UCC) of the New York Accounts that are “deposit accounts”; and (v) the Securities
Intermediary will not have any rights of set-off or other Lien in respect of such New York Accounts or the credit
balance therein and the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, shall have a Lien on such New York
Accounts and the credit balances therein.  The Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that it will comply with
instructions with respect to the New York Accounts originated by the Collateral Agent without further consent by the
Borrower, Apex Metals or any other Person.
(i)            No Borrower or Apex Metals Rights.  Neither the Borrower nor Apex Metals shall have any right to withdraw
funds held in the New York Accounts, except to:  (i) receive or make requisitions of monies held in the New York
Accounts as expressly permitted by this Agreement; (ii) cause transfers of monies held in the New York Accounts, as
expressly permitted by this Agreement; and (iii) direct the investment of monies held in the New York Accounts as
expressly permitted by Section 4.03.  No other Affiliated Obligor shall have any right, title or interest in, to or under
any of the New York Accounts.
(j)            Bolivian Accounts.
(i)            Expense Account.  The “Expense Accounts” shall be two separate bank accounts established in the name
of the Borrower and maintained by the Borrower at the Local Bank.  One Expense Account shall be in US Dollars, into
which US Dollar-denominated deposits shall be made and from which US Dollar-denominated withdrawals shall be
made. A second Expense Account shall be in Bolivianos into which Boliviano-deposits shall be made and from which
Boliviano-denominated withdrawals shall be made (and references herein to the “Expense Accounts” shall be deemed
to include a reference to the accounts maintained therein).  The Borrower may make transfers into the Expense
Accounts in accordance with Section 4.04(a) for the payment of Operating Costs in Bolivia, provided that, (1) no such
transfer may be made if, after giving effect
32
thereto, the balance in the Expense Accounts would exceed the Maximum Expense Account Balance and (2) each
such transfer shall be in a minimum amount of $500,000.  In the event that the balance of funds in the Expense
Accounts exceeds the Maximum Expense Account Balance, the Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, promptly direct the Local Bank to transfer funds (converting amounts in Bolivianos to Dollars) from the Expense
Accounts to the applicable New York Account to cure such excess; and if required for purpose of effecting such
transfer, the Borrower shall cooperate with the Collateral Agent in constituting and issuing such accounts,
authorizations and powers as may be advisable or requested by the Collateral Agent to comply with any formal
requirements incident to such transfer.  If any Boliviano amount otherwise required to be deposited in the Expense
Accounts cannot be deposited therein without the balance in the Expense Account exceeding the Maximum Expense
Account Balance, such Boliviano amount shall (to the extent permitted by applicable law) promptly be deposited in the
applicable New York Account (converting amounts in Bolivianos to Dollars at the rate established by the Bolivian
Central Bank).
(ii)           Bolivian Proceeds Account.  If at any time the Borrower shall have received any proceeds, other than
proceeds from Expropriation Compensation or Insurance subject to Article V, denominated in Bolivianos and such
proceeds cannot be deposited in the applicable New York Account (after converting amounts in Bolivianos to Dollars)
in accordance with Section 4.01(j)(i), then at such time the Borrower shall direct the Local Bank to promptly establish
a segregated Bolivian Account (a “Bolivian Proceeds Account”) at the Local Bank and shall deposit such funds
therein.  After establishing the Bolivian Proceeds Account the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the
Local Bank an irrevocable instruction in favor of the Collateral Agent duly authorizing the Collateral Agent, as its
attorney-in-fact to direct the funds in the account.  The Borrower shall not withdraw or otherwise make use of such
funds without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent (acting in accordance with Section 13.06).
4.02  Deposits.
(a)           Senior Loan Disbursements.  Disbursements of Senior Loans shall be paid directly to the Loan Proceeds
Account.  The proceeds of withdrawals from the Equity Account in accordance with Section 4.08(a) shall be paid into
the Loan Proceeds Account.  Promptly upon its receipt of proceeds of Senior Loans into the Loan Proceeds Account,
the Securities Intermediary shall notify each funding Senior Lender and the Borrower that it has received such
proceeds.
(b)           Equity Amount.  Prior to the Initial Disbursement Date, Sponsor Funding in an amount equal to the Equity
Amount shall be deposited directly into the Equity Account; provided that an Equity Support Letter of Credit may be
provided in lieu of all or a portion of the Equity Amount as provided in Section 11.02(a)(i).
33
(c)           Proceeds.  Apex Metals agrees to instruct all buyers of Project Production or the Persons making payment
on behalf of such buyers (including banks making payments under letters of credit) to make all payments in respect
thereof in Dollars directly to the Apex Metals Account.  Without prejudice to such buyers’ obligations to make
payments in Dollars under Third Party Concentrate Sales Agreements directly to the Apex Metals Account, if,
notwithstanding the instructions required to be given to buyers of Project Production pursuant to this Agreement, any
such payments are remitted to Apex Metals other than by deposit to the Apex Metals Account, then Apex Metals
shall hold such amounts (without, if possible, intermingling them with other funds) in trust for the benefit of the
Collateral Agent, and promptly following receipt, remit such amounts to the Apex Metals Account.
(d)           Hedge Agreement Proceeds and Early Termination Amounts.  All Hedge Banks shall make all payments of
amounts due to Apex Metals under any Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreements in Dollars directly to the Apex Metals
Account.
(e)           Contingent Support Amount.  Prior to the Initial Disbursement Date, Sponsor Funding in an amount equal to
$70,000,000 shall be deposited directly into the Contingent Support Account; provided that a Contingent Support
Letter of Credit may be provided in lieu of all or a portion of such amount as provided in Section 11.02(a)(ii).
Subsequent to the Initial Disbursement Date, Sponsor Funding shall be deposited directly into the Contingent Support
Account as and when required pursuant to Section 5.03 of the Completion Agreement.
(f)            Proceeds from Sale of Collateral, Expropriation Compensation and Insurance.  Any proceeds from the sale
of Project Property shall be paid directly to the Apex Metals Account.  Any proceeds from Expropriation
Compensation shall be paid directly to the Expropriation Proceeds Account; provided that (i) any proceeds
denominated in Bolivianos when received, and (ii) any proceeds originating, paid or received in Bolivia and not
permitted under applicable Government Rules to be paid directly to the Expropriation Proceeds Account, shall be
deposited (following conversion, if necessary, of the relevant amount into a corresponding Dollar or Boliviano amount)
in the Expense Account, subject to Section 4.01(j), which amount shall be promptly deposited to the applicable New
York Account (after converting amounts in Bolivianos to Dollars).  Any proceeds from insurance shall be paid directly
to the Insurance Proceeds Account, the Expense Account or, in the case of third party liability or worker’s
compensation, to the Person to whom the liability has been incurred, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions
of Article V.
(g)           IVA Reimbursements.  All payments in respect of IVA Reimbursement Rights or sales of IVA
Reimbursement Rights shall be made directly to, or deposited in the Expense Account, subject to Section 4.01(j).
(h)           Other Project Funds and Sponsor Funding.  Other than as specified in clauses (a) through (g) of this
Section 4.02 and as contemplated by Section 5.05 or 5.08, all Project Funds and Sponsor Funding shall be deposited
directly (following conversion, if necessary, of the relevant amount into a corresponding Dollar amount) in the Apex
Metals Account.  All other amounts received by or paid to the Borrower or Apex Metals and not expressly required to
be deposited into another New York Account in accordance with the terms
34
of this Agreement shall be deposited directly into the Apex Metals Account (and each of the Borrower and Apex
Metals hereby agree to notify all payors that all payments to be made to either of them shall be made to the Apex
Metals Account).
4.03  Investment of Funds in Accounts.
(a)           Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Collateral Agent shall direct the Securities
Intermediary to invest funds (and vary and redeem such investments) in the New York Accounts in the name of the
Collateral Agent as directed by the Borrower or Apex Metals (solely with respect to the Apex Metals Account);
provided that such investments shall only be in Authorized Investments in Dollars and shall be at the sole risk and
expense of the Borrower or Apex Metals (solely with respect to the Apex Metals Account).  All taxes accruing with
respect to Authorized Investments and the acquisition, liquidation and redemption thereof shall be for the sole account
of the Borrower or Apex Metals (solely with respect to the Apex Metals Account).
(b)           If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Collateral Agent shall, to the extent so notified as
contemplated by Section 4.05(a), direct the Securities Intermediary to invest funds (and vary and redeem such
investments) in the New York Accounts as directed by the Person designated by the applicable Secured Parties in an
Account Enforcement Notice, provided that such funds may be invested only in certain Authorized Investments as
directed by the Administrative Agent, at the instruction of the Majority Secured Parties.
(c)           Whenever directed to make a withdrawal or transfer of funds, the Collateral Agent (unless, so long as no
Event of Default is continuing, otherwise directed by the Borrower or Apex Metals (solely with respect to the Apex
Metals Account)) is authorized to direct the Securities Intermediary to liquidate any investment to the extent that,
after application of all other available funds, liquidation of such investment is necessary to make such transfer,
provided that the Collateral Agent shall not be obliged to issue such a direction to so liquidate any investment unless
directed to do so by the Borrower or Apex Metals (solely with respect to the Apex Metals Account) (or, in the event
that an Account Enforcement Notice has been delivered and not revoked, the Administrative Agent or the Person
identified in such notice).  If so directed by the Borrower or Apex Metals (solely with respect to the Apex Metals
Account) (or, in the event that an Account Enforcement Notice has been delivered and not revoked, the
Administrative Agent or the Person identified in such notice), the Collateral Agent shall cause to be liquidated
investments as so directed.  The Collateral Agent shall have, however, no liability with respect to any interest cost or
penalty on the liquidation of any investment pursuant to this clause (c), nor shall the Collateral Agent have any liability
with respect to investments (including purchases or conversions of foreign exchange) of moneys held in the New York
Accounts (or any losses resulting therefrom) made in accordance with this Section 4.03, except in the case of gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Collateral Agent as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  All
investment of funds in the New York Accounts shall be made in the name of and on behalf of the Collateral Agent and
should be reflected as such on the books and records of the Securities Intermediary, and shall be at the sole cost and
expense of the Borrower and Apex Metals (solely with respect to the Apex Metals Account).  To the extent that a
transfer of funds from one New York Account to another New York Account is required in
35
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Securities Intermediary can effect such transfer without
liquidating Authorized Investments in the New York Account from which funds are to be transferred (e.g., where such
New York Account has an Authorized Investment having a face amount that is less than or equal to the amount of the
funds to be transferred), then the Collateral Agent, the Borrower or Apex Metals (solely with respect to the Apex
Metals Account) may request that the Securities Intermediary transfer such Authorized Investments to the recipient
New York Account without liquidating such Authorized Investment.
(d)           All references in this Agreement to New York Accounts and to cash, moneys or funds therein or balances
thereof, shall include the investments in which such moneys are then invested and the proceeds thereof.
(e)           Proceeds of Authorized Investments shall be posted to the New York Accounts to which such Authorized
Investments are credited.
4.04  Withdrawals from Liquidity Accounts Pre-Event of Default.  Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and
is continuing, the Borrower shall have the sole right to direct the Collateral Agent by delivery of a Withdrawal
Certificate (and the Collateral Agent shall direct the Securities Intermediary in accordance with such Withdrawal
Certificate) to withdraw moneys as directed from the Liquidity Accounts (subject to Section 4.07(d) with respect to the
Operating Reserve Account) and to apply such moneys in the following order of priority:
(a)           first, (i) to pay Operating Costs (other than Operating Costs to be paid from amounts on deposit in the
Insurance Proceeds Account or the Expropriation Proceeds Account) then due and payable and (ii) for transfer to the
Expense Account the amount requested by the Borrower for the payment of Operating Costs in Bolivia, subject to
Section 4.01(j);
(b)           second, to pay Senior Loan Obligations consisting of interest and commitment fees then due and payable
with respect to the Senior Loans and Senior Loan Commitments;
(c)           third, to pay (i) premia on the PRI Policies then due and payable and (ii) any other amount (other than
principal payments, Cash Sweep Prepayments, Guaranteed Apex Metals Early Termination Amounts and any
amounts payable under steps first and second above) then due and payable under the Financing Documents in
respect of the Secured Debt Obligations;
(d)           fourth, to pay (i) Secured Debt Obligations consisting of the amount of principal of the Senior Loans
(excluding Cash Sweep Prepayments) then due and payable and (ii) Guaranteed Apex Metals Early Termination
Amounts;
(e)           fifth, from and after the Completion Date, (i) first to fund in accordance with Section 4.06(a)(i) the amount of
any Debt Service Reserve Deficiency and (ii) second to fund in accordance with Section 4.07(a)(i) the amount of any
Operating Reserve Deficiency;
36
(f)            sixth, to Cash Sweep Prepayments of the Senior Loans in accordance with Section 9.02; and
(g)           seventh, to pay any Service Fee then due and payable.
Apex Metals hereby irrevocably authorizes the Borrower to make such withdrawals and transfers from the Apex
Metals Account as may be necessary to fund the foregoing costs, expenses and payments.
4.05  Withdrawals from Liquidity Accounts During the Continuance of an Event of Default.
(a)           If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent may, and if directed
by the Majority Secured Parties the Administrative Agent shall, notify (such notification, an “Account Enforcement
Notice”) the Collateral Agent (which in turn shall notify the Securities Intermediary) in accordance with Section 10.04
that, as contemplated by this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall no longer accept Withdrawal Certificates and
instructions from the Borrower or Apex Metals (solely with respect to the Apex Metals Account) for the investment,
withdrawal or transfer of funds or investments in the New York Accounts.  The Collateral Agent and the Securities
Intermediary shall thereafter, for so long as such Event of Default shall be continuing, accept instructions for the
investment or disposition of funds in such New York Accounts solely from the Administrative Agent or other Person(s)
designated by the Administrative Agent in such notice.  In the event that the Administrative Agent does not issue an
Account Enforcement Notice, the provisions of Section 4.04 shall continue to apply notwithstanding the occurrence of
an Event of Default; provided that no payments shall be made in respect of Section 4.04(d)(ii) except payments of
Guaranteed Apex Metals Early Termination Amounts where the Collateral Agent has delivered to each other Secured
Party a notice previously delivered to it by a Hedge Bank specifying that such Hedge Bank has terminated some or all
of the Mandatory Metals Hedge Transactions then outstanding.
(b)           The Borrower, Apex Metals, the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties agree that following the delivery
to the Collateral Agent of an Account Enforcement Notice, and until such time as either (x) an Enforcement Direction
has been given in accordance with Section 10.02(e) or (y) the Event of Default has been cured or waived as specified
in clause (d) below, the Collateral Agent shall (I) direct the Securities Intermediary to invest moneys available in the
New York Accounts solely in certain Authorized Investments as instructed by the Administrative Agent acting at the
direction of the Majority Secured Parties, and (II) cause available funds from the Liquidity Accounts to be applied on
the first Business Day of each month following receipt of an Account Enforcement Notice in the following order of
priority:
(i)            first, (A) for the period from the date of the applicable Event of Default to the beginning of the first month for
which the Borrower may timely deliver a Restricted Operating Cost Certificate in accordance with clause (c) below, to
pay to the Persons indicated on such certificate at the times specified in such certificate or transfer to the Expense
Account, Operating Costs (other than Operating Costs to be paid from amounts on deposit in the Insurance Proceeds
Account or the Expropriation Proceeds Account) incurred prior to the date of such
37
Event of Default that are then due and payable or that constitute Restricted Operating Costs, in each case when due
and payable during such period, as certified by the Borrower in a Restricted Operating Cost Certificate delivered to the
Technical Agent and the Collateral Agent pursuant to and in accordance with Section 4.05(c), and (B) thereafter, to
pay to the Persons indicated on such certificate at the times specified in such certificate or transfer to the Expense
Account, Restricted Operating Costs (other than Restricted Operating Costs to be paid from amounts on deposit in
the Insurance Proceeds Account or the Expropriation Proceeds Account) for such month as set forth in the applicable
Restricted Operating Cost Certificate for such month delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to clause (c) of this
Section 4.05 (excluding, in any case, any amount set forth in such certificate that the Administrative Agent has
notified the Collateral Agent has been determined by the Technical Agent in consultation with the Independent
Engineer pursuant to clause (c) of this Section 4.05 not to be a Restricted Operating Cost);
(ii)           second, to pay all outstanding fees and expenses of the Agents then due and payable ratably to such
Agents based on the amounts owed to such Agents or to reserve for such amounts reasonably expected to become
due and payable prior to the next scheduled date of application of funds;
(iii)          third, to pay interest and commitment fees constituting Senior Loan Obligations and to pay Guaranteed
Apex Metals Net Payment Amounts then due and payable ratably to the Persons entitled thereto based on the ratio of
such amounts owed to such Persons to the aggregate of all such amounts owed to all such Persons, or to reserve for
all such amounts reasonably expected to become due and payable prior to the next scheduled date of application of
funds;
(iv)          fourth, to pay premia on PRI Policies then due and payable ratably to the Persons entitled thereto based on
the ratio of such amounts owed to such Persons to the aggregate of all such amounts owed to all such Persons, or to
reserve for such amounts reasonably expected to become due and payable prior to the next scheduled date of
application of funds;
(v)           fifth, to pay Senior Loan Obligations (other than those described in the foregoing clauses (ii) through (iv) and
clauses (vi), (vii) and (viii) below) then due and payable ratably to the Persons entitled thereto based on the ratio of
such amounts owed to such Persons to the aggregate of all such amounts owed to all such Persons, or to reserve for
such amounts reasonably expected to become due and payable prior to the next scheduled date of application of
funds;
(vi)          sixth, to pay regular scheduled installments of principal of Senior Loan Obligations then due and payable
ratably to the Persons entitled thereto based on the ratio of such amounts owed to such Persons to the aggregate of
all such amounts owed to all such Persons, or to reserve for such amounts reasonably expected to become due and
payable prior to the next scheduled date of application of funds;
38
(vii)         seventh, to reserve for Secured Debt Obligations described in clauses (ii) through (vi) above reasonably
expected to become due and payable on or prior to the next Principal Repayment Date;
(viii)        eighth, to pay Senior Loan Obligations that have become due and payable prior to their scheduled Principal
Repayment Date and Guaranteed Apex Metals Early Termination Amounts; ratably to the Persons entitled thereto
based on the ratio of such amounts owed to such Persons to the aggregate of all such amounts owed to all such
Persons;
(ix)           ninth, from and after the Completion Date, (i) first to fund in accordance with Section 4.06(a)(i) the amount
of any Debt Service Reserve Deficiency and (ii) second to fund in accordance with Section 4.07(a)(i) the amount of
any Operating Reserve Deficiency; and
(x)            tenth, to Cash Sweep Prepayments of the Senior Loans in accordance with Section 9.02;
provided, however, that if an Enforcement Direction has been given in accordance with
Section 10.02(e), then the Collateral Agent shall, upon receipt of directions from the
Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Majority Secured Parties, instruct the Securities
Intermediary to cause such funds to be applied as so directed by the Administrative Agent, on
behalf of the Majority Secured Parties as specified in the Enforcement Direction.
(c)           In the event that the Administrative Agent delivers an Account Enforcement Notice to the Collateral Agent
and for so long as the Event of Default referred to therein has not been cured or waived, the Borrower shall deliver to
the Collateral Agent, the Technical Agent and the Independent Engineer at least 15 Business Days prior to the first
day of each month or, in the case of Operating Costs occurring during the period described in clause (b)(i)(A) above,
as soon as possible, a certificate signed by a senior financial officer of the Borrower (a “Restricted Operating Cost
Certificate”) setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the amount of Operating Costs incurred prior to the Event of Default
then due and payable and (ii) the amount of Restricted Operating Costs that are expected to become due and payable
during the period required to be covered by such certificate pursuant to clause (b)(i) above.  Each such Restricted
Operating Cost Certificate shall contain a warranty that the funds disbursed at the direction of the Collateral Agent
pursuant to item (i) in the order of priority specified in clause (b) shall be used solely to pay Operating Costs incurred
prior to the Event of Default then due and payable and Restricted Operating Costs that will become due and payable
on or prior to the last day of the period covered by such certificate.  Each such Restricted Operating Cost Certificate
shall state that the amount of Restricted Operating Costs contained therein has been based on the Construction
Budget or Operating Plan, as the case may be, for the period to which it relates.  The funds in the Liquidity Accounts
shall be applied as provided in such certificate unless within 10 Business Days of the delivery to the Independent
Engineer and the Technical Agent of the Restricted Operating Cost Certificate, the Technical Agent, in consultation
with the Independent Engineer, identifies any items of expenditure specified therein which it determines are not
Restricted Operating Costs and provides written notice thereof to the Borrower and the Senior Lenders indicating the
reason for its conclusion.  In such event, such items of expenditure
39
shall not be treated as Restricted Operating Costs for purposes of Section 4.05(b) until such time as the Majority
Secured Parties determine that they may be treated as Restricted Operating Costs.  The Technical Agent and
Independent Engineer shall review each Restricted Operating Cost Certificate.  The reasonable and documented fees
and expenses of the Independent Engineer and the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses of the
Technical Agent, in each case to the extent incurred in the review of the Restricted Operating Cost Certificates, shall
be for the account of the Borrower.
(d)           Upon cessation, cure or waiver of an Event of Default, the Majority Secured Parties shall cause the
Administrative Agent to deliver a notice to the Borrower and the Collateral Agent, stating the date of such cessation,
cure or waiver.  Any notice given pursuant to this Section 4.05(d) shall be a “Cessation Notice”.   Upon receipt by the
Collateral Agent of Cessation Notices with respect to all continuing Events of Default, the Collateral Agent shall
promptly notify the Securities Intermediary, with a copy to the Borrower and Apex Metals, directing them once again
to accept the directions of the Borrower, and the Securities Intermediary shall again accept the directions of the
Borrower pursuant to written instructions in respect of investment of funds in the Accounts and pursuant to Withdrawal
Certificates in respect of disposition of funds in the Accounts, all on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
4.06  Debt Service Reserve Account.
(a)           Debt Service Reserve Payments.
(i)            If, after Completion, there is a Debt Service Reserve Deficiency on any Reserve Payment Date, then on
such Reserve Payment Date the Borrower shall deliver a Withdrawal Certificate to the Collateral Agent instructing it to
transfer to the Debt Service Reserve Account, from funds (if any) available in any Liquidity Account, funds in an
amount equal to such Debt Service Reserve Deficiency (a “Debt Service Reserve Payment”).
(ii)           The Borrower shall give immediate notice to the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent if less than
100% of any Debt Service Reserve Payment due has been deposited in the Debt Service Reserve Account on or prior
to the applicable Reserve Payment Date.
(b)           Timing of Debt Service Reserve Payments.  The Borrower may make Debt Service Reserve Payments or
cause to be provided Debt Service Reserve Letters of Credit at any time including to meet the conditions of
Section 9.01(a).
(c)           Transfer at Completion.  In order to meet the conditions to Completion set forth in the Financial Certificate
attached as Appendix B-6 to the Completion Agreement, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower may either (i) direct the Collateral Agent pursuant to a duly delivered Withdrawal Certificate to
cause the Securities Intermediary to transfer amounts on deposit in the Equity Account or the Contingent Support
Account to the Debt Service Reserve Account in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (A) the aggregate
amount available for withdrawal therefrom and (B) the Debt Service Reserve Requirement or (ii) cause to be delivered
to the Collateral Agent Debt Service Reserve
40
Letters of Credit in an amount available to be drawn thereunder equal to the Debt Service Reserve Requirement.
(d)           Transfers from the Debt Service Reserve Account.
(i)            In the event that, at any time, the sum of (A) the balance in the Debt Service Reserve Account plus (B)
amounts available to be drawn on Debt Service Reserve Letters of Credit is in excess of the Debt Service Reserve
Requirement, the Borrower may either (1) direct the Collateral Agent to transfer funds from the Debt Service Reserve
Account to the Apex Metals Account or (2) request that the Collateral Agent consent to (and the Collateral Agent shall
consent to) a reduction in the undrawn face amount of such Debt Service Reserve Letters of Credit, but, in each case,
only to the extent of such excess.
(ii)           The Borrower shall direct the Collateral Agent to apply funds in the Debt Service Reserve Account to pay
Secured Debt Obligations that are then due and payable if and to the extent at any time there are no other funds
available in the Liquidity Accounts or the Bolivian Accounts (other than moneys in the Bolivian Insurance Account or
Bolivian Expropriation Account, which shall be utilized as specified in Sections 5.05 and 5.08, respectively) to pay
such Secured Debt Obligations.
(e)           Debt Service Reserve Letters of Credit
(i)            At any time, the Borrower may deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Collateral Agent Debt Service
Reserve Letters of Credit in an aggregate maximum amount available to be paid or drawn thereunder equal to all or
any portion of the then-current Debt Service Reserve Requirement.  Promptly following delivery of such Debt Service
Reserve Letters of Credit to the Collateral Agent in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the
Collateral Agent shall remit to such Person as directed by the Borrower as set forth in a Withdrawal Certificate of the
Borrower delivered contemporaneously with such Debt Service Reserve Letters of Credit, an amount from the Debt
Service Reserve Account equal to the lesser of (A) the maximum amount to be paid or drawn under such Debt
Service Reserve Letters of Credit and (B) the monies then held in the Debt Service Reserve Account (provided that
such remission does not result in the sum of the (1) amounts available to be drawn under Debt Service Reserve
Letters of Credit plus (2) the balance in the Debt Service Reserve Account being less than the Debt Service Reserve
Requirement), and such payment shall not constitute a Restricted Payment for purposes of the Financing
Documents.  In the event that with respect to any date on which a withdrawal is to be made from the Debt Service
Reserve Account as provided in Section 4.06(d)(ii), there would be insufficient funds on deposit in the Debt Service
Reserve Account to make such withdrawal (the amount of such insufficiency, an “Unfunded DSRA Deficiency”), the
Collateral Agent shall, on the date three Business Days prior to such date, deliver to the issuers of the Debt Service
Reserve Letters of Credit (ratably based on the aggregate amount
41
available for drawing thereunder) (A) drafts in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of the
Unfunded DSRA Deficiency and (2) the aggregate maximum amount available to be drawn under such Debt Service
Reserve Letters of Credit and (B) appropriate certificates with respect thereto in the form required by such Debt
Service Reserve Letters of Credit, and deposit the monies received from the issuers of such Debt Service Reserve
Letters of Credit in payment of such drafts in the Debt Service Reserve Account for application in accordance with
this Section 4.06.
(ii)           In the event that (A) a Debt Service Reserve Letter of Credit delivered to the Collateral Agent in respect of
the Debt Service Reserve Account has not been renewed, extended or replaced on or prior to the date fifteen days
prior to the expiration of such Debt Service Reserve Letter of Credit or (B) the Collateral Agent and the Borrower shall
receive from the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party an Officer’s Certificate of an Authorized Officer of
the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party stating that a Debt Service Reserve Letter of Credit does not
meet the Support Standards for a Debt Service Reserve Letter of Credit (and the reasons therefor), and such Debt
Service Reserve Letter of Credit has not been replaced by a replacement Debt Service Reserve Letter of Credit within
ten days after receipt by the Collateral Agent and the Borrower of such Officer’s Certificate, then the Collateral Agent
shall deliver to the issuer of such Debt Service Reserve Letter of Credit on such date (1) a draft in an amount equal to
the aggregate maximum amount available to be paid or drawn under such Debt Service Reserve Letter of Credit and
(2) an appropriate certificate with respect thereto in the form required by such Debt Service Reserve Letter of Credit. 
The Collateral Agent shall deposit the monies received from the issuer of such Debt Service Reserve Letter of Credit
in payment of such draft in the Debt Service Reserve Account to be applied in accordance with this Section 4.06.
4.07  Operating Reserve Account.
(a)           Operating Reserve Payments.
(i)            If, after Completion, there is an Operating Reserve Deficiency on any Reserve Payment Date, then on such
Reserve Payment Date the Borrower shall deliver a Withdrawal Certificate to the Collateral Agent instructing it to
transfer to the Operating Reserve Account, from funds (if any) available in the Apex Metals Account funds in an
amount equal to such Operating Reserve Deficiency (a “Operating Reserve Payment”).
(ii)           The Borrower shall give prompt notice to the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent if less than
100% of any Operating Reserve Payment due has been deposited in the Operating Reserve Account on or prior to the
applicable Reserve Payment Date.
42
(b)                                 Timing of Operating Reserve Payments.  The Borrower may make Operating
Reserve Payments at any time including to meet the conditions of Section 9.01(a).
(c)                                  Transfer at Completion.  In order to meet the conditions to Completion set forth in
the Financial Certificate attached as Appendix B-6 to the Completion Agreement, so long as no
Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may direct the Collateral
Agent pursuant to a duly delivered Withdrawal Certificate to cause the Securities Intermediary to
transfer amounts on deposit in the Equity Account or the Contingent Support Account to the
Operating Reserve Account in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (A) the aggregate
amount available for withdrawal therefrom and (B) the Operating Reserve Requirement.
(d)                                 Restrictions on Withdrawals.  No money shall be withdrawn from the Operating
Reserve Account under Section 4.04 or Section 4.05 unless at such time there remain no funds
on deposit in any other Liquidity Account.
4.08  Equity Account.
(a)                                  Transfers to Loan Proceeds Account.
(i)                                     On or Prior to the Commitment Termination Date.  On the Business Day
immediately prior to a Requested Disbursement Date, the Borrower shall direct the Collateral
Agent pursuant to a duly delivered Withdrawal Certificate to direct the Securities Intermediary to
withdraw from the Equity Account the amount specified as being the Base Equity Contribution
due to be made in connection with such Requested Disbursement Date as set out in the related
Notice of Disbursement and transfer such Base Equity Contribution to the Loan Proceeds
Account.
(ii)                                  Following the Commitment Termination Date.  On the Business Day
immediately prior to a Project Cost Funding Date, the Borrower shall direct the Collateral Agent
pursuant to a duly delivered Withdrawal Certificate to direct the Securities Intermediary to
withdraw from the Equity Account the amount specified as being the Base Equity Contribution
due to be made in connection with such Project Cost Funding Date as set out in the related
Notice of Project Costs and transfer such amount to the Loan Proceeds Account.
(b)                                 Completion.  In order to meet the conditions to Completion set forth in the
Financial Certificate attached as Appendix B-6 to the Completion Agreement, so long as no
Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may direct the Collateral
Agent pursuant to a duly delivered Withdrawal Certificate to transfer from the Equity Account
(i) first, to the Loan Proceeds Account the lesser of (A) the amount necessary to pay all remaining
costs incurred to achieve Completion which are not yet due and payable as set out in such
Financial Certificate delivered under the Completion Agreement and (B) the amount then on
deposit in the Equity Account, (ii) second, to the Debt Service Reserve Account the lesser of
(A) the amount of the Debt Service Reserve Requirement and (B) the amount then on deposit in
the Equity Account and (iii) third, to the Operating Reserve Account the lesser of (A) the amount
43
of the Operating Reserve Requirement and (B) the amount then on deposit in the Equity Account.  Any funds on
deposit after the transfers pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) in the preceding sentence shall be remitted as directed
by the Borrower (and such transfer shall not constitute a Restricted Payment hereunder).
(c)                                  Equity Support Letters of Credit.
(i)                                     At any time, the Borrower may deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the
Collateral Agent Equity Support Letters of Credit in an aggregate maximum amount available to
be drawn thereunder equal to all or any portion of the Remaining Equity Amount.  Promptly
following delivery of Equity Support Letters of Credit to the Collateral Agent in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence, the Collateral Agent shall remit to such Person as directed
by the Borrower as set forth in a Withdrawal Certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Borrower
delivered contemporaneously with such Equity Support Letters of Credit, an amount from the
Equity Account equal to the lesser of (A) the maximum amount to be paid or drawn under such
Equity Support Letters of Credit and (B) the monies then held in the Equity Account (provided that
such remission does not result in the sum of (x) the amounts available to be drawn under Equity
Support Letters of Credit plus (y) the balance in the Equity Account being less than the
Remaining Equity Amount), and such payment shall not constitute a Restricted Payment for
purposes of the Financing Documents.  In the event that with respect to any date on which a
withdrawal is to be made from the Equity Account as provided in Section 4.08(a) or 4.08(b), there
would be insufficient funds on deposit in the Equity Account to make such withdrawal (the
amount of such insufficiency, an “Equity Deficiency”), the Collateral Agent shall, on the date three
Business Days prior to such date, deliver to the issuers of the Equity Support Letters of Credit
(ratably based on the aggregate amount available for drawing thereunder) (A) drafts in an
aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of the Equity Deficiency and (2) the
aggregate maximum amount available to be drawn under such Equity Support Letters of Credit
and (B) appropriate certificates with respect thereto in the form required by such Equity Support
Letters of Credit, and deposit the monies received from the issuers of such Equity Support Letters
of Credit in payment of such demands for payment or drafts in the Equity Account for application

three Business Days prior to Completion, the Collateral Agent shall draw on the Equity Support
Letters of Credit and deposit such funds in the Equity Account.
(ii)                                  In the event that (A) an Equity Support Letter of Credit delivered to the Collateral
Agent in respect of the Equity Account has not been renewed, extended or replaced on or prior to
the date fifteen days prior to the expiration of such Equity Support Letter of Credit or (B) the
Collateral Agent and the Borrower shall receive from the Administrative Agent or any other
Secured Party an Officer’s Certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Administrative Agent or such
other Secured Party stating that an Equity Support Letter of Credit does not meet the Support
Standards for an Equity Support Letter of Credit (and the reasons
44
therefor), and such Equity Support Letter of Credit has not been replaced by a replacement Equity Support Letter of
Credit within fifteen days after receipt by the Collateral Agent and the Borrower of such Officer’s Certificate, then the
Collateral Agent shall deliver to the issuer of such Equity Support Letter of Credit on such date (1) a draft in an
amount equal to the aggregate maximum amount available to be paid or drawn under such Equity Support Letter of
Credit and (2) an appropriate certificate with respect thereto in the form required by such Equity Support Letter of
Credit.  The Collateral Agent shall deposit the monies received from the issuer of such Equity Support Letter of Credit
in payment of such draft in the Equity Account to be applied in accordance with this Section 4.08.
4.09  Contingent Support Account.
(a)                                  Transfers to Loan Proceeds Account.
(i)                                     Prior to the Commitment Termination Date.  On the Business Day immediately
prior to a Requested Disbursement Date, the Borrower shall direct the Collateral Agent pursuant
to a duly delivered Withdrawal Certificate to direct the Securities Intermediary to withdraw from
the Contingent Support Account the amount specified as being the Contingent Support
Contribution due to be made in connection with such Notice of Disbursement and transfer such
Contingent Support Contribution to the Loan Proceeds Account.
(ii)                                  Following the Commitment Termination Date.  On the Business Day
immediately prior to a Project Cost Funding Date, the Borrower shall direct the Collateral Agent
pursuant to a duly delivered Withdrawal Certificate to direct the Securities Intermediary to
withdraw from the Contingent Support Account the amount specified as being the Contingent
Support Contribution due to be made in connection with such Project Cost Funding Date as set
out in the related Notice of Project Costs and transfer such Contingent Support Contribution to
the Loan Proceeds Account.
(b)                                 Completion.  In order to meet the conditions to Completion set forth in the
Financial Certificate attached as Appendix B-6 to the Completion Agreement, so long as no
Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may direct the Collateral
Agent pursuant to a duly delivered Withdrawal Certificate to transfer from the Contingent Support
Account (after making all transfers from the Liquidity Accounts and the Equity Account) (i) first, to
the Apex Metals Account the lesser of (A) the amount necessary to pay all remaining costs
incurred to achieve Completion which are not yet due and payable as set out in such Financial
Certificate delivered under the Completion Agreement and (B) the amount then on deposit in the
Contingent Support Account, (ii) second, to the Debt Service Reserve Account the lesser of

the Contingent Support Account and (iii) third, to the Operating Reserve Account the lesser of
(A) the amount of the Operating Reserve Requirement and (B) the amount then on deposit in the
Contingent Support Account.  Any funds on deposit after the transfers pursuant to clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) in the preceding sentence shall be remitted to as directed by the
45
Borrower pursuant to a duly delivered Withdrawal Certificate (and such transfer shall not constitute a Restricted
Payment hereunder).
(c)                                  Contingent Support Letters of Credit.
(i)                                     At any time, the Borrower may deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the
Collateral Agent Contingent Support Letters of Credit in an aggregate maximum amount
available to be drawn thereunder equal to all or any portion of the Contingent Support
Requirement.  Promptly following delivery of Contingent Support Letters of Credit to the
Collateral Agent in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the Collateral Agent
shall remit to such Person as directed by the Borrower as set forth in a Withdrawal Certificate of
the Borrower delivered contemporaneously with such Contingent Support Letters of Credit, an
amount from the Contingent Support Account equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum amount to be
paid or drawn under such Contingent Support Letters of Credit and (ii) the monies then held in
the Contingent Support Account (provided that such remission does not result in the sum of the
(x) amounts available to be drawn under Contingent Support Letters of Credit plus (y) the
balance in the Contingent Support Account being less than the greater of (1) the Contingent
Support Amount and (2) the sum of (x) the maximum amount to be paid or drawn under
Contingent Support Letters of Credit outstanding immediately prior to the posting of such new
Contingent Support Letter of Credit and (ii) the monies held in the Contingent Support Account
immediately prior to the posting of such new Contingent Support Letter of Credit), and such
payment shall not constitute a Restricted Payment for purposes of the Financing Documents.  In
the event that with respect to any date on which a withdrawal is to be made from the Contingent
Support Account as provided in Section 4.09(a) or 4.09(b), there would be insufficient funds on
deposit in the Contingent Support Account to make such withdrawal (the amount of such
insufficiency, a “Contingent Support Shortfall”), the Collateral Agent shall, on the date three
Business Days prior to such date, deliver to the issuers of the Contingent Support Letters of
Credit (ratably based on the aggregate amount available for drawing thereunder) (A) drafts in an
aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of the Contingent Support Shortfall and
(2) the aggregate maximum amount available to be drawn under such Contingent Support Letters
of Credit and (B) appropriate certificates with respect thereto in the form required by such
Contingent Support Letters of Credit, and deposit the monies received from the issuers of such
Contingent Support Letters of Credit in payment of such demands for payment or drafts in the
Contingent Support Account for application in accordance with this Section 4.09.
(ii)                                  In the event that (A) a Contingent Support Letter of Credit delivered to the
Collateral Agent in respect of the Contingent Support Account has not been renewed, extended
or replaced on or prior to the date fifteen days prior to the expiration of such Contingent Support
Letter of Credit or (B) the Collateral Agent and the Borrower shall receive from the Administrative
Agent or any other Secured Party an Officer’s Certificate of an Authorized Officer of the
46
Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party stating that a Contingent Support Letter of Credit does not meet the
Support Standards for a Contingent Support Letter of Credit (and the reasons therefor), and such Contingent Support
Letter of Credit has not been replaced by a replacement Contingent Support Letter of Credit within fifteen days after
receipt by the Collateral Agent and the Borrower of such Officer’s Certificate, then the Collateral Agent shall deliver to
the issuer of such Contingent Support Letter of Credit on such date (1) a draft in an amount equal to the aggregate
maximum amount available to be paid or drawn under such Contingent Support Letter of Credit and (2) an appropriate
certificate with respect thereto in the form required by such Contingent Support Letter of Credit.  The Collateral Agent
shall deposit the monies received from the issuer of such Contingent Support Letter of Credit in payment of such draft
in the Contingent Support Account to be applied in accordance with this Section 4.09.
(d)                                 All Withdrawals.  The Borrower shall not direct the Collateral Agent to direct the
Securities Intermediary to make any transfers from the Contingent Support Account other than
pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 4.09, notwithstanding there being any amounts on
deposit in the Contingent Support Account (or amounts available under Contingent Support
Letters of Credit) in excess of the Contingent Support Requirement.

Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent (for delivery to each other Secured Party), no later
than 20 days after the end of each month following the initial drawdown of Senior Loans, copies
of the account statements for all Accounts for such month prepared or compiled by the Securities
Intermediary.  Such account statements shall indicate, with respect to each such Account
deposits and withdrawals, investments made and closing balances.
(b)                                 Each time the Borrower directs that a transfer or withdrawal be made from a New

INSURANCE AND EXPROPRIATION
5.01  Maintenance of Insurance.
(a)                                  On or prior to the Closing Date and until this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 15.01, the Borrower shall at all times keep all of its property of an
insurable nature and of a character usually insured, insured with insurers of good repute selected
by it, against such risks, with such coverage (including deductibles and exclusions) and in such
form and amounts as are customary and reasonable for mines and mining facilities of similar type
and scale, taking into account the current availability and cost of such coverage.  Without limiting
the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, the Borrower shall, to the extent permitted
by Bolivian law, obtain and maintain in effect the coverage set forth in the schedule of minimum
insurance requirements set forth in Appendix C-1 (the “Schedule of Minimum Insurance
Requirements”).  The Borrower agrees that the insurance set forth in the Schedule of Minimum
Insurance Requirements shall be (a) denominated in Dollars, (b) except for the Other Local
Policies, reinsurance shall be obtained for all such insurance placed with insurers in Bolivia with
non-Bolivian reinsurers of international standing with a minimum rating of at least “A-” from S&P
or an equivalent rating from Moody’s or A.M. Best or, if not so rated, acceptable to the Majority
Secured Parties and (c) except for the Other Local Policies, placed with Bolivian insurers
reasonably acceptable to the Majority Secured Parties or, if permitted by Bolivian law, placed
directly with non-Bolivian insurers of international standing with a minimum rating of at least “A-”
from S&P or an equivalent rating from Moody’s or A.M. Best (the requirement set forth in clause
(c) is hereinafter referred to as the “Minimum Insurer Credit Requirements”).  The Schedule of
Minimum Insurance Requirements may be amended by the Borrower with the consent of the
Majority Secured Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that the
Majority Secured Parties’ consent shall not be required to the extent such amendment updates
the Schedule of Minimum Insurance Requirements to (i) delete any Other Local Policy to the
extent it is no longer required by applicable law or (ii) as appropriate in light of any changes to
the Construction Budget or the Operating Plan that have been accepted pursuant to
Section 8.14.  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each
other Secured Party of any proposed modification of the Schedule of Minimum
48
Insurance Requirements regardless of whether or not such modification requires the consent of the Majority Secured
Parties.
(b)                                 As of the Initial Disbursement Date, the Borrower has no Non-Bolivian Policies.
5.02  Lender Provisions in Policies of Insurance.  The Borrower shall cause each insurer to include in each insurance
policy issued to the Borrower (other than the Other Local Policies), provisions addressing the matters set forth in
Appendix C-2 attached hereto.
5.03  Payment, Etc. of Reinsurance.  The Borrower shall cause (a) on or before the Initial Disbursement Date all of its
insurers in Bolivia (other than insurers under the Other Local Policies) and their reinsurers and (b) after the Initial
Disbursement Date any reinsurers that become bound by a treaty of reinsurance in respect to any of the insurance
policies issued to the Borrower, to agree to assign the reinsurance policies to the Collateral Agent and cause such
reinsurers to execute a consent to such assignment substantially in the form attached to the “Deed of Assignment”
which is attached as Appendix C-4.
5.04  Payment of Premiums.  The Borrower shall pay all premiums and other sums payable in respect of its insurance
when due.
5.05  Application of Insurance Proceeds.  To the extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise provided
in an Enforcement Direction, proceeds of insurance or reinsurance shall be applied as set forth in this Section 5.05.
(a)                                  Any sum paid in settlement of any third party liability or worker’s compensation
shall be paid to the Person to whom the liability shall have been incurred or, if such liability shall
have been previously paid by the insured party, to or to the order of the insured party and if such
insured party is the Borrower, such sum shall be paid to the Apex Metals Account or, to the extent
required by applicable law or paid pursuant to an Other Local Policy, the Expense Account.
(b)                                 Proceeds from any delay in startup or business interruption insurance (or
reinsurance) shall be deposited in the Apex Metals Account or, to the extent required by
applicable law, the Expense Account and will be applied as provided for other withdrawals from
such Accounts.
(c)                                  Except as provided in subclauses (i) and (ii) below and except as provided in
clause (d) of this Section 5.05 with respect to proceeds from any Other Local Policy, all proceeds
from property insurance and reinsurance shall be deposited in the Apex Metals Account;
provided that (i) any proceeds denominated in Bolivianos when received and (ii) any proceeds
originating, paid or received in Bolivia and not permitted under applicable law to be paid directly
to a New York Account, shall be deposited (following conversion, if necessary, of the relevant
amount into a corresponding Dollar or Boliviano amount) in the Expense Account, subject to
Section 4.01(j), and will be applied as provided for other withdrawals from such Accounts.
49
(i)                                     If the Borrower shall have suffered a single loss or related series of losses to
Project Property that it reasonably expects to cost in excess of $5 million but not more than
$25 million to repair or replace, then such proceeds of insurance relating to such loss or losses
shall be deposited in the Insurance Proceeds Account (or, if deposited in the Apex Metals
Account, promptly transferred to the Insurance Proceeds Account in accordance with a
Withdrawal Certificate issued by the Borrower), or to the extent required by applicable law or if
such proceeds are denominated in Bolivianos, in a segregated Bolivian Account (a “Bolivian
Insurance Account”, and together with the Insurance Proceeds Account, the “Insurance Account”)
established at such time with a Local Bank in respect of which the Borrower shall use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly convert such proceeds into Dollars and pay the Dollar
proceeds thereof to the Apex Metals Account.  Such insurance proceeds shall be applied to
repair or replace the damaged or lost Project Property unless, if the Borrower desires to apply
less than 100% of such proceeds to repair or replace the affected Project Property, the Borrower
delivers, within 30 days of receipt of proceeds into the Insurance Account which it desires to
apply to another purpose, a restoration plan to the Technical Agent, the Administrative Agent and
the Independent Engineer detailing the sources and uses of funds for repairing or replacing the
affected Project Property and certifying to the Secured Parties that (A) such proceeds are not
then required to repair or replace the affected property because (x) sufficient funds remain in the
Insurance Account to pay for such repair or replacement, (y) such repair or replacement has
already been made and paid for or (z) the affected property was or has become obsolete or
superfluous and such repair or replacement is not necessary for the construction of the Project in
accordance with the Project Description and the Construction Budget and the operation of the
Project in accordance with the Operating Plan and (B) if such application of insurance proceeds
is to occur after Mechanical Completion, after the proposed application of such proceeds and
after giving effect to such restoration plan, the Project would have unit operating costs and
production levels substantially similar in all material respects to those unit operating costs and
production levels that would be applicable but for the casualty.  The Technical Agent and the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of their receipt of such plan.  If after receipt of such
plan and following review by the Independent Engineer, the Technical Agent and the
Administrative Agent and following consultation with the Borrower, the Majority Secured Parties,
in the exercise of their reasonable judgment, determine that the implementation of such plan
could not reasonably be expected to satisfy the foregoing conditions, such proceeds will be
applied in their entirety (or such lesser extent actually required) to repair or replace the affected
Project Property.  Otherwise, such proceeds may be applied from the Insurance Account in
accordance with, and at the times specified by, such restoration plan and the Borrower may
transfer (in the case of a transfer from the Bolivian Insurance Account, to the extent permitted by
applicable law) any excess proceeds to the Apex Metals Account.  Any certificate delivered by
the Borrower under this clause (i) shall state in reasonable detail the basis for such
determination.
50
(ii)                                  If the Borrower shall have suffered a single loss or related series of losses to
Project Property that it reasonably expects to cost in excess of $25 million to repair or replace,
then such proceeds of insurance relating to such loss or losses will be deposited in the Insurance
Proceeds Account (or, if deposited in the Apex Metals Account, promptly transferred to the
Insurance Proceeds Account in accordance with a Withdrawal Certificate issued by the
Borrower), or to the extent required by applicable law or if such proceeds are denominated in
Bolivianos, in a Bolivian Insurance Account from which the Borrower shall use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly convert such insurance proceeds into Dollars and pay the Dollar
proceeds thereof to the Insurance Proceeds Account.  Within 30 days of the receipt of the first
proceeds to be received in respect of such loss or series of losses, the Borrower shall deliver to
the Technical Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Independent Engineer a plan for the
repair, replacement or restoration of the affected Project Property.  The Independent Engineer,
the Technical Agent and the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower upon the receipt of
such plan and shall review such plan in consultation with the Borrower and, following such
review, shall submit such plan to the Secured Parties for their approval, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. In making a determination as to whether to approve a
restoration plan, the Secured Parties shall consider among other things, whether, after
implementation of the Borrower’s plan, the Borrower would be able to pay Secured Debt
Obligations as and when they fall due.  In the event that the Majority Secured Parties approve
such plan and no Event of Default has then occurred and remains outstanding, the Borrower
shall be entitled to apply such proceeds as set out in such plan subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.  In the event that such plan is not approved by the Majority Secured
Parties, then the Majority Secured Parties shall have the right to require that such insurance
proceeds be applied (in the case of insurance proceeds held in the Bolivian Insurance Account,
to the extent permitted by applicable law) to prepay Senior Loans in accordance with
Section 2.04, provided that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and an
Enforcement Direction has been issued directing the application of such proceeds in accordance
with Section 10.04, then such proceeds shall be applied in accordance with Section 10.04.
(d)                                 Proceeds from an Other Local Policy (except sums paid in settlement of any third
party or worker’s compensation liability, which shall be deposited as provided in clause (a) of this
Section 5.05) shall be deposited in the Expense Account, and, if such proceeds are proceeds
from property insurance and reinsurance, such proceeds shall be applied to repair or replace the
damaged or lost Project Property, as applicable, or, if the Borrower desires to apply less than
100% of such proceeds for these purposes, the excess shall be applied as provided for other
withdrawals from such accounts.
5.06  Information.
(a)                                  At least 90 days prior to the renewal or replacement of any insurance policy
required by Section 5.01, the Borrower shall undertake a review of the insurance market, and, to
the extent it believes it will not be able to comply with any item on the existing Schedule
51
of Minimum Insurance Requirements, it shall promptly inform the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent (who
shall promptly inform the Secured Parties), together with an explanation therefor.
(b)                                 Promptly following receipt of any certificate of insurance, insurance binder or
broker’s undertaking letter, as the case may be, in respect of renewal or replacement of any
insurance policy or reinsurance policy, or any new insurance or reinsurance policy, required to
be maintained by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.01, the Borrower shall deliver a copy
thereof to the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent.
(c)                                  The Borrower shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent and the Administrative
Agent (who shall promptly notify the Secured Parties) of (i) any material dispute with an insurer or
reinsurer, (ii) the non-payment of any premium when due, (iii) failure, for any reason, to maintain
in full force and effect the minimum insurance coverage required to be maintained in accordance
with Section 5.01, (iv) any reduction in any insurance coverage or any other material amendment
or proposed amendment to any policy required to be maintained by the Borrower in accordance
with Section 5.01, (v) the cancellation or termination prior to its stated term of any policy in
respect of the coverage required to be maintained by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.01,
(vi) any claim under any of its insurance policies which is equal to or in excess of $1,000,000 and
(vii) any other information relating to the Borrower’s insurance or reinsurance that may be
reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or the Insurance Advisor.
5.07  Insurance Advisor.  The Majority Secured Parties shall have the right to appoint an Insurance Advisor, subject,
so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, to the prior approval by the Borrower (which approval may not
be unreasonably withheld), of the identity of such consultant and the terms of its appointment, including fee
arrangements and the scope of its work, provided that in the event that the Borrower has not objected to such
appointment within 10 days of notification, such appointment shall become final and effective at the expiration of such
10-day period.  The Borrower shall pay or reimburse the Secured Parties for the reasonable and documented fees and
expenses of the Insurance Advisor in connection with (i) any request by the Borrower for a waiver of, or amendment
to, the requirements of the Schedule of Minimum Insurance Requirements, (ii) review of information provided by the
Borrower to the Collateral Agent under Sections 5.05 and 5.06, (iii) initial review of information, insurance plan and
schedules in connection with the negotiation of the documentation and the closing of the Senior Loan Facilities, and
(iv) the review of such renewal and replacement policies of insurance and reinsurance and other insurance documents
relating to the Project as may be reasonably requested at any time by the Majority Secured Parties.
5.08  Expropriation Compensation.
(a)                                  None of the Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Sweden or Apex Luxembourg shall
(i) voluntarily enter into or accept any settlement for Expropriation Compensation or Project
Equity Expropriation Compensation if the aggregate amount of the proposed Expropriation
Compensation or Project Equity Expropriation Compensation, as the case may be, to be
received is less than the Secured Debt Obligations then outstanding or (ii) reject any settlement
offered without, in each case, having first received the consent of each of the Secured
52
Parties and the PRI Insurers.  Each of the Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Sweden and Apex Luxembourg shall notify
the Secured Parties and PRI Insurers not more than 30 days after receiving the terms of such settlement offer, and
the Secured Parties and the PRI Insurers shall agree to accept or reject such settlement within 45 days following
receipt of such notice (or, if disclosed to the Secured Parties, such shorter period as may be required by the terms of
such settlement offer, but in no event less than 30 days).
(b)                                 In the event of the expropriation (including the deprivation of rights) of Project
Property or Borrower Shares or Subordinated Debt, each of the Borrower, Apex Sweden, Apex
Metals and Apex Luxembourg, as applicable, shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain promptly
the full amount of Expropriation Compensation and Project Equity Expropriation Compensation
to which it may be entitled under applicable law.  Each of the Borrower, Apex Sweden, Apex
Metals and Apex Luxembourg agrees to inform and consult with the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties regarding the status of discussions with or proceedings
against Bolivia or any expropriating authority thereof.
(c)                                  Subject to applicable law, Expropriation Compensation in respect of Project
Property shall be paid to the Expropriation Account and applied as provided for other
withdrawals from the Accounts, in each case except as provided below.
(i)                                     If the aggregate amount of Expropriation Compensation (except Expropriation
Compensation arising from expropriation of all or substantially all of the Mining Concessions or
the Borrower’s rights thereunder, which is addressed in clause (iii) of this Section 5.08(c)) for a
single loss or related series of losses exceeds $5 million but does not exceed $25 million, such
proceeds shall be deposited in the Expropriation Proceeds Account or, if in Bolivianos, in a
segregated Bolivian Account (such account, the “Bolivian Expropriation Account” and, together
with the Expropriation Proceeds Account, the “Expropriation Account”) established at such time
with a Local Bank in respect of which the Borrower shall use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly convert such Expropriation Compensation to Dollars and pay the Dollar proceeds
thereof to the Expropriation Proceeds Account.  Such Expropriation Compensation (including the
proceeds of any conversion and transfer of such Expropriation Compensation to the
Expropriation Proceeds Account) shall be applied to replace the expropriated Project Property
unless, if the Borrower desires to apply less than 100% of such proceeds to repair or replace the
affected Project Property, the Borrower delivers, within 30 days of receipt of Expropriation
Compensation into the Expropriation Account which it desires to apply to another purpose, a
restoration plan to the Technical Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Independent Engineer
detailing the sources and uses of funds for repairing or replacing the affected Project Property
and certifying to the Secured Parties that (A) such Expropriation Compensation is not then
required to repair or replace the affected property because (x) sufficient funds remain in the
Expropriation Account to pay for such repair or replacement, (y) such repair or replacement has
already been made and paid for or (z) the affected property was or has become obsolete or
superfluous and such repair or replacement is not necessary for the construction of the Project in
accordance with the Project Description and the
53
Construction Budget and the operation of the Project in accordance with the Operating Plan and (B) if such application
of Expropriation Compensation is to occur after Mechanical Completion, after the proposed application of such
Expropriation Compensation and after giving effect to such restoration plan, the Project would have unit operating
costs and production levels substantially similar in all material respects to those unit operating costs and production
levels that would be applicable but for the expropriation.  The Technical Agent and the Administrative Agent shall
notify the Borrower of their receipt of such plan.  If after receipt of such plan and following review by the Independent
Engineer, the Technical Agent and the Administrative Agent and following consultation with the Borrower, the Majority
Secured Parties, in the exercise of their reasonable judgment, determine that the implementation of such plan could
not reasonably be expected to satisfy the foregoing conditions, such Expropriation Compensation will be applied in
their entirety (or such lesser extent actually required) to repair or replace the affected Project Property.  Otherwise,
such Expropriation Compensation may be applied from the Expropriation Account in accordance with, and at the
times specified by, such restoration plan and the Borrower may transfer (in the case of a transfer from the Bolivian
Expropriation Account, to the extent permitted by applicable law) any excess proceeds to the Apex Metals Account. 
Any certificate delivered by the Borrower under this clause (i) shall state in reasonable detail the basis for such
determination.
(ii)                                  If the aggregate amount of Expropriation Compensation (except Expropriation
Compensation arising from expropriation of all or substantially all of the Borrower’s rights under
the Mining Concessions, which is addressed in clause (iii) of this Section 5.08(c)) for a single
loss or related series of losses exceeds $25 million, then such Expropriation Compensation shall
be deposited in the Expropriation Proceeds Account or, to the extent required by applicable law
or if such proceeds are denominated in Bolivianos, in a Bolivian Expropriation Account from
which the Borrower shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly convert such Expropriation
Compensation into Dollars and pay the Dollar proceeds there of to the Expropriation Proceeds
Account.  Within 30 days of the receipt of the first Expropriation Compensation to be received in
respect of such loss or series of losses, the Borrower shall deliver to the Technical Agent, the
Administrative Agent and the Independent Engineer a plan for the repair, replacement or
restoration of the affected Project Property.  The Independent Engineer, the Technical Agent and
the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower upon receipt of such plan and shall review
such plan in consultation with the Borrower and, following such review, shall submit such plan to
the Secured Parties for their approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
In making a determination as to whether to approve a restoration plan, the Secured Parties shall
consider among other things, whether, after implementation of the Borrower’s plan, the Borrower
would be able to pay Secured Debt Obligations as and when they fall due.  In the event that the
Majority Secured Parties approve such plan and no Event of Default has then occurred and
remains outstanding, the Borrower shall be entitled to apply such Expropriation Compensation
as set out in such plan subject to the terms and
54
conditions of this Agreement.  In the event that the Borrower does not deliver a plan or such plan is not approved by
the Majority Secured Parties, then the Majority Secured Parties shall have the right to require that such Expropriation
Compensation be applied (in the case of Expropriation Compensation held in the Bolivian Expropriation Account, to
the extent permitted by applicable law) to prepay Senior Loans in accordance with Section 2.04, provided that if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and an Enforcement Direction has been issued, then such proceeds
shall be applied in accordance with Section 10.04.
(iii)                               If the Expropriation Compensation arises from expropriation of all or substantially
all of the Borrower’s rights under the Mining Concessions, such Expropriation Compensation
proceeds shall be applied to prepay the Secured Debt Obligations in accordance with
Section 10.04.  The Administrative Agent shall direct the Collateral Agent to apply such
prepayments in the manner in which each Secured Party indicates by written notice to the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Borrower at least 5 Business Days prior to
such prepayment.
(d)                                 Project Equity Expropriation Compensation received by Apex Luxembourg,
Apex Sweden or any Affiliate of any thereof shall be paid as provided in Section 3.07.

respects as contemplated by the Construction Budget and Operating Plan then in effect and
(II) the performance by the Borrower of its obligations under the Project Documents, in each case,
with respect to (A), (B), (D) and (E) above, other than those which (x) are not now necessary and
which are expected to be obtained in the ordinary course of business by the time they are
necessary (and which are listed in Part B of Appendix E-2) or (y) the failure to have or obtain

(f)                                    No Conflicts.  The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of each
of the Transaction Documents to which it is or is intended to be a party and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not (i) violate any provision of its
Organizational Documents, any Authorization, any Government Rule or any Government
Approval applicable to the Project or the Borrower; (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or
constitute a default under any Transaction Document or any indenture or loan or credit
agreement to which the Borrower is a party or by which it or its property may be bound or affected
in any material respect; or (iii) result in, or create any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon or
with respect to any of the properties now owned or hereafter acquired by the Borrower.

the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against, or affecting the Borrower or any of its
properties before or by any Governmental Authority or before any arbitrator other than those
which have been disclosed in writing to the Senior Lenders on or prior to the date hereof or which
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  There is no existing
default by the Borrower under any applicable order, writ, injunction or decree or other decision of
any Governmental Authority or any arbitrator.
(h)                                 Project Information.  As of the date hereof and the Initial Disbursement Date, the
Project Information (including known mineable reserves information) and other information
provided by or on behalf of the Borrower in writing to the Senior Lenders or the PRI Insurers (as
may have been superseded, modified or corrected by later information provided in writing by or
on behalf of the Borrower in accordance with the Transaction Documents) does not contain any
material misrepresentation or misstatement (or omit any material fact or circumstance necessary
in order to make the information contained therein not misleading); provided that, the Borrower’s
sole representation with respect to projections, estimates or other expressions of view as to future
circumstances set out in the Project Information shall be that such projections, estimates or other
expressions of view as to future circumstances (i) were prepared in good faith and with due care
and (ii) were based on reasonable assumptions as to all factual and legal matters material to the
estimates therein as of their respective date(s) of delivery.
62
(i)                                     No Immunity.  The Borrower is subject to civil and commercial law with respect
to its obligations under each of the Financing Documents to which it is a party.  The execution,
delivery and performance by the Borrower of each of the Financing Documents to which it is a
party constitute private and commercial acts rather than public or governmental acts.  Neither the
Borrower, nor any of the Project Properties, is entitled to any right of immunity in any jurisdiction
from suit, court jurisdiction, judgment, attachment (whether before or after judgment), set-off or
execution of a judgment or from any other legal process or remedy relating to the obligations of
the Borrower under any of the Financing Documents to which it is a party.
(j)                                     Title to Properties; Security Interests.  Except as noted in the legal opinions
delivered in satisfaction of the conditions precedent referred to in clause (h) of Section 11.02, the
Borrower has good, legal and valid title to (or, in the case of any leased premises, easement
properties or licensed property, valid leasehold, easement or license interests in) all real and
personal property and all rights, tangible or intangible (including Intellectual Property Rights and
Other Property Rights), required for the construction and operation of the Project substantially as
contemplated by the Construction Budget and Operating Plan then in effect; and there are no
Liens of any nature against such Properties or rights (other than Permitted Liens).  To the extent
provided in Article III, except as noted in the legal opinions delivered in satisfaction of the
conditions precedent referred to in clause (h) of Section 11.02, each Security Document, when
executed and delivered as contemplated hereby, will create each Lien purported to be created
thereby.  To the extent provided in Article III, except as noted in the legal opinions delivered in
satisfaction of the conditions precedent referred to in clause (h) of Section 11.02, each such Lien
will be valid and legally binding, and will constitute, under applicable law, fully perfected first and
prior security interests or assignments of rights, superior in right to any other Liens and interests
(other than Permitted Liens referenced in Sections 8.20(b), (c), (d), and, if applicable (e) and (f)  to
the extent such Liens are granted priority on a mandatory basis under applicable Government
Rules) and enforceable against the grantor of such security interests, any trustee in bankruptcy or
equivalent and any attaching creditor or third party.
(k)                                  Taxes.  The Borrower has filed or caused to be filed all tax returns required to be
filed by it, and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns, or on any
assessments made against it or any of its properties, and all other taxes, assessments, fees,
liabilities or other charges imposed on it or on its properties by any Governmental Authority, in
each case after giving effect to any applicable extensions, except for any such taxes,
assessments, fees, liabilities or other charges (i) the payment of which is being contested in good
faith and by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves are being maintained in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and Applicable Accounting Principles or (ii) the failure of which to
file or pay could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  As of the date
hereof, there are no material disputes pending or, to its knowledge, threatened, between the
Borrower and any Governmental Authority relating to taxes.
(l)                                     Withholding and Other Taxes.  No income or other taxes or levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, compulsory loans or withholdings whatsoever are or will
63
be, under applicable Bolivian law as at the date of this Agreement, imposed, assessed, levied or collected by Bolivia
or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein on or in respect of (i) principal, interest or
commissions payable to the Senior Lenders as of the date hereof under this Agreement, except for withholding taxes
on payments of interest on the Senior Loans at a rate of 12.5% and (ii) premia payable under the PRI Policies.
(m)                               Ranking.  The obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and in respect of
the Senior Loans and under the Hedge Guaranty, will at all times rank (i) in right of payment and
of collateral security, senior to the obligations of the Borrower in respect of the Subordinated Debt
and (ii) pari passu in right of payment with or senior in right of payment to, and senior in right of
collateral security to, all other obligations of the Borrower other than those obligations which are
granted priority on a mandatory basis under Bolivian law.
(n)                                 No Event of Default or Material Adverse Effect.  No Default or Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing.  No event, circumstance or condition has occurred that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(o)                                 Transaction Documents.
(i)                                     The Transaction Documents constitute and include all contracts and
agreements to which the Borrower is a party other than those providing for immaterial services,
materials or rights.  All Project Documents to which the Borrower is a party on the Closing Date
are listed on Schedule 7.01(o)(i).  All Third Party Concentrate Sales Agreements to which Apex
Metals is a party on the Closing Date are listed on Schedule 7.01(o)(i).
(ii)                                  There are no material services, materials or rights (other than Government
Approvals and Authorizations) required for the current stage of the development, financing,
construction, operation and ownership of the Project other than those granted by, or to be
provided to the Borrower pursuant to, the Transaction Documents.
(iii)                               Except as permitted pursuant to Section 8.11 hereof, none of the Material Project
Documents have been amended, modified or supplemented, and all of the Financing Documents
and Material Project Documents are in full force and effect and have not been terminated,
suspended or rescinded by any party thereto.
(iv)                              All conditions precedent to the obligations of the respective parties under the
Material Project Documents have been satisfied or waived except for such conditions precedent
which need not or cannot be satisfied until a later stage of development, financing, construction,
operation and ownership of the Project, and the Borrower has no reason to believe that any such
condition precedent cannot be satisfied on or prior to the commencement of the appropriate stage
of development, financing, construction, operation and ownership of the Project,
64
except as otherwise disclosed to the Secured Parties in writing prior to the date hereof.
(v)                                 The Borrower is not in default in the performance of any covenant or obligation
set forth in or otherwise in default under any Project Document, which default could reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  To the Borrower’s knowledge, there has been
no default by any Material Project Counterparty under, and no Event of Force Majeure has
occurred under, any Material Project Document, which in either case could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
(vi)                              The copies of the Material Project Documents and the Financing Documents and
of any amendments to any of the foregoing provided or to be provided by the Borrower to the
Collateral Agent prior to or on the date of execution of this Agreement are, or when delivered will
be, true and complete copies of such agreements and documents and each of such agreements
heretofore provided is, and all such agreements and documents will, at the date of execution of
this Agreement, be in full force and effect.
(vii)                           All letters of credit, performance bonds and other types of performance security
issued in favor of the Borrower or Apex Metals under any Project Document or any Third Party
Concentrate Sales Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date are listed on Schedule 7.01(o)(vii).

Government Rules, which are addressed in the immediately succeeding paragraph) and
Government Approvals (other than environmental Government Approvals, which are addressed
in the immediately succeeding paragraph), except where failure to so comply, individually or in

Transactions with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit or Support Terrorism
(66 Fed. Reg. 49, 079 (2001) (the “Anti-Terrorism Order”) and the provisions of Public Law 107-
56 (the “USA Patriot Act”).
(q)                                 Environmental Matters.
(i)                                     The development, construction and operation of the Project and the activities
and properties of the Borrower are in compliance (A) in all material respects with (1) the
Environmental Guidelines, (2) all applicable Environmental Laws and (3) all environmental
Government Approvals and (B) with all anti-corruption Government Rules in force in Bolivia, the
United States and Switzerland.  The Borrower has designed the Project in compliance in all
material respects with the Environmental Guidelines.

written complaints have been filed, no penalty has been assessed and, to the Borrower’s
knowledge, no investigation or review is pending or threatened by any Governmental Authority or
other Person with respect to any alleged failure by the Borrower to have any material
environmental Government Approval, to comply with any applicable Environmental Law or to
comply with any anti-corruption Government Rule.
(r)                                    Financial Condition.  The financial statements of the Borrower delivered in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement are true, complete and correct and fairly
present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the Borrower
as at the end of, and for, such fiscal year or each fiscal quarter, as the case may be, in
accordance with Applicable Accounting Principles consistently applied (subject, in the case of
quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of notes).  The
Borrower does not have as of the date of such financial statements any material contingent
liabilities, liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments or unrealized or
anticipated losses from any unfavorable commitments required to be included or noted in
financial statements prepared in accordance with Applicable Accounting Principles except (i) as
referred to or reflected or provided for in such financial statement or, in the case of the financial
statements delivered pursuant to Section 11.01(h), as arising solely from the execution and
delivery of the Financing Documents or (ii) as notified in writing to the Administrative Agent
concurrently with the delivery of such financial statements.  There has been no material adverse
change in the business, assets, operations or condition, financial or otherwise, of the Borrower

compliance with the Initial Operating Plan, Initial Construction Budget or Initial Financial Model,
respectively, it shall promptly notify the Technical Agent and the Borrower of the reasons for such
determination, and the Technical Agent shall submit such updated Operating Plan, updated
Construction Budget or updated Financial Model, as the case may be, for approval by the
Majority Secured Parties.  If the Majority Secured Parties approve such updated Operating Plan,
updated Construction Budget or updated Financial Model, as the case may be, the Technical
Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such approval.  If the
Borrower is notified by the Technical Agent that its updated Financial Model, updated
Construction Budget or updated Operating Plan, as the case may be, has not been approved by
the Majority Secured Parties, the Borrower shall, within ten (10) Business Days and after
consultation with the Technical Agent as to the reasons for such rejection, submit an
appropriately revised Financial Model, Construction Budget and/or Operating Plan, as the case
may be. Following such resubmission, the process described in the foregoing clause (i) shall be
repeated until a Financial Model, Construction Budget and Operating Plan have been accepted
as provided therein.  To the extent that a calendar year commences without a Financial Model,
Construction Budget and/or Operating Plan having been approved in accordance with this

Plan, as applicable, shall remain in effect until a revised Financial Model, Construction Budget
and/or Operating Plan, as applicable, shall have been approved.

required to be subordinated pursuant to the terms hereof.  The Borrower shall cause all of its
Affiliates to whom it owes Indebtedness for Borrowed Money to agree to be bound by the

made on such Principal Repayment Date, together, in either case, with calculations in
reasonable detail demonstrating the Borrower’s compliance with this Section 9.02.  Failure of the
Borrower to provide such Withdrawal Certificate shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
make a Cash Sweep Prepayment.  In the event that the Borrower has failed to deliver a
Withdrawal Certificate as required by this Section 9.02(c), the Administrative Agent shall
calculate the amount of the Cash Sweep Prepayment and instruct the Collateral Agent to
disburse such Cash Sweep Prepayment.  The Administrative Agent’s calculation shall be final

authorizes (i) BNP Paribas as the Administrative Agent to act as its agent hereunder, under the

Hedge Bank as any other Senior Lender or Hedge Bank and may exercise the same as though it
were not the Administrative Agent or the Technical Agent, as applicable, and such bank and its
affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business
with the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent or the
Technical Agent, as applicable, hereunder.
12.02  Limitation of Liability.

obligations except those expressly set forth herein, in the other Financing Documents to which it
is a party and, with respect to the Administrative Agent, the PRI Policies.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing (i) neither the Administrative Agent nor the Technical
108
Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, (ii) neither the Administrative Agent nor the Technical Agent shall have any duty to
take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly

action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the requisite Secured Parties as specified in the
applicable agreement, or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent shall be deemed not to
have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to it by an Affiliated
Obligor or a Secured Party, and neither the Administrative Agent nor the Technical Agent shall be responsible for or
have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (A) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with

forth herein or therein, or (F) the adequacy of any insurance or insurance support agreement, the effectiveness or
maintenance of any insurance policy or insurance support agreement, the creditworthiness of any underwriter or any
other matter relating to the insurance provided by the Borrower hereunder.
(b)                                 Each of the Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate,
consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the
Technical Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  Each of
the Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent may consult with, and obtain advice from, legal
counsel, accountants and other experts of its choice, in connection with the performance of their
respective duties hereunder and under the other Financing Documents and the PRI Policies as
applicable and shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected in acting in good faith in
reliance on the written opinion and written advice of such counsel, accountants and other
experts.  The Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent shall not be responsible for the

all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents or
attorneys-in-fact appointed by it, including sub-agents specifically appointed to represent a single
Creditor Group (and, in the event that a sub-agent is appointed to represent a single Creditor
Group, such sub-agent may seek the advice of counsel for such single Creditor Group).  Each of
the Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent and any such sub-agent or attorney-in-fact
may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective
affiliates.  The exculpatory provisions of this Section 12.02 and the indemnification provisions of
Section 15.14 shall apply to the affiliates of each of the Administrative Agent and the Technical
Agent and any such sub-agent or attorney-in-fact, and shall apply to their respective activities
provided for herein as well as the activities of the Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent.
12.03  Resignation and Replacement.  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative
Agent or Technical Agent as provided in this Section, each of the Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent may
resign at any time by notifying each other Secured Party and the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent and the
Technical Agent may be removed as agent hereunder, under the other Financing Documents to which it is a party and
under the PRI Policies upon thirty (30) days’ notice by an instrument in writing signed by the Majority Lenders and the
Majority Hedge Banks.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders and the Majority Hedge Banks
shall have the right to appoint a successor.  No removal or resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Technical
Agent or appointment of a successor Administrative Agent or Technical Agent shall be effective until (a) the
appointment of a successor is accepted by such successor and (b) all indemnity and compensation required under
the Financing Documents, and, in the case of the Administrative Agent, the PRI Policies have been paid or provided
for.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and the Majority Hedge Banks or shall
have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent or Technical Agent, as
the case may be, gives notice of its resignation, then such retiring Administrative Agent or Technical Agent may, on
behalf of the Secured Parties, appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Technical Agent, as the case may be,
which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York or London, England having capital and surplus in excess
of $500,000,000, or an affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as the Administrative
Agent or Technical Agent hereunder, as applicable, by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such retiring Administrative Agent or Technical Agent and
such retiring Administrative Agent or Technical Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder,
under each other Financing Document to which it is a party and, in the case of the Administrative Agent, under the
PRI Policies.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent or Technical Agent shall be the
same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After
the resignation of either the Administrative Agent or the Technical Agent hereunder, the provisions of this Article XII
and Section 15.14 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was acting as Administrative Agent or Technical Agent, as the case may be.
110
12.04  No Reliance.  Each Secured Party acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon either the
Administrative Agent or the Technical Agent or any other Secured Party and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and
each other Financing Document.  Each Secured Party also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon either the Administrative Agent or the Technical Agent or any other Secured Party and based on such
documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in
taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement and each other Financing Document, any related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  Each Secured Party further acknowledges that
consent by the Secured Parties to certain proposed actions hereunder shall be deemed to have been given in certain
circumstances with the passage of time, as expressly provided herein.
12.05  Communication.
(a)                                  The Administrative Agent agrees to furnish promptly to each other Secured Party
a copy of each written communication (including notices, notices of borrowing, certificates,
reports, opinions, agreements, other documents, financial information and project reports)
received by it from any Affiliated Obligor under or expressly relating to this Agreement, any other
Financing Document or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; provided that
information received under the Commercial Bank Senior Loan Agreement need only be provided
to Commercial Bank Senior Lenders.  The obligation of the Administrative Agent with respect to
information received under the Loan PRI Policy and the Hedge PRI Policy shall be governed
solely by Sections 12.08(b) and 12.09(b) respectively.
(b)                                 The Administrative Agent agrees to furnish promptly to each other Secured Party
a copy of each written communication received by it from, or sent by it to, any member of the
Apex Group expressly relating to any insurance to be provided for, or in respect of or relating to,
the Borrower or the Project.
(c)                                  The Technical Agent agrees to promptly upon receipt of a request thereof from
the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, provide technical and environmental advice in
relation to the contents of any notice, document, request or other information received by it.
12.06  Indemnity.  Each Senior Lender (other than the Agents) and each Hedge Bank agrees to indemnify each of the
Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent, its officers, agents and employees for, and to hold it harmless ratably
in accordance with, its proportionate share of the aggregate amount of Secured Debt Obligations held by or payable to
each Secured Party (other than the Agents) against, any loss, liability, claim, judgment, settlement, compromise,
obligation, damage, penalty, cost, expense or disbursement of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the
performance of its agency role in accordance with this Agreement, the other Financing Documents and the PRI
Policies (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 15.14), unless arising from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct, as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, of the Administrative Agent or Technical
Agent, its officers, agents and employees that are seeking indemnification.  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the
other Financing Documents to the contrary, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Technical Agent shall be obliged
to take any such action or to expend or risk its
111
own funds or otherwise incur any liability in the performance of any of its duties or the exercise of any of its rights or
powers hereunder or thereunder if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or
adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it or if such action would be contrary to
applicable law.
12.07  Duties.
(a)                                  Each of the Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent shall:

duties in accordance with any instructions given to it by the requisite Secured Parties as provided
in this Agreement, which instructions shall be binding on all Secured Parties (including the
Collateral Agent) party hereto; and
(ii)                                  if so instructed by the requisite Secured Parties, refrain from exercising any right,
power, authority or discretion vested in it hereunder or under the other Financing Documents
(other than rights arising under this Article XII).
(b)                                 The Technical Agent shall:
(i)                                     coordinate and monitor the activities of the Independent Engineer as required;
(ii)                                  monitor the results of any reports prepared by the Independent Engineer and
provide comments as appropriate to the Administrative Agent on such reports; and

correspondence prepared by the Insurance Advisor and provide comments as appropriate to the
Administrative Agent in respect thereof.
12.08  Special Provisions Relating to the Loan PRI Policy.
(a)                                  Each Tranche A Senior Lender represents and warrants to the Administrative
Agent that:  (i) it has reviewed the Loan PRI Policy and is aware of the provisions thereof and
(ii) no information provided by such Tranche A Senior Lender in writing to the Loan PRI Insurers
prior to the date hereof was incomplete, untrue or incorrect in any respect except to the extent that
such Tranche A Senior Lender, in the exercise of reasonable care and due diligence prior to the
giving of the information, could not have discovered the error or omission.  Each Tranche A
Senior Lender represents and warrants for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and each other
Tranche A Senior Lender that it has not taken (or failed to take), and agrees that it shall not take
(or fail to take), any action that would result in the
112
Administrative Agent being in breach of any of its obligations as “Agent” under the Loan PRI Policy, or result in the
“Insureds” (as defined in the Loan PRI Policy) being in breach of any of their respective obligations as “Insureds”
under the Loan PRI Policy, or which would otherwise prejudice the Administrative Agent’s ability to make a claim on
behalf of the Tranche A Senior Lenders under the Loan PRI Policy.
(b)                                 The Administrative Agent agrees to furnish promptly to each Tranche A Senior
Lender a copy of each written communication received by it from, or sent by it to, the Loan PRI
Insurers, the Borrower, the Collateral Agent, any member of the Apex Group or any Affiliate of
any thereof expressly relating to, and any amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of, the
Loan PRI Policy, or from any Tranche A Senior Lender pursuant to or in relation to the Loan PRI
Policy.  The Administrative Agent agrees not to take any action under the Loan PRI Policy
without the consent of the Tranche A Senior Lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate
amount of uncancelled and undrawn Tranche A Loan Commitments and outstanding Tranche A

request for any information it reasonably requires for the purposes of fulfilling its duties under the
Loan PRI Policy.
(c)                                  Each Tranche A Senior Lender acknowledges and agrees that it shall have no
entitlement to make any claim or to take any action whatsoever under or in connection with the
Loan PRI Policy except through the Administrative Agent (acting upon the instructions of the
Tranche A Senior Lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate amount of uncancelled and
undrawn Tranche A Loan Commitments and outstanding Tranche A Loans) and that all of the
rights of the Tranche A Senior Lenders under the Loan PRI Policy shall only be exercised by the
Administrative Agent (acting upon the instructions of the Tranche A Senior Lenders holding more
than 50% of the aggregate amount of uncancelled and undrawn Tranche A Loan Commitments
and outstanding Tranche A Loans).
(d)                                 Each payment received by the Administrative Agent from the Loan PRI Insurers
under the Loan PRI Policy for the account of any Tranche A Senior Lender shall be distributed by
the Administrative Agent to each such Tranche A Senior Lender in accordance with
Section 4.01(b) of the Commercial Bank Senior Loan Agreement.
12.09  Special Provisions Relating to the Hedge PRI Policy.
(a)                                  Each Hedge Bank represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent that:  (i) it
has reviewed the Hedge PRI Policy and is aware of the provisions thereof and (ii) no information
provided by such Hedge Bank in writing to the Hedge PRI Insurers prior to the date hereof was
incomplete, untrue or incorrect in any respect except to the extent that such Hedge Bank, in the
exercise of reasonable care and due diligence prior to the giving of the information, could not
have discovered the error or omission.  Each Hedge Bank represents and warrants for the benefit
of the Administrative Agent and each other Hedge Bank that it has not taken (or failed to take),
and agrees that it shall not take (or fail to take), any action that would result in the Administrative
Agent being in breach of any of its obligations as “Agent” under the Hedge PRI Policy, or result in
the “Insureds” (as defined in the Hedge PRI Policy) being in breach of any of their respective
obligations as “Insureds” under the Hedge PRI Policy, or which would otherwise
113
prejudice the Administrative Agent’s ability to make a claim on behalf of the Hedge Bank under the Hedge PRI Policy.
(b)                                 The Administrative Agent agrees to furnish promptly to the Administrative Agent
(for delivery to each Hedge Bank) a copy of each written communication received by it from, or
sent by it to, the Hedge PRI Insurers, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, any member of the Apex Group or any Affiliate of any thereof expressly relating to, and
any amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of, the Hedge PRI Policy, or from any Hedge
Bank pursuant to or in relation to the Hedge PRI Policy.  The Administrative Agent agrees not to
take any action under the Hedge PRI Policy without the consent of the Majority Hedge Banks. 
The Administrative Agent agrees to furnish promptly to each Hedge Bank a request for any
information it reasonably requires for the purposes of fulfilling its duties under the Hedge PRI
Policy.
(c)                                  Each Hedge Bank acknowledges and agrees that it shall have no entitlement to
make any claim or to take any action whatsoever under or in connection with the Hedge PRI
Policy except through the Administrative Agent (acting upon the instructions of the Majority
Hedge Banks) and that all of the rights of the Hedge Banks under the Hedge PRI Policy shall
only be exercised by the Administrative Agent (acting upon the instructions of the Majority Hedge
Banks).
(d)                                 Each payment received by the Administrative Agent from the Hedge PRI Insurers
under the Hedge PRI Policy for the account of any Hedge Bank shall be distributed by the
Administrative Agent promptly to each such Hedge Bank, in immediately available funds, for the
account of and as designated by such Hedge Bank.
(e)                                  Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Administrative Agent (at the direction
of each Hedge Bank) and the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the
Hedge PRI Insurers, all fees, premia and other amounts payable from time to time in respect of
the Hedge PRI Policy (excluding any premia payment deducted or offset by the Hedge PRI
Insurers during the process of calculating a claim payment payable to one or more Hedge
Banks), by no later than 11:00 a.m. New York time on the date due therefor.  All such payments
shall be made by the Borrower free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any
and all present and future income, stamp and other taxes and levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, fees, compulsory loans and assessments whatsoever imposed, assessed, levied or
collected by any competent authority in Bolivia or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein.  If the Borrower is required by any applicable Government Rule to withhold any
amounts when making any payment referred to in this Section 12.09(e), the Borrower shall pay
the Hedge PRI Insurers such additional amounts as are necessary to pay to the Hedge PRI
Insurers the full amount due notwithstanding the withholding requirement.
(f)                                    Each Hedge Bank hereby agrees that in the event that a potential “Event of
Default” described in Section 5(a)(ix) of its Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreement has occurred,
and (i) the Majority Hedge Banks have accepted the terms and conditions or a proposed
replacement insurance policy and (ii) the Majority Hedge Banks have accepted the proposed
replacement Hedge PRI Insurer, then such Hedge Bank will agree to accept the proposed policy
and shall not terminate the Mandatory Metals Hedge Transactions.
114
(g)                                 If any Event of Default Section 10.01(u) (Selective Discrimination), (v) (Foreign
Exchange Restrictions), (w) (Political Violence Events), (x) (Mining Concessions and
Government Approvals), (y) (Embargo), (z) (Restriction of Export Rights) or (aa) (Forced
Divestiture) has occurred (each such Event of Default, a “PRI Eligible Event”), the Borrower will
notify the Administrative Agent who shall promptly notify the Hedge Banks in writing (such notice,
a “PRI Notice”) of such PRI Eligible Event giving reasonable details in respect thereof. Each
Hedge Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of its Guaranteed Apex Metals Early
Termination Amount in respect of all Mandatory Metals Hedging Transactions promptly upon
receipt of such PRI Notice from the Administrative Agent. Each Hedge Bank agrees that it shall
not declare an “Event of Default” (as defined in a Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreement) or
otherwise declare an “Early Termination Date” (as defined in a Mandatory Metals Hedge
Agreement) in respect of any Mandatory Metals Hedge Transaction unless and until either (a) the
Administrative Agent shall have informed the Hedge Banks in writing that no PRI Eligible Event
has occurred (or that the same has been waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
or that the same is not an event that would be covered by the Hedge PRI Policy) and that the PRI
Notice has been withdrawn (in which case the Hedge Banks shall be entitled to take such action
as desired under the Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreements in respect of any continuing “Event of
Default” thereunder) or (b) the Hedge PRI Insurers have informed the Administrative Agent that
such Hedge PRI Insurers desire to direct the Hedge Banks to declare an Early Termination Date
under the Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreements in respect of the Mandatory Metals Hedge
Transactions, in which case the Hedge Banks shall declare that an Early Termination Date has
occurred under the Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreements in respect of all Mandatory Metals
Hedge Transactions; provided that if at any time following the delivery of a PRI Notice the Hedge
Banks inform the Administrative Agent that the collective Guaranteed Apex Metals Early
Termination Amount for all Hedge Banks exceeds the amount of cover provided by the Hedge
PRI Insurers under the Hedge PRI Policy, then, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, each
Hedge Bank shall be entitled to declare an Early Termination Date under its Mandatory Metals
Hedge Agreement with respect to all Mandatory Metals Hedge Transactions notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 12.09(g).  Except as provided in this Section 12.09(g), nothing in the
Financing Documents shall prohibit a Hedge Bank from establishing an “Early Termination Date”
as defined under its Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreement where it is otherwise entitled to do so
following the occurrence of an “Event of Default” as defined thereunder.
115
12.10  Compensation.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent shall be entitled to compensation
as separately agreed upon with the Borrower.  The Senior Lenders shall have no liability for any fees, expenses or
disbursements of the Administrative Agent or the Technical Agent.  Any reasonable and documented fees,
compensation or expenses of the Administrative Agent or the Technical Agent or its counsel not paid as provided for
herein may be taken from any property held by the Collateral Agent hereunder notwithstanding any provisions herein
to the contrary.  As security for such payment, the Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent shall have a lien
upon all Collateral and other property and funds held or collected by the Collateral Agent hereunder and shall have
priority in the distribution of proceeds from Enforcement Actions in accordance with Section 10.04.  The obligations of
the Borrower under this Section 12.10 and Section 15.14 to compensate and indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Technical Agent and each predecessor Administrative Agent or Technical Agent and to pay or reimburse the
Administrative Agent, the Technical Agent and each predecessor Administrative Agent or Technical Agent as set
forth herein shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Technical Agent and the termination of this
Agreement.
12.11  Authority to Act for Secured Parties.  The Administrative Agent and the Technical Agent shall have the right
and authority with full power of substitution to act for and on behalf of the Secured Parties with respect to each
Financing Document to which such Agent is a party, including the right to create, accept, perfect and execute such
Financing Document and any and all amendments (subject to Section 15.18) and renewals of such documents and,
on behalf of the Secured Parties, to exercise in accordance with the provisions hereof the Secured Parties’ rights
under such Financing Documents and shall incur no liability to the Secured Parties in connection with any failure to
act thereunder as the same may be amended or renewed from time to time.

power of attorney) for purposes of exercising any rights and remedies of such Senior Lender or Hedge Bank under the
Financing Documents to which the Collateral Agent is a party and taking all action in Bolivia on behalf of the Secured
Parties that the Collateral Agent is authorized to take pursuant to this Agreement.

Lenders and Hedge Banks, as applicable.  The Collateral Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretionary
power granted to it herein or in any Financing Document, but may act or refrain from acting upon the written direction
of the Administrative Agent acting on behalf of the requisite Senior Lenders and Hedge Banks, as applicable.  The
Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment or for any act done or omitted to be done by it in good
faith or for any mistake of fact or law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing, except for its own gross
118
negligence or willful misconduct.  The Senior Lenders and Hedge Banks shall in no event be liable for any act done or
omitted to be done by the Collateral Agent or by any of their officers or employees.

accountants and other experts of its choice, in connection with the performance of its respective duties hereunder and

Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any counsel, accountants and other experts
selected by it without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part.
The Collateral Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or

may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Affiliates.  The
exculpatory provisions of this Article XIII and the indemnification provisions of Section 15.14 shall apply to the
Affiliates of the Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent or attorney-in-fact, and shall apply to their respective
activities provided for herein as well as the activities of the Collateral Agent.
13.08  Duties.  The Collateral Agent shall have no duties other than those specifically and expressly set forth or
provided for in this Agreement and the other Financing Documents to which it is a party and no implied covenants or
obligations or fiduciary duties of the Collateral Agent shall be read into, or implied by use of the term “collateral agent”
in, this Agreement, the other Financing Documents or any related agreement to which the Collateral Agent is a party. 
The Collateral Agent shall not have any obligation to familiarize itself with and shall have no responsibility with respect
to any other agreement or document relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Financing Documents nor any obligation to inquire whether any notice, certificate, instrument, demand, request,
direction, instruction, waiver, receipt, consent, document, communication, statement or calculation is in conformity
with the terms of any such other agreement, except those irregularities or errors manifestly apparent on the face of
such document or to the actual knowledge of a Authorized Officer of the Collateral Agent.  Except to the extent the
Collateral Agent is acting on express instructions, the Collateral Agent shall at all times take such care in dealing with
the Collateral as would a prudent person in dealing with his or her own property.  The Collateral Agent shall, upon
receipt of an Enforcement Direction, exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement, the other
Financing Documents or by any Security Document which it is directed by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
requisite Senior Lenders and Hedge Banks to exercise and the Collateral Agent shall not be liable with respect to any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with the direction of the Administrative Agent on behalf of such
requisite Senior Lenders and Hedge Banks.
13.09  Resignation, Replacement and Successor Collateral Agent.  The Collateral Agent at any time may resign as
Collateral Agent hereunder and under the other Financing Documents, upon giving not less than thirty (30) days notice
in writing to the Borrower and each other Secured Party.  The Collateral Agent may be removed as Collateral Agent
hereunder and
119
under the other Financing Documents, by an instrument in writing signed by the Majority Lenders and Majority Hedge
Banks.  Upon resignation of the Collateral Agent, a successor collateral agent shall be appointed by the Majority
Lenders and the Majority Hedge Banks and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
with the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  No resignation or removal
of the Collateral Agent and no appointment of a successor collateral agent shall be effective until the successor
collateral agent has accepted its appointment hereunder.  If no successor collateral agent shall have been so
appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the date fixed for such resignation or
such removal, the Collateral Agent may, at the expense of the Borrower, petition any court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a successor collateral agent.  Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may
prescribe, appoint a successor collateral agent.  Any successor collateral agent appointed pursuant to this
Section shall be a bank or trust company of international repute and suitable experience acting through a branch or
office in London, England or New York, New York, in any such case having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000.  Any successor collateral agent shall evidence its acceptance of the trust hereunder by executing and
delivering to the Borrower, each Senior Lender, each PRI Insurer and the Collateral Agent an instrument accepting its
appointment as Collateral Agent hereunder, and thereupon such successor collateral agent, without any further act,
deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor
hereunder with like effect as if originally named as Collateral Agent herein, and such predecessor shall have no further
obligation or liability thereunder except for liability with respect to its acts or omissions prior to such succession
pursuant to Section 13.06; nevertheless, on the request of any party hereto or such successor collateral agent, the
Collateral Agent ceasing to act shall, upon payment of its then unpaid charges, execute and deliver instruments
transferring to such successor collateral agent all rights and powers of the Collateral Agent so ceasing to act,
including any such instruments necessary to assign and/or novate the relevant Financing Documents, and shall
deliver to such successor collateral agent all property held by it under the Security Documents, provided that all
indemnities in favor of the substituting or resigning collateral agent shall be retained by it.
13.10  Indemnity.  Each Senior Lender (other than the Agents) and each Hedge Bank agrees to indemnify each of the
Collateral Agent and the Securities Intermediary, its officers, agents and employees for, and to hold it harmless
ratably in accordance with its proportionate share of the aggregate amount of Secured Debt Obligations held by or
payable to each Secured Party (other than an Agent) against, any loss, liability, claim, judgment, settlement,
compromise, obligation, damage, penalty, cost, expense or disbursement of any kind or nature whatsoever with
respect to the performance of its agency role in accordance with this Agreement and the other Financing Documents
(to the extent not reimbursed under Section 15.14), unless arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct, as
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, of any of the Collateral Agent or the Securities Intermediary, its
officers, agents and employees that are seeking indemnification.  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the other
Financing Documents to the contrary, neither the Collateral Agent nor the Securities Intermediary shall be obliged to
take any such action or to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any liability in the performance of any of its
duties or the exercise of any of its rights or powers hereunder or thereunder if it shall have reasonable grounds for
believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured
to it or if such action would be contrary to applicable law.
120
13.11  Compensation.  The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to compensation as separately agreed upon with the
Borrower.  The Senior Lenders shall have no liability for any fees, expenses or disbursements of the Collateral Agent. 
Any reasonable and documented fees, compensation or expenses of the Collateral Agent or its counsel not paid as
provided for herein may be taken from any property held by the Collateral Agent hereunder notwithstanding any
provisions herein to the contrary.  As security for such payment, the Collateral Agent shall have a lien upon all
Collateral and other property and funds held or collected by the Collateral Agent hereunder and shall have priority in
the distribution of proceeds from Enforcement Actions in accordance with Section 10.04.  The obligations of the
Borrower under this Section 13.11 and Section 15.14 to compensate and indemnify the Collateral Agent and each
predecessor Collateral Agent and to pay or reimburse the Collateral Agent and each predecessor Collateral Agent as
set forth herein shall survive the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent and the termination of this Agreement.
13.12  Certificates.  Whenever the Collateral Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or
established in connection with taking or omitting any action by the Collateral Agent hereunder or under the other
relevant Financing Documents such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed)
may, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Collateral Agent, be deemed to be
conclusively proved or established by an Officer’s Certificate of the Borrower or instruction by the requisite Secured
Parties, as applicable, delivered to the Collateral Agent.
13.13  Information.  Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent, the
Technical Agent, each Senior Lender and each Hedge Bank shall deliver to the Collateral Agent an authority and
incumbency certificate setting forth the positions of the Persons authorized to provide instructions or directions to the
Collateral Agent as of the date hereof and shall promptly provide any changes thereto from time to time thereafter. 
The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such certificate (or notice, as applicable) until it receives
a certificate (or notice) specifically stating that it is a superseding certificate (or notice).
13.14  Limitation on Collateral Agent’s Duties in Respect of Collateral.  Beyond its express duties set forth in this
Agreement as to the custody thereof and the accounting to the Borrower, Apex Metals, the Senior Lenders and Hedge
Banks for moneys received hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall not have any duty to the Borrower, Apex Metals, the
Senior Lenders or the Hedge Banks with respect to any Collateral in its possession or control or in the possession or
control of its agent or nominee, any income thereon, or the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other
rights pertaining thereto.  To the extent, however, that the Collateral Agent or an agent or nominee of the Collateral
Agent, as the case may be, maintains possession or control of any of the Collateral or the Security Documents at any
office of the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall, or shall instruct such agent or nominee to, grant the Borrower,
Apex Metals and the Secured Parties the access to such Collateral or Security Documents, which they require for the
conduct of their businesses, except in the case of the Borrower, if and to the extent that the Collateral Agent shall
have received notice of an Event of Default.
13.15  Right to Initiate Judicial Proceedings, Etc.  If and only if the Collateral Agent shall have received an
Enforcement Direction and during such time as such Enforcement
121
Direction shall not have been withdrawn (a) the Collateral Agent shall have the right and power to institute and
maintain such suits and proceedings as (subject to the instructions of the requisite Senior Lenders and Hedge Banks)
it may deem appropriate to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Agreement and the other Financing
Documents and (b) the Collateral Agent may, either after entry or without entry, proceed (subject to the instructions of
the requisite Senior Lenders and Hedge Banks) by suit or suits at law or in equity to enforce such rights and to
foreclose upon the Collateral assigned for the benefit and to the extent of the interest therein of such Senior Lender or
Hedge Bank and to realize upon all or, from time to time, any of the property of the trust established hereunder for the
benefit of such Senior Lender or Hedge Bank under the judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
13.16  Exculpatory Provisions.  The Collateral Agent makes no representation as to the value or condition of the
Collateral or any part thereof, or as to the title of any Affiliated Obligor thereto or as to the rights and interests granted
or the security afforded by this Agreement or any other Financing Document or as to the validity, execution (except by
itself), enforceability, legality or sufficiency of this Agreement, any other Financing Document or the Secured Debt
Obligations secured hereby, and the Collateral Agent shall not incur any liability or responsibility in respect of any
such matters.
13.17  Treatment of Senior Lenders by Collateral Agent.  Any Person which shall be designated as the duly authorized
representative of one or more of the Senior Lenders to act as such in connection with any matters pertaining to this
Agreement, any other Financing Document or the Collateral shall present to the Collateral Agent, if applicable, such
documents, including opinions of counsel, as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in order to demonstrate to
the Collateral Agent the authority of such Person to act as the representative of such Senior Lenders.  The Collateral
Agent may rely upon such documents until it receives documents, including opinions of counsel, as the Collateral
Agent may reasonably request, specifically stating that they are superseding documents.
13.18  Collateral Agent Protections.  The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Collateral
Agent hereunder and under the other Financing Documents, including its right to be indemnified are extended to, and
shall be enforceable by, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Collateral Agent (or any successor Collateral Agent
appointed in accordance herewith) and to each agent, custodian and other Person employed by it to act hereunder or
thereunder.
13.19  Miscellaneous.
(a)                                  In the event of any disagreement between the other parties to this Agreement
resulting in adverse claims being made in connection with property held by the Collateral Agent,
in the event that the terms of this Agreement do not unambiguously mandate the action the
Collateral Agent is to take or not to take in connection therewith under the circumstance then
existing, or the Collateral Agent is in doubt as to what action it is required to take or not to take,
the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action until directed otherwise in
writing by a request signed jointly by the parties hereto entitled to give such direction or by order
of a court of competent jurisdiction.
122
(b)                                 The Collateral Agent makes no representations as to, and shall have no
responsibility for, the correctness of any statement contained in, or the validity or sufficiency of
this Agreement or any documents or instruments referred to herein, or the sufficiency or
effectiveness of any security afforded hereby or thereby or as to or for the validity or collectibility
of any obligation contemplated hereby or thereby.  The Collateral Agent shall not be accountable
for the use or application by any Person of disbursements properly made by the Collateral Agent
in conformity with the provisions of this Agreement or of the proceeds of Senior Loans or other
moneys borrowed by the Borrower.  The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to monitor the
investment rating of any Authorized Investment after such investment has been made.
(c)                                  Any bank serving as the Collateral Agent hereunder shall have the same rights
and powers in its capacity as a Senior Lender or Hedge Bank as any other Senior Lender or
Hedge Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Collateral Agent, and such
bank and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind
of business with the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Collateral Agent
hereunder.
(d)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the
Collateral Agent be liable under or in connection with this Agreement for indirect, special,
incidental, punitive or consequential losses or damages of any kind whatsoever, including but
not limited to lost profits, whether or not foreseeable, even if the Collateral Agent has been
advised of the possibility thereof and regardless of the form of action in which such damages are
sought.
(e)                                  The Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have actual, constructive, direct or
indirect notice or knowledge of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless and until
the Collateral Agent shall have received written notice indicating that any Default or Event of
Default has occurred.  The Collateral Agent shall not have any obligation whatsoever either prior
to or after receiving such notice to enquire whether a Default or Event of Default has, in fact,
occurred and shall be entitled to rely conclusively, and shall be protected in so relying, on any
notice so furnished to it.
ARTICLE XIV
INTERCREDITOR ARRANGEMENTS
14.01  Sharing of Information.  Each Secured Party shall use reasonable efforts promptly to make available to other
Secured Parties, the Administrative Agent, the PRI Insurers and the Collateral Agent any material information it
receives regarding: (a) the construction or operation of the Project, the prospects for the achievement of Completion
or the financial condition or business of the Borrower, (b) the Borrower’s ability to pay Secured Debt Obligations when
due, (c) the security interests granted by or pursuant to this Agreement and the Security Documents, (d) each
Affiliated Obligor’s ability to comply with its obligations under each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a
party, (e) the occurrence of a Default or an
123
Event of Default or (f) any other matter regarding an Affiliated Obligor, the Guaranteed Apex Metals Obligations or the
Senior Loans that such Secured Party considers to be of common interest to Secured Parties; provided that (i) this
Section shall not require any Secured Party to make available to any other Secured Party information that, in such
Secured Party’s reasonable judgment, is not of common interest to the other Secured Parties or is subject to
confidentiality restrictions that prohibit such disclosure and (ii) no Secured Party shall have any liability for any failure
to make available to other Secured Parties such information or for any inaccuracy or incompleteness of any such
information made available by it in good faith.
14.02  Notice of Payments Subject to Sharing Among Secured Parties.  Each Secured Party shall notify each other
Secured Party of any payment received in respect of Secured Debt Obligations in excess of the amount payable to
such Secured Party as provided in Article IV.  Any such excess payment shall be applied, subject to
Section 14.07(c), 14.08 and 14.13, as provided in Section 14.07(a) as if such payment was not received from the
Collateral Agent hereunder.
14.03  Meetings of Secured Parties.  Any Secured Party may at any time request that a meeting (telephonic or
otherwise) of Secured Parties be convened, without cost to the Borrower.  The Secured Party or Secured Parties
requesting such meeting shall give at least five (5) Business Days’ notice thereof to each Secured Party (unless such
period of advance notice is not practicable in the reasonable judgment of such Senior Lender(s) in view of the
circumstances, in which case such Secured Parties shall give such advance notice as is reasonably practicable)
specifying the date, time and place of the meeting and the general nature of the business proposed to be considered;
provided, however, that this provision shall not affect in any manner the rights of the Secured Parties hereunder or
improve in any way the rights or defenses of the Borrower.
14.04  No Reliance.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no Secured Party has relied or shall rely
on any other Secured Party or any Agent (a) to inquire into or verify the accuracy or completeness of any information
provided by the Borrower or any Affiliated Obligor, or made available by a Secured Party to other Secured Parties on
or prior to the date of this Agreement, or hereafter pursuant to Section 14.01, or (b) to review or evaluate the condition
of the Borrower, any Affiliated Obligor, the Project or Bolivia.  Each Secured Party has made its credit decision, and
shall take, or refrain from taking, any future decision or action, on the basis of its own independent judgment, without
reliance on information provided by or expected from, or on views expressed by, any other Secured Party, any Agent
or the Collateral Agent.
14.05  Use of Agent for the Collateral.
(a)                                  Accounts.  Without improving in any way the rights or defenses of the Borrower,
if any one or more Secured Parties shall direct the Administrative Agent to give an Account
Enforcement Notice to the Collateral Agent contemplated by Section 4.05(a) of this Agreement,
then all Secured Parties shall endeavor to agree on (i) the appointment of a Person or Persons to
act as their agent in the giving of instructions with respect to the investment and disposition of
funds in the Accounts and (ii) the development of objectives or instructions to be followed by
such Person or Persons.
124
(b)                                 Enforcement Action.  If necessary or desirable, in connection with the taking of
Enforcement Action, the Secured Parties shall endeavor to agree on the appointment of a Person
resident in Bolivia, if necessary, to act as their agent in the administration of the Collateral
located in Bolivia and the taking of Enforcement Action with respect thereto.
14.06  Sharing Generally.  Subject to the provisions of Section 14.08 and the provisions set forth in the Senior Loan
Agreements affecting the allocation of funds within the applicable Senior Loan Facility, all amounts paid to or received
by the Collateral Agent for redistribution to the Secured Parties (other than to the Agents in their capacity as agents)
and representing the proceeds of the Collateral and the proceeds of any action taken pursuant to an Enforcement
Direction shall be paid promptly to the Secured Parties ratably in the order specified in Section 10.04 based on the
amounts owing to each Secured Party on each level of priority specified therein.
14.07  Sharing of Non-Pro Rata Payments.
(a)                                  Payments Subject to Sharing Among Secured Parties.  Subject to Sections
14.07(c), 14.08 and 14.13, if any Secured Party (other than an Agent) obtains any amount (other
than amounts disbursed by the Collateral Agent in accordance with this Agreement) in respect of
the Financing Documents or the Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreements (whether (i) by way of
voluntary or involuntary payment, (ii) by virtue of an exercise of any right of setoff (including
without limitation by virtue of an exercise of any such right under a Mandatory Metals Hedge
Agreement (but subject to Section 14.08(a)(vii) below) or any guarantee related to any of the
foregoing), banker’s lien, or counterclaim, (iii) as proceeds of any insurance policy covering any
Project Property, (iv) from proceeds of liquidation or dissolution of the Borrower or distribution of
its assets among its creditors, however such liquidation, dissolution or distribution may occur,
(v) as payment of any Secured Debt Obligations following the acceleration thereof, whether in
whole or in part, (vi) from any realization on the Collateral, (vii) by virtue of the application of any
provision of any of the Financing Documents, or (viii) in any other manner), such Secured Party
shall forthwith notify the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent thereof in writing and shall
promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of its so obtaining the same, pay such
amount (less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such Secured Party in obtaining
such amount) to the Collateral Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall direct the Collateral Agent
promptly following receipt of any such sums to distribute the appropriate amount to each Secured
Party entitled to such funds under the provisions of Article IV or Section 10.04, as applicable, of
this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at such time the payment of such amount to the
Collateral Agent in such manner is inadvisable in the judgment of any Secured Party, then at the
request of such Secured Party, the Secured Parties shall promptly consult with each other to
determine whether there is a preferable manner to make equitable adjustments (including the
purchase by such Secured Party of Secured Debt Obligations held by other Secured Parties) to
permit all Secured Parties to share such payment (net of expenses incurred by the recipient
Senior Lenders in obtaining or preserving such payment) as if such payment had been made to
the Collateral Agent and redistributed pursuant to Article IV or Section 10.04 as applicable.  If any
such redistributed or shared payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Secured
Party that first obtained it, each other Secured Party that shares the benefit of such payment shall
return to such Secured Party its portion of the payment so rescinded or required to be restored. 
Nothing contained in this Section 14.07(a) shall require
125
any Secured Party to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Secured Party to exercise, and retain the
benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower.  If, under
any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Secured Party receives a secured claim in lieu of a
set-off to which this Section 14.07(a) applies, such Secured Party shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights
in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Secured Parties entitled under this
Section 14.07(a) to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.
(b)                                 The Borrower consents to the foregoing arrangements, and agrees that, any
provision to the contrary notwithstanding:
(i)                                     any Secured Party (other than an Agent) that has received a payment that is
more than its pro rata share of such payment and has remitted the amount of such payment to
other Secured Parties pursuant to this Section for redistribution shall be deemed to have
received payment only of the amount received by such Secured Party after redistribution by such
Secured Party to other Secured Parties, and any Secured Party that has received a payment
pursuant to this Section from another Secured Party shall be deemed to have been paid such
amount by the Borrower; and
(ii)                                  if any sharing of payments pursuant to this Section 14.07 shall (with the consent
of all Secured Parties (other than the Agents)) have been accomplished by the purchase by any
Secured Party (other than an Agent) of participations in Secured Debt Obligations owed to
another Secured Party (other than an Agent), such purchasing Secured Party shall have and may
exercise all legal and equitable rights and remedies (including rights of set-off) with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Secured Party were the holder of a direct Secured Debt
Obligation in the amount of such participation.
(c)                                  For purposes hereof, any payment received by a Secured Party (other than an
Agent) pursuant to this Agreement may be presumed by such Secured Party to have been
properly received by such Secured Party in accordance with this Agreement unless and until
such Secured Party receives notice from any other Secured Party that such payment was not
made in accordance herewith.
14.08  Amounts Not Subject to Sharing.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other
Financing Document to the contrary:
(a)                                  no Secured Party (other than the Collateral Agent) shall have any obligation to
share:
(i)                                     any payment made by any Person to such Secured Party (other than an Agent)
pursuant to a contract of participation or assignment or any other arrangement by which a direct
or indirect interest of such Secured Party under the Financing Documents or any Mandatory
Metals Hedge Agreement is transferred (unless such participation or assignment is purchased by
the Borrower or an Affiliate of the Borrower);
126
(ii)                                  any payment made to a Secured Party (other than an Agent) by a PRI Insurer
under a PRI Policy, provided that to the extent that a PRI Insurer has refused to pay on, or
excluded a claim by, a specific Secured Party, the other Secured Parties that are entitled to
payment in respect of such claim shall not be required to share recoveries with the excluded
Secured Party;
(iii)                               any prepayment of a Senior Lender’s Senior Loan Obligations pursuant to
Sections 2.04(b)(v), 2.05(b) and 2.07 that is not required to be a Pro Rata Payment;
(iv)                              any indemnification, tax gross-up or similar payment received by such Secured
Party under the Financing Documents for costs or losses suffered by such Secured Party;
(v)                                 any payment made to such Secured Party pursuant to a credit swap or similar
arrangement between such Secured Party and a third party (other than the Borrower or an
Affiliate of the Borrower);
(vi)                              any agency, upfront fees or other fees paid to any Secured Party pursuant to the
Financing Documents;
(vii)                           any payment made to a Hedge Bank in respect of Mandatory Metals Hedge
Transactions where such payment is effected by such Hedge Bank netting amounts payable by
such Hedge Bank under Mandatory Metals Hedge Transactions against amounts payable to
such Hedge Bank in respect of Mandatory Metals Hedge Transactions (whether in the ordinary
course or upon the occurrence of an “Early Termination Date” with respect thereto); and
(viii)                        amounts received by CAF pursuant to clause (c) of this Section 14.08;
(b)                                 the sharing of payments made with respect to a particular Senior Loan
Agreement shall be subject to the sharing provisions of such Senior Loan Agreement as such
provisions affect the sharing of payments among the parties thereto; and
(c)                                  CAF, in its capacity as a Senior Lender, shall have the right to receive and
retain, without obligation to share with any other Secured Party or other Person, any Preferred
Payment (as hereinafter defined); provided that nothing in this paragraph is intended to modify
any provision in any Security Document (including this Agreement) governing the exercise of any
remedies in respect of all or any part of the Collateral or otherwise in connection with the
enforcement of such Security Document.
A “Preferred Payment” shall mean each of the following:
(i) any payment received by or for the account of CAF as a Senior Lender in freely convertible and transferable
currencies (“Convertible Currencies”)  under circumstances in which (A) any Governmental Authority (including any
central bank or entity acting as a central bank) having the power to regulate foreign exchange in Bolivia or any other
jurisdiction through which payment is due under the CAF Senior Loan Agreement is made (Bolivia and any such
jurisdiction, as the case may be, a “Restricted
127
Country”) is not generally permitting the conversion of the currency of such Restricted Country or
the remittance of Convertible Currencies from such Restricted Country or has imposed a general
moratorium on the payment of international debt using                Convertible Currencies and
(B) CAF is either being exempted from such foreign exchange restrictions or moratorium or is
otherwise being afforded preferential treatment by such Government Authority or another
competent Government Authority by foreign exchange being made available for obligations owed
to it in Convertible Currencies; and
(ii) any payment received by or for the account of CAF as a Senior Lender (in Convertible Currencies, or converted as
provided in clause (i) above) constituting the proceeds of enforcement by CAF (exercised subject to the proviso
above) of its pro rata share of the Secured Parties’ Lien on particular Collateral in Bolivia under circumstances in
which (A) any Governmental Authority of Bolivia shall have attached assets constituting such Collateral and is not
generally permitting the enforcement of Liens by the Secured Parties or by the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Secured Parties against such Collateral and (B) CAF is either being exempted from such Lien enforcement
restrictions or is otherwise being afforded preferential treatment by Governmental Authorities in Bolivia by being
allowed to enforce its pro rata share of the Secured Parties’ Lien on such Collateral.
14.09  No Separate Security.  Each Secured Party that is a party to this Agreement (for itself and any Person
claiming through it):  (a) agrees that, except as otherwise provided herein, all Collateral is for the joint benefit of all the
Secured Parties (subject to the priority among the Secured Parties set out herein); and (b) represents and warrants to
each other Secured Party that, in respect of any Secured Debt Obligations now or hereafter owing to such Secured
Party (other than an Agent), it has received no security or guarantees from the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof, other
than (i) its interest in the Collateral as provided in the Security Documents, if any, or (ii) as otherwise provided
pursuant to the Financing Documents.  In furtherance of the foregoing, if any Secured Party (other than an Agent)
shall receive or be entitled to demand or otherwise call upon any guaranty, security or other assurance of payment
which is not described in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence in respect of the Secured Debt Obligations owed
to such Secured Party, such Secured Party shall receive any proceeds thereof in trust for all the Secured Parties (to
be shared promptly and ratably (subject to the priority provisions among the Secured Parties established herein) with
the other Secured Parties) and shall exercise its rights to demand or call upon such guaranty, security or other
assurance of payment as directed by the Majority Secured Parties.
14.10  Consent and Agreement of Borrower.  The Borrower consents to the exchange of information and views among
the Secured Parties as contemplated in this Article XIV.  Each of the Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Luxembourg and
Apex Sweden agrees and acknowledges that the provisions of Article XIV are intended for the benefit of the Secured
Parties only and shall not give rise to any rights on the part of the Borrower, Apex Luxembourg, Apex Sweden, Apex
Metals or any other member of the Apex Group.
14.11  Termination of Senior Loan Commitments.  In the event the Senior Loan Commitment of a Senior Lender is
terminated prior to disbursement of any Senior Loans by such
128
Senior Lender, such Senior Lender shall cease to be a party to this Agreement and the other Financing Documents.
14.12  Hedge Bank Voting.  At any time when a Hedge Bank is entitled to vote as set out in the definition of “Majority
Secured Parties” or “Majority Hedge Banks”,  or at any time when the Administrative Agent may otherwise require for
purposes of making calculations under the Hedge PRI Policy, the Administrative Agent may request, and each Hedge
Bank shall provide, its statement of the Guaranteed Apex Metals Early Termination Amount with respect to such
Hedge Bank (whether or not such Hedge Bank has then terminated any of its Mandatory Metals Hedge
Transactions).  The Administrative Agent shall calculate the Eligible Guaranteed Apex Metals Amount for each Hedge
Bank and inform such Hedge Bank of its calculation when any such request is made in connection with a vote to be
taken.  The Administrative Agent will seek such information and perform such calculations each time a vote is to be
taken hereunder where the vote of the Hedge Banks is required.
14.13  Hedge Bank Accession.  Any Person proposing to execute Mandatory Metals Hedge Transactions may
become a Secured Party hereunder as a Hedge Bank subject to (a) such Person otherwise being a Senior Lender
hereunder and (b) the Administrative Agent’s receipt of an executed and delivered counterpart of (i) a CSA Accession
Agreement (by virtue of which such Person shall become entitled to the benefits of the Security Documents) and
(ii) the Hedge Guaranty.  Upon acceptance of such CSA Accession Agreement and the executed counterpart with
respect to the Hedge Guaranty by the Administrative Agent, such Person shall be a party to this Agreement and the
Hedge Guaranty and shall have the rights and obligations of a Secured Party hereunder and thereunder.  No Hedge
Bank may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under any Mandatory Metals Hedge Transaction to any
Person that is not a Senior Lender having a credit rating in respect of its long term unsecured and un-credit enhanced
Dollar-denominated indebtedness of at least A from Standard & Poor’s and A2 from Moody’s Investor Service. No
Hedge Bank may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under any Mandatory Metals Hedge Transaction
without causing the assignee or transferee thereof to execute a counterpart of a CSA Accession Agreement and the
Hedge Guaranty.
14.14  Secured Party Action.
(a)                                  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and
each other Secured Party of the identity of any new Senior Lender Group (and of the Senior
Lender part thereof whose action shall constitute action of the Senior Lender Group) formed in
connection with Replacement Secured Debt.
(b)                                 Any Secured Party that is party to any arrangement with the Borrower or any
member of the Apex Group whereby such Secured Party has agreed to take direction from the
Borrower or such member of the Apex Group in connection with any matter under any Financing
Document, shall not have any voting rights, in its capacity as a Secured Party, on any matter
concerning the Secured Parties and contemplated under this Agreement or the other Financing
Documents, shall not be entitled to any information provided to Secured Parties by any Secured
Party and shall not be entitled to attend any meetings of any Secured Parties.

(x)                                   if to any Senior Lender or Hedge Bank, to it at its address (or telecopy number)
set forth in Appendix B-2 hereto or, as applicable, in the case of any assignee, as notified to the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent in accordance with the assignment
provisions in each Senior Loan Agreement or Mandatory Metals Hedging Agreement, as the
case may be.
(b)                                 The Administrative Agent shall promptly forward to each Secured Party copies of
any notice, certificate, instrument, demand, request, direction, instruction, waiver, receipt, consent
or other document that it receives from any other party hereto.
Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other communications hereunder by
notice to the other parties hereto.  All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.
15.09  Benefits of Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement or any other Financing Document, express or implied, shall
give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns hereunder or under the
other Financing Documents, any benefit or any legal or equitable right or remedy under this Agreement.
134
15.10  Remedies.
(a)                                  Other than as stated expressly herein, no remedy herein conferred upon the
Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, the Technical Agent or the other Secured Parties is
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every such remedy shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or under the other
Financing Documents or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.
(b)                                 The amounts payable by the Borrower at any time under this Agreement shall be
a separate and independent debt and each Senior Lender, except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents, shall be entitled to protect
and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents, and
its right to cancel or suspend its Senior Loan Commitment and to accelerate the maturity of
amounts due under its Senior Loan Agreement, and, except as aforesaid, it shall not be
necessary for any other Senior Lender to consent to, or be joined as an additional party in, any
proceedings for such purposes.
(c)                                  No failure on the part of any Secured Party to exercise and no delay in
exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power, or privilege under this
Agreement, or any other Financing Document, shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under any such document preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  None of the
Collateral Agent, any other Agent or any other Secured Party shall be responsible for the failure
of any other Secured Party to perform its obligations hereunder, under any Senior Loan
Agreement or any Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreement.
(d)                                 In case any Secured Party, or the Collateral Agent on behalf of any Secured
Party, shall have proceeded to enforce any right, remedy or power under this Agreement or any
other Financing Document, and the proceeding for the enforcement thereof shall have been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been determined adversely to such
Secured Party, then and in every such case the Borrower and the Secured Parties shall, subject
to any effect of or determination in such proceeding, severally and respectively be restored to
their former positions and rights hereunder and under such Financing Document, and thereafter
all rights, remedies and powers of the Secured Parties shall continue as though no such
proceeding had been taken.
15.11  Execution in Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the
different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original,
but all the counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
15.12  Consent to Jurisdiction.
(a)                                  Each party hereto hereby irrevocably consents and agrees, for the benefit of
each other party hereto, that any legal action, suit or proceeding against it with respect to its
obligations, liabilities or any other matter under or arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, any Senior Loan Agreement or the Secured Debt Obligations may be brought in any
135
Federal or State court located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (including the Supreme Court of the
State of New York sitting in New York County and the United States District Court of the Southern District of New
York), and any appellate court from any thereof, and hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court with respect to any such action, suit or proceeding.  Each party hereto hereby waives
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions, suits or
proceedings brought in any such court and hereby further waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
(b)                                 The Borrower hereby agrees that a final judgment against it in any action, suit or
proceeding taken in any Federal or State Court in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York in accordance with clause (a) above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any
jurisdiction by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which judgment shall be conclusive
evidence thereof, or by any other means provided by law.
(c)                                  The Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints CT Corporation System, with offices
at the date of this Agreement at 111 8th Avenue, New York, NY 10011, as its authorized agent on
which any and all legal process may be served in any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any Federal or State court located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.  The
Borrower agrees that service of process in respect of it upon such agent, together with written
notice of such service given to it as provided in Section 15.08, shall be deemed to be effective
service of process upon it in any such action, suit or proceeding.  The Borrower agrees that the
failure of such agent to give notice to it of any such service shall not impair or affect the validity of
such service or any judgment rendered in any action, suit or proceeding based thereon.  If for any
reason such agent shall cease to be available to act as such, the Borrower agrees to designate a
new agent in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, on the terms and for the purposes
of this Section.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the ability of any other party hereto to
serve any such legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable law or to obtain
jurisdiction over any such party or bring actions, suits or proceedings against it in such other
jurisdictions, and in such manner, as may be permitted or required by applicable law.
(d)                                 The Borrower hereby irrevocably consents and agrees, for the benefit of the
Collateral Agent and each Secured Party, that any legal action, suit or proceeding against it with
respect to its obligations, liabilities or any other matter under or arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement or the Senior Debt Obligations may be brought in Bolivia and hereby
irrevocably accepts and submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts with respect to
any such action, suit or proceeding.
(e)                                  To the extent that the Borrower has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from
jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service of notice, attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution, sovereign immunity or otherwise)
with respect to itself or its property, it hereby irrevocably waives such immunity, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, in respect of its obligations under this Agreement and the other
Financing Documents.
136
15.13  Judgment Currency.  The obligations of the Borrower to make payments under the Financing Documents shall
not be discharged by an amount paid in any currency other than Dollars, whether pursuant to a court or arbitral
judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid upon conversion to Dollars and transferred to New York,
New York under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of Dollars due, and the Borrower hereby, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify the Collateral Agent, the Agents and
each other Secured Party against, and to pay to the Collateral Agent, the Agents and each Senior Lender on demand,
in Dollars, any difference between the sum originally due in Dollars and the amount of Dollars received upon any such
conversion and transfer.
15.14  Expenses; Indemnity.
(a)                                  Without duplication with respect to any similar obligations contained in the
Senior Loan Agreements or the Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreements, the Borrower shall pay
promptly (i) all reasonable and documented fees of and out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred after the Closing Date by the respective Agents and the other Secured Parties (including
the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel, consultants and advisors to
them) in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
translation, authentication, notarization, legalization, recordation or registration, if required, of this
Agreement, any other Financing Document, the Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreements, any PRI
Policy and any other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby (whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable and documented fees
of and out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred after the Closing Date by the Agents and the
other Secured Parties (including fees and expenses of counsel, consultants and advisors to
them) in connection with any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions of any
Financing Document or Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreement (whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (iii) all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket expenses incurred after the Closing Date by the Agents or any other Secured Party
(including (A) the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of common counsel, consultants
and advisors for the Agents or any of the other Secured Parties and (B) costs and expenses of
pursuing any claim under any PRI Policy or making any assignment to a PRI Insurer in
connection therewith) in connection with the exercise, enforcement, protection or preservation of
its rights in connection with the Financing Documents or Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreements,
including its rights under this Section 15.14, or in connection with the Senior Loans made under
each Senior Loan Agreement or Guaranteed Apex Metals Obligations, including in connection
with any workout whether or not consummated, restructuring, negotiations in respect thereof and
(iv) the exercise by a PRI Insurer of any of its rights of access to the business records of the
Borrower or to the Project (whether under this Agreement or its PRI Policy).  To the extent that
any Agent has entered into a Fee Letter with the Borrower, such Fee Letter shall prevail in the
event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and such Fee Letter.
(b)                                 The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent, each Senior Lender (other than any
Tranche B Senior Lender or CAF in the case of clause (iv) below), each Hedge Bank and each
Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each, an “Indemnitee”) from, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless against, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related
expenses, including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of any
137
counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of (i) the execution or delivery of the Financing Documents, the performance by the parties hereto or thereto of
their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, (ii) any Senior Loans or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto or (iv) any
termination of any PRI Policy, including any premia or fees payable to, or deducted from a claim payment made by,
the PRI Insurer; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Borrower will indemnify each Indemnitee from, and hold each of them harmless
against, any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses described in the preceding sentence (excluding any
loss, liability, claim, damage or expense incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Person to be indemnified as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) arising under any Environmental
Law as a result of the past, present or future operations of the Borrower (or any predecessor in interest to the
Borrower) or the environmental contamination of any site or facility owned, operated, mined or leased at any time by
(or, in the case of “operated or mined” at the direction of) the Borrower (or any such predecessor in interest) in
connection with the Project, or any Release or threatened Release of any Hazardous Materials by the Borrower (or
any such predecessor in interest) at or from any such site or facility.
(c)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Collateral Agent each other Agent, and each Secured
Party from, and shall reimburse the Collateral Agent, each other Agent and each Secured Party for, any present or
future claim for liability for any stamp or other similar documentary tax and any penalties or interest with respect
thereto, which may be assessed, levied or collected by any jurisdiction in connection with this Agreement, the other
relevant Financing Documents or the PRI Policies or the attachment or perfection of the security interest granted to
the Secured Parties in any Collateral.
(d)                                 All amounts due under this Section 15.14 shall be promptly paid after written
demand therefor in accordance with this Section 15.14.  The obligations of the Borrower under
this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent or any Agent and the
termination of the other provisions of this Agreement.
15.15  Survival.  The provisions of Sections 12.06, 13.10, 13.11, 15.14 and this Section 15.15 shall survive and
remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of the Senior Loans, the expiration or termination of the Senior Loan Commitments or the termination of
this Agreement or any provision thereof.
15.16  Right to Setoff.  If an Enforcement Direction has been delivered, each Senior Lender and each Hedge Bank is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the
provisions of this Agreement and the Security Documents, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such
138
Senior Lender or Hedge Bank to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against the Senior Loan Obligations or
Guaranteed Apex Metals Obligations, as applicable, due and payable to such Senior Lender or Hedge Bank at the
time of such offset.  The rights of each Senior Lender and Hedge Banks under this Section 15.16 are in addition to
other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Senior Lender or Hedge Banks may have.
15.17  Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and by the Financing Documents or
Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreements, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Senior Lender and Hedge Bank, as applicable (and
any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void).  Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.
15.18  Waivers; Amendments.
(a)                                  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any applicable
Financing Document or any Mandatory Metals Hedge Agreement, no failure or delay by any
Agent or any other Secured Party in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of
the Agents and the other Secured Parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement
or consent to any departure by the Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Luxembourg or Apex Sweden
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless such waiver or consent shall be permitted by
clause (b) of this Section 15.18, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the making of a Senior Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event
of Default, regardless of whether any Agent or any Senior Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.
(b)                                 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement may be waived,
amended, modified or supplemented only by an agreement in writing entered into by the
Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Sweden, Apex Luxembourg and the Majority Secured Parties or by
the Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Sweden, Apex Luxembourg and the Administrative Agent
acting with the consent of the Majority Secured Parties (except that no Hedge Bank shall have
any right in any circumstance to vote in connection with the waiver or amendment of any
condition precedent to disbursement specified in Sections 11.02 and 11.03 hereof); provided
that, subject to clause (c) below, no such agreement shall (i) reduce any amounts payable to a
Secured Party hereunder, without the written consent of each Secured Party affected thereby,
(ii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of any amounts payable to a Secured Party
hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment without the written
consent of each Secured Party affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of expiration
of,
139
or increase, any Senior Loan Commitment, without the written consent of each Senior Lender affected thereby,
(iv) change Section 2.01, 2.02, 2.03, 2.04 or 2.05 or any other provision in any other Financing Document in a manner
that would alter (A) the pari passu status of the Secured Debt Obligations, (B) the prepayments or (C) the pro rata
sharing of payments or terminations, in each case as required thereby, without the written consent of each Secured
Party (other than the Agents), (v) change the definition of “Majority Lenders” or “Supermajority Lenders”, without the
written consent of each Senior Lender, (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of “Majority
Secured Parties” or “Supermajority Secured Parties”, or any other provision hereof specifying the number or
percentage of Secured Parties required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or
grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Secured Party (other than the Agents), (vii) amend,
modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Collateral Agent or any Agent hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Collateral Agent or, as applicable, the relevant Agent, (viii) release a material part of the Collateral or
terminate any security interest created by the Security Documents without the written consent of each Secured Party
(other than the Agents), (ix) release any Affiliated Obligor from (A) all or substantially all of its obligations under or
(B) any guarantee or payment obligation under, any Financing Document to which it is a party, (x) materially change
the requirement for achieving Completion (other than in accordance with the Completion Agreement) without the
written consent of each Secured Party (other than the Agents), (xi) waive or amend any condition precedent to
disbursement set forth in Section 11.02 or 11.03 in connection with the Initial Disbursement without the consent of
each Senior Lender, (xii) waive any condition to termination set forth in Section 15.01, without the written consent of
each Secured Party, (xiii) change any provision requiring ratable funding of Senior Loans, without the written consent
of each Senior Lender, (xiv) change any provision of any payment waterfall set out in this Agreement that would have
the effect of preferring one Secured Party over another without the consent of the Secured Party disadvantaged
thereby, (xv) waive any Event of Default under Section 10.01(ee)(i) without the written consent of each Secured Party
or (xvi) change the definition of “Majority Hedge Banks” without the written consent of each Hedge Bank.
(c)                                  The provisions of Article XIV may be waived, amended, modified or
supplemented only by an agreement in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and each
Secured Party and no consent of the Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Sweden or Apex Luxembourg
shall be required.
(d)                                 Sections 12.08 and 12.09 may be waived, amended, modified or supplemented
only by an agreement in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Majority Bank
Lenders, in the case of Section 12.08 and the Majority Hedge Banks, in the case of
Section 12.09, and no consent of the Borrower, Apex Metals, Apex Sweden or Apex Luxembourg
shall be required.
(e)                                  Unless otherwise specifically provided herein or in another Financing
Document, the Administrative Agent shall take and shall only direct the Collateral Agent to take,
and the Collateral Agent shall only take, such actions and execute such amendments,
modifications, waivers and supplements to such Financing Documents (other than this
Agreement) to which they are a party as directed by the Majority Secured Parties; provided that
no such action or agreement in respect of such Financing Document shall (i) reduce any
amounts
140
payable to a Secured Party thereunder, without the written consent of each Secured Party affected thereby,
(ii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of any amounts payable to a Secured Party thereunder, or reduce the
amount of, waive or excuse any such payment without the written consent of each Secured Party affected thereby,
(iii) alter the pari passu status of the Secured Debt Obligations, without the written consent of each Secured Party
(other than the Agents),  (iv) change any provision thereof specifying the number or percentage of Secured Parties
required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder,
without the written consent of each Secured Party (other than the Agents), (v) amend, modify or otherwise affect the
rights or duties of the Collateral Agent or any Agent thereunder without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent
or, as applicable, the relevant Agent, (vi) release a material part of the Collateral or terminate any security interest
created thereunder without the written consent of each Secured Party other than the Agents, (vii) change any
provision of any payment waterfall set out in this Agreement that would have the effect of preferring one Secured
Party over another without the consent of the Secured Party disadvantaged thereby, or (viii) release any Affiliated
Obligor from (A) all or substantially all of its obligations under or (B) any guarantee or payment obligation under, any
Financing Document to which it is a party without the written consent of each Secured Party (other than the Agents).
(f)                                    The Borrower shall provide to each PRI Insurer and the Administrative Agent
(for delivery to the other Secured Parties) written notice of any proposed amendment,
modification or waiver of any Financing Document (together with a copy of such proposed
amendment, modification or waiver).
15.19  Conflicts.  In case of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any Security Document (with
respect to the rights and obligations of the parties prior to enforcement and the conditions and terms on which security
interests may be enforced) this Agreement shall control.
15.20  Effectiveness.  This Agreement shall come into full force and effect upon its execution and delivery by each of
the parties named on the signature pages hereof.
15.21  Headings.  Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of
reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in
interpreting, this Agreement.
15.22  Compliance with Applicable Law.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, but without in any way
limiting any rights of the Collateral Agent or the Secured Parties under Article X in connection with any Event of
Default resulting from the taking or refraining from taking of any action pursuant to any law, statute, regulation, rule,
order, injunction, decree, writ or judgment binding on it or affecting its properties, the Borrower shall not be obligated to
take or refrain from taking any action otherwise required under this Agreement if at the time the Borrower is to take or
refrain from taking such action, such action is contrary to any law, statute, regulation, rule, order, injunction, decree,
writ or judgment binding on it or affecting its properties.
15.23  Language.  If any Financing Document, financial statements, Material Project Document, notice, certificate,
communication or other such document required to be
141
delivered to the Agents or any other Secured Party pursuant to this Agreement or any other Financing Document is
not originally executed, delivered or given in the English language, the Borrower shall, at the request of any Secured
Party, additionally and at its own expense, promptly provide a certified English translation thereof.
15.24  Reinstatement.  This Agreement shall automatically be reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any
payment by or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of the Secured Debt Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be
restored to Borrower or the Person that made such payment on the Borrower’s behalf by any holder of the Secured
Debt Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the
Borrower shall indemnify the Collateral Agent and each other Secured Party on demand for all reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including fees of counsel) incurred by the Collateral Agent or such Secured Party in
connection with such rescission or restoration.
15.25  No Consequential Damages.  No Affiliated Obligor nor any Secured Party shall assert any claim against any
Affiliated Obligor or Secured Party, as the case may be, on any theory of liability, for any lost profits or special,
indirect or consequential damages or (to the fullest extent lawful) any punitive damages arising out of, in connection
with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any other Financing Document (except as the same may be asserted by a
third party in respect of any claim for which a Secured Party is indemnified under Section 15.14), and each of the
parties hereto hereby forever waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such lost profits or
special, indirect, consequential or (to the fullest extent lawful) punitive damages, whether or not accrued and whether
or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.
