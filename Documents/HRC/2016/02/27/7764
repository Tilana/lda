<p><b>  Report of the independent international 
commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab 
Republic</b>* 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Syrian Arab Republic is a battlefield. Its cities and towns suffer relentless 
shelling and sieges. Massacres are perpetrated with impunity. An untold number of Syrians 
have disappeared. The present report covers investigations conducted from 15 May to 15 
July 2013. Its findings are based on 258 interviews and other collected evidence. 
</p>
<p> Government and pro-government forces have continued to conduct widespread 
attacks on the civilian population, committing murder, torture, rape and enforced 
disappearance as crimes against humanity. They have laid siege to neighbourhoods and 
subjected them to indiscriminate shelling. Government forces have committed gross 
violations of human rights and the war crimes of torture, hostage-taking, murder, execution 
without due process, rape, attacking protected objects and pillage. 
</p>
<p> Anti-government armed groups have committed war crimes, including murder, 
execution without due process, torture, hostage-taking and attacking protected objects. 
They have besieged and indiscriminately shelled civilian neighbourhoods. 
</p>
<p> Anti-government and Kurdish armed groups have recruited and used child soldiers 
in hostilities. 
</p>
<p> The perpetrators of these violations and crimes , on all sides, act in defiance of 
international law. They do not fear accountability. Referral to justice is imperative. 
</p>
<p> There is no military solution to this conflict. Those who supply arms create but an 
illusion of victory. A political solution founded upon tenets of the Geneva communiqu&#233; is 
the only path to peace.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the independent international commission of inquiry on the 
Syrian Arab Republic1 sets out its findings based on investigations conducted from 15 May 
to 15 July 2013. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 22/24, the Human Rights Council extended the mandate originally 
established by the Council in its resolution S-17/1 for a period of one year. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report should be read in conjunction with the previous reports of the 
commission.2 
</p>
<p>4. On 21 June 2013, the commission was invited to brief the Security Council on the 
situation in the Syrian Arab Republic. On 29 July, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 
67/262, the Chairperson of the commission briefed the Assembly on the situation of human 
rights in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>5. The commission&#8217;s ability to reach victims from all sides and to present a full picture 
of the conflict was significantly curtailed by the denial of access to the Syrian Arab 
Republic. A thorough investigation requires access to the location of incidents, to all 
available information and to all available witnesses. Recent missions to the country by the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children in Armed Conflict and the 
United Nations investigation mission to investigate allegations of the use of chemical 
weapons give rise to hopes that the commission will be able to visit the country in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>6. On 2 July, the commission addressed a request to the Permanent Mission of the 
Syrian Arab Republic in which it reiterated its request to have access to the country and 
sought information on the events in Al Qusayr in May and June (see annex I). On 16 July, 
the commission addressed a request to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the members of 
the commission be granted access to the Syrian Arab Republic to examine the modalities 
for a future visit. No responses were received. On 5 August, a note verbale was sent to the 
Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations requesting 
information from the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>7. The methodology employed for the present report was based on the standard 
practices of commissions of inquiry and human rights investigations, adapted to the above 
challenge. The commission relied primarily on first-hand accounts to corroborate its 
findings. 
</p>
<p>8. The information contained in the present report is based on 258 interviews 
conducted in the region and from Geneva, including via Skype and telephone. The total 
number of interviews conducted since the mandate began in September 2011 now stands at 
2,091. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The commissioners are Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro (Chairperson), Karen Koning AbuZayd, Vitit  
</p>
<p>Muntarbhorn and Carla Del Ponte. 
 2  S-17/2/Add.1, A/HRC/19/69, A/HRC/21/50, A/HRC/22/59  and A/HRC/23/58. </p>


<p>9. Photographs, video recordings, satellite imagery and forensic and medical records  
were collected and analysed. Reports from Governments and non-governmental sources, 
academic analyses and United Nations reports formed part of the investigation. 
</p>
<p>10. The standard of proof used in previous reports remains. This standard is met when 
incidents are corroborated to a level where the commission has reasonable grounds to 
believe that incidents occurred as described. 
</p>
<p>11. The commission investigated a number of incidents that may be labelled as &#8220;terrorist 
attacks&#8221; or &#8220;terrorism&#8221;. Once the threshold of non-international armed conflict has been 
met, and the suspected perpetrators are parties to the conflict, the commission renders its 
assessment of an attack&#8217;s legality under the rubric of international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law. Any attack the sole purpose of which is to spread terror 
among the civilian population is prohibited. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political context 
</b></p>
<p>12. The situation in the Syrian Arab Republic was discussed in a June meeting of the 
Friends of Syria group in Doha and at the margins of the Group of Eight summit on 17 and 
18 June in Northern Ireland, with little apparent progress towards a solution to the conflict. 
As prospects for a political settlement stagnate, the warring parties&#8217; willingness to negotiate 
has been affected by military developments on the ground. 
</p>
<p>13. Despite the efforts of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the 
League of Arab States for Syria, agreement on a date for the proposed conference in 
Geneva remains elusive. The Government and the Kurdish Syrian forces have agreed, in 
principle, to send separate delegations to the conference. After making its participation 
conditional on a shift in military momentum, the Syrian National Coalition now appears to 
have agreed, in principle, to attend the conference.  
</p>
<p>14. Both the Government and anti-government armed groups believe that they can 
achieve a military victory. Their respective supporters afford them political coverage, 
financial assistance and military hardware, turning the Syrian conflict into a proxy war of 
regional and international interests.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. The parties  
</b></p>
<p>15. The Government continues to struggle to provide security and basic services in areas 
under its control where living conditions have further deteriorated. 
</p>
<p>16. The Syrian opposition remains marred by internal strife. On 6 July 2013, the Syrian 
National Coalition voted in a new President, Ahmad Asi Al-Jarba, almost three months 
after the resignation of Moaz Al-Khateeb. Two days later, Prime Minister Ghassan Hitto 
resigned, citing the inability to form an interim Government to be entrusted with the 
administration of areas under opposition control. On the ground, the political vacuum has 
fed the ongoing fragmentation and disintegration of political authority, as signalled by 
recent infighting in Latakia governorate between some anti-government armed groups.  
</p>
<p>17. In the north-east, friction over power-sharing emerged within the Kurdish political 
leadership, formally united under the Kurdish Supreme Council. Despite tensions, recent 
statements made by representatives of the Kurdish parties indicate that parliamentary 
elections are being prepared in the areas under Kurdish control. Elections will be preceded 
by a referendum on an interim constitution currently being drafted.  </p>


<p><b> 2. Regional dimension 
</b></p>
<p>18. The joint call made by Turkey and the Islamic Republic of Iran for a truce to come 
into force during Ramadan, which reiterated an appeal by the Secretary -General, was 
disregarded by all parties. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>19. Regional allies continued to provide military and financial support to the 
Government. Hizbullah now fights alongside government forces; young Iraqi Shiites are 
travelling to the Syrian Arab Republic to fight for the Government. The Government&#8217;s 
currency crisis has been temporarily stemmed by the extension of a $3.6 billion credit line 
from the Islamic Republic of Iran. A loan from the Russian Federation is reportedly under 
discussion, while pre-conflict arms deals between Moscow and Damascus continue to be 
honoured. 
</p>
<p>20. Influential Sunni clerics from several Arab States, including Saudi Arabia and 
Egypt, called on Sunnis to join the jihad against the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic and its supporters. Appeals, echoing an earlier call made by Al-Qaida leader 
Zawahiri, urged that money and weapons be provided to anti-government armed groups.  
</p>
<p>21. The conflict continues to affect the internal political dynamics of neighbouring 
countries. Nowhere is this more evident than in Lebanon: fierce clashes in Tripoli and 
Sidon; kidnappings, roadside bombs and cross-border shelling in the Beqaa Valley; rockets 
and a car bomb in Beirut, where a protester was killed during a sit-in in front of the 
Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, were just a few instances of spreading violence. 
Lebanon hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees: according to the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees, there were 665,978 as at 1 August. Jordan hosts more than 
500,000 refugees, a quarter concentrated in Zaatari camp on the northern border with the 
Syrian Arab Republic, provoking growing concerns about the impact on the Kingdom&#8217;s 
economy, security and stability.  
</p>
<p>22. On 5 July, Israel attacked a site near Latakia, apparently targeting Russian-made 
missiles. This, and previous attacks inside the Syrian Arab Republic, could lead to a 
reassessment of the conflict in the legal framework of an international armed conflict.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Military context 
</b></p>
<p>23. The conflict is deadlocked, with both warring parties convinced that a military 
victory is possible. This has led to an intensification of hostilities along distinct, though 
fluid, battle lines. Fighting continued, with both sides consolidating forces in their primary 
strongholds. Government forces continued to control major cities and lines of 
communications, while anti-government armed groups reinforced their presence in large 
swathes of the northern and eastern governorates, and areas along the Jordanian border. 
More regional actors were sponsoring flows of fighters and equipment, increasingly along 
sectarian lines, leading to a rise in corresponding violence. Meanwhile, the conflict has 
expanded beyond the country&#8217;s borders, re-igniting tensions in fragile neighbouring 
countries and threatening regional peace and security.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces 
</b></p>
<p>24. Government forces have seized the momentum in the past three months, recapturing 
some of the areas lost previously to the armed groups and consolidating their control over 
contested regions, particularly in Homs and Damascus countryside. 
</p>
<p>25. With the exception of Aleppo city, government forces reinforced their hold over 
major cities and economically important areas. Despite the efforts of armed groups, 
government forces successfully held most strategic military positions, air force bases and </p>


<p>main lines of communication in Aleppo and Idlib. They disrupted supply lines linking 
armed groups to their networks across the borders.  
</p>
<p>26. Government forces continued to rely on heavy and often indiscriminate firepower to 
target areas they were unwilling or unable to recapture through ground operations. A 
variety of fire assets, including missiles, jet fighters and artillery, were systematically 
employed against restive localities to prevent a return to normality under armed group 
control and to sanction the local population. 
</p>
<p>27. Battle-hardened and growing accustomed to fighting an insurgency, government 
forces benefited from wide logistical support and personnel provided by allies, including 
the deployment of military advisers. The army was invigorated by the increased support of 
the National Defence Forces 3 and by the involvement of foreign irregular forces, in 
particular Hizbullah. These regenerated combat power, replacing losses through deaths, 
defections and the increasingly difficult recruitment of new troops. 
</p>
<p>28. Defections continued to spare the core of military and security forces and steadily 
declined, even among the less-trusted units. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>29. Anti-government armed groups reinforced their control over large swathes of the 
northern and eastern governorates, but failed to hold key positions in Homs and Damascus. 
Persistent divisions and lack of logistical support seriously limited their operational 
capacity to face the latest offensives of government forces. 
</p>
<p>30. A number of diverse and initially profoundly divided insurgent groups have evolved 
into a more organized force. Alliances operated across several fronts, with increasing 
collaboration among groups. They failed, however, to unify their structures under a 
coherent command owing to their divergent objectives and resources. The efforts of the 
Supreme Joint Military Command Council were undermined by its inability to centralize 
logistical support and to integrate existing command networks. More recently, discord grew 
among groups with different loyalties, occasionally leading to confrontation over areas and 
resources. 
</p>
<p>31. The fluctuating and erratic support provided by a number of countries and wealthy 
individuals to the armed groups was sufficient to escalate hostilities, but is unlikely to 
fundamentally determine the course of the conflict. Support mainly benefited the armed 
groups operating along the borders. Those positioned in central areas recently lost control 
of their supply lines. 
</p>
<p>32. Anti-government armed groups were equipped mainly with small arms and light 
weapons, although they occasionally increased their use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft 
systems. They also employed mortars and artillery guns to target military and security 
positions, including those within residential areas. 
</p>
<p>33. Despite efforts to limit the extremists&#8217; influence in opposition circles, the 
radicalization of anti-government fighters continued. Alongside a growing number of 
foreign fighters, the discipline and operational abilities of radical fighters, combined with 
better access to reliable sponsors, allowed them to outmatch the fractious moderate groups. 
The most radical, such as Jabhat Al-Nusra and the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
(ISIS), developed their own strongholds in the north. ISIS subsumed the Islamic State of 
Iraq, a group which, with Al-Nusra, is on the sanctions list maintained by the Security 
Council Committee pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999). 
</p>
<p>  
 3 A/HRC/23/58, para. 22. </p>


<p><b> 3. Kurdish armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>34. Armed violence flared in Kurdish areas in the north-east, where the role of local 
militias in the conflict grew. Prioritizing their neutrality and the protection of Kurdish 
localities, the People&#8217;s Protection Units (YPG) clashed with both government forces and 
anti-government armed groups. There was a spike in tensions with radical anti-government 
armed groups. Intra-Kurdish disputes also arose. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Socioeconomic and humanitarian context 
</b></p>
<p>35. Since January 2013, the number of refugees has grown from approximately 600,000 
to more than 1.85 million.  
</p>
<p>36. The influx fuelled tensions between refugees and their host communities. In refugee 
camps, women and girls are vulnerable to sexual exploitation, forced marriage and 
trafficking. There are increasing incidents of domestic violence. Hardships compelled some 
refugees to return to the Syrian Arab Republic.  
</p>
<p>37. Oil exports decreased, partly owing to sanctions. Some oil fields are now controlled 
by opposition forces, including those affiliated with Al-Qaida, which benefit from sales.4 
The manufacturing sector contracted owing to both the destruction of factories and 
sanctions. The burning of crops and the disruption of agriculture raised prices of goods, 
including flour.  
</p>
<p>38. Notwithstanding the ever-growing number of people in need of urgent assistance, 
the Government and some anti-government armed groups obstructed the delivery of 
humanitarian assistance. Despite security constraints, some cross-line deliveries of aid were 
made, but were insufficient to meet the ever-growing needs of the affected population. 
Some locations remained inaccessible. Some 2.8 million people are in need inside the 
country. The situation is particularly dire in besieged areas of Aleppo, Homs and 
Damascus. 
</p>
<p>39. United Nations aid agencies have estimated that $3.1 billion is needed to aid the 
affected population, in the Syrian Arab Republic and in neighbouring countries, until the 
end of 2013. Only half the pledges made at the international donors&#8217; conference held in 
Kuwait in January 2013 have been fulfilled.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Violations concerning the treatment of civilians and hors de 
combat fighters 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Massacres and other unlawful killing</b>5<b> 
</b></p>
<p>40. Individuals were regularly killed in contravention of international law, which 
criminalizes both murder and execution without due process. International human rights 
law prohibits arbitrary deprivation of life. Common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions  
prohibits execution without previous judgement pronounced by regularly constituted courts 
affording judicial guarantees. 
</p>
<p>  
 4 In May 2013, the European Union voted to lift  sanctions to allow other opposition groups to sell the 
</p>
<p>oil they control. 
 5  See also annex II. </p>


<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces 
</b></p>
<p>41. Deaths in custody rose markedly. Deaths from torture were recorded in centres 
controlled by the Air Force, Political and General Intelligence and Military Security. Many 
cases were recorded in General Intelligence Branch 295, 20 km east of Damascus, and 
Branch 251, in Damascus. One former detainee held in the Al-Fehar Branch of Political 
Security in Al-Mezzeh (Damascus) barely survived. He detailed the deaths of others. 
Detainees were tortured to death in Military Security Branch 215 (Damascus). 
</p>
<p>42. Other unlawful killings included checkpoint shootings (Damascus, June), snipers 
killing civilians (Damascus countryside, June) and unlawful killing of civilians during 
ground operations (Homs, February, March, April and June; Hamah, February; Damascus 
countryside, June). 
</p>
<p>43. A &#8220;terrorism court&#8221; was established in Al-Mezzeh to hear cases that violate the 2012 
Anti-Terrorism Law. Accused were not informed of the allegation, nor were they afforded 
timely access to counsel. The Government also established military field courts. No legal 
representation, family visits or appeals were allowed, yet judges may confer capital 
sentences.  
</p>
<p>44. Unlawful killing was perpetrated by government forces as part of widespread attacks 
directed against the civilian population. The attacks included widespread shelling of 
villages, the burning of civilian objects, sniper attacks and systematic executions (see annex 
II). The coordination and active participation of Government institutions indicated the 
attacks were institutionalized and conducted as a matter of policy. Unlawful killing 
occurring during such attacks were crimes against humanity. Government forces also 
committed the war crime of murder, carried out executions without affording due process 
and arbitrarily deprived the right to life. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>45. On 8 June, ISIS fighters executed a 15-year-old boy, Mohamed Qatta, accused of 
blasphemy.  
</p>
<p>46. In June, an anti-government armed group killed a Catholic priest, Father Fran&#231;ois 
Murad, in Idlib. The priest was one of the only remaining Christians in the town of 
Ghassaniya. Jabhat Al-Nusra was active in Ghassaniya at the time. 
</p>
<p>47. Quasi-judicial mechanisms established by anti-government armed groups varied 
considerably across areas under their control. The lack of codified law led to an inconsistent 
administration of justice. Essential judicial and procedural guarantees were rarely accorded, 
and most judicial mechanisms did not reach the necessary level of independence and 
impartiality.  
</p>
<p>48. The punitive mechanisms established by some armed groups deny the right to 
counsel and the opportunity for appeal, given that executions were carried out immediately 
after sentencing. The close functional relationship between armed groups and courts 
compromised the independence and impartiality of the latter. 
</p>
<p>49. In Hamah, persons arrested or captured by armed brigades are transferred to one of 
two parallel quasi-judicial mechanisms, following military interrogation. The local security 
committee has jurisdiction over disputes between armed groups and minor criminal and 
civil offences. Serious cases, such as murder, are referred to the sharia committee in Bab 
Al-Hawa, Idlib. Those found guilty can be executed. A captured soldier or pro-government 
fighter who &#8220;confesses&#8221; faces immediate execution, without referral to the sharia 
committee. On 20 May, a captured soldier was executed in Qalat Al-Madiq after confessing 
to killing a fighter for the Free Syrian Army (FSA). </p>


<p>50. Military councils in Dara&#8217;a set up sharia courts to investigate allegations, operate 
detention facilities and conduct trials. In practice, court judges operate under the authority 
and instruction of the councils. Captured government soldiers or those that defected in 
Dara&#8217;a are reportedly not executed, but may be imprisoned for such crimes as spying. 
Those accused are not permitted defence counsel.  
</p>
<p>51. In Dayr az Zawr, armed groups accepted the jurisdiction of a local court. Judicial 
authority was exercised by legal scholars, religious scholars and legal professionals that had 
defected from the Government and applied a hybrid of Islamic and Syrian civil law.  
</p>
<p>52. The war crime of murder and the crime of executing without due process were 
perpetrated by anti-government armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Kurdish armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>53. In June, in the town of Amudah (Al Hasakah), several protestors were shot and 
killed by YPG forces. A 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy were among the deceased. 
Rocks and bottles had been thrown at YPG fighters, and they claimed that one of their 
ranks had been shot. The YPG committed an abuse of human rights associated with the 
disproportionate use of force. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention 
</b></p>
<p>54. Thousands of people have been apprehended since the conflict began. Most face a 
string of interwoven human rights violations, often culminating in their torture or death. 
Some bribe their way out; a relatively small number were &#8220;amnestied&#8221;. Others eventually 
appeared before a judge and were sentenced. Most languished in overcrowded cells with no 
access to judicial oversight, legal counsel or their families.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces 
</b></p>
<p>55. Since 2011, government forces have conducted arbitrary arrests on an enormous 
scale. Males over the age of 15 years were routinely arrested during raids. Arrests are 
increasingly made by entities with no or dubious arresting authority, such as the National 
Defence Forces. In June, Hizbullah arrested Syrians in Dayr Atiyah. Detainees were 
typically held for days outside the law and subjected to severe maltreatment before being 
transferred to security services.  
</p>
<p>56. A presidential decree promulgated in March required all 18-year-olds to report for 
military duty, or face arrest. Boys appearing to be 18 were detained at checkpoints. At Al-
Madakah checkpoint (Dara&#8217;a), soldiers routinely arrested and ill-treated young men on the 
pretext that they had not enlisted.  
</p>
<p>57. Internally displaced persons are especially vulnerable to arbitrary arrest as they fled 
conflict-affected areas, often without documents. Arrests appeared to be predicated on the 
person&#8217;s originating from a restive area or being a family member of wanted persons, such 
as defectors. Cases of internally displaced persons arrested at checkpoints were recorded in 
Al-Nabak (Damascus countryside), Al-Madakah (Dara&#8217;a), Qusayr, Al-Houlah (Homs), Al-
Bayda (Tartus) and Masharah (Al-Qunaytirah)<i>.</i> In May and June, in Job Al-Jarrah (Homs), 
National Defence Forces raided the area, arresting displaced Sunnis in what was viewed as 
an attempt to evict them.  
</p>
<p>58. In some cases, family members were arrested if the person wanted could not be 
found. In one case, a girl, released from detention in April in Damascus, was arrested to 
gain information on her brother&#8217;s activities. In Karnaz (Hamah) in March, soldiers detained 
the wife and children of a wanted man.  </p>


<p>59. Medical staff were arrested on the pretext of &#8220;having supported terrorists&#8221; when they 
provided medicine or medical aid to fighters. Many Red Crescent volunteers were detained 
for &#8220;assisting terrorists&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>60. The arrest or detention of persons on discriminatory grounds violated the State&#8217;s 
human rights obligations. Medical s taff are protected under international law irrespective of 
the party to which their patients belong. Depriving detainees of such fundamental rights as 
the presumption of innocence, being informed of the charges against them to having their 
detention reviewed by an independent authority violates international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>61. The number of people detained by anti-government armed groups is rising, as are 
instances of arbitrary arrest and illegal detention. In April, a doctor in Aleppo was detained 
for refusing to allow Jabhat Al-Nusra to hoist its flag over a field hospital. More than 150 
people were detained in the same location, and none had access to counsel. Family visits 
were also prohibited. In Ar Raqqah, ISIS is holding several hundred prisoners, including 
community activists and women. The legal basis for anti-government groups detaining 
individuals is unclear. There is no indication that detainees are being granted their 
fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Kurdish armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>62. In areas under Kurdish control, arbitrary arrest is also on the rise. In March, a 
woman protesting in Afrin against YPG was arrested. In May, YPG forces detained 
opposition activists. YPG was involved in &#8220;tit-for-tat&#8221; abductions with other opposition 
groups. While an ad hoc judicial mechanism exists, its efforts to exercise authority over 
detainees appear limited. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Hostage-taking 
</b></p>
<p>63. Hostage-taking and kidnapping have risen sharply. Armed men, motivated by 
financial gain or to exchange prisoners held by opposing forces, abduct and hold 
individuals under threat of death. Scores remain captive; others have been released after 
negotiation. In the period under review, dozens were killed. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces 
</b></p>
<p>64. Pro-government militia were involved in kidnappings in volatile areas across the 
Syrian Arab Republic. Multiple cases of kidnappings occurred among groups inside, and 
those laying siege to, Nubl (Aleppo). One interviewee described these abductions as &#8220;quite 
common&#8221;. In February, in Al-Hajar Al-Aswad (Damascus), two older men in a car were 
seized while passing through a checkpoint manned by National Defence Forces. Their 
families were later approached and ransom was sought for their release. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>65. Kidnapping and hostage-taking by armed groups also revolved around ransoms and 
prisoner exchange. On 25 March, following the arrest of a fighter&#8217;s wife and children by 
pro-government forces (see paragraphs 54 to 62), a group of fighters abducted three women 
from Al-Suqaylabiyah (Hamah). The kidnappers contacted a religious leader, and informed 
him of the abduction and the conditions for release. Abductees from both sides were 
allowed a phone call to their families. An exchange was negotiated and all women were 
released unharmed. </p>


<p>66. Both pro-government forces and anti-government armed groups engaged in hostage-
taking, in violation of international humanitarian and criminal law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Enforced disappearance   
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces  
</b></p>
<p>67. Instances of enforced disappearance have risen exponentially since the conflict 
began. By placing victims outside the protection of the law, government forces sewed terror 
among the civilian population.  
</p>
<p>68. Enforced disappearance infringes on a person&#8217;s fundamental human rights, including 
the rights to liberty, to personal security and to a fair trial. A crime under international law, 
it is a violation which persists for years after the initial arrest or abduction. It is a gateway 
to other offences, such as torture. 
</p>
<p>69. Enforced disappearance was carried out by government forces, including Air Force 
and Military Intelligence, and by National Defence Forces. In Aleppo, Damascus, Dara&#8217;a, 
Dayr az Zawr, Hamah and Homs, civilians were arrested following army raids. Individuals 
were abducted in their homes, at checkpoints, in mosques and in hospitals. Victims were 
taken to unknown locations, their whereabouts undisclosed.  
</p>
<p>70. Across the country, families wait &#8211; sometimes for extended periods &#8211; to know the 
fate and whereabouts of their relatives. One interviewee&#8217;s brother was arrested in Dara&#8217;a in 
March 2012 by members of Security Branch 215, and has not yet reappeared.  
</p>
<p>71. Families have justified fears that searching for their relatives may lead to reprisals. 
Some who reported a disappearance were themselves detained. Authorities also refused to 
provide information or to acknowledge arrests. One defector, who worked in Air Force 
Intelligence in a central governorate until late 2012, cited orders that information about 
detainees was not to be provided to their relatives. The desperation of families has left them 
vulnerable to extortion. Some families pay bribes to those who &#8211; often falsely &#8211; claimed 
they could provide information.  
</p>
<p>72. In most cases, the only way to obtain information is when a detainee is released. One 
interviewee, held for over a year by an intelligence agency, was confronted upon his release 
by dozens of women thrusting photographs of their male relatives towards him, hoping he 
might have seen them during his detention.  
</p>
<p>73. Most frequently targeted are males over the age of 15. In some cases, however, 
elderly women and children have been &#8220;disappeared&#8221;. One interviewee reported that, 
following the army&#8217;s counter-offensive in Bab Amr in March, soldiers abducted his 
neighbours, including women and children. These families were not seen again. Medical 
personnel, internally displaced persons and individuals fleeing the violence have also 
vanished. On 8 June, a family fleeing fighting in Al-Waar neighbourhood, Homs city, was 
stopped by soldiers. The husband was arrested and taken to an unknown location.  
</p>
<p>74. Enforced disappearance is used by government and pro-government forces as a 
strategy of war, to stifle dissent and to spread terror within society. It is committed as part 
of a widespread attack against a civilian population, with knowledge of the attack, and 
constitutes a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Torture and ill-treatment  
</b></p>
<p>75. Torture remains widespread. Severe physical and mental pain and suffering is 
deliberately inflicted to obtain information or confessions, as punishment, to intimidate or </p>


<p>coerce. The prohibition of torture under international human rights law and humanitarian 
law is absolute, triggering both State and individual responsibility. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Government, including its intelligence agencies, employed widespread, 
systematic torture to interrogate, intimidate and punish its perceived opponents. Torture 
was used in detention centres, security branches, prisons and hospitals.  
</p>
<p>77. Previously reported torture methods remained in use across the country. Many of the 
victims interviewed carried visible scars consistent with their accounts and exhibited 
symptoms of psychological trauma.  
</p>
<p>78. Interviewees consistently identified Air Force Intelligence (AFI) as one of the worst 
perpetrators. In Hamah, AFI detainees were beaten upon arrest and tortured during 
interrogations. According to an AFI defector in Hamah, personnel who used torture faced 
no disciplinary measures.  
</p>
<p>79. Military Security interrogated those apprehended by the army and routinely used 
torture. One detainee, arrested in Dara&#8217;a city in mid-May, was released from Military 
Security three weeks later with a broken leg and multiple cigarette burns on his back. 
Another former detainee described being tortured in Military Security Branch 235. 
</p>
<p>80. Victims in these centres were subjected to previously undocumented torture 
methods. Military Intelligence officers used water torture, such as simulated drowning, at 
Branch 227. Detainees in the Al-Fehar Branch in Damascus were held in solitary 
confinement &#8220;squatting cells&#8221;, in which it was impossible to stand upright or lie down. One 
detainee was held in such conditions for 10 months, beaten daily, suspended by his wrists 
for 17 days, burned with cigarettes and subjected to electric shocks.  
</p>
<p>81. Where detainees were brought before Government courts in Aleppo city, they bore 
evident marks of torture, which were ignored by the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>82. Medical professionals at some military hospitals were co-opted into the 
maltreatment of hospitalized detainees.  
</p>
<p>83. Security and intelligence services operated detention centres within Abdul Gadir Al-
Shagafi Military Hospital in Al-Waar, Homs, and at Al-Mezzeh Military Hospital in 
Damascus. Detainees were brought in bound and blindfolded. They were registered 
according to the number of the detaining authority. Security personnel guard ed the 
detainees and acted as intermediaries between patient and doctor. 
</p>
<p>84. Cases were recorded of patients being tortured in these hospitals in coordination 
with various security branches. Patients were reportedly beaten in the guarded 14-bed ward 
of Al-Mezzeh Military Hospital.  
</p>
<p>85. The bodies of those tortured to death in Abdul Gadir Al-Shagafi Military Hospital 
and in State Security in Damascus were transferred to hospital morgues. Most bodies were 
not returned to their families. Some were returned to their family in exchange for a signed 
statement confirming that the victim had been killed by &#8220;terrorists&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>86. Multiple reports were received of beatings and ill-treatment at checkpoints and other 
points of arrest. Most victims were men accused of assisting the opposition, and they were 
often transferred to Military Security and tortured during interrogations. A man was 
arrested in January at a checkpoint in Khalidiyeh (Homs). He was detained until his death 
in June. His body was covered with injuries consistent with extensive beating and 
whipping.  </p>


<p>87. Beatings were documented at the checkpoint at the entry of Dara&#8217;a, operated by 
Military Security, the checkpoint in Deir Baalbah operated by Political Security and at 
checkpoints along the Homs-Damascus highway, which contained short-term detention 
facilities where detainees were beaten prior to their transfer to the Military Intelligence, 
outside Masharah (Al-Qunaytirah) and in Al-Ashrafiyah (Aleppo).  
</p>
<p>88. Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
were perpetrated by government forces as part of a widespread and systematic attack 
directed against a civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of an organizational 
policy. The involvement and active participation of government institutions indicated that 
torture was institutionalized and employed as a matter of policy. The crime against 
humanity of torture and cruel treatment was perpetrated with impunity by Syrian 
intelligence agencies, in particular Military and Air Force Intelligence, as well as the 
Military Security services. Such conduct is also prosecutable as a war crime.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>89. Some anti-government armed groups mistreated and tortured persons in their 
custody. While such violations were committed in isolated instances, there are strong 
indications that such practices are on the rise. 
</p>
<p>90. In mid-May, members of a sharia committee in northern Aleppo city arrested and 
detained several activists following a peaceful demonstration, and subjected them to 
physical violence, including beating them on the soles of their feet. 
</p>
<p>91. Liwa Asifat Al-Shamal operated a 300-person capacity prison in Azaz (Aleppo) 
where, as a method of interrogation, detainees were put in a 1.5 m deep hole in the ground 
and covered with sheet metal for 48 hours.  
</p>
<p>92. On 19 July, the Saddam Hussein Battalion, part of the Liwa Al-Tawheed military 
police, beat and tortured a man using the <i>dulab</i> method.6  
</p>
<p>93. Some ant-government armed groups perpetrated the war crime of torture. The 
infliction of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is also a violation of 
international human rights law and humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Kurdish armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>94. In February, YPG forces in Afrin beat anti-government protesters and detained 
persons affiliated with the FSA. Accounts were received of the setting up of makeshift 
prisons near Afrin, where detainees were beaten. The YPG has inflicted cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, a violation of international human rights law and 
humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>95. Sexual violence has played a prominent role in the conflict, owing to the fear and 
threat of rape and by the violence committed. It occurs during raids, at checkpoints and in 
detention centres and prisons across the country. The threat of rape is used as a tool to 
terrorize and punish women, men and children perceived as being associated with the 
opposition. Underreporting and delayed reported of sexual violence is endemic, making an 
assessment of its magnitude difficult.  
</p>
<p>  
 6  See A/HRC/23/58, para. 83. </p>


<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces 
</b></p>
<p>96. Sexual violence was committed against women during raids by pro-government 
forces in Dara&#8217;a, Hamah and Tartus. A woman was raped by a security officer during a raid 
in Dara&#8217;a in December 2012. A National Defence Force fighter attempted to rape a woman 
in her home in Tartus during a raid in May.  
</p>
<p>97. Detention centres and prisons were the locations most often cited for sexual 
violence. In late April, a woman released from the Political Intelligence branch in 
Damascus described how she had been forced to orally copulate with her interrogators. A 
woman detained at Al-Mezzeh in Damascus in December 2012 described the rape of 
cellmates. In late January, FSA fighters captured a detention centre in Dayr az Zawr and 
found a family among the prisoners. Under threat that her children would be killed, the 
mother was raped and forced to clean and cook for her captors.  
</p>
<p>98. The threat of rape was used as a tool to coerce confessions. Two women, held at Al-
Mezzeh and Branch 235 in Damascus respectively, were told by their interrogators that 
their daughters would be raped if they did not confess. A nurse held at a police station in 
Damascus was threatened with gang rape if she failed to reveal whom she was treating.  
</p>
<p>99. Women were harassed, insulted and, in some instances, beaten at checkpoints in 
Damascus, Dara&#8217;a, Homs and Al-Qunaytirah. A university student was raped at a 
checkpoint in Dara&#8217;a in early 2013 because her brother was wanted by the Government. 
Afterwards, the FSA arranged for her to marry someone in order to &#8220;protect her honour&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>100. Rape and other inhumane acts, as crimes against humanity, were committed by 
government forces and the National Defence Forces. Rape and inhuman treatment are also 
prosecutable as war crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> G. </b>Violation of children&#8217;s rights <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces  
</b></p>
<p>101. Most child deaths and injuries were caused by shelling and aerial bombardments. On 
4 June, a missile strike on Kafr Hamrah (Aleppo) killed 63 people, including 10 young 
children. There were no military targets nearby. On 12 June, during the shelling of Tell Al-
Shaykh (Dara&#8217;a), a 13-year-old girl was severely wounded when a shell struck her house. 
Her mother died and her two sisters were seriously injured in the attack.  
</p>
<p>102. Children were the victims of executions. When pro-government forces raided Al-
Bayda (Tartus) on 2 May, boys aged around 13 to 15 years were killed alongside adult men. 
On 10 April, in Khirbet Al-Teen (Homs), a Bedouin family was killed. The adults were 
shot, while the four children had their throat cut (see also annex II). 
</p>
<p>103. Young men join &#8211; sometimes voluntarily, sometimes forcibly &#8211; the army and the 
National Defence Forces. Three 17-year-old boys were forcibly recruited at checkpoints in 
Aleppo; one was killed within two weeks. Young recruits  were reportedly mistreated and 
pushed towards frontlines by older soldiers. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds have been observed 
in the National Defence Forces. 
</p>
<p>104. In June, 10 boys aged 14 to 17 years, who were with a group of around 50 civilians 
displaced from Homs, were taken from a bus, forced to strip naked and were beaten at a 
checkpoint run by Political Security in Deir Baalbah (Homs). They were later released.  
</p>
<p>105. Adult detainees regularly reported the detention and torture of children as young as 
13 in detention facilities. </p>


<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>106. Children were killed when armed groups indiscriminately shell civilian areas. On 15 
June, a 10-year-old boy in Al-Fou&#8217;a (Idlib) was killed by indiscriminate shelling from 
positions in neighbouring Binnish.  
</p>
<p>107. On 8 June, three armed men executed 15-year-old Mohamed Qatta in Aleppo. Two 
children were among 27 people killed in Hatla (Dayr az Zawr) on 10 June (see annex II). 
</p>
<p>108. Some armed groups recruited children under the age of 18. The ranks of both Liwa 
Al-Tawheed and Jabhat Al-Nusra included fighters between the ages of 14 and 18. Younger 
fighters were not armed with heavy weaponry, but underwent a training programme and 
participated in hostilities on the front. One fighter explained that children were recruited 
because &#8220;they fight with enthusiasm; they are fearless&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>109. A 13-year-old boy enlisted with an FSA brigade in Dara&#8217;a after his school ceased to 
operate. He was not allowed to carry weapons or ammunition but used as a porter, whose 
duties included carrying the wounded and medicines, and preparing ammunition. He was 
seriously wounded in May. Another boy, who provided support services to an FSA -
affiliated group, joined when he was 13 years old after seeing his father humiliated at a 
checkpoint. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Kurdish armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>110. In Afrin (Aleppo) and Al Hasakah, the YPG recruited boys and girls from the age of 
</p><p>12. In late 2012, large numbers were recruited to counter an attempt by Jabhat Al-Nusra to 
enter Al Hasakah from Turkey.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violations concerning the conduct of hostilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Unlawful attacks 
</b></p>
<p>111. Most civilian deaths result from indiscriminate or disproportionate shelling. These 
unlawful attacks are a primary reason for the movement of people inside the Syrian Arab 
Republic and over its borders. 
</p>
<p>112. Unlawful attacks by government forces were documented in almost every 
governorate. In particular, towns and villages hosting internally displaced persons from 
restive areas, such as Homs, were relentlessly assaulted. 
</p>
<p>113. Some anti-government armed groups &#8211; notably in northern Aleppo and in Idlib 
countryside &#8211; also shelled indiscriminately. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces 
</b></p>
<p>114. Across the country, the Government shelled civilian areas with artillery, mortars and 
rockets. Aerial bombardment by helicopters and jet fighters was common and, in some 
areas, a daily occurrence. Imprecise weaponry, such as surface-to-surface missiles and 
cluster munitions, was regularly used. Defectors indicated that there was a retributive 
element to some attacks, to &#8220;punish&#8221; civilians for the presence of armed groups. 
</p>
<p>115. Government forces continued to fiercely shell and bombard contested areas of 
strategic importance (see annex III for a description of the attack on Al Qusayr and the 
surrounding villages by government forces and Hizbullah).  
</p>
<p>116. Across Homs, shelling and bombardments have intensified since April. Civilian 
populations residing in Job Al-Jarrah, Houlaia, Al-Houlah, Al-Talif, Ain Tamora, </p>


<p>Talkalakh, Dar Al-Kabirah, Al-Ghantu, Teir Maalah and opposition-controlled 
neighbourhoods in Homs city came under attack. In Al-Qaryatayn, shelling increased in 
April and became near-continuous in the days leading up to the ground attack of 24 June. 
On 18 May, in Al-Talif, a rocket landed in the house of a displaced family from Al-Houlah, 
killing a woman and her three children. Between 7 and 9 June, 22 civilians who had been 
internally displaced from other areas of Homs were killed by shells. In April, in eastern 
Homs, more than a dozen civilians attempting to flee towards Jordan were killed when a 
checkpoint shelled a truck. 
</p>
<p>117. Accounts received from those who fled western Homs countryside, particularly the 
Al Qusayr region, emphasized that the attacks had displaced the Sunni population. Most 
believed this to be a deliberate policy. The fact that some attacks were launched by 
Hizbullah and that many of the Government&#8217;s artillery positions were located within Shia 
villages led to a strong undercurrent of sectarianism in the interpretation of events by thos e 
who lived through them. 
</p>
<p>118. As civilians fled Homs into north-eastern Damascus, the shelling and bombardment 
of localities hosting internally displaced persons intensified. This occurred in Al-Nabak, Al-
Qarah, Yabrud and Dayr Atiyah. Soldiers extorted money from civilians in these areas in 
exchange for a temporary cessation of the attacks. Government forces continued to shell 
and bombard areas south of Damascus city, including Darayya, Jbeb, Ramadan and Adra.  
</p>
<p>119. Between April and July, civilians in northern rural Hamah (Kafr Zita, Howija, Qalat 
Al-Madiq, Al-Hawash, Halfaya and Tremseh) came under sustained attack. Artillery shells 
were launched from army checkpoints and from within pro-government towns, such as Al-
Suqaylabiyah. In Halfaya, the shelling presaged the ground attack by pro-Government 
forces of 19 May. Government forces also fired cluster munitions into Halfaya between 12 
and 16 May.  
</p>
<p>120. Shelling and aerial bombardment, including the dropping of barrel bombs, continued 
in towns across northern Aleppo. Indiscriminate attacks were recorded in Mare&#8217;a, Azan, 
Anadan, Hreitan, Kafr Hamrah, Al-Atarib and Tal Rifat. Surface-to-surface missiles were 
widely used, resulting in many civilian casualties.7  
</p>
<p>121. In Idlib towns where civilians remain, such as Taftanaz, Salqin and Jisr-Ash-
Shughur, indiscriminate shelling by government forces caused excessive civilian casualties. 
Cluster munitions were used extensively in these areas. 
</p>
<p>122. In Dara&#8217;a, planes continued to bomb Dara&#8217;a city, notably the Tariq Asad area. Also 
shelled were Tafas, Inkhel, Al-Musayfrah, Nawa, Khirbet Ghazalah and Maarbeh.  
</p>
<p>123. The shelling and aerial bombardment of opposition-controlled areas of Dayr az Zawr 
city and Muhassan continued. Surface-to-surface missiles were fired on these locations, 
where civilians still resided. Similarly, in Ar Raqqah governorate, Ar Raqqah city and Al-
Tabqah came under artillery and mortar fire, as well as barrel bombing. Attacks intensified 
in early June, with a corresponding increase in civilian cas ualties. In Al Hasakah 
governorate, Government forces shelled Al-Hamis and Zahiriya villages in March after 
they fell under opposition control. 
</p>
<p>124. Indiscriminate sniper fire resulted in civilian casualties, including children, in 
Aleppo and Dara&#8217;a cities . 
</p>
<p>  
 7  The photographs contained in annex IV show the impact site of a missile strike in Al-Nayrab, 
</p>
<p>southern Aleppo city, which destroyed approximately 12 buildings.  </p>


<p>125. Government forces conducted their military operations in flagrant disregard of the 
distinction between civilians and persons directly participating in hostilities. The 
Government should take greater precautions to protect civilians inside areas where military 
operations are conducted. Precautions include the use of more targeted weaponry and the 
cessation of use of barrel bombs, poorly-guided missiles and cluster munitions. 
</p>
<p>126. Government forces continued to position military objectives inside towns  and 
villages, including Nubl and Zahra (Aleppo), Fou&#8217;a (Idlib) and Shia villages in south -
western Homs, thus endangering the civilian population and violating international legal 
obligations. As the residents of these localities tend to be predominantly Shia, Alawite and 
Christian, such positioning contributed to rising sectarian tensions. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>127. Armed groups continue to operate within civilian areas, violating international legal 
obligations to avoid positioning military objectives within or near densely populated areas. 
In several locations, including Kafr Zita (Hamah), Al-Qaryatayn (Homs) and Al-Nabak 
(Damascus), armed groups took care to base themselves away from the civilian population. 
Some fighters, however, including those in Aleppo city, live among civilians, exposing 
them to attack. 
</p>
<p>128. Anti-government armed groups, led by Liwa Al-Tawheed, continued to shell Nubl 
and Zahra in northern Aleppo using artillery and home-made rockets. Forces positioned 
inside the villages shelled nearby opposition-controlled villages.  
</p>
<p>129. From March to July, a coalition of armed groups, including Ahrar Al Sham, Liwa 
Al-Tawheed and Jabhat Al-Nusra, shelled Aleppo central prison. In Aleppo city, armed 
groups fired rockets and shells indiscriminately into Government-controlled 
neighbourhoods. 
</p>
<p>130. Armed groups based in Binnish, Idlib, continued to launch home-made rockets and 
artillery shells on Fou&#8217;a villages. While there were Government shelling positions 
(targeting Taftanaz and Binnish) in Fou&#8217;a, armed groups made no distinction between 
civilian and military objectives  for shelling, causing several civilian deaths. 
</p>
<p>131. For information on the shelling of villages in south-west Homs countryside by anti-
government armed groups, see annex III. 
</p>
<p>132. Reports were received of snipers from armed groups shooting indiscriminately into 
Government-controlled neighbourhoods of Aleppo city, causing civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>133. Anti-government armed groups used mortars, rockets and snipers in a manner that 
made no distinction civilian and military objectives, thereby committing unlawful attacks. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Undetermined perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>134. Two bombings, both in Damascus, were reported during the period under review. 
On 11 June, there was a double suicide bombing in Marjeh Square, killing 14 people and 
injuring 30 others. The target appeared to be a nearby police station. On 27 June, a suicide 
bombing occurred in a Christian neighbourhood, killing four people. The likely target was a 
nearby Shia charity. No party claimed responsibility. These bombings demonstrated no 
clear military objective and spread terror among the civilian population.  
</p>
<p>135. While the above-mentioned acts constitute crimes under domestic law, they may, if 
it is determined that the perpetrators are parties to the conflict, also amount to war crimes. </p>


<p><b> B. Specifically protected persons and objects  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Hospitals and health-care personnel 
</b></p>
<p>136. Across the country, hospitals were destroyed and medical personnel targeted. Sick 
and wounded civilians and hors de combat fighters were left to languish without treatment.  
</p>
<p>137. Under common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, parties to the conflict must 
ensure that the wounded and sick are cared for. Hospitals and medical personnel must be 
respected and protected at all times and must not be the object of attack. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Government and pro-government forces  
</b></p>
<p>138. Attacks on hospitals and health-care facilities were documented in Hamah, Homs, 
Idlib, Dara&#8217;a, Ar Raqqah and Damascus.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>139. In mid-May, during the ground operation on Halfaya (Hamah), government forces 
deliberately shelled a field hospital, resulting in death and injury of medical personnel and 
the destruction of the facility. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>140. In the course of attacks on opposition-controlled areas in Homs, on 16 May, 
government forces destroyed a children&#8217;s hospital in Dar Al-Kabirah and, in late May, 
shelled a field hospital in Al-Houlah. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>141. On 24 May, two rockets hit a field hospital in Taftanaz, Idlib. They were fired in 
close succession, indicating that the hospital had been targeted. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>142. Field hospitals in Dara&#8217;a were systematically targeted and shelled, killing medical 
staff and patients. Given that the hospitals were forced to close, the wounded were left 
unattended. Although some hospitals remain operational in basements of civilian homes, 
there is a severe shortage in medicine and qualified staff. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>143. In early June, a field hospital in the Al-Qalamoun region was shelled, leading to the 
wounding and death of patients. First responders were killed in a second shelling attack. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>144. On 20 June, government forces bombarded the national hospital in Ar Raqqah. 
Three medical staff members were injured and the intensive care unit was destroyed. 
</p>
<p>145. Medical personnel were targeted and killed while performing their duties. A pattern 
of arrests, harassment and intimidation of health-care professionals was observed (see 
paragraphs 54 to 62 above). 
</p>
<p>146. Government forces misused health-care facilities for military purposes, 
compromising their neutral status. Abdul Gadir Al-Shagafi Military Hospital in Al-Waar 
(Homs) was used as a military base to launch attacks on Al-Waar and Juret Al-Sheyah. 
Snipers were positioned on the roof of the hospital, with tanks and artillery around its 
perimeter. In late May, prior to the Al-Qusayr offensive, government forces deployed inside 
its hospitals.  
</p>
<p>147. There was a significant presence of security services in State hospitals in Qamishli 
(Al Hasakah) and Damascus. Nurses working in Damascus hospitals received instructions 
to deny medical aid to members of the opposition, any of whom elected not to seek medical 
assistance in hospitals based on a well-founded fear of arrest, detention, torture or death. 
</p>
<p>148. The Government has violated its obligations under international humanitarian law, 
deliberately obstructing the efforts of the sick and wounded to receive help. Government 
forces deliberately targeted field hospitals to gain military advantage by depriving the 
opposition and those perceived to support them of medical assistance for injuries sustained, </p>


<p>committing the war crime of attacking protected objects. Such attacks spread terror among 
the civilian population. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>149. On 28 May, Liwa Shuhada Al-Huran attacked the national hospital in Dara&#8217;a. No 
warning was given prior to the attack. The attack violated international humanitarian law 
and amounts to the war crime of attacking protected objects. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Cultural property 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Government and pro-government forces  
</i></p>
<p>150. Government forces attacked cultural property as military targets. On 13 July, 
government forces aerially bombarded Krak des Chevaliers, a UNESCO World Heritage 
site in Homs, causing severe damage to a fortress tower. The commission was unable to 
confirm allegations that anti-government groups were stationed there at the time. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Anti-government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>151. In the two days following the attack on Hatla (Dayr az Zawr) on 11 June, Jabhat Al-
Nusra fighters looted and detonated explosives placed within the Shia <i>hussainiat</i> of Imam 
Al-Hussein and Imam Murtada and the Shia Al-Rasoul Al-Muaddam mosque. These places 
of worship were targeted deliberately as part of an attack on a Shia locality. 
</p>
<p>152. Prior to April, a church in Ghassaniya (Idlib) was vandalized, its statues 
dismembered and icons painted over. According to the remaining priest, extremist anti-
government fighters carried out the attack. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Journalists 
</b></p>
<p>153. The Syrian Arab Republic has become the world&#8217;s most dangerous (and, in 2012, 
the deadliest) country for media workers. Syrian and international journalists have been 
killed, arbitrarily arrested, detained, tortured and disappeared in the line of duty. Several 
Syrian journalists have gone into voluntary exile. 
</p>
<p>154. As many as 84 journalists have been killed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 
2011. The figure comprises citizen journalists and <i>netizens </i>(people who reported on the 
ongoing violence through social media).  
</p>
<p>155. To date, more than a dozen local and international journalists on assignment in the 
Syrian Arab Republic remain missing. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Government and pro-government forces 
</b></p>
<p>156. On 5 July, Fida Al-Baali, also known as Mohammed Moaz, a reporter with <i>Orient 
News</i> and a citizen journalist, died of injuries sustained the month before while covering 
government shelling of Qabun, north of Damascus. 
</p>
<p>157. The Government arbitrarily arrested, detained and tortured journalists. On 16 
February 2012, 13 journalists from the Damascus -based Syrian Centre for Media and 
Freedom of Expression were arrested by Air Force Intelligence and detained at Al-Mezzeh. 
Some of the men were severely tortured. To date, three of them &#8211; Mazen Darwish, the 
Centre Director, Hussein Ghrer and Hani Al-Zeitani &#8211; remain in detention at Damascus 
Central Prison and face charges of &#8220;promoting terrorist acts&#8221;. Their next hearing at the 
terrorism court in Damascus was set for 21 August.  </p>


<p><b> 7. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>158. Al-Ikhbariya correspondent Yara Abbas was killed on 27 May when her crew&#8217;s 
vehicle came under fire from anti-government armed groups in Al Qusayr. 
</p>
<p>159. Some armed groups detained journalists for extended periods. Their subsequent 
release without trial, and the confiscation in some cases of their equipment, indicates an 
intent to prevent journalists from performing their professional work. In two separate 
incidents, Jabhat Al-Nusra Muhajireen Brigade was involved. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Pillaging and destruction of property 
</b></p>
<p>160. Appropriating property for private or personal use (pillaging) in the context of an 
armed conflict is a war crime. Deliberately destroying the property of an adversary in the 
absence of military necessity is illegal under international humanitarian law. Instances of 
both violations were recorded. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces 
</b></p>
<p>161. Government forces intentionally destroyed the homes, farms and  businesses of 
defectors, suspected anti-government members and supporters during raids. Properties were 
searched and then looted before being destroyed. This occurred during raids in Baniyas 
(Tartus) on 2 and 3 May; Musayfrah (Dara&#8217;a), on 11 February; Dahadil (Damascus), in 
February; Karnaz (Hamah), on 25 March; Halfaya (Hamah), on 16 May; and Ramadan 
(Damascus), on 9 June. 
</p>
<p>162. Soldiers transported loot in military vehicles. One interviewee reported that looted 
objects were available at markets in Damascus, and that government forces returning from 
operations in Darayya &#8220;sold the stolen goods along the street in Athar&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>163. Checkpoints have also been a point of unlawful appropriation. In May, internally 
displaced persons from anti-government areas were targeted at checkpoints in the Al-
Qalamoun region (Damascus) and in Inkhel (Dara&#8217;a). 
</p>
<p>164. Through bulldozing and detonations, neighbourhoods were razed to clear areas near 
military objectives, such as bases and airports.  
</p>
<p>165. Residential areas in Damascus, Dara&#8217;a and the neighbourhoods of Mosha Arbeen 
and Wadi Al-Jawz (Hamah) were also razed. 
</p>
<p>166. On 5 June, government forces demolished civilian houses in eastern Inkhel, located 
around the perimeter of the 15th Brigade. According to a former resident, the demolitions 
were aimed at increasing visibility of the town and targeted houses that could be used, by 
virtue of their location, by anti-government armed group fighters. 
</p>
<p>167. Demolitions in Mosha Arbeen, Wadi Al-Jawz and Inkhel targeted civilian objects 
whose destruction could yield military advantage. The destruction of neighbourhoods 
caused a level of harm to civilian property that is excessive in relation to the concrete and 
direct military advantage anticipated. Such disproportionate attacks violate international 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>168. Government forces committed the war crime of pillage. They also violated 
international human rights law pertaining to arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, 
family and home. </p>


<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>169. In Hatla (Dayr az Zawr), Shia homes and religions sites were deliberately destroyed 
after clashes on 10 and 11 May (see annex II). Groups affiliated with Jabhat Al-Nusra 
committed the crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Illegal weapons 
</b></p>
<p>170. Allegations were received regarding the use of chemical weapons, predominantly by 
government forces. On the evidence currently available, it was not possible to reach a 
finding about the chemical agents used, their delivery systems or the perpetrators. 
Investigations are ongoing.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Sieges and attacks on food security 
</b></p>
<p>171. Sieges continued to be imposed across the country, with harrowing consequences for 
civilians. The use of starvation as a method of warfare is prohibited under the laws of war. 
Parties to the conflict must allow the unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Sieges 
</i></p>
<p>172. Government and pro-government forces laid siege to towns and villages in Homs, 
Damascus, Dara&#8217;a, Al-Qunaytirah and Dayr az Zawr. Such sieges appeared to be calculated 
to render the conditions of life unbearable, forcing civilians to flee.  
</p>
<p>173. Most recorded sieges were in Homs, where supplies of food, water, fuel, medicine 
and electricity have been blocked or drastically curtailed since late 2012. Government 
forces, supported by Hizbullah, intensified sieges and imposed new ones in the weeks 
leading up to ground attacks. This strategy was particularly visible in relation to the May 
attack on Al Qusayr (see annex III).  
</p>
<p>174. In May, as military operations in the Al Qusayr area commenced, sieges intensified 
in Al-Talif and Al-Buweydah. In Al-Talif, supplies of food were blocked by soldiers 
stationed at Jibreen checkpoint. In May, government forces seized Abel village and a siege 
was imposed on Al-Buweydah. Opposition-controlled areas of Homs city remain under 
siege.  
</p>
<p>175. In May, soldiers and pro-government forces imposed sieges in areas north-east of 
Damascus city, where displaced persons from Al Qusayr had fled. In the Al-Qalamoun 
area, government-controlled checkpoints  prevented the flow of food and medicine. 
Hizbullah fighters reinforced the siege of Harasta and Dumah in eastern Damascus 
countryside. Areas of southern Damascus, including Yarmuk and Al-Asali, as well as 
Muadamiyah, in western Damascus countryside, remained besieged. 
</p>
<p>176. In Dara&#8217;a, government checkpoints enforced a siege on Dara&#8217;a city and on Al-Lijah 
villages. In Damascus and Dara&#8217;a governorates, armed groups were periodically able to 
smuggle food to civilians. 
</p>
<p>177. In Al-Qunaytirah, a siege was imposed on Masharah. Government forces prevented 
incoming supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine. In addition, the village water tower 
and electricity generator were shelled. </p>


<p>178. Areas of Dayr az Zawr city under armed group control had their supplies of food, 
potable water, electricity and fuel cut. The use of untreated water from the river resulted in 
health problems in the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>179. Government forces and Hizbullah imposed sieges, violating their obligations under 
international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Attacks on food security 
</i></p>
<p>180. In the agricultural areas of northern Hamah governorate, the burning of harvests 
around Kafr Zita, Kafr Nabudah, Halfaya, Qalat Al-Madiq, Al-Howija and Tremseh were 
recorded in late May 2013. 
</p>
<p>181. In Homs governorate, harvests were burned in Al-Houlah, Al-Talif, Teir Maalah and 
Job Al-Jarrah in June. 
</p>
<p>182. Wheat and barley harvests were set alight around Taftanaz, Idlib, in late May. The 
blaze followed the shelling from artillery positions located in Fou&#8217;a villages. 
</p>
<p>183. Between April and June, government forces fired shells and mortars into fields in 
Anadan, Hreitan and Mare&#8217;a, burning crops. 
</p>
<p>184. In Hamah and Homs governorates, farmers trying to extinguish fires were shot at by 
soldiers at nearby checkpoints. 
</p>
<p>185. During ground attacks in Ramadan (Damascus) on 9 June, and in Al-Qaraytayn 
(Homs) on 24 June, security forces killed and burned cattle and other livestock. In a ground 
attack on Halfaya (Hamah) on 16 May, government forces burned crops and looted farm 
equipment. 
</p>
<p>186. That the attacks on the crops took placed immediately prior to the harvesting period  
suggests that they were carried out with the deliberate aim of limiting the availability of 
food. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Sieges 
</i></p>
<p>187. Since July 2012, armed groups in northern Aleppo have surrounded Nubl and Zahra, 
blocking food, fuel and medical supplies to its residents and government forces inside. The 
siege is enforced by multiple groups, including Liwa Al-Tawheed, Liwa Ahrar Sourya, 
Liwa Al-Fatih and Jabhat Al-Nusra. The Government has periodically brought supplies by 
helicopter. 
</p>
<p>188. Since April, armed groups &#8211; including Liwa Al-Tawheed, Jabhat Al-Nusra and 
Ghoraba Al-Sham &#8211; have besieged the predominantly Kurdish town of Afrin. Armed 
groups believed that supplies of food and other necessities were flowing to Nubl through 
YPG checkpoints. Clashes broke out as armed groups sought to seize these checkpoints. 
Shortly thereafter, supplies of food and electricity were cut to Afrin. With no clean water 
entering the town, there has been a rise in infectious diseases. 
</p>
<p>189. In April, armed groups imposed a siege on the Aleppo central prison following the 
movement of soldiers and National Defence Force fighters into the prison. Armed groups 
blocked supplies of food and medicine. In late July, the siege was temporarily  lifted after 80 
political prisoners were released. 
</p>
<p>190. In laying siege, anti-government armed groups in Aleppo violated their obligations 
under international law. </p>


<p><b> V. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>191. In conferring its mandate to the commission, the Human Rights Council, sought to 
hold to account those responsible for violations and abuses of international law.8 The 
commission continues to keep record of those it reasonably believes to be responsible for 
the crimes and violations noted in its reports. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government and pro-government forces  
</b></p>
<p>192. The Government retains the primary role in protecting the rights of its citizens. As 
documented above and in previous reports, government forces have committed crimes 
against humanity, war crimes and violations of international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>193. The Government has yet to demonstrate the willingness or ability to reign in its 
security and intelligence apparatus. Similarly, it has condoned pro-government forces 
perpetrating crimes. Until the Government enforces discipline within these entities, 
violations will continue. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>194. Some anti-government armed groups have committed war crimes. Commanders of 
groups have consistently failed to take appropriate disciplinary steps. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>195.<b> Relentless shelling has killed thousands of civilians and displaced the 
populations of entire towns. Massacres and other unlawful killings are perpetrated 
</b></p>
<p><b>with impunity. An untold number of men, children and women have disappeared. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Many are killed in detention; survivors live with physical and mental scars of torture. 
Hospitals and schools have been bombarded. 
</b></p>
<p>196.<b> The porous borders of the Syrian Arab Republic have facilitated the 
involvement of regional armed actors, increasingly along sectarian lines. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>dynamics of the conflict are extremely complex and extend well beyond its borders. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The overtones of sectarianism present in many of the violations find their roots in 
</b></p>
<p><b>politics. It is politics that pushes sectarianism, engenders violence and empowers its 
perpetrators.  
</b></p>
<p>197<b>. These violations have been the focus of 10 reports and updates. The 
perpetrators are not deterred and do not fear future accountability.  
</b></p>
<p>198.<b> There is no military solution to this conflict. Those who supply arms create but 
an illusion of victory. A political solution founded on the tenets of the final 
</b></p>
<p><b>communiqu&#233; of the Action Group for Syria (the Geneva communiqu&#233;)9 is the only 
path to peace. 
</b></p>
<p>199.<b> The commission renews the recommendations made in previous reports and 
emphasizes those below.

<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Massacres 
</b></p>
<p>1. The commission continued to carry out its s pecific mandate to investigate all 
massacres.a In the incidents described, the intentional mass killing and identity of the 
perpetrator were confirmed to the commission&#8217;s evidentiary standards . 
</p>
<p><b>  Government and pro-Government forces  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Deir Baalbeh, Homs, 7-11 April 2012 
</i></p>
<p>2. In the Deir Baalbeh, near Homs city, between 20 and 40 men were killed in 
circumstances amounting to mass execution.  Evidence indicated that the men, found in 
groups of two to 13, had been blindfolded and had their hands tied behind the ir backs, 
before being shot at close quarters. Reasonable grounds exist to believe that Government 
forces committed the massacre. 
</p>
<p><i>  Al-Hamamiat, Hamah, 13 March 2013 
</i></p>
<p>3. Government forces stationed in Al-Hamamiat, a village located four kilometres east 
of Karnaz, Hamah, unlawfully executed six male farmers, residents of Al-Hamamiat. The 
men were internally displaced to Kafr Nabudah but had returned to Al-Hamamiat on 13 
March. They approached troops stationed at a checkpoint, apparently seeking access to 
their farms.  The commission has reasonable grounds to believe that Government forces 
stationed in Al-Hamamiat unlawfully killed the men in violation of international law. 
</p>
<p><i>  Bab Amr, 27 March 2013 
</i></p>
<p>4. Government forces regained control over Bab Amr neighbourhood, Homs city, for 
10 days during the second half of March. As per observed patterns, after heavy shelling, 
Government troops entered the neighbourhood as FSA fighters withdrew.  Save for a 
number of elderly, most civilians had fled. 
</p>
<p>5. On 27 March, pro-Government forces, including the National Defence Forces, 
gathered several people, including seven elderly members of the Bzazi family. The seven 
were executed and their bodies burnt at the family house. The deceased were between the 
ages of 50 and 88 years old and included four women and three men. The Commission 
found reasonable grounds to believe that pro-Government forces unlawfully killed the 
Bzazi family members. 
</p>
<p><i>  Khirbet Al-Teen, Homs, 10 April 2013 
</i></p>
<p>6. The Qadrou family, part of a community of Bedouins  was executed in the area of 
Khirbet Al-Teen, in Homs countryside. The family included eight children (aged between 
two and 18 years old). Videos of the victims clearly show that they had been shot at close 
range and three of the child victim&#8217;s throats were slit. The village, along the Tartus-Homs 
highway, where the victims were found is surrounded by villages that support Government 
forces.  
</p>
<p>  
 a  See A/HRC/22/59, para 42. </p>


<p>7. There are reasonable grounds to believe that pro-Government forces have 
unlawfully killed the Qadrou family. 
</p>
<p><i>  Jdeidat Al-Fadel, western Damascus countryside, 21 April 2013 
</i></p>
<p>8. Accounts collected confirmed that thousands of internally displaced persons were in 
the area of Jdeidet Al-Fadel when Government forces launched a military operation on 15 
April. With the participation of the 100th Regiment and 4th Brigade, all access points to the 
area were blocked by Government forces whereas heavy shelling from army bases west of 
the town targeted residential areas inside, causing a number of casualties. Some accounts 
state that the FSA had successfully overtaken a checkpoint outside Jdeidet Artouz which 
prompted the Government&#8217;s response. As fighting intensified, particularly between 15 and 
21 April, thousands of civilians along with a number of anti-Government fighters were 
blocked inside the town. Hundreds of Government snipers were positioned on the town&#8217;s 
exit points. Snipers and soldiers positioned at the town exits killed many civilians trying to 
flee the hostilities. Anti-Government forces attempted to accompany thousands of civilians 
out of the area of combat but the blockade and the military operation made this impossible.  
</p>
<p>9. Collected evidence gave reasonable grounds to believe that Government forces 
executed a number of inhabitants once they took control of the town, including the Imam of 
the Mosque and his family.  
</p>
<p><i>  Al-Bayda, Banias, Tartus, 2 May 2013 
</i></p>
<p>10. On the morning of 2 May, the army surrounded Al-Bayda and blocked the main exit 
points. Extensive shelling preceded the operation leading many civilians, especially those 
living at the edge of the village, to flee to surrounding agricultural areas. At approximately 
7am Government forces entered with a force of 60-70 soldiers, establishing sniper positions 
around the main village square. Government forces proceeded to raid various streets in the 
village as members of the National Defence Forces joined the operation. Hundreds of 
civilians were arrested while some were executed in various locations. Evidence indicates 
that between 40-60 bodies were laid out in one room, a mobile phone shop, near the square. 
The bodies appear to have been burned. The victims appeared to have been first arrested 
and then executed in the square area. Some of the victims also appeared to have been hit in 
the head with blunt, heavy objects. Bodies of 30 women, also apparently executed, were 
found in a house not far from the centre while tens of bodies were strewn in the streets. 
Between150-250 civilians were allegedly killed. Testimonies were consistent that members 
of the National Defence Forces were actively involved in the raids and in many cases 
leading them. 
</p>
<p>11. Findings indicate that armed opposition was not present or actively engaged in 
hostilities in the village of Al-Bayda or its vicinity in the lead-up or during the alleged 
massacre. Some of the accounts suggest that Government forces were chasing a small 
activists&#8217; cell in the village which it accused of facilitating the defection of regular soldiers 
from the army. It is evident, however, that the type of military operation and the alleged 
massacre that ensued were not in the context of an armed confrontation. Government forces 
with the support of the National Defence Forces operated freely throughout the day on 2 
May in and around the village. There were no reported deceased pro-Government forces. 
The area where the village is located was under the full control of government forces. 
Accordingly, there are reasonable grounds to believe that government forces and affiliated 
militia including the National Defence Forces are the perpetrators of the Al-Bayda 
massacre </p>


<p><i>  Ras Al-Nabe', Banias, Tartus, 3 May 2013 
</i></p>
<p>12. The incidents at Ras Al-Nabe' are closely connected to the events of Al-Bayda the 
preceding day. News spread that the National Defence Forces, with the support of the army, 
were moving towards the village as part of the same operation. Hundreds of civilians 
attempted to leave the village through the regular checkpoints but were pushed back. Some 
of the inhabitants managed to flee through dirt roads as main access roads to the village 
were blocked. Government forces proceeded to shell the village from various locations, 
including from a bridge connecting the village to other areas including Al-Bayda. Shelling 
lasted for approximately an hour before pro-Government forces moved in. 
</p>
<p>13. As they raided the village, civilians were captured and executed. The commission 
reviewed evidence of families that had been executed, including children, as part of the 
operation. Testimonies of those who witnessed the aftermath described bodies lying in the 
streets for days before the inhabitants could safely return to collect them. Some of the 
bodies appeared to have been hit with heavy or sharp objects, especially in the face and 
head area. According to reports the numbers killed is between150-200.  As in Al-Bayda, 
there is no indication that the armed opposition was active in the village. The operation did 
not occur in the context of a military confrontation. Government forces were in full control 
of the area.  
</p>
<p>14. Based on an analysis of the evidence, there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
pro-Government forces perpetrated the 3 May killings in Ras Al-Nabe'. 
</p>
<p><i>  Khirbat Al-Souda, Homs, 15 May 2013 
</i></p>
<p>15. On 15 May, anti-Government armed groups attacked a checkpoint at the railway 
linking Homs and Tartus. In retaliation for this incident, Government forces from the 
checkpoint shelled and raided Khirbat Al-Souda, a small village five kilometres north of 
Homs city, killing 16 people, including two women and a three-year-old child, and burned 
their bodies.    
</p>
<p>16. In eight incidents detailed above, reasonable grounds exist to believe that the war 
crime of murder was committed by Government and pro-Government forces, including the 
National Defence Forces.   
</p>
<p><b>  Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Hatla, Dayr Az-Zawr, 11 June 2013 
</i></p>
<p>17. On June 11 at approximately 5:45 am, several anti-Government armed groups, 
including members of Jabhat Al-Nusra, attacked the Shi'ite areas of Hatla, a mixed, but 
Sunni-majority, village located in eastern Dayr Az-Zawr. In the ensuing fight, anti-
Government armed groups defeated the outnumbered and outgunned Shi&#8217;ite fighters. More 
than 20 were killed and some were captured. Ten anti-Government fighters were killed 
during the attack.  
</p>
<p>18. During the takeover, anti-Government armed group fighters conducted home 
invasions, killing and summarily executing (by shooting at close range) many Shia 
including at least 30 civilians, among them children, women and elderly. Fighters also set 
civilian houses and a Shia mosque on fire as they shouted sectarian slogans. 
</p>
<p>19. There are reasonable grounds to believe that the anti-Government fighters who 
attacked Hatla unlawfully killed at least 20 civilians in violation of international law. In 
relation to the 11 June killings in Hatla, anti-Government armed groups involved have 
committed the war crime of murder. </p>


<p><b>  Incidents remaining under investigation 
</b></p>
<p>20. In some incidents that remain under investigation, the fact of the illegal killing was 
confirmed; however the perpetrator could not be identified.  In other cases the 
circumstances of the killing is not sufficiently clear to make a determination as to its 
legality.

<p><b>Annex III 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Inquiry into events in Al Qusayr 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pro-Government forces, including Hezbollah, launched a major offensive against the 
region of Al-Qusayr, Homs governorate, from 4 April to 8 June 2013, forcing the 
withdrawal of anti-Government armed groups from the town and the surrounding 
countryside.  
</p>
<p>2. In its Resolution A/HRC/23/1, the Human Rights Council requested the 
Commission of Inquiry to &#8220;urgently conduct a comprehensive, independent and unfettered 
inquiry into the events in Al Qusayr&#8221; and requested the findings of the inquiry be included 
in its report to the Council at its 24th session. 
</p>
<p>3. This Annex details the offensive according to information collected during the 
investigations, taken together with documentary material such as photographs, satellite 
imagery and video recordings.  
</p>
<p><b>  Background 
</b></p>
<p>4. Al-Qusayr is located in Homs province at a strategic juncture for the warring parties&#8217; 
forces operating in the central governorates. The town is located close to the Lebanese 
borders along the main line of communication between Damascus and both northern and 
coastal governorates.  
</p>
<p>5. Since early 2012, anti-Government armed groups have controlled parts of the 
locality and extended their presence to its countryside, reducing the presence of 
Government forces to the eastern neighbourhood of Al-Qusayr city around the security 
square. Control of the town enabled the armed groups to ensure cross-border movement of 
arms and logistics while also disrupting the Government&#8217;s supply lines from Lebanon&#8217;s 
Bekaa Valley. 
</p>
<p>6. Government forces responded by imposing a siege on Al-Qusayr towns and 
surrounding villages. The Syrian army prevented the flow of food and water into the areas 
from the northern and eastern access points, while Hezbollah did the same following the  
assumption of control of access points to the south and west. For over a year, Al-Qusayr 
and nearby villages came under heavy shelling and aerial bombardment by Government 
forces. Both the Government siege and shelling of the area intensified in the weeks  prior to 
the ground attacks. 
</p>
<p>7. From April to mid-June, anti-Government armed groups fired homemade rockets 
and artillery shells into villages, such as Hermel, under Government and Hezbollah control. 
Some rockets fell on Al-Qasr, a village inside Lebanon, causing civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>8. In the Al-Qusayr western countryside, tensions increased between anti-Government 
armed groups and pro-Government armed elements in the Shia villages. This led to 
Hezbollah&#8217;s incremental involvement. As a result of clashes between the warring parties, 
local inhabitants from the predominantly Sunni villages around Al-Qusayr were internally 
displaced to safer areas in Al-Qalamoun, northeastern Damascus countryside, with 
thousands fleeing to the town of Ersal in Lebanon. </p>


<p>9. Inside the town of Al-Qusayr, various anti-Government armed groups collaborated 
during operations under the supervision of Al-Qusayr Military Council. The main groups 
included Al-Farouq Battalions, Al-Waleed Battalions, Fajr Al-Islam Brigade, Bashair Al-
Nasr Battalions, Al-Haq Brigade and a group of Jabhat Al-Nusra fighters. Immediately 
prior to the Government offensive, there were approximately 2,000 &#8211; 2,500 anti-
Government armed group fighters inside Al-Qusayr. 
</p>
<p>10. In March 2013, the siege around Al-Qusayr town and the surrounding countryside 
tightened. Villages west of the Al-Assi River, predominantly populated by Sunni Muslims, 
were particularly affected. These included Al-Burhaniya, Al- Radwaniyeh, Saqraja, Ayn 
Al-Tannur, Arjoun and Al-Hamidiyah.  
</p>
<p>11. In the weeks prior to the May 2013 offensive, there were severe shortages of food, 
water and medicine inside the town of Al-Qusayr. By early May, Hezbollah had taken 
control of the Ain Tanour and Hamah water stations, four kilometres west and two 
kilometres north of Al-Qusayr town respectively. Water to the town, already limited, was 
cut entirely. Sanitation levels declined rapidly, resulting in a corresponding increase in 
infectious diseases. As medical supplies ran low, the ability of hospitals and clinics to treat 
civilians injured by shelling and by crossfire was severely compromised. Pro-Government 
forces refused to allow Red Crescent ambulances to enter Al-Qusayr to evacuate the 
wounded. 
</p>
<p><b>  Preparatory operations and bombardment 
</b></p>
<p>12. In reaction to the coordinated attack by anti-Government armed groups on southern 
districts of Homs city in March 2013, a Government offensive on Al-Qusayr was initiated 
in early April. This offensive formed a key part of the Government&#8217;s strategy to secure 
Homs governorate.  
</p>
<p>13. Government forces, supported by foreign combatants including thousands of 
Hezbollah fighters, captured the majority of villages in the countryside in order to cut the 
armed groups&#8217; supply lines and prevent their withdrawal. From 11 April to 13 May, 
Hezbollah fighters controlled the Sunni villages located in the southwest of Al-Qusayr 
(west of Al-Assi River), while the Government regained territory in Homs city and 
challenged the armed groups&#8217; positions from the northeast. These tactics ultimately 
blockaded the armed groups in a triangle formed by the towns of Al-Qusayr, Buwaydah Al-
Sharqiyah and Arjoun. The tight siege imposed on the town of Al-Qusayr prevented the 
transfer of reinforcements and weapons to the armed groups.  
</p>
<p>14. Shelling and airstrikes on Al-Qusayr town and surrounding villages also escalated in 
the weeks prior to the ground attacks. The villages to the southwest of Al-Qusayr were 
shelled with mortars and came under aerial bombardment from jet fighters and helicopters. 
Al-Qusayr also came under sustained attack, from shelling, surface-to-surface missiles and 
aerial bombardment. In the ten days prior to the ground attacks, shelling and bombardments 
on the area were near continuous. 
</p>
<p><b>  Attack on Al-Qusayr city 
</b></p>
<p>15. On 19 May, Hezbollah fighters along with Government troops and National Defence 
Forces launched a final attack on Al-Qusayr from several directions, reportedly forcing a 
negotiated withdrawal of anti-Government fighters. Witnesses stated that the armed groups 
withdrew in exchange for the lifting of the siege and the evacuation of civilians and injured 
persons.  </p>


<p>16. The ground attack by the pro-Government forces was accompanied by an extensive 
campaign of shelling and bombardment involving the use of artillery and airpower. 
Corroborated interviews indicated the use by Hezbollah fighters of a highly explosive 
shoulder fired missile, likely to have been thermobaric in nature.  This weaponry caused a 
significant number of casualties among anti-Government fighters and civilians, as well as 
extensive destruction of buildings. 
</p>
<p>17. Within 24 hours, on 20 May, Government forces and Hezbollah fighters managed to 
take control of Al-Qusayr town, with the exception of its northern neighbourhood where 
anti-Government armed groups redeployed. Fighting continued throughout May, with both 
sides reinforcing their positions in and around the town. Further Government 
reinforcements were redeployed from Damascus and Dara&#8217;a, including from the Syrian 
Republican Guard. 
</p>
<p>18. Approximately 300 anti-Government fighters, including elements from the Al-
Tawheed Brigade from Aleppo and the Al-Usra Army from Dayr Al-Zawr, arrived to 
support the armed groups inside Al-Qusayr. Despite those reinforcements, anti-Government 
armed groups began to lose ground to Government forces and Hezbollah. Government 
forces benefitted not only of their superior weaponry and their ability to sever the armed 
groups&#8217; supply lines into Al-Qusayr but also from Hezbollah&#8217;s expertise in street-to-street 
insurgency fighting. Approximately 500 armed group fighters were killed by shelling and 
by gunfire during the ground operations. An estimated 800 to 1000 fighters were injured, 
rendering them hors de combat. The Government later indicated that approximately 1,000 
anti-Government fighters were captured. It has not been able to confirm these numbers. The 
whereabouts and treatment of many captured fighters is currently unknown. 
</p>
<p>19. The remaining fighters were unable to hold ground in the face of the pro -
Government onslaught. Squeezed between northern Al-Qusayr and Buwaydah Al-
Sharqiyah, the fighters, together with civilians and hors de combat fighters, were forced &#8211; 
or allowed &#8211; to withdraw from Al-Qusayr on 5 June along a narrow corridor still under 
opposition control to reach the villages of Dabaa, Salhiyah and Buwaydah Al-Sharqiyah.  
</p>
<p>20. Until the last day of the offensive, scores of women, children and elderly had been 
able to exit Al-Qusayr through military checkpoints in Domaynah Al-Sharkiyah and 
Shamseen. However, those at risk of arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention &#8211; themselves a 
gateway to a range of other violations &#8211; had little choice but to remain inside the town. This 
included civilian men, boys over 12 years old and women related to wanted persons, such 
as defectors. They formed part of the convoy leaving Al-Qusayr in the last days of the 
battle. 
</p>
<p><b>  The fall of Al-Qusayr 
</b></p>
<p>21. It has been difficult to estimates the size of the convoy that exited Al-Qusayr on 5 
June, primarily because of the sheer number of people moving in a narrow formation out of 
Al-Qusayr towards Buwaydah Al-Sharqiyah. However, there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that the total number was between 13,000 and 15,000 people. Corroborated 
accounts indicate that at least 10,000 civilians, mostly males over 12 years and over, were 
part of this convoy. This large group moved along dirt roads to avoid army positions. 
</p>
<p>22. From 6 to 8 June, the convoy of internally displaced moved towards the Homs -
Damascus Highway through Domaynah Al-Sharkiyah, Hamra and Al-Hussayniyah. The 
few persons remaining in these villages joined the convoy. 
</p>
<p>23. After taking control of the town of Al-Qusayr, pro-Government forces successively 
recaptured the remaining villages including Dabaa (6 June) and Buwaydah Al-Sharqiyah (8 </p>


<p>June). The displacement of thousands of civilians and fighters, including hundreds of 
injured, followed.  
</p>
<p>24. At dawn on 7 June, the first group of civilians and fighters, numbering 
approximately 500 people, arrived at the Homs-Damascus highway. The majority of the 
group was able to cross, in spite of shelling from nearby army checkpoints, which caused a 
number of casualties. Continued shelling and the resulting deaths led the remaining 
thousands still waiting to cross to retreat a few kilometres to a farming area next to Al-
Hussayniyah where they stayed until the following night.  
</p>
<p>25. At around 9pm on 8 June, the group of displaced tried once again to cross the 
highway but were targeted by shelling from army positions in nearby Shamseen and 
Shinshar. In an effort to facilitate the crossing of the highway by waiting civilians, anti-
Government fighters reportedly attacked the Shamseen checkpoint. By dawn, more groups 
of civilians and injured fighters were still unable to reach east of the highway. They 
returned to the area of the farms, where they spent two more days suffering from lack of 
water, food and medication. In one instance on 8 June, army tanks and troops from 
checkpoints in the area attacked the civilians and fighters hiding in the farms, but they were 
pushed back by anti-Government fighters .  
</p>
<p>26. On or around 8 June, following a negotiation, armed groups returned the bodies of 
two Hezbollah fighters in exchange for the safe passage of 34 seriously injured armed 
group fighters to the Lebanese Red Crescent. The injured fighters suffered beatings while 
under Hezbollah&#8217;s control but were taken alive to the border and handed over to the Red 
Crescent for medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>27. It was not until on or about 11 June that the groups of fighters and civilians were 
able to cross the highway and entered the localities of Shamseen, Hissiyah and Al-Dibah. 
They settled there for a few days before leaving to other areas across the country and 
towards Ersal in Lebanon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Casualties 
</b></p>
<p>28. The commission has, to date, been able to verify the killing of 450 people during the 
offensive on Al-Qusayr town. Approximately half were civilian casualties, killed primarily 
in the shelling and aerial bombardment of the town in the early days of the offensive.  
</p>
<p>29. While civilians were killed by gunfire, it has not been possible to determine who 
fired the shots or the circumstances under which the shooting took place. These civilians 
may have been killed in crossfire during the intense street-to-street battles. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Unlawful attacks 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Pro-Government forces 
</i></p>
<p>30. In its shelling and aerial bombardment of both Al-Qusayr and the Al-Qusayr region 
in the months and weeks preceding the military offensive &#8211; and in particular during the 
intense shelling which occurred in the ten days prior to the ground attack &#8211; Government 
forces conducted themselves in flagrant disregard of the distinction between civilians and 
persons directly participating in hostilities.  
</p>
<p>31. On 17 April, the aerial bombardment of Buwaydah Al-Sharqiyah killed at least 12 
people, including two women and two children. On June 7, at least a dozen civilians </p>


<p>displaced from Al-Qusayr were killed when the army shelled orchards on the outskirts of 
the town. Between 5 and 12 June, Government shelling targeted internally displaced 
persons fleeing Al-Qusayr, the vast majority of whom were civilians and hors de combat 
fighters. Civilians were killed in the shelling as they attempted to cross the Damascus -
Homs highway in search of a safe haven. 
</p>
<p>32. During the attack on Al-Qusayr and the villages around it, the Government deployed 
extensive aerial and artillery capabilities. This included imprecise weaponry such as 
surface-to-surface missiles which destroyed not only individual targets but also blocks of 
buildings. That the majority of civilians were killed in the shelling and aerial bombardment 
underlines the failure to take adequate precautions to protect civilians. 
</p>
<p>33. As set out in the chapter on Unlawful Attacks, Government forces consistently 
transgressed the fundamental principle of the laws of war that they must at all t imes 
distinguish between civilian and military objectives. 
</p>
<p>34. Government forces and Hezbollah also positioned military objectives inside the 
villages to the south-west of Al-Qusayr, endangering the civilian population and violating 
international legal obligations. 
</p>
<p><i>  Anti-Government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>35. Anti-Government armed groups shelled villages west of Al-Qusayr, home 
predominantly to a Shia community, without taking precautions to protect civilians living 
inside. On 27 May, a Lebanese girl aged 17 was killed in a rebel mortar attack on the 
Hezbollah stronghold of Hermel. On 11 June, one man was killed and several people were 
injured during a rocket attack also on Hermel.  
</p>
<p>36. Anti-Government armed groups used mortars, rockets and snipers in a manner that 
failed to distinguish civilian and military objectives, thereby committing unlawful attacks. 
</p>
<p>37. Armed groups also operated within civilian areas, including in the town of Al-
Qusayr itself, violating international legal obligations to avoid positioning milit ary 
objectives within or near densely populated areas. 
</p>
<p><i>  Imposition of sieges 
</i></p>
<p>  Pro-Government forces  
</p>
<p>38. Government forces and Hezbollah had imposed a siege on the Al-Qusayr area since 
late 2012. In the weeks prior to the military offensive, the siege tightened considerably with 
harrowing consequences for the civilians remaining inside Al-Qusayr town and the 
surrounding villages. The cutting off of medical supplies into Al-Qusayr town, in particular, 
had dire consequences for the ability of the hospitals and clinics to treat those injured by 
shelling and gunfire. 
</p>
<p>39. As detailed in the section on Sieges and Attacks on Food Security, pro-Government 
forces have a legal obligation to allow and facilitate the unimpeded passage of humanitarian 
relief. The use of starvation as a method of warfare is clearly prohibited under the laws of 
war. There is strong evidence to suggest the siege was imposed for the specific reason to 
render the conditions of life unbearable, weakening the armed groups and forcing civilians , 
who were so able, to flee. 
</p>
<p>40. Government forces and Hezbollah have imposed sieges and blockades in the Al-
Qusayr region, without complying with their obligations under international humanitarian 
law. </p>


<p><b>  Torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Pro-Government forces 
</i></p>
<p>41. Following a negotiated exchange of 34 seriously injured armed group fighters for 
the bodies of two Hezbollah fighters on or around 8 June, the injured <i>hors de combat</i> 
fighters were beaten by Hezbollah members prior to their transfer to the Lebanese Red 
Crescent for medical treatment. Such conduct is in flagrant disregard for the protections 
accorded to the sick, wounded and <i>hors de combat</i> fighters from ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>  Massacres and other unlawful killings 
</b></p>
<p>42. Civilians were killed in the indiscriminate shelling of Al-Qusayr and its 
surroundings. It has not been possible to determine, beyond the requisite standard of proof, 
the circumstances in which those killed by gunfire died. Given the fierce fighting that took 
place in Al-Qusayr, there is a strong possibility that those killed may have been caught in 
crossfire between the warring factions. There is no evidence, as yet, to indicate that fighters 
on either side were killed in circumstances that would have deemed those killings unlawful. 
Investigations are continuing. </p>
