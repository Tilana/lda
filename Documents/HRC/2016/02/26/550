</p>
<p>of the law, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, that everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion

</p>

</p>
<p>manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the positive role that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion 
</p>
<p>and expression and full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information can 
</p>
<p>play in strengthening democracy and combating religious intolerance, and also that the 
</p>
<p>exercise of the right to freedom of expression carries with it special duties and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities, in accordance with article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, 
</p>

<p><i>Expressing deep concern</i> at those acts that advocate religious hatred and thereby 
</p>
<p>undermine the spirit of tolerance, 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> about incidents of intolerance, discrimination and violence 
</p>
<p>against persons based on their religion or belief in all regions of the world, 
</p>
<p><i>Deploring </i>any advocacy of discrimination or violence on the basis of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief, 
</p>
<p><i>Strongly deploring</i> all acts of violence against persons on the basis of their religion 
</p>
<p>or belief, as well as any such acts directed against their homes, businesses, properties, 
</p>
<p>schools, cultural centres or places of worship, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> about actions that wilfully exploit tensions or target individuals on the 
</p>
<p>basis of their religion or belief, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with deep concern</i> the instances of intolerance, discrimination and acts of 
</p>
<p>violence in many parts of the world, including cases motivated by discrimination against 
</p>
<p>persons belonging to religious minorities, in addition to the negative projection of the 
</p>
<p>followers of religions and the enforcement of measures that specifically discriminate 
</p>
<p>against persons on the basis of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern</i> at the growing manifestation of intolerance based on religion or 
</p>
<p>belief that can generate hatred and violence among individuals from and within different 
</p>
<p>nations that may have serious implications at the national, regional and international levels, 
</p>
<p>and in this regard emphasizing the importance of respect for religious and cultural diversity 
</p>

</p>
<p>respect among individuals, societies and nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the valuable contribution of people of all religions or beliefs to 
</p>
<p>humanity and the contribution that dialogue among religious groups can make towards an 
</p>
<p>improved awareness and understanding of the common values shared by all humankind, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that working together to enhance the implementation of existing 
</p>
<p>legal regimes that protect individuals against discrimination and hate crimes, increase 
</p>
<p>interfaith and intercultural efforts and expand human rights education are an important first 
</p>
<p>step in combating incidents of intolerance, discrimination and violence against individuals 
</p>
<p>on the basis of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of General Assembly resolution 68/127 on &#8220;A world against violence

</p>
<p>promoting interreligious, intercultural and interfaith harmony and combating discrimination 
</p>
<p>against individuals on the basis of religion or belief, including the launching of the Istanbul 
</p>
<p>Process, and taking note of the recent initiative of the chairmanship of Albania of the 
</p>
<p>Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe under the theme &#8220;United in diversity&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>the initiative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement 
</p>
<p>to discrimination, hostility or violence, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at the continued serious instances of derogatory 
</p>
<p>stereotyping, negative profiling and stigmatization of persons based on their religion or 
</p>
<p>belief, as well as programmes and agendas pursued by extremist organizations and groups 
</p>
<p>aimed at creating and perpetuating negative stereotypes about religious groups, in particular 
</p>
<p>when condoned by Governments; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that incidents of religious intolerance, discrimination 
</p>
<p>and related violence, as well as of negative stereotyping of individuals on the basis of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief, continue to rise around the world, condemns in this context any advocacy 
</p>
<p>of religious hatred against individuals that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility 
</p>
<p>or violence, and urges States to take effective measures, as set forth in the present 
</p>
<p>resolution, consistent with their obligations under international human rights law, to address 
</p>
<p>and combat such incidents; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Condemns deeply</i> any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement

</p>
<p>4. <i>Welcomes</i> international, regional and national initiatives aimed at promoting 
</p>

</p>
<p>held in Washington, D.C., London, Geneva and Doha, in the framework of the Istanbul 
</p>
<p>process to discuss the implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 16/18; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Notes</i> the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and the holding of four regional workshops, in Austria, Chile, Kenya and

<p>Thailand, on separate but related issues, as well as the final workshop in Morocco and its 
</p>
<p>outcome document, the Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy of national,

<p>and the recommendations and conclusions contained therein; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Recognizes</i> that the open, public debate of ideas, as well as interfaith and 
</p>
<p>intercultural dialogue, at the local, national and international levels can be among the best 
</p>
<p>protections against religious intolerance and can play a positive role in strengthening 
</p>
<p>democracy and combating religious hatred,  and convinced that continuing dialogue on 
</p>
<p>these issues can help to overcome existing misperceptions; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Notes</i> the speech given by Secretary-General of the Organization of the 
</p>
<p>Islamic Conference at the fifteenth session of the Human Rights Council, and draws on his

<p>harmonizing actions at the local, national, region and international levels through, inter alia, 
</p>

</p>
<p>irrespective of their religion, in all sectors of society;
