About Klondex
We are a well-capitalized, junior-tier gold and silver mining company focused on exploration,
development, and production in a safe, environmentally responsible, and cost-effective manner.
Gold and silver sales represent 100% of our revenues and the market prices of gold and silver
significantly impact our financial position, operating results, and cash flows. As of June 30, 2016,
we had 100% interests in: (1) two producing underground mines located in Nevada, USA: (a)
Fire Creek and (b) the Midas Mine and Milling Facility (collectively the "Midas Mine" or “Midas”),
(2) one mine project located in Manitoba, Canada: the True North Mine and Mill Complex ("True
North"), and (3) early-stage exploration properties located in Nevada, USA and Manitoba and
Ontario, Canada. In Nevada, USA, the Company's milling and processing facilities located at
Midas process ore from both Midas and Fire Creek.
As discussed in the Corporate Developments and Acquisitions section of this MD&A and in
further detail in Note 22. Subsequent Events, on July 25, 2016, we entered into (1) an agreement
to purchase the Hollister mine ("Hollister") and the Esmeralda mine and milling complex
("Esmeralda") and (2) an agreement for a "bought deal" private placement.
Our primary strategy is to increase shareholder value by achieving our internal production, cost,
and capital targets while attempting to extend our mine lives through development and
exploration programs. We also consider acquisitions or other arrangements in the normal course
which strategically fit our future growth objectives. We have an experienced management team, a
strong financial position, a low-cost production profile, and high-quality assets located in mining-
friendly jurisdictions.

Executive Summary and Quarterly Highlights
Our second quarter 2016 highlights and subsequent developments as of the date of this MD&A
included the following, which are discussed in further detail throughout this MD&A:
Health, Safety, and Environmental - We remained committed to our most important core values
by operating in an environmentally-responsible manner while protecting the health and safety of
our employees and contractors. We had no lost-time injuries or environmental citations at Fire
Creek, Midas, or True North.
•
•
•
•
•
Acquisition of Hollister and Private Placement - On July 25, 2016, we entered into (1) an
agreement to purchase Hollister and Esmeralda and (2) a "bought deal" private placement (see
Note 22. Subsequent Events).
Cash Flows and Liquidity - Maintained our strong financial position and liquidity. Our ending
cash balance was $36.9 million after $23.6 million of operating cash flows, $19.8 million used in
investing activities, and $2.1 million provided by financing activities. Our quarter end working
capital was $29.5 million (ratio of 1.8:1) and total liquidity was $54.5 million when including the
Revolver availability.
Ounces Sold and Financial Results - We sold 37,914 gold equivalent ounces ("GEOs"),
consisting of 32,499 gold ounces and 408,316 silver ounces, as ore grades and milling rates
increased from the prior quarter. Revenue totaled $48.0 million from average selling prices per
gold and silver ounce of $1,266 and $16.78, respectively. Net income was $7.1 million (or $0.05
per share - basic).
Mine Operations and Performance Measures - We produced a record 41,436 GEOs, in-line with
management expectations which anticipate GEO production and grades progressively
increasing from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. Averages for key operating
metrics were: 947 ore tons milled per day, 0.44 oz/ton gold mill head grade, 5.72 oz/ton silver
mill head grade, 0.52 oz/ton GEO mill head grade. Our cost performance measures were as
follows:

True North - We made significant progress on the drilling and rehab activities required to make a
production decision in the third quarter of 2016. We now expect to recover 8,000 - 12,000 gold
ounces during the second half of 2016 from a combination of processing gold in tailings and test
stope mining if we proceed with a production decision.
Capital Expenditures - We spent $8.4 million at Fire Creek, $7.7 million at Midas, $5.8 million at
True North, and $0.1 million at corporate for total capital spending of $21.9 million.
2016 Full Year Outlook
Nevada Operations
We are maintaining our targeted annual production costs and GEO production, which is expected
to be weighted approximately 45%-50% in the first-half of 2016 and 50%-55% in the second-half
of 2016. Our 2016 GEO production and grades are expected to progressively increase from the
first half of the year to the second half of the year following the completion of planned first-half
development and silling activities. The following table outlines our annual guidance (compared
to actual results) and includes all-in costs per gold ounce sold measures exclusive of True North,
which was acquired during the first quarter of 2016 after the release of our full-year guidance:

ratio. GEO ratios are computed by dividing the projected average realized gold price per ounce
by the projected average realized silver price per ounce expected to be received by us in 2016.
(2) See Non-IFRS Performance Measures section in this MD&A.
True North
We expect to produce 8,000 - 12,000 gold ounces during the second half of 2016 from a
combination of processing gold in tailings and test stope mining. Subsequent to June 30, 2016,
we began processing tailings and at the end of July we poured our first doré bar.
Corporate Developments and Acquisitions
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, and subsequent to such date, we announced the
following:
Hollister and Esmeralda Acquisitions
As more fully discussed in Note 22. Subsequent Events, on July 25, 2016, the Company entered
into an agreement to acquire, among other assets, the Hollister mine and the Esmeralda mine
and ore milling complex, both of which are located in Nevada, USA.
Subscription Receipt Offering
As more fully discussed in Note 22. Subsequent Events, on July 25, 2016, the Company entered
into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters, who agreed to purchase for resale, on a
bought deal private placement basis, subscription receipts of the Company.
Annual Meeting
Our Annual Meeting of Shareholders was held on June 15, 2016, at which all management
nominees were elected to the Board, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was appointed as our
auditors for the ensuing year, and a new share incentive plan was approved (Note 13. Share
Capital and Share-Based Compensation).
Key Management Hires
We strengthened our management team by adding Mr. John Antwi as the Senior Vice President
of Strategic Development and Mr. Ian McMullan as the Director of Mining and Engineering, both
of whom have extensive mining experience.
Health, Safety, and Environmental Permitting
Our mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations which
govern the protection of the health and safety of our employees and contractors and the
environment. At Klondex, environmental stewardship and the health and safety of the people on
our mine sites are core values, and we are dedicated to continued improvement.
Health and Safety
During 2016, we had no lost-time injuries at our properties and as of June 30, 2016, had
operated 1,355 days (~3.7 years) at Fire Creek, 632 days (~1.7 years) at Midas, and 161 days at
True North (~0.4 years), without a lost-time injury. Shortly after June 30, 2016, we were notified
by the Nevada Mining Association that our Fire Creek and Midas mines, as well as certain of
their employees, were recipients of awards for exemplary safety achievements. Despite high-
levels of health and safety performance, our philosophy is one of "continuous improvement" as
our core principle belief is that "the miner is the most important thing to come out of a mine."
Environmental Compliance and Permitting
During the second quarter of 2016, we did not receive any notices of non-compliance or citations
at any of our properties. In February 2016, the Environmental Assessment for Fire Creek was
approved by the BLM which allowed us to advance mining
- 4 -
and exploration activities, including to begin the second quarter 2016 construction of the new
waste rock storage facility and ramp for additional access to ore bodies and improved ventilation.
Exploration
Fire Creek
A total of 71 underground and 14 surface drill holes were drilled during the second quarter for a
total footage of 47,630 feet (14,518 meters). Underground drilling targeted mainly the Karen,
Joyce and Hui Wu veins down-dip and extending north along strike from the north haulage.
Additionally, east directed holes were drilled from the north haulage to assess the mineral
endowment potential of Vein 9 and Vein 16. Surface drilling mostly targeted the East Zone, Vein
16 extension, Northwest veins extensions and Vonnie Vein north extension.
Midas Exploration
11 surface holes totaling 13,512 feet (4,118 meters) were drilled in the second quarter targeting
the veins to the west: Rico, Grant Jackson and Midas Trend. The intent of the drilling was to
upgrade and increase resources.
True North
In the second quarter a total of 60 holes were drilled totaling 25,659 feet (7,821 meters). Drilling
was mostly focused up-dip on the 710 and 711 veins from the 24 level where the Company’s
intends to commence production. Drilling highlights included the following:
•625-16-007: 1.18 opt Au over 3.0 ft, or 40.3 g/t over 0.9 m (710A)
•625-16-009: 0.98 opt Au over 3.0 ft, or 33.4 g/t over 0.9 m (710A HW)
•630-16-001: 0.20 opt Au over 11.9 ft, or 6.9 g/t over 3.6 m (710)
◦Including 0.61 opt Au over 3.1 ft, or 20.8 g/t over 0.9 m (710)
•630-16-002: 1.4 opt Au over 3.7 ft, or 48.0 g/t over 1.1 m (710 HW)
•630-16-002: 0.43 opt Au over 56.0 ft, or 14.7 g/t over 17.1 m (710)
•630-16-004: 0.78 opt Au over 6.5 ft, or 26.7 g/t over 2.0 m (710 HW)
•630-16-005: 0.57 opt Au over 10.1 ft, or 19.4 g/t over 3.1 m (710)
•630-16-005: 0.48 opt Au over 8.9 ft, or 16.6 g/t over 2.7 m (710 HW)
Drilling is planned for later this year to follow up these high grade intercepts and drill down-dip on
the 710 and 711 veins from the 26 level.

Gold revenues increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 largely due to
increases of 5,731 ounces and 5,560 ounces, respectively, in the number of gold ounces sold.
Ounces sold during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 increased from the
comparable periods of 2015 as ore tons milled increased by 36.7% and 32.5%, respectively,
which accommodated planned lower grades in the mine plan. During the second quarter of 2016,
gold revenues further benefited from an increase of $54 (or 4.4%) in the average realized price

(1)  Gold equivalent measures are the gold measure plus the silver measure divided by a GEO
ratio. GEO ratios are computed by dividing the average realized gold price per ounce by the
average realized silver price per ounce received by us in the respective period. Refer to the Non-
IFRS Performance Measures section of this MD&A for additional detail.
Production costs - As discussed in the above Revenues section, during the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, we sold an additional 3,725 GEOs and 3,522 GEOs, respectively, which
largely increased production costs compared to the same periods of 2015. When compared to
the same periods of the previous year, production costs per gold equivalent ounce sold were
approximately $10 lower during both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 as we
benefited from an increased mining rate and high grades from additional working faces and
sequencing abilities provided by previously completed ore development. Our 2016 operating
targets anticipate GEO production and grades progressively increasing throughout the year
which we expect will result in lower second half production costs compared to the first half of
2016.
Depreciation and depletion - Although the cost of our Mineral properties, plant and equipment in
service generally increases period over period due to recurring capital expenditures, increases in
the mineral resource bases at both Fire Creek and Midas have reduced the amount of
depreciation and depletion per gold equivalent ounce sold.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative costs totaled $3.2 million and $3.0 million during the second quarters
of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $6.6 million and $5.8 million during the first six months of
2016 and 2015, respectively. Increases in the 2016 periods are due to higher compensation and
benefit costs from increased staff levels at the corporate office due to our growth and $0.4 million
of first quarter severance costs.
(Loss) gain on derivative, net
The change in fair value of the derivative, which is related to the March 2011 gold supply
agreement, as amended and restated (the "Gold Supply Agreement"), totaled $(0.7) million and
$0.1 million during the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $(1.8) million and
$0.3 million during the first six months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Losses in the second
quarter and first six months of 2016 were attributable to (1) increases in the fair value of the
derivative liability due to higher estimates of forward gold prices and (2) realized losses recorded
for gold ounces sold to the counterparty under the Gold Supply Agreement (see Note 7.
Derivative Liability Related to Gold Supply Agreement).
Finance charges, net
Finance charges totaled $1.3 million and $2.1 million during the second quarters of 2016 and
2015, respectively, and $2.6 million and $4.3 million during the first six months of 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and were primarily related to effective interest charges on the gold purchase
agreement dated February 11, 2014 between us and Franco-Nevada GLW Holdings Corp. (the
"Gold Purchase Agreement") and, in the 2015 periods, interest charges for the 11.0% senior
secured notes issued in February 11, 2014 in connection with the Midas acquisition, which were
repaid in full in the third quarter of 2015. During the 2016 periods we recorded additional finance
charges for finance lease obligations, the Promissory Note pursuant to the True North Acquisition
(which were capitalized to qualifying assets), and accretion of the decommissioning provision.
For additional detail on our borrowing agreements and amounts recorded to Finance charges,
net, see Note 14. Finance Charges.

Foreign currency gain (loss), net
Foreign currency gain (loss) totaled $0.1 million and $(1.4) million during the second quarters of
2016 and 2015, respectively, and $(2.2) million and $6.3 million during the first six months of
2016 and 2015, respectively, and is primarily related to unrealized amounts on intercompany
loan balances, which we expect to settle in the foreseeable future, and the Gold Purchase
Agreement.
Business acquisition costs
Business acquisition costs totaled $0.3 million and $1.0 million during the second quarter and
first six months of 2016 and are related to the True North Acquisition (Note 3. Business
Combinations) and the Hollister Acquisition (Note 22. Subsequent Events).
Provision for legal settlement
During the second quarter and first six months of 2016, we recorded a $2.3 million provision for
estimated settlement costs with a former employee. See Note 21. Commitments and
Contingencies for details.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense totaled $3.7 million and $3.0 million during the second quarters of 2016 and
2015, respectively, and $4.4 million and $6.5 million during the first six months of 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and includes amounts for the State of Nevada net proceeds tax and federal income
tax.
Net income and Net income per share - basic
For the reasons discussed above, we reported net income of $7.1 million (or $0.05 per share)
and $3.9 million (or $0.03 per share) during the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and $6.0 million (or $0.04 per share) and $12.0 million (or $0.09 per share) during the first six
months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Mining Operations (Nevada, USA)
Actual vs. modeled resource grades
Our average gold equivalent mill head grades, on both a consolidated and individual mine site
basis, can vary from the average gold equivalent grades of the mineral resource estimates for
each site. During our mining activities at Fire Creek, we may encounter mineralization not
included in the mineral resource estimate that, in the opinion of management, can be processed
economically. Often-times, rather than leaving such mineralization for future extraction, we mine
the area when encountered so as not to potentially sterilize the mineralization or incur additional
costs to re-access and mine it at a later date. At Midas, additional design work, rehabilitation, and
underground development are required to enable access to some of the higher grade areas
included in the historical mining portions of the mineral resource estimate. Due to the above,
actual mined gold equivalent grades can differ from those which are stated in the current mineral
resource estimate.

Operations - As a result of increased mill throughput and higher grades at Fire Creek, during the
second quarter of 2016 we produced a record 41,436 GEOs, bringing our year to date
consolidated GEO production to 71,592 GEOs, which is approximately 48.5% of our annual
guidance's midpoint range. Our 2016 operating targets anticipate GEO production and grades
progressively increasing throughout the year which we expect will result in lower second half
cost measures compared to the first six months of 2016. The 86,194 ore tons milled (average of
947 tons per day) represented a quarterly record and increased by an average of 131 tons per
day over the first quarter of 2016, thereby accommodating planned lower ore grades in the first
half of the year. Our second-half strategy entails continuing to increase the average daily milling
rate at the Midas mill, which has a design capacity of 1,200 tons per day, to allow us to meet our
annual production goal.
Revenues and costs - Fire Creek and Midas's second quarter 2016 ounces sold were in-line with
management expectations and included the sale of 37,914 GEOs, consisting of 32,499 gold
ounces and 408,316 silver ounces. Due to the sale of an additional 5,731 gold ounces at a $53
higher average realized price, gold revenue increased $8.7 million during the second quarter of
2016 compared to the same period of 2015, while silver revenue decreased due to lower grades,
lower recoveries from reduced ore retention time in the leach tanks, and comparable realized
prices. Additional details over revenue changes are provided in the Consolidated Financial
Results of Operations section. Despite planned lower first-half 2016 grades, we generated
significant
- 10 -
cash margins on a consolidated basis. Production cash costs per GEO sold decreased by $90
(or 13.1%) from the first quarter of 2016 to $595 in the second quarter of 2016, resulting in
production cash costs per GEO sold of $636 for the first half of 2016. Second quarter 2016
production costs were positively impacted by increased tons and higher grades from additional
working faces and sequencing abilities provided by previously completed ore development. All-
in costs per gold ounce sold (excluding True North capital expenditures) were $1,137 and totaled
$1,271 when including True North capital expenditures.
Capital Expenditures - During the second quarter of 2016, capital expenditures totaled $8.4
million at Fire Creek, $7.7 million at Midas, and $5.8 million at True North. For additional details
of capital expenditures by site and type refer to the Investing Cash Flows part of the Financial
Position, Liquidity, and Capital Resources section.
Fire Creek (Nevada Operations)
Fire Creek is 100% owned, fully-permitted, and was acquired by Klondex in 1975. Production
began in 2014 under the bulk sample permit. Fire Creek is located in north-central Nevada in
Lander County approximately 16 miles south of a major highway (Interstate-80) near other large
gold deposits and mines which are owned and operated by major mining companies. Fire Creek
is a high-grade, epithermal vein deposit, and the land package covers approximately 17,000
acres (~26.5 square miles). Ore mined from Fire Creek is trucked daily to Midas for processing in
the milling facility. The following table provides a summary of Fire Creek operating results and
period-over-period changes.

Operations - Ore tons milled from Fire Creek were an all-time high 33,968 tons, surpassing the
previous record set in the first quarter of 2016 by 1,226 tons, and increasing 14,337 tons (or
73.0%) from the second quarter of 2015. Increased tonnage together with increased grades
resulted in the production of 29,067 GEOs during the second quarter of 2016, an increase of
10,172 GEOs from the second quarter of 2015 and 7,493 GEOs from the first quarter of 2016.
Higher grades during the second quarter of 2016 at Fire Creek were attributable to first quarter
silling activities which opened up additional working faces to access higher gold grade ore. We
believe the ore development activities completed during the first half of 2016 have positioned

us to continue to increase production and GEO grades during the third and fourth quarters to
achieve our goal of producing 97,000 - 100,000 GEOs for the year.
Revenues and costs - Revenues during the second quarter of 2016 increased due to the sale of
an additional 7,432 gold ounces (from higher production) at a $57 higher average realized price
per ounce, resulting in $10.4 million more gold revenue during the second quarter of 2016
compared to the 2015 quarter. In addition to the increased working faces discussed above, our
use of longhole stoping continued and accounted for approximately 26% of the ore tons mined
during the second quarter of 2016, thereby benefiting costs and resulting in production cash
costs per GEO sold of $417 in the second quarter of 2016, a decrease of $38 (or 8.4%) per ounce
from first quarter 2016 production cash costs per GEO sold of $455. During the second half of
2016, production cash costs per GEO sold are expected to continue to decrease due to our ability
to access higher grade ore from mine sequencing.
Capital Expenditures - During the second quarter of 2016, capital expenditures totaled $8.4
million, consisting of $6.6 million in sustaining and $1.8 million in non-sustaining (growth). For
additional details of capital expenditures by site refer to the Investing Cash Flows part of the
Financial Position, Liquidity, and Capital Resources section.
Midas Mine and Mill (Nevada Operations)
Midas is 100% owned, fully-permitted, and was acquired by Klondex in February 2014. Midas is
located in north-central Nevada in Elko County approximately 58 miles east of a major highway
(Interstate-80) near other large gold deposits and mines which are owned and operated by major
mining companies. Midas is a low-sulphidation, epithermal vein, deposit and the land package
covers approximately 30,000 acres. Midas has a 1,200 ton per day milling facility which
processes ore mined from both Midas and Fire Creek. The following table provides a summary of

development activities continued at Midas and we expect second half 2016 production to occur
from higher grade areas and veins made accessible from the recent development activities.
During the second quarter of 2016, Midas produced 12,320 GEOs, an increase of 3,844 (or
45.3%) GEOs from the first quarter of 2016. Silver recoveries were negatively impacted by
increased milling rates, which reduced ore retention times in leach tanks. We believe the ore
development activities completed during the first half of 2016 have positioned us to continue to
increase production and GEO grades during the third and fourth quarters to achieve or goal of
producing 48,000 - 50,000 GEOs.
Revenues and costs - Revenues decreased $3.7 million as higher average realized metal prices
helped to offset the impacts of selling 1,701 less gold ounces and 121,958 less silver ounces
compared to the second quarter of 2015. Production cash costs per GEO sold decreased by $55
(or 5.2%) from the first quarter of 2016 to 996 in the second quarter of 2016, resulting in
production cash costs per GEO sold of 1,019 for the first half of 2016. Second quarter 2016
production costs were positively impacted by increased grades and tons.
Capital Expenditures - During the second quarter of 2016, capital expenditures totaled $7.7
million, consisting of $5.8 million in sustaining and $1.9 million in non-sustaining (growth). For
additional details of capital expenditures by site refer to the Investing Cash Flows part of the
Financial Position, Liquidity, and Capital Resources section.
True North Project (Manitoba, Canada)
Project Overview
True North (formerly Rice Lake), located in Manitoba, Canada, is 100% owned, fully-permitted,
and was acquired on January 22, 2016 (see Note 3. Business Combinations for additional
details). True North is our first property outside of Nevada, USA, and we believe True North
provides us with an opportunity to strategically and responsibly grow our business in a mining
friendly jurisdiction while leveraging our technical expertise in narrow-vein underground mining.
True North is a past producing underground gold mining operation consisting of three
underground deposits with a modern, fully-permitted 2,500 ton per day mill. Under previous
ownership, mining took place at True North continuously from 2007 until May 2015 when the
operation was placed on care and maintenance.
Near Term Objectives
Due to the fact that True North is a fully permitted, previously producing mining complex, we
expect an efficient and straightforward process to identify the most profitable and responsible
program to advance the project. We have retained a portion of the existing site workforce,
including members of the team who will be integral in developing a right-sized mine plan,
capable of generating free cash flow (if a production decision is made). Efforts and activities at
True North will be executed based on best in class health, safety, and environmental practices
consistent with the Company's core values.
It is our expectation that there is substantial value and upside potential in a variety of areas at the
True North property, and our 2016 objectives will therefore include the following, all of which are
focused on making a production decision in the third quarter of 2016:
Exploration - Commence a small-scale, selective exploration campaign to improve our
understanding of, and to identify mineralization (if any), in areas close to existing underground
workings. As of June 30, 2016, we had received positive assay results from 30 underground drill
holes totaling 13,288 ft which targeted the up-dip extensions of the 710/711 zones. Many of the
assay results met or exceeded grades contained in historical resource estimates.
Mineral resources - Develop a mineral resource estimate that includes both historical and new
drill results. New drill results will be based on priority targets and zones which we believe can
contribute to a quality mineral resource estimate. Incorporating the positive assays received from
the ongoing exploration program, we expect the updated mineral resource estimate to be
completed in the third quarter of 2016.
Mine Plan - Generate a detailed mine plan that optimizes the ore body, subsequent to the
completion of a new mineral resource estimate.
Gold in tailings and test stope mining - We have assessed the potential to recover gold in
tailings and believe, when coupled with test stope mining, that we can recover 8,000 - 12,000
gold ounces in 2016.
Site infrastructure and equipment - Perform a thorough assessment of site facilities,
infrastructure, underground workings, and mobile equipment and refurbish as needed. Identify
and transfer any excess pieces of equipment to our Nevada operations as appropriate.
We expect to be in a position to make a formal production decision in the third quarter of 2016.

In March 2016, we received approval to recommence mining and milling operations from the
Director of Manitoba Mineral Resources. We have replaced 100% of the guides on the shaft and
approximately 95% of the track replacement has been

completed (approximately 6,000 ft). Additional infrastructure included a new underground shop
and new gear storage cut-outs, which are approximately 95% complete. We initiated testing of
narrow vein long hole design to reduce dilution. We also received initial metallurgical testing
results on existing tailings which indicate the tailings can be processed through the existing mill
flow sheet. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we began processing tailings and at the end of July we
poured our first doré bar.
Capital Expenditures
During the second quarter of 2016, capital expenditures at True North totaled $5.8 million,
consisting entirely of non-sustaining (growth) expenditures. For additional details of capital
expenditures by site refer to the Investing Cash Flows part of the Financial Position, Liquidity,
and Capital Resources section.
Financial Position, Liquidity, and Capital Resources
General Strategy
It is our goal to maintain sufficient liquid assets and access to capital resources. To accomplish
this, we regularly perform short and long-term cash flow forecasts using current assumptions of
future gold and silver prices, foreign exchange rates, production rates, and operating and capital
costs. Our liquidity and capital resources management strategy entails a disciplined approach in
monitoring the timing and amount of any capital investment in our mines, mineral properties, or
acquisitions while continually remaining in a position which we believe will allow us to respond
to changes in our business environment, such as a decrease in metal prices, or other factors
beyond our control.
Our capital structure consists of a mixture of debt and other obligations and shareholders' equity.
We regularly review our capital structure and evaluate various financing options and strategies
that may improve our current liquidity and financial condition, are attainable on favorable and
reasonable terms, and are permissible under our existing debt arrangements and other
obligations. Such financing options may include, but are not limited to, revolving borrowing
facilities, equipment financing, term loan facilities, refinancing existing obligations, and/or the
issuance of equity securities, warrants, or other instruments.
Forward Sales Contracts
During the second quarter of 2016, in order to increase the certainty of our expected future cash
flows, we entered into fixed forward spot trades for a portion of our 2016 gold and silver sales. As
of June 30, 2016, we had outstanding fixed forward contracts covering 54,900 ounces of gold at
an average price of $1,260 per ounce and 652,000 ounces of silver at an average price of $16.73
per ounce, all of which will be physically delivered into during the third and fourth quarters of
2016.
Other than the aforementioned, we have not entered into any other contracts to hedge market
risks arising from changes in metal prices, diesel and propane costs, and currency and interest
rates. We will continually and actively monitor applicable markets and quotes and may consider
entering into additional hedging agreements and contracts if determined to be advantageous by
management and the board of directors, and such transactions are permissible under our existing
debt agreements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As discussed below in the Sources and Uses of Cash section, at June 30, 2016, our Cash
balance totaled $36.9 million, decreasing $22.2 million from the December 31, 2015 balance of
$59.1 million largely due to $20.0 million paid for the Rice Lake Acquisition and $36.4 million of
capital expenditures which were partially offset by $28.0 million of cash generated from
operations. Due to the nature of our operations and the composition of our balance sheet assets,
as of June 30, 2016 our current assets, which include Cash of $36.9 million, Trade receivables of
$0.1 million, and Inventories of $21.4 million, represented substantially all of our liquid assets on
hand. We have access to additional liquidity under the $25.0 million Revolver, the entire capacity
of which was available as of June 30, 2016.
We maintained our strong financial position and as of June 30, 2016, had total liquidity of $56.6
million, consisting of $29.5 million in working capital and $25.0 million of borrowing availability
under our Revolver. The following chart provides a summary of our working capital and liquidity
for the most recent eight quarters.

Our working capital decreased by $32.9 million (approximately 52.8%) from December 31, 2015
to June 30, 2016, while our working capital ratio decreased by 50.5%. Working capital changes
were primarily attributable to a $22.2 million decrease in Cash, a $5.6 million increase in
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a $3.6 million increase in Secured promissory note,
current, and a $2.3 million increase in Provision for legal settlement.
Included in working capital are Inventories, which include production-related inventories that can
provide us with cash liquidity in excess of their June 30, 2016 carrying value of $17.7 million due
to a cash profit margin we realize at the time of sale. The following table summarizes the
estimated recoverable gold and silver ounces contained in our Inventories and the underlying
amount of liquidity which may be generated from their sale using June 30, 2016 period-end

Our June 30, 2016 working capital, available sources of liquidity, and future operating cash flows
will be used, in part, to fund recurring operating and production costs, deliver gold ounces under
the Gold Purchase Agreement (8,000 ounces over the next 12 months), make principal and
interest payments on the Promissory Note and finance lease obligations, fund sustaining and
expansion capital expenditures at our mines (expected to total approximately $55.0 million to
$60.0 million for 2016), and invest in the development of our True North project. At current and
hedged metal price levels, and when using our estimates

of future production and costs, we believe our cash flows from operating activities together with
our working capital and Revolver, will be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next 12
months. See the Contractual Obligations section for additional detail on the timing and amounts
of our future cash requirements.

Operating Cash Flows - During the second quarter of 2016, we sold 5,731 more gold ounces at a
$53 higher average realized price per ounce, which increased our operating margins and cash
flows from operations, partially offset by lower silver revenues. During the second quarters of
2016 and 2015, our production cash costs per GEO sold totaled $595 and $605, respectively,
both of which were significantly less than our average realized gold prices per ounce of $1,266
and $1,213, respectively. Cash flows from operations are reduced for gold ounces delivered
under the Gold Purchase Agreement, which during the three and six months ended June 30,
2016, totaled 2,000 gold ounces (or $2.5 million in revenue) and 4,000 gold ounces (or $5.2
million in revenue), respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
Depreciation and depletion totaled $7.0 million and $12.8 million, respectively, and were the
largest non-cash charges included Net income.
Investing Cash Flows - During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash used in
investing activities increased by $11.3 million and $40.2 million, respectively, compared to the
same periods of 2015, as we have larger capital expenditure programs and funded the $20.0
million True North Acquisition payment in the first quarter of 2016. During both the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, we decreased our net restricted cash balances by $2.1 million
compared to decreases of $3.4 million and $6.8 million, respectively, in the same periods of
2015. The following tables summarize our capital expenditures for the three and six months

Financing Cash Flows - During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash
provided by financing activities increased by $1.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively,
compared to the same periods of 2015 as we received additional cash proceeds from the
exercise of warrants and share options which exceeded the cash payments required to service
our debt obligations.
Foreign Currency Effect on Cash - A portion of our Cash is held in bank accounts denominated in
Canadian dollars. Generally speaking, when the US dollar strengthens against the Canadian
dollar, we experience negative foreign currency translation adjustments on our Canadian dollar

our current estimate and subject to change based on specific decisions and circumstances
applicable to each mine or project.
In addition to the above, Midas and Fire Creek are subject to royalty commitments as disclosed in
Note 24. Commitments and Contingencies of our audited consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2015.
Debt Covenants
The Gold Purchase Agreement, Revolver, Promissory Note, and finance lease obligations all
contain representations and warranties, events of default, and covenants which are customary for
agreements of each type that, among other things, restrict or limit our ability to incur or guarantee
additional debt. The Revolver contains financial covenants which require us to maintain a
Tangible Net Worth of not less than $100.0 million, a Gearing Ratio not greater than 4.00:1, a
Cash Balance of not less than
- 17 -
$10.0 million, and a Current Ratio of not less than 1.10:1 (as such terms are defined in the
Revolver). At June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants and terms of our debt
obligations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Non-IFRS Performance Measures
We have included the non-IFRS measures "Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce
sold", “All‐in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold”, and "All-in costs per gold ounce sold" in this
MD&A (collectively, the "Non-IFRS Measures"). These Non-IFRS Measures are used internally
to assess our operating and economic performance and to provide key performance information
to management. We believe that these Non-IFRS Measures, in addition to conventional
measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to
evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flows required to fund our business. These
Non-IFRS Measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered
in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
These Non-IFRS Measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and
therefore may not be comparable to or consistent with measures used by other issuers or with
amounts presented in our financial statements.
Our primary business is gold production and our future development and current operations
primarily focus on maximizing returns from such gold production. As a result, our Non-IFRS
Measures are calculated and disclosed on a per gold ounce basis.
Production Cash Costs per Gold Equivalent Ounce Sold
Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold presents our cash costs associated with
the production of gold equivalent ounces and, as such, non-cash depreciation and depletion
charges are excluded. Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated on a
per gold equivalent ounce sold basis, and includes all direct and indirect operating costs related
to the physical activities of producing gold, including mining, processing, third-party refining
expenses, on-site administrative and support costs, and royalties (State of Nevada net proceeds
taxes are excluded). Gold equivalent ounces are computed as the number of silver ounces
required to generate the revenue derived from the sale of one gold ounce, using average realized
selling prices (table in thousands, except ounces sold and per ounce amounts):

All-in Sustaining Costs per Gold Ounce Sold
All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold presents the full cost of gold production from our
current operations; therefore, capital amounts related to expansion and growth projects are
excluded. Certain other cash expenditures, including State of Nevada net proceeds taxes,
federal tax payments, and financing costs are also excluded. Our calculation of all-in sustaining
costs per gold ounce sold is consistent with the June 2013 guidance released by the World Gold
Council, a non-regulatory, non-profit market development organization for the gold industry.
We calculate our all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold on a consolidated basis as ore from
both Fire Creek and Midas is processed at Midas and because general and administrative
expenses are related to our mining operations as a whole. All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce
sold includes all (1) direct and indirect operating cash costs related to the physical activities of
producing gold, including mining, processing, third-party refining expenses, on-site
administrative and support costs, and royalties, (2) general and administrative expenses, (3)
decommissioning provision accretion, and (4) sustaining capital expenditures, the total of which
is reduced for revenues earned from silver sales (table in thousands, except ounces sold and per

We define sustaining capital expenditures as those costs which are required to sustain current
gold ounce production levels. As such, sustaining capital expenditures exclude amounts for
exploration activities, mine development, and permitting activities related to long-term growth and
expansion efforts. For a reconciliation of our sustaining and non-sustaining (growth) capital
expenditures see the Investing Cash Flows part of the Financial Position, Liquidity, and Capital
Resources section.
All-in Costs per Gold Ounce Sold
All-in costs per gold ounce sold includes additional costs which reflect the varying costs of
producing gold over the life-cycle of a mine or project. We calculate our all-in costs per gold
ounce sold by beginning with the all-in sustaining costs total and adding non-sustaining (growth)
capital expenditures and other costs not related to current operations (table in thousands, except
ounces sold and per ounce amounts):

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments, Estimates, and Assumptions
Changes in Accounting Policies
As discussed in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, during the first quarter of
2016, we began capitalizing borrowing costs (see Note 14. Finance Charges for amounts
capitalized). Other than the aforementioned, the preparation of our Financial Statements followed
the same accounting policies applied in the prior year which are disclosed in Note 2. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2015. We continue to evaluate the impacts of the recently issued, but not
yet effective, accounting pronouncements disclosed in Note 3. Recent Accounting
Pronouncements of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended

Significant Judgments, Estimates, and Assumptions
This MD&A is based on our Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
IFRS. The preparation of our Financial Statements requires us to make judgments, assumptions,
and/or estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the
date of the Financial Statements and reported amounts of expenses and taxes during reporting
periods. Actual results may differ from estimates as the estimation process is inherently
uncertain. Estimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other
factors that are considered to be relevant at the time such estimates are made. Revisions to
estimates and the resulting impacts on the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities are
accounted for prospectively.
For a detailed discussion of the judgments, estimates, and assumptions used in preparing our
Financial Statements and this related MD&A, refer to Note 4. Significant Judgments, Estimates,
and Assumptions of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Financial
Statements.
Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
National Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings
(“National Instrument 52-109”) requires public companies in Canada to submit interim and
annual certificates relating to the design of internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) and
an annual certificate that includes evaluating the effectiveness of ICFR. Our ICFR is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. Management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining ICFR. We used the 2013 Commission of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) framework as the basis for
designing our ICFR. Due to its inherent limitations, ICFR may not prevent or detect
misstatements on a timely basis as such systems can only be designed to provide reasonable as
opposed to absolute assurance. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of ICFR
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
There were no changes in ICFR during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 that are
reasonably likely to materially affect, or that have materially affected, ICFR.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all
relevant information is gathered and reported on a timely basis to senior management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to enable this information to be reviewed
and discussed so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding the timely public disclosure
of the information. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each evaluated the
design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as at June 30, 2016 and
concluded that these controls and procedures were effective.
There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the
quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, internal control over financial reporting.
Exchange Listing and Outstanding Share Data
Our common shares are listed on the TSX under the symbol “KDX” and on the NYSE MKT under
the symbol "KLDX." We have an unlimited number of common shares authorized for issuance.
As of June 30, 2016, we had 142,884,336 common shares issued and outstanding, 6,793,268
outstanding share purchase options, and 8,057,300 outstanding share purchase warrants. As of
August 5, 2016, we had 144,820,792 common shares issued and outstanding, 6,551,225
outstanding share purchase options, and 6,463,200 outstanding share purchase warrants,
390,439 outstanding common share awards, and 158,225,656 common shares fully-diluted.
Cautionary Notes
Forward-Looking Statements
This MD&A contains "forward-looking information" or "forward looking statements" within the
meaning of applicable Canadian and United States securities legislation (collectively, the
"forward-looking information"). All forward-looking information contained in this MD&A is given
as of the date hereof. In certain cases, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of
words such as "believe", "expect", "may", "will", "should", "could", "plans", "anticipates",
"estimates", "believes", "potential", "intends", "projects", "expects" and other similar expressions.
Forward-looking information reflects the current expectations and assumptions of management,
and is subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which
may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-
looking information. Forward-looking information, including, but not limited to information relating
to the actual results of exploration, development, mining, evaluation activities, actual results of
reclamation activities, the estimation or realization of mineral resources and mineral reserves, the
timing and
- 21 -
amount of estimated future production, the making of future production decisions, the timing and
receipt of required permits and approvals, capital expenditures, costs and timing of the
development of new mineral deposits, requirements for additional capital, the sufficiency of
working capital and liquidity, and the future prices of precious and base metals, is inherently
uncertain. In addition, the timing and magnitude of certain events are inherently risky and
uncertain, particularly as they relate to the possible variations in mineral grade or recovery rates,
failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated, accidents, labour disputes,
road blocks and other risks of the mining industry, delays in obtaining governmental approvals,
permits or financing or in the completion of development or construction activities, currency
fluctuations, title disputes or claims limitations on insurance coverage and the timing and
possible outcome of pending litigation.
Key assumptions upon which our forward-looking information is based include the following:
estimated prices for gold and silver; being able to secure new financing to continue exploration,
development and operational activities; currency exchange rates; our ability to comply with
environmental, safety and other regulatory requirements and being able to obtain regulatory
approvals (including licenses and permits) in a timely manner; there not being any material
adverse effects arising as a result of political instability, taxes or royalty increases, terrorism,
sabotage, natural disasters, equipment failures or adverse changes in government legislation or
the socio-economic conditions in the regions in which we operate; us being able to achieve our
growth strategy; our operating costs; key personnel and access to all equipment necessary to
operate Fire Creek, Midas, and our other mineral projects.
These assumptions should be carefully considered. You are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on the forward-looking information or the assumptions on which our forward-looking
information is based. You are advised to carefully review and consider the risk factors identified
in this MD&A under the heading "Risk Factors" as well as other factors identified and described
in more detail under the heading “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Information Form and
our other filings with Canadian securities regulators and the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”), which may be viewed at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov,
respectively, for a discussion of the factors that could cause our actual results and performance to
be materially different from any anticipated future results or performance expressed or implied by
the forward-looking information. You are further cautioned that the foregoing list of assumptions is
not exhaustive and it is recommended that you consult the more complete discussion of our
business, financial condition and prospects that are included in this MD&A. The forward-looking
information contained in this MD&A is given as of the date hereof and, accordingly, is subject to
change after such date.
Although we believe that the assumptions on which the forward-looking information is given are
reasonable, based on the information available to us on the date such forward-looking
information was given, no assurances can be given as to whether these assumptions will prove
to be correct. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information.
We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking information, except as, and to the
extent, required by applicable securities laws. The forward-looking information contained in this
MD&A is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.
Mineral Reserve and Resource Estimates
This MD&A has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in
effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of U.S. securities laws. All resource and
reserve estimates included in this MD&A have been prepared in accordance with National
Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”). NI 43-101 is a rule
developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public
disclosures an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects.
These standards differ significantly from the mineral reserve disclosure requirements of the SEC
set out in Industry Guide 7. Consequently, reserve and resource information contained in this
MD&A are not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by U.S.
companies in accordance with the rules of the SEC.
In particular, the SEC’s Industry Guide 7 applies different standards in order to classify
mineralization as a reserve. As a result, the definitions of proven and probable reserves used in
NI 43-101 differ from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7. Under SEC standards,
mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless the determination has been made that
the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the
reserve determination is made. Among other things, all necessary permits would be required to
be in hand or issuance imminent in order to classify mineralized material as reserves under the
SEC standards. Accordingly, mineral reserve estimates contained in this MD&A may not qualify
as “reserves” under SEC standards.
In addition, this MD&A uses the terms “mineral resources”, “measured mineral resources”,
“indicated mineral resources” and “inferred mineral resources” to comply with the reporting
standards in Canada. The SEC’s Industry Guide 7 does not recognize mineral resources and
U.S. companies are generally not permitted to disclose resources in documents they file with the
SEC. You are specifically cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in
these categories will ever be converted into SEC defined mineral reserves. Further, “inferred
mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence
- 22 -
and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, you are also cautioned
not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists. In accordance with
Canadian rules, estimates of “inferred mineral resources” cannot form the basis of feasibility or,
except in limited circumstances, other economic studies. It cannot be assumed that all or any part
of “indicated mineral resources” or “inferred mineral resources” will ever be upgraded to a higher
category or mineral resources or that mineral resources will be classified as mineral reserves.
You are cautioned not to assume that any part of the reported “measured mineral resources”,
“indicated mineral resources” or “inferred mineral resources” in this MD&A is economically or
legally mineable. Disclosure of “contained ounces” is permitted under the Canadian disclosure
rules; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not
constitute reserves as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Further,
while NI 43-101 permits companies to disclose economic projections contained in preliminary
economic assessments which are not based on “mineral reserves”, U.S. companies are not
normally permitted to disclose economic projections for a mineral property in their SEC filings
prior to the establishment of “mineral reserves.” For the above reasons, information contained in
this MD&A that describes the Company’s mineral reserve and resource estimates or that
describes the results of pre-feasibility or other studies is not comparable to similar information
made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.
Technical Information
Scientific and technical information in this MD&A has been reviewed and approved by Brian
Morris, a "qualified person" within the meaning of NI 43-101.
Risk Factors
As a resource acquisition, exploration, development and production company, we are engaged
in a highly speculative business that involves a high degree of risk and is frequently
unsuccessful. In addition to the information disclosed elsewhere in this MD&A, you should
carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before deciding whether to invest
in our securities. These risk factors do not necessarily comprise all of the risks to which we are or
will be subject.
Our failure to successfully address the risks and uncertainties described below could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations and could
cause the trading price of our securities to decline. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully
address these risks or other unknown risks that may affect our business. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our
business operations. If any of the possibilities described in such risks actually occurs, our
business, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. In
addition to the risk factors mentioned below, you are encouraged to read the risk factors as more
fully described in our filings with the Canadian Securities Administrators, including our annual
information form, available under our issuer profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and our filings
with the SEC at www.sec.gov. Important risk factors to consider, among others, are the following:
We are primarily dependent on the success of the Fire Creek mine and the Midas mine as
sources of future revenue and profit.
Our decision to operate the Midas and Fire Creek mines for commercial production purposes
was not based on a feasibility study.
Forecasts of future production are estimates only, and actual production may be less than
•
•
•
•estimated.
•Our exploration activities may not be commercially successful.
•Exploration, development and mining involve a high degree of risk.
•Our operations may require further capital.
•We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in gold and silver prices.
•Our ability to pay interest and loan repayments depends on production and cash flows.
•We are subject to foreign exchange risk relating to the relative value of the U.S. dollar.
•Title to our mineral properties may be subject to other claims.
Mineral resources and mineral reserves are only estimates which may be unreliable and subject
to geologic uncertainty and inherent sample variability.
Inferred mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic
viability.
•Government regulation may adversely affect our business and planned operations.
•Government approvals and permits are required in connection with our activities.
•Our operations are subject to environmental risks.
Aboriginal interests and related consultation issues may impact operations at our Canadian
properties.
•We may be subject to unforeseen litigation.
•We do not insure our operations against all risks.
•We compete with larger, better capitalized competitors in the mining industry.
•Current global financial conditions are subject to volatility.
•
•
- 23 -
•Our directors and officers may have conflicts of interest.
•Our success depends on key personnel and a limited management team.
•We may engage in hedging activities.
•There is no assurance that an active trading market in our common shares will be sustained.
•Our common shares may experience price volatility and be subject to dilution.
•We have not declared dividends and there is no assurance we will do so.
