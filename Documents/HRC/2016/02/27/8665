<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In accordance with General Assembly resolution 62/145 and Human Rights Council 
resolution 7/21, the Working Group held a regional consultation for the African group in 
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 3 and 4 March 2010. 
</p>
<p> Through the consultation, the Working Group sought to gain a regional perspective 
on the current practices related to mercenaries and private military and security companies 
registered, operating or recruiting personnel in Africa. It provided an opportunity to discuss 
the fundamental question of the role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the 
legitimate use of force and to share information on steps taken by States in the region to 
introduce legislation or other measures to regulate and monitor the activities of such 
companies on the international market. 
</p>
<p> The consultation also provided an opportunity for the Working Group to brief 
participants on progress made in drawing up a draft convention on the regulation, oversight

</p>
<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 15 of its resolution 62/145, the General Assembly requested the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to convene 
regional governmental consultations on traditional and new forms of mercenary activities as 
a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-
determination, in particular regarding the effects of the activities of private military and 
security companies (PMSCs) on the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p><p>2. In line with the above-mentioned resolution and Human Rights Council resolution 
7/21, the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights 
and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination1 held its regional 
consultation for Africa in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 3 and 4 March 2010. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group had held three previous regional consultations, the first in 
Panama City for the Latin American and Caribbean Region on 17 and 18 December 2007, 
the second in Moscow for the Eastern European Group and Central Asian Region on 17 and 
18 October 2008 and the third in Bangkok for Asia and the Pacific on 26 and 27 October 
2009.2 
</p>
<p>4. The African consultation was attended by representatives of Algeria, Angola, 
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Morocco, 
Mozambique, Niger, Sierra Leone, the Sudan, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe and by 
representatives from the African Union Commission. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group was represented by its Chairperson-Rapporteur, Shaista 
Shameem and its members Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez, Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado and 
Alexander Nikitin. 
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group expresses its sincere appreciation to the authorities of Ethiopia 
for hosting this consultation. It is also extremely grateful to the OHCHR-East Africa 
Regional Office in Addis Ababa for its invaluable assistance throughout the meeting. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of the meeting 
</b>7. The consultation was opened by Karim Ghezraoui, Chief, Groups in Focus Section, 
Special Procedures Branch, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) who, on behalf of OHCHR, welcomed all participants and expressed his 
sincere appreciation to the Government of Ethiopia for hosting the meeting. He stated that 
the question of the human rights impact related to the activities of mercenaries had been of 
increasing concern to the international community and particularly to Africa in its fight for 
the right to self-determination. Commending the work done by the Working Group since its 
creation, he explained that its mandate had evolved with time to cover the use of private 
</p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The Working Group on the use of mercenaries was established by resolution 2005/12 of the 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights. The Working Group is composed of five independent experts serving 
in their personal capacities. Since March 2009, Ms. Shaista Shameem (Fiji) is the Chairperson-
Rapporteur. The other members are Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez (Colombia), Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del 
Prado (Spain), Alexander Nikitin (Russian Federation), and Najat al-Hajjaji (Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya).

<p>military and security companies (PMSCs) and their impact on human rights. He 
emphasized that at the core of the issue was the question of accountability for violations 
and remedies for victims. Finally, he took the opportunity to mention that OHCHR was 
pleased to have recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the African Union 
(AU) that confirmed long-standing cooperation to promote and protect human rights in 
Africa and set up mechanisms for technical assistance, training, capacity-building and 
mutual cooperation in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>8. In her opening remarks, Ms. Shaista Shameem, Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group, said that she was appreciative that so many African countries had 
responded positively to the Working Group&#8217;s invitation to this important consultation. She 
gave a brief overview of the mandate of the Working Group and reminded the participants 
that the mandate succeeded that of the Special Rapporteur on the use of mercenaries which 
had been created in 1987 in a context in which the right of peoples to self-determination in 
Africa was often threatened by mercenary activities. Emphasizing that Africa had been both 
at the receiving end of, and a fertile ground for, mercenary activities, she recalled that in 
1989 the General Assembly had adopted the International Convention against the 
Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries (A/RES/44/34), ratified by 32 
countries, including 9 African States. 
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Shameem went on to point out that Africa was becoming both an important 
market and a supplier of personnel for the security industry. She said that this new situation 
remained largely unregulated and had impacted negatively on the enjoyment of human 
rights of many people in all regions. She stated that in order to address the legal gaps 
regarding the jurisdiction applicable to PMSCs, the Working Group recommended that a 
new international legal instrument in the form of a new convention on PMSCs be drafted 
and adopted by the United Nations. She reminded participants that the Working Group had 
sent all Member States a &#8220;Note on elements for a possible draft convention on Private 
Military and Security Companies&#8221; in early January 2010, outlining the main guiding 
principles of such a convention and encouraged all States to provide their comments. 
</p>
<p>10. Finally, Ms. Shameem said that the Working Group would benefit from hearing the 
views and national experiences with regard to the challenges posed by the use of 
mercenaries and encouraged discussion on good practices and lessons learned on 
monitoring and regulation from participants&#8217; experiences in their countries, in order to 
review the recent activities of mercenaries and PMSCs. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Challenges posed by the use of mercenaries and its impact on human 
rights, in particular the right to self-determination 
</b></p>
<p>11. The representative of Madagascar gave a comprehensive presentation on the 
situation in his country both with respect to mercenaries and PMSCs. He stated that the 
Government of Madagascar had ratified the Organization of African Unity (OAU) 
Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa but that it had yet to be 
incorporated into national legislation. He added that the fundamental laws of the country 
identified foreign intervention as a crime. He informed participants that approximately 80 
PMSCs (or so-called &#8220;associations&#8221;) were currently operating in Madagascar but that only 
10 were legally registered as PMSCs. He said that these companies were recruited to 
provide security for important commercial firms. He expressed concerns at the burgeoning 
number of these companies and at the fact that they prosper from, but may also contribute 
to, insecurity, in order to justify their role. He stressed the need for international 
cooperation to ensure security in the Indian Ocean region and the importance of sharing 
good practices on existing regulations regarding PMSCs. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-13961 
</p>
<p>12. During the discussion that followed, participants shared their experiences with 
regard to mercenary activities and also emphasized the increasing activity of PMSCs in 
Africa. A representative stressed the importance of ratifying the Organization of African 
Unity Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa (the OAU Convention) and 
wondered what the reasons were for some countries not ratifying this Convention. Another 
underlined the &#8220;moral duty&#8221; incumbent on all African States to ratify the OAU Convention. 
The representative from Equatorial Guinea recalled that his country had been the victim of 
an attempted coup by mercenaries in 2004 which had led the country to strengthen its 
national legislation. He also underlined the importance of strengthening the legislation at 
the subregional level and of promoting regional cooperation. 
</p>
<p>13. The representative of Sierra Leone recalled the mercenary activities that had 
occurred in the past in Sierra Leone and in neighbouring countries. He emphasized the 
problem of child combatants, who often found it very difficult to reintegrate into society. 
He said that recruitment of mercenaries by warring factions posed medium- to long-term 
consequences, in particular with regard to the issue of reintegration into society. He stressed 
the efforts made by Sierra Leone to reform its security sector, including through 
decentralization, towards a community-based approach to security and the setting up of 
border-control mechanisms. He pointed out that these national efforts have to be 
accompanied by increased cooperation both at the regional level by security agencies and at 
the community level, in particular in border areas. He also emphasized the importance of 
effective implementation of the regional defence pact at the level of the AU and at the 
subregional level among the Mano River Union countries (Liberia, Sierra Leone and 
Guinea). 
</p><p>14. Several participants stressed the need to develop coordination mechanisms at the 
regional level and to counteract movement of funds between nations to finance mercenary 
activities. The adoption of national legislation for the elimination of mercenary activities 
should also be viewed as a measure to protect neighbouring countries. 
</p>
<p>15. With regard to the legal framework, the Working Group reiterated its call to African 
governments to ratify the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing 
and Training of Mercenaries, which, despite its shortcomings, including the absence of an 
international mechanism to monitor implementation, continues to be a very useful 
instrument to combat mercenary activities. Participants were however reminded of the 
importance of drafting and adopting national legislation and regulations to ensure the 
applicability of the Convention. The Working Group invited participants to present the 
practical steps taken by Government to implement the Convention and to share with them 
recent laws adopted by countries on this issue. 
</p>
<p>16. Finally, the Working Group explained the rationale behind their ideas for the 
creation of a new binding international instrument to regulate the activities of PMSCs. They 
explained that the definition of mercenary was not applicable to a PMSC and its personnel. 
They highlighted the legal gap in addressing the activities of PMSCs and the need to 
promote new standards to regulate the industry. They also pointed out that in some cases 
the line between the legal activities of PMSCs and the illegal activities of mercenaries 
could be blurred. They illustrated this assertion through the example of Equatorial Guinea, 
where employees of PMSCs decided to join the coup while on leave from their company 
providing protection to a Western embassy in Iraq. </p>

<p><b> B. Regional and national legislation to prohibit the activities of 
mercenaries 
</b></p>
<p>17. This agenda item was introduced by Mr. Nikitin, a member of the Working Group, 
who emphasized the importance of regional cooperation in prohibiting mercenary activities. 
He drew attention to the role of the AU and referred to the Commonwealth of Independent 
States (CIS), which had adopted model laws on several issues, including one against 
mercenarism, which was adopted in 2005. He said that these model laws were particularly 
useful to States wishing to adopt such laws at the national level. 
</p>
<p>18. The representative of the African Union Commission gave a presentation on &#8220;the 
OAU Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa and Options for the 
Regulation of PMSCs and Services&#8221;. He said that the discussion on mercenarism and 
PMSCs was characterized by a negative connotation of the word &#8220;mercenary&#8221; following the 
involvement of mercenaries against liberation movements and in the destabilization of new 
democratically elected governments in Africa. He provided several examples of the 
involvement of mercenaries in post-colonial Africa. He stated that this negative background 
had informed African countries to adopt the OAU Convention, ratified by 30 member 
States to date. This Convention invites States to transcribe their international obligations 
into national laws. He went on to point out the leading role played by the AU in the 
international discussions that had culminated in the adoption of the International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. He 
acknowledged that the OAU Convention faced criticisms, in that it did not address the issue 
of PMSCs. He recalled that at the time when the Convention was adopted, PMSCs were not 
such an important industry as at present, but emphasized the possibility of a revision of the 
Convention to address the issue. He explained that the process had started in 2004 with the 
creation of the African Union Commission on International Law, responsible for reviewing 
all OAU and AU laws. He said that although the Commission would have to review all 
conventions it should not ignore the revision of the OAU Convention. He added that the 
revision of the OAU treaties is a State-driven initiative and therefore it is up to the States to 
call for revision of this Convention. He informed the audience that the Commission would 
hold its first meeting in May 2010. 
</p>
<p>19. Regarding the activities of PMSCs, the AU representative stated that the AU had no 
objection to the activities of legally constituted private security companies as long as their 
activities were not of a mercenary nature as defined in the OAU Convention. He went on to 
say that some States had also regulated PMSCs at the national level. He added however that 
the AU recognized the need to establish an international framework to regulate the 
activities of these private security companies. He noted that the increasing use of PMSCs is 
not peculiar to Africa but is in fact an international phenomenon and hence any options for 
the regulation of PMSCs should not only target Africa or the continent&#8217;s less robust States 
but be applicable internationally. In view of this legal vacuum, he stressed the readiness of 
the AU to play its part in the process that it is hoped will lead to a satisfactory international 
framework for the regulation of the activities of PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group thanked the representative of the AU for his substantial 
presentation and referred to the permeable borders between some countries which facilitate 
the movement of mercenaries. The Working Group stressed the importance of taking 
measures at the subregional and regional level to avoid this migration of mercenaries. 
</p>
<p>21. The representative from Equatorial Guinea recalled that mercenary activities are a 
threat to the fundamental right of peoples to self-determination. He emphasized the role 
played by regional cooperation in stopping the coup attempt against his Government by 
mercenaries in 2004, based on the recognition of the sovereignty of Governments. </p>

<p><b>8</b> GE.10-13961 
</p>
<p>22. A discussion followed during which examples of possible amendments to the OAU 
Convention were shared by participants. The need to find ways to define legal and illegal 
activities and the importance of incorporating such a distinction in the Convention were 
highlighted, together with the need for an implementation mechanism to impose sanctions 
on States in violation of their international obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Current practices related to private military and security companies 
registered, operating or recruiting in the region/national and regional 
legislation and/or other measures to regulate and monitor the activities 
of private military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p>23. Ms. Benavides de P&#233;rez, a member of the Working Group, summarized the 
discussions of the previous day and briefed participants on the ongoing work of the 
Working Group regarding PMSCs. She informed participants of the missions undertaken by 
the Working Group to date, in countries where PMSCs are headquartered such as the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America, 
where companies are operating, such as Afghanistan and in countries providing personnel, 
such as Fiji, Chile and Peru. She explained the process that had led the Working Group to 
recommend the adoption of a new international legal instrument to regulate and monitor 
PMSCs. She referred to other existing approaches, including self-regulation and 
emphasized the importance of not having two opposing approaches, with the Western group 
supporting self-regulation and the developing world favouring the legal approach. Another 
group member also pointed out that the Working Group was not working towards the goal 
of banning all PMSCs, given that many organizations such as the United Nations and 
NGOs were also using them. He underlined the need to make a clear distinction between 
the legal and illegal activities of PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>24. The representative from the Democratic Republic of the Congo gave a brief 
historical account of the activities of foreign and national PMSCs in the country since 1990. 
He said that one of the foreign companies employed up to 6,000 people for activities such 
as the protection of persons and businesses or embassies or the transport of funds and 
precious goods. He informed participants of two legislative texts regulating the 
establishment and functioning of PMSCs, adding that PMSCs are not authorized. 
Commenting on the advantages and drawbacks of using these companies, he pointed out 
that PMSCs were doing business in a context of insecurity and there was consequently a 
fear that they could be tempted to prey on the chronic instability of countries. 
</p>
<p>25. The representative of Equatorial Guinea expressed strong support for the drafting of 
an international instrument on PMSCs, indicating that he would propose a meeting at 
ministerial level to support such a convention. He stated that the responsibility to protect 
the right to life was in the hands of States and should remain so. In this connection, he 
underlined the importance of protecting the sovereignty of the State against the economic 
interests of foreign powers. He stressed the need for a subregional legal mechanism in 
addition to an international convention to reflect the various concerns and experiences. He 
finally reminded participants of the crucial importance of prevention and the need for 
regulation and monitoring mechanisms to be effective in practice. 
</p>
<p>26. The representative from Malawi presented the case of the South African PMSC 
Executive Outcomes, mentioning the risks associated with its activities and the positive 
purposes it served. He stressed the need for effective national regulation and international 
regulation to ensure public transparency. He finally stated that arms-control initiatives, such 
as the current United Kingdom guidelines on arms control and the European Union Code of 
Conduct on the arms trade, provided a basis for regulation of the activities of PMSCs. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13961 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>27. In his presentation, the representative of Mozambique stated that there had been no 
allegations of mercenary and/or PMSCs activities in the country and hence the Government 
had not developed specific legislation on such groups. He stated that there were currently 
30 PMSCs registered in Mozambique providing protection services, surveillance and access 
control to buildings and sites. A specific decree (No. 9/2007) provided for the establishment 
and operation of PMSCs, including minimum requirements for hiring staff. The decree 
states the main principles for the use of force and protection of people and establishes 
mechanisms for registration, licensing and the inspection of PMSCs. Only Mozambican 
citizens can establish PMSCs, although the participation of foreign partners in business 
partnerships is allowed. 
</p>
<p>28. The representative of Sierra Leone recalled the past experience of his country with 
PMSCs such as Executive Outcomes and Sandline and said that it had left a sense of 
mistrust among the population. Following the end of hostilities, some of the notorious ex-
combatants from Sierra Leone and Liberia had provided a readymade market for 
recruitment in the subregion. He outlined the Security Sector Reform (SSR) process his 
country had been through, which included transformation strategies, a regulatory 
mechanism and monitoring/oversight. Sierra Leone had adopted a series of measures to 
regulate PMSCs, including specific regulations and licensing regimes and signed the 
Montreux document on Private Military and Security Companies.3 He noted that some 
important challenges remained, such as high youth unemployment, including that among 
ex-combatants, the increasing number of PMSCs, inadequate institutional capacity amongst 
traditional security and justice sector institutions, line ministries and other State actors, and 
the effective implementation of regional and international defence pacts and agreements. 
He finally emphasized the need for collaboration and sustained partnership with border 
countries, regional mechanisms and international partners to ensure surveillance and 
accurate sharing of information on the activities of PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>29. Several countries provided information on existing national regulations on PMSCs 
in their countries. Several representatives indicated that only companies providing security 
services were authorized and under strict control of the State. These companies were mostly 
national, although in some countries foreign participation was possible. One representative 
mentioned the ongoing recruitment of his country&#8217;s nationals by foreign companies active 
in Iraq and Afghanistan. He added that countries where personnel are recruited should have 
the ability to regulate those companies that recruit on their territory, in particular through 
licensing and registration. He added that the national police should also have a role in 
background checks to prevent people who have been dismissed from security functions or 
have criminal records being hired by these companies. However, the representative also 
emphasized the limited capacity of the home State to do this background checking, raising 
the question of the State&#8217;s responsibility vis-&#224;-vis its nationals recruited by foreign 
companies and working abroad. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the use of force 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group indicated that it had noted a 
global trend toward the increased privatization of security. She stressed that in some 
conflict zones, PMSC contractors had exceeded the number of conventional forces and 
possessed sophisticated logistical support and weaponry. She raised the concern that the 
increasing outsourcing of military and security functions in post-conflict situations could 
jeopardize the State&#8217;s control over the legitimate use of force. She invited participants to

<p><b>10</b> GE.10-13961 
</p>
<p>explain their understanding of the State&#8217;s monopoly of the use of force and whether they 
agreed that certain functions were inherent to the State and should not be outsourced. Ms. 
Shameem raised the issue of police and military training and asked whether participants 
thought there should be a limit on the outsourcing of these training activities to PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>31. During the open discussion, States shared their ideas on which military and security 
functions their Governments would consider as inherent to the State and which could thus 
not be outsourced to private entities. In particular, several States stressed that PMSCs 
should not be involved in military activities. In the debate on police and military training, 
one representative indicated that States should be able to decide whether or not to use the 
services of PMSCs for their training activities. 
</p>
<p>32. Emphasizing the existing legal vacuum and stressing the need to ensure that the 
activities of PMSCs were systematically monitored, several representatives expressed their 
support for the Working Group&#8217;s efforts in drafting a new convention.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Draft international convention on the regulation, oversight and 
monitoring of private military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p>33. Mr. Del Prado, a member of the Working Group, presented the &#8220;Elements for a 
possible draft convention on PMSCs&#8221;, shared with all Member States for comments on 4 
January 2010. He recalled that in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 10/11 
of 26 March 2009, the Working Group had consulted with IGOs, NGOs, academic 
institutions and experts during the course of 2009. He said that on the basis of all comments 
received by States and NGOs, the Working Group would report on the progress made in 
drawing up the draft convention to the fifteenth session of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>34. He referred to the impact of PMSCs on the enjoyment of human rights and to the 
States&#8217; responsibilities to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. He went on to discuss the 
existing gaps in international, and often national, legislations on PMSCs which also lead to 
accountability gaps. He pointed out that the Convention would help close the existing legal 
gap regarding PMSCs by reaffirming and strengthening the responsibilities of States 
regarding the activities of PMSCs as related to human rights protection, establishing an 
independent oversight body and providing an avenue of redress for victims. 
</p>
<p>35. Mr. Nikitin contributed to the presentation by highlighting the principles on which 
the draft convention is based, including the need for registration and licensing systems at 
both national and international levels. He stressed the importance for &#8220;countries of 
operation&#8221; of the ability to monitor the activities of PMSCs on their territory, the training of 
PMSC personnel and the acquisition of weapons. 
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group invited participants to brief their respective Governments and 
encourage them to submit their input on the Note on the elements for a possible convention. 
They stated that countries where PMSCs were headquartered were not in favour of a legally 
binding approach and therefore the support of all other countries was crucial. 
</p>
<p>37. Several delegates noted the importance of national legislation but recognized the 
added value of an international framework to address this global problem. Others 
emphasized the need to address the responsibility of countries of origin of PMSCs 
contracted to operate abroad. Participants welcomed the work done by the Working Group 
on a possible draft convention. </p>

<p><b> III. Conclusions and observations of the Working Group 
</b>38. <b>The Working Group thanks all countries which responded positively to the 
invitation of the Working Group to hold this important consultation. It noted the 
negative impact of mercenary activities in the past and the growing presence of PMSC 
activities on the African continent. 
</b></p>
<p>39. <b>The Working Group notes that several representatives emphasized the 
importance of subregional and regional cooperation to combat mercenary activities 
and encourages African countries to ratify the OAU Convention on the elimination of 
mercenaries in Africa and the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, 
Financing and Training of Mercenaries. 
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>The Working Group notes that the African Union will engage in a process of 
revision of all existing OAU conventions and encourages the Commission and African 
States to discuss the possibility of regulating PMSCs at the regional level during this 
process. 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>The Working Group notes that States are particularly concerned about the 
activities of foreign PMSCs operating in countries in the absence of clear oversight 
and monitoring mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>The Working Group recognizes a consensus amongst participants regarding 
the existing legal gap at the international level vis-&#224;-vis the activities of PMSCs and 
welcomes the high level of support for its ongoing efforts to draft an international 
instrument for the regulation of PMSCs. 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>The Working Group encourages States to review the functions which are 
inherent to the sovereignty of States and should remain within the purview of States 
and should not be outsourced to PMSCs. 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>The Working Group recalls States&#8217; responsibility to respect and protect human 
rights and to ensure that PMSCs are held accountable if and when they are 
responsible for crimes or human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>The Working Group believes that an effective system for the licensing and 
registering of private military and security companies and the training of its 
employees should be developed. 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>The Working Group will conclude its series of regional consultations with the 
Western European and Others Group consultation in Geneva on 14 April 2010.  
</b></p>
<p>47.<b> The Working Group notes that this process of regional consultation may lead to 
a high-level round table of States under the auspices of the United Nations to discuss 
the fundamental question of the role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the use 
of force, with the objective of facilitating a critical understanding of the 
responsibilities of the various actors, including private military and security 
companies, in the current context, and their respective obligations for the protection 
and promotion of human rights and in reaching a common understanding as to which 
additional regulations and controls are needed at the international level as stated in 
Human Rights Council resolution A/HRC/RES/7/21. </b></p>
