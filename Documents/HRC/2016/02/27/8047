<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present note provides information on the status of the Special Fund established 
by the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report was prepared in accordance with the arrangements approved by 
the General Assembly in its resolution 66/150, by which it encouraged contributions to the 
Special Fund established by the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Optional Protocol), and 
requested the Secretary-General to submit a report to the Human Rights Council on the 
operations of the Special Fund. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate of the Special Fund 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Special Fund was established pursuant to article 26 of the Optional Protocol, to 
help finance the implementation of the recommendations made by the Subcommittee on 
Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
following a visit to a State party to the Optional Protocol, as well as education programmes 
of national preventive mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Fund receives voluntary contributions from Governments, 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and other private or public entities. 
An overview of contributions to the Special Fund to date is provided under section II of the 
present note.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Management of the Special Fund  
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Fund is administered by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in accordance with the Financial Regulations 
and Rules of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>5.  As an interim scheme, it was decided that the OHCHR Grants Committee, the 
advisory body to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, would advise 
the High Commissioner on the eligibility of projects and awards of grants based on the 
evaluation criteria set out in the guidelines for applications for the project cycles 2012 and 
</p><p>2013. This interim scheme will be reviewed in 2013. In this regard, note is taken of the 
readiness of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of 
Torture to assist the work of the Special Fund, if so requested. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Project cycle 2012  
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Fund became operational in July 2011, and the first call for applications 
was launched on 1 November 2011. The first grants were awarded during 2012. Under the 
call for applications for the period 2011-2012, 69 applications were received, out of which 
25 were deemed admissible (those submitted within the deadline and in which the 
geographic eligibility criteria were met1). In accordance with the guidelines for applications 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Projects aiming at the implementation of recommendations made by the Subcommittee after a visit to 
</p>
<p>a State party, provided those recommendations are contained in a report that has become public by the 
request of the State party. </p>


<p>for the period 2011-2012, the secretariat for the Special Fund conducted an extensive 
evaluation of those 25 projects, taking into consideration the outcome of informal 
consultations with members of the Subcommittee, in February 2012. The evaluation 
process has been done in close collaboration with OHCHR field presences, and field visits 
to eligible applicants have been conducted by OHCHR or United Nations Development 
Programme staff. 
</p>
<p>7.  In the evaluation of projects, priority consideration was given to projects submitted 
by States parties and national preventive mechanisms. In those cases in which a project was 
submitted by a non-governmental organization, particular attention was paid to the 
implementation of the project in collaboration and partnership with States parties and 
national preventive mechanisms. In some cases, applicants were encouraged to implement 
the projects with the national preventive mechanism.  
</p>
<p>8.  Nine projects encompassing a wide range of activities, in accordance with the 
Subcommittee recommendations, that address the prevention of torture in Benin, Honduras, 
Maldives, Mexico and Paraguay, were approved and grants awarded. The total amount of 
grants awarded was $166,977. Please refer to the annex for further information on the 
approved projects.  
</p>
<p>9.  The remaining 16 projects were rejected by the Grants Committee for not meeting 
the thematic selection criteria established by the guidelines for applications for the period 
2011-2012.  
</p>
<p><b> E.  Call for applications 2013  
</b></p>
<p>10. A new call for applications to the Special Fund was published on 15 August 2012 
and closed on 15 October 2012. For this call, thematic priorities per country were identified 
by the Subcommittee during its seventeenth session, held in Geneva from 18 to 22 June 
</p><p>2012. In addition, projects addressing any other specific recommendation in the visit 
reports that detailed a pressing and compelling need could be considered.   
</p>
<p>11. Under this call, eligible projects were to be aimed at implementing 
recommendations made by the Subcommittee after a visit to a State party, provided those 
recommendations were contained in a report that had become public by the request of the 
State party. Therefore, the countries able to respond to this call were: Benin, Brazil, 
Honduras, Maldives, Mexico, Paraguay and Sweden<b>. 
</b></p>
<p>12. As in the previous cycle, applications could be submitted by States parties and 
national preventive mechanisms. In addition, applications could be submitted by national 
human rights institutions, if compliant with the principles relating to the status of national 
institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles), and non-
governmental organizations, if the proposed projects were to be implemented in 
cooperation with States parties and/or national preventive mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>13. Applicants could request grants of up to $50,000 for project activities to be 
implemented between 1 January and 31 December 2013. OHCHR, as fund manager, 
reserves the right to earmark part of a grant to specific budget lines.   
</p>
<p>14. A total of 34 applications were received, out of which 4 were considered 
inadmissible under the geographic eligibility criteria (that is, projects aiming at the 
implementation of recommendations made by the Subcommittee following a visit to a State 
party, provided those recommendations are contained in a report that has become public by 
the request of the State party). The 30 applications deemed admissible (those submitted 
within the deadline and in which the geographic eligibility criteria were met) concern six of </p>


<p>the seven countries that had agreed on the publication of the Subcommittee report following 
the country visit: Benin, Brazil, Honduras, Maldives, Mexico and Paraguay.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Financial situation of the Special Fund 
</b></p>
<p>15. At the time of writing, the following contributions to the Special Fund had been 
received: $29,704.98 from the Czech Republic, $5,000 from the Maldives, $82,266.30 from
