NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND GOING CONCERN
Silver Bull Resources, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 8,
1993 as the Cadgie Company for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties. The
Cadgie Company was a spin-off from its predecessor, Precious Metal Mines, Inc. On June 28, 1996,
the Company's name was changed to Metalline Mining Company. On April 21, 2011, the Company's
name was changed to Silver Bull Resources, Inc. The Company's fiscal year-end is October 31. The
Company has not realized any revenues from its planned operations and is considered an exploration
stage company. The Company has not established any reserves with respect to its exploration projects
and may never enter into the development stage with respect to any of its projects.
The Company engages in the business of mineral exploration. The Company currently owns or has
the option to acquire a number of property concessions in Mexico (collectively known as the "Sierra
Mojada Property"). The Company conducts its operations in Mexico through its wholly-owned
subsidiary corporations, Minera Metalin S.A. de C.V. ("Minera") and Contratistas de Sierra Mojada S.A.
de C.V. ("Contratistas") and through Minera's wholly-owned subsidiary Minas de Coahuila SBR S.A.
de C.V. ("Minas").
On April 16, 2010, Metalline Mining Delaware, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was
merged with and into Dome Ventures Corporation ("Dome").  As a result, Dome became a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company. Dome has a wholly-owned subsidiary Dome Asia Inc. ("Dome
Asia"), which is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Dome Asia has a wholly-owned subsidiary
incorporated in Gabon, African Resources SARL Gabon ("African Resources"), as well as a 99.99%-
owned subsidiary, Dome Minerals Nigeria Limited, incorporated in Nigeria. In January 2015, the
Company completed the sale of its subsidiary Dome International Global Inc. ("Dome International"),
including Dome International's wholly-owned subsidiary Dome Ventures SARL Gabon ("Dome
Gabon"), which held the Ndjole prospect in Gabon.
The Company's efforts and expenditures have been concentrated on the exploration of properties,
principally in the Sierra Mojada Property located in Coahuila, Mexico. The Company has not
determined whether its exploration properties contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable.
The ultimate realization of the Company's investment in exploration properties is dependent upon the
success of future property sales, the existence of economically recoverable reserves, and the ability of
the Company to obtain financing or make other arrangements for exploration, development, and future
profitable production activities. The ultimate realization of the Company's investment in exploration
properties cannot be determined at this time.
Going Concern
Since its inception in November 1993, the Company has not generated revenue and has incurred a
deficit of $119,903,662.  Accordingly, the Company has not generated cash flow from operations, and
since inception the Company has relied primarily upon proceeds from private placements and
registered direct offerings of the Company's equity securities and warrant exercises as the primary
sources of financing to fund the Company's operations. As of July 31, 2016, the Company had working
capital of $1,244,090 and cash and cash equivalents of $1,511,172. The Company's continuation as a
going concern is dependent upon several possible financing and strategic options not limited to the
following: obtaining adequate equity financing, joint venture opportunities on the Sierra Mojada
Property, and asset divestitures. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful
in pursuing these financing and strategic options. Accordingly, even after taking into account the
proceeds from the Company's recent private placements, there is substantial doubt as to whether the
Company's existing cash resources and working capital are sufficient to enable the Company to
continue its operations for the next 12 months as a going concern.
These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis and do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and
liabilities that may be necessary in the event the Company can no longer continue as a going concern.

NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP")
and applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding interim
reporting. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated during consolidation.
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The
condensed consolidated balance sheet at October 31, 2015 was derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements. Accordingly, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2015.
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same
basis as the audited consolidated financial statements, except as disclosed in Note 3. In the opinion of
management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements furnished herein
include all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of
the results for the interim periods presented. Uncertainties with respect to estimates and assumptions
are inherent in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements;
accordingly, operating results for the nine months ended July 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2016.
NOTE 3 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies are defined in the Company's consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October
31, 2015 filed on January 19, 2016, except as follows.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in the Nine-Month Period Ended July 31, 2016
Effective November 1, 2015, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-08, "Presentation of Financial Statements
(Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and
Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity." Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals
representing a strategic shift in operations are presented as discontinued operations. In addition, ASU
2014-08 requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide additional
information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. ASU 2014-
08 also requires disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an
organization that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The adoption of this update did
not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and
disclosures.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting," which amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transaction,
including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows. These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal
year beginning November 1, 2017. The Company has not determined the effects of this update on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases," which will require lessees to recognize
assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on the balance sheet. These
changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning November 1, 2019. Modified
retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, is
required with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company has not determined the effects of
this update on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at
this time.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments – Overall: Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," which (i) requires equity investments
(except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation
of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii)
requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial
instruments for disclosure purposes, (iii) requires separate presentation of financial assets and
financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and (iv) eliminates the
requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to
estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized
cost. These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning November 1, 2018.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,"
which requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities
as noncurrent. These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning November 1,
2017. Early application is permitted.  The Company has not determined the effects of this update on
the Company's financial position, and disclosures at this time.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-
Period Adjustments," which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the
financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business
combination is consummated. These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year
beginning November 1, 2016. The Company has not determined the effects of this update on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Deferral of the Effective Date," which defers the
effective date of ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" to become effective for the
Company's fiscal year beginning November 1, 2018. The Company has not determined the effects of
this update on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at
this time.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory," which
provides a revised, simpler measurement for inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net
realizable value. These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning November
1, 2017. The Company has not determined the effects of this update on the Company's financial
position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,"
which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented as a
reduction to the carrying amount of that debt liability, not as an asset. These changes become effective
prospectively for the Company's fiscal year beginning November 1, 2016. The Company has not
determined the effects of this update on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash
flows and disclosures at this time.
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis," which amends the consolidation requirements in Accounting Standards
Codification 810. These changes become effective prospectively for the Company's fiscal year
beginning November 1, 2016. The Company has not determined the effects of this update on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements—Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability To Continue as a
Going Concern." ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether
there is substantial doubt about an organization's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide
related footnote disclosures. The update provides guidance to an organization's management, with
principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures
that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The
amendments are effective for the Company's fiscal year and interim periods within those years
beginning after November 1, 2017. Early application is permitted. The Company has not determined
the effects of this update on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and
disclosures at this time.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task
Force) and the SEC did not or are not believed to have a material impact on the Company's present or
future consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 4 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On January 23, 2015, the Company closed the sale to BHK Mining Corp. (formerly BHK Resources,
Inc.) of 100% of the issued and outstanding securities of the Company's former subsidiary, Dome
International, which holds, indirectly, a 100% interest in the Ndjole concession. Under the terms of the
share purchase agreement, the Company received cash consideration of $1,500,000 and
reimbursement of the Company's expenses of $75,000 in cash. In addition, the Company incurred
transaction costs of $213,299. As a result of this transaction, the Company realized a gain on the sale
of assets of discontinued operations of $284,224, net of income taxes.

NOTE 5 – LOSS PER SHARE
The Company had stock options and warrants outstanding at July 31, 2016 and 2015 that upon
exercise were issuable into 27,320,568 and 9,807,858 shares of the Company's common stock,
respectively. They were not included in the calculation of loss per share because they would have
been anti-dilutive.
NOTE 6 – VALUE-ADDED TAX RECEIVABLE
Value-added tax ("VAT") receivable relates to VAT paid in Mexico and Gabon. The Company
estimates net VAT of $110,550 will be received within 12 months of the balance sheet date. The
allowance for uncollectible VAT taxes was estimated by management based upon a number of factors,
including the length of time the tax returns have been outstanding, responses received from tax
authorities, general economic conditions in Mexico and Gabon and estimated net recovery after
commissions. During the nine months ended July 31, 2016, an additional provision for uncollectible
VAT of $1,292 has been recorded.
A summary of the changes in the allowance for uncollectible VAT taxes for the nine months ended July
31, 2016 is as follows:

sold within one year and management has an active program to locate buyers for these assets.
As at July 31, 2016, the assets held for sale had a net book value of $28,794. An impairment of $7,554
was recorded on assets held for sale during the nine months ended July 31, 2016. During the nine
months ended July 31, 2016, the Company recorded a gain on sale of office and mining equipment of
$132,912, which is included in miscellaneous income in the condensed consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive loss.

During the nine months ended July 31, 2016, the Company decided to reduce the Company's
concession holdings in Sierra Mojada, Mexico. As a result, the Company has written off the capitalized
property concession balance related to these concessions of $588,877.
NOTE 10 – GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess, at the date of acquisition, of the purchase price of the business
acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. On July 31, 2016, the
Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not
that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Based on this assessment,
management determined it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment tests at April 30th of each
fiscal year.
The following is a summary of the Company's goodwill balance as at July 31, 2016 and October 31,
2015, respectively:
Goodwill – October 31, 2015 $2,058,031 
 $2,058,031 
Goodwill – July 31, 2016

NOTE 11 – SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
On June 11, 2007, the board of directors adopted a shareholders' right plan through the adoption of a
Rights Agreement, which became effective immediately.  In connection with the adoption of the Rights
Agreement, the board of directors declared a distribution of one share of common stock purchase right
(a "Right") for each outstanding share of the Company's common stock, payable to shareholders of
record at the close of business on June 22, 2007.  In accordance with the Rights Agreement, one Right
is attached to each share of Company common stock issued since that date.  Each Right is attached to
the underlying common stock and will remain with the common stock if the stock is sold or transferred. 
As of July 31, 2016, there are 174,774,967 shares outstanding with Rights attached.
In certain circumstances, in the event that any person acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or more of
the outstanding stock of the Company's common stock, each holder of a Right, other than the acquirer,
would be entitled to receive, upon payment of the purchase price, which is initially set at $20 per Right,
a number of shares of the Company's common stock having a value equal to two times such purchase
price.  The Rights will expire on June 11, 2017.
NOTE 12 – COMMON STOCK
On May 19, 2016, June 3, 2016 and June 29, 2016, the Company completed a three tranche private
placement for an aggregate of 11,362,310 units at a purchase price of $CDN 0.13 per unit (the "$CDN
0.13 Unit") for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,137,643 ($CDN 1,477,100). Each $CDN 0.13 Unit
consists of one share of the Company's common stock and one warrant (the "$CDN 0.13 Warrant"). 
Each $CDN 0.13 Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one share of common stock at a price of
$CDN 0.16 for the period of 12 months from the closing of the tranche of the private placement. If the
closing price of the common stock of the Company on the OTCQB Venture Marketplace is $0.18 or
higher for five consecutive trading days, then the $CDN 0.13 Warrant will expire 30 trading days from
such fifth consecutive day. The Company paid an 8% finder's fee totaling $19,644 to certain agents
with respect to certain purchasers who were introduced by these agents. The Company incurred other
costs of $36,843 related to this private placement.
On July 20, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of an aggregate of 4,340,000 units at a
purchase price of $CDN 0.15 per unit (the "$CDN 0.15 Unit") for aggregate gross proceeds of
$504,729 ($CDN 651,000). Each $CDN 0.15 Unit consists of one share of the Company's common
stock and one warrant (the "$CDN 0.15 Warrant").  Each $CDN 0.15 Warrant entitles the holder thereof
to acquire one share of common stock at a price of $CDN 0.16 for the period of 36 months from the
closing of the private placement. If, commencing on the date that is four months after the closing of the
private placement, the closing price of the common stock on the TSX is higher than $CDN 0.30 for 20
consecutive trading days, then on the 20th consecutive trading day (the "Acceleration Trigger Date")
the expiry date of the $CDN 0.15 Warrants may be accelerated to the 20th trading day after the
Acceleration Trigger Date by the issuance, within three trading days of the Acceleration Trigger Date,
of a news release announcing such acceleration. The Company paid a 6% finder's fee totaling
$23,326 to a placement agent with respect to certain purchasers who were introduced by this agent. In
addition, the placement agent received 200,400 non-transferable warrants (the "Placement Agent's
Warrants"). Each Placement Agent's Warrant entitles the placement agent to acquire one share of
common stock until the date that is two years following closing of the private placement at $CDN 0.205
and is subject to the acceleration provision noted above. The fair value of the Placement Agent's
Warrants was determined to be $11,621 (Note 14), and the Company incurred other offering costs of
$28,146.
No common stock was issued during the nine months ended July 31, 2015.
12
NOTE 13 – STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has two active stock option plans. Under the 2006 Stock Option Plan (the "2006 Plan"),
the Company may grant non-statutory and incentive options to employees, directors and consultants
for up to a total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock. Under the 2010 Stock Option and Stock Bonus
Plan (the "2010 Plan"), the lesser of (i) 30,000,000 shares or (ii) 10% of the total shares outstanding
are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options or the grant of stock bonuses.
Options are typically granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company's
stock at the date of grant, have a graded vesting schedule over approximately one to two years and
have a contractual term of two to 10 years.

NOTE 15 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair Value Measurements
All financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded at fair value on initial recognition. Transaction
costs are expensed when they are incurred, unless they are directly attributable to the acquisition of
financial assets or the assumption of liabilities carried at amortized cost, in which case the transaction
costs adjust the carrying amount.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for
identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level 2
Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and
Level 3
Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value
measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
Under fair value accounting, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  As of July 31, 2016 and October 31,
2015, the Company had no financial assets or liabilities required to be reported for fair value purposes.
The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents,
other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and expenses approximate fair value at
July 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015 due to the short maturities of these financial instruments.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the
Company by failing to discharge its obligations. To mitigate exposure to credit risk on financial assets
the Company has established policies to ensure liquidity of funds and ensure that counterparties
demonstrate minimum acceptable creditworthiness.
The Company maintains its U.S. dollar and $CDN cash and cash equivalents in bank and demand
deposit accounts with major financial institutions with high credit standings.  Cash deposits held in the
United States are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") for up to $250,000
and $CDN cash deposits held in Canada are insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation
("CDIC") for up to $CDN 100,000. Certain United States and Canadian bank accounts held by the
Company exceed these federally insured limits or are uninsured as they related to U.S. dollar deposits
held in Canadian financial institutions. As of July 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, the Company's cash
and cash equivalent balances held in United States and Canadian financial institutions included
$1,430,623 and $854,979 respectively, which was not insured by the FDIC or CDIC. The Company
has not experienced any losses on such accounts and management believes that using major
financial institutions with high credit ratings mitigates the credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.
The Company also maintains cash in bank accounts in Mexico and Gabon.  These accounts are
denominated in the local currency and are considered uninsured. As of July 31, 2016 and October 31,
2015, the U.S. dollar equivalent balance for these accounts was $3,816 and $19,393, respectively.
 
 
15
Interest Rate Risk
The Company holds substantially all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents in bank and
demand deposit accounts with major financial institutions. The interest rates received on these
balances may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions. Based on the average cash and cash
equivalent balances during the nine months ended July 31, 2016, a 1% decrease in interest rates
would have resulted in a reduction of approximately $317 in interest income for the period.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
 
Certain purchases of labor, operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in $CDN, Mexican
Pesos ("$MXN"), Central African Francs ("$CFA") or other currencies.  As a result, currency exchange
fluctuations may impact the costs of the Company's operations.  Specifically, the appreciation of the
$MXN, $CDN or $CFA against the U.S. dollar may result in an increase in operating expenses and
capital costs in U.S. dollar terms. As of July 31, 2016, the Company maintained the majority of its cash
balance in U.S. dollars. The Company currently does not engage in any currency hedging activities.
NOTE 16 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
The Company's activities are subject to laws and regulations controlling not only the exploration and
mining of mineral properties, but also the effect of such activities on the environment. Compliance with
such laws and regulations may necessitate additional capital outlays or affect the economics of a
project, and cause changes or delays in the Company's activities.
Property Concessions in Mexico
To properly maintain property concessions in Mexico, the Company is required to pay a semi-annual
fee to the Mexican government and complete annual assessment work.
Royalty
The Company has agreed to pay a 2% net smelter return royalty on certain property concessions
within the Sierra Mojada Property based on revenues generated from production. Total payments
under this royalty are limited to $6.875 million (the "Royalty").
Office Lease Commitment
The Company entered into a six-month office sub-lease agreement from July 1, 2016 to December 31,
2016 for the Company's corporate office in Vancouver, Canada. The monthly lease payment is $CDN
4,300. The lease payments remaining during fiscal 2016 and during fiscal 2017 are $CDN 12,900 and
$CDN 8,600. As of July 31, 2016, one U.S. dollar approximates $CDN 1.31.
Litigation and Claims
On May 20, 2014, a local cooperative named Sociedad Cooperativa de Exploración Minera Mineros
Norteños, S.C.L. ("Mineros Norteños") filed an action in the Local First Civil Court in the District of
Morelos, State of Chihuahua, Mexico, against the Company's subsidiary, Minera, claiming that Minera
breached an agreement regarding the development of the Sierra Mojada project.  On January 19,
2015, the case was moved to the Second District Court (of federal jurisdiction). Mineros Norteños is
seeking payment of the Royalty, including interest at a rate of 6% per annum since August 30, 2004,
notwithstanding that no revenue has been produced from the applicable mining concessions, and it is
also seeking payment of wages to the cooperative's members since August 30, 2004, notwithstanding
that none of the individuals were ever hired or performed work for Minera under this agreement and
Minera never committed to hiring them. The Company and the Company's Mexican legal counsel
believe that this claim is without merit and have asserted all applicable defenses. All necessary
testimony and evidence has been produced before the court and the Company expects to receive the
judgment of the court prior to the end of the first quarter of 2017. The Company has not accrued any
amounts in its unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements with respect to this
claim.

On February 15, 2016, Messrs. Jaime Valdez Farias and Maria Asuncion Perez Alonso (collectively,
"Valdez") filed an action before the Local First Civil Court of Torreon, State of Coahuila, Mexico,
against the Company's subsidiary, Minera, claiming that Minera had breached an agreement regarding
the development of the Sierra Mojada project.  Valdez seeks payment in the amount of $5.9 million for
the alleged breach of the agreement.  On April 28, 2016, Minera filed its response to the complaint,
asserting various defenses, including that Minera  terminated the agreement before the payment
obligations arose and that certain conditions precedent to such payment obligations were never
satisfied by Valdez.  The lawsuit is currently in the phase of evidence submission by the parties. The
Company and the Company's Mexican legal have asserted all applicable defenses.  The Company
has not accrued any amounts in its unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
with respect to this claim.
From time to time, the Company is involved in other disputes, claims, proceedings and legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company intends to vigorously defend all claims
against the Company, and pursue its full legal rights in cases where the Company has been harmed.
Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted due to the inherent
uncertainty of litigation, in the opinion of management, based upon current information, no other
currently pending or overtly threatened proceeding is expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.

The Company has significant assets in Coahuila, Mexico.  Although Mexico is generally considered
economically stable, it is always possible that unanticipated events in Mexico could disrupt the
Company's operations.  Neither the Mexican government nor the Gabonese government requires
foreign entities to maintain cash reserves in its respective country.

Cautionary Note Regarding Exploration Stage Companies
We are an exploration stage company and do not currently have any known reserves and cannot be
expected to have reserves unless and until a feasibility study is completed for the Sierra Mojada
concessions that shows proven and probable reserves. There can be no assurance that our
concessions contain proven and probable reserves and investors may lose their entire investment.
See "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015.
Business Overview
Silver Bull, incorporated in Nevada, is an exploration stage company, engaged in the business of
mineral exploration. Our primary objective is to define sufficient mineral reserves on the Sierra Mojada
Property to justify the development of a mechanized mining operation. We conduct our operations in
Mexico through our wholly-owned Mexican subsidiaries, Minera Metalin S.A. de C.V. ("Minera") and
Contratistas de Sierra Mojada S.A. de C.V. ("Contratistas"), and through Minera's wholly-owned
subsidiary, Minas de Coahuila SBR S.A. de C.V. ("Minas"). However, as noted above, we have not
established any reserves at the Sierra Mojada Property are in the exploration stage and may never
enter the development or production stage.
Our principal offices are located at 777 Dunsmuir Street, Suite 1610, Vancouver, BC, Canada V7Y
1K4, and our telephone number is 604-687-5800.
Current Developments
2016 Private Placements
In May, June and July 2016, we raised net proceeds of approximately $1,534,000 in two private
placements of units consisting of one share of common stock and one common stock purchase warrant
as described in the "Material Changes in Financial Condition; Liquidity and Capital Resources"
section.
Properties Concessions and Property Concessions Outlook
Sierra Mojada Property
Our board of directors approved a calendar year 2016 budget of $0.4 million for the Sierra Mojada
Property. As a result of completion of the private placements and improvement of market conditions,
our board approved an updated budget for the Sierra Mojada Property in September 2016. Our
updated exploration budget for the Sierra Mojada Property for the period from September 2016 to
December 2016 is $0.6 million compared to $0.1 million in the original budget. The updated
exploration budget is focused on the drilling program described below, securing additional surface
rights, maintaining our property concessions and continuing to internally investigate the potential for a
high grade underground zinc oxide mine and a small silver open-pit targeting the "at-surface" silver
mineralization with a small project with a low strip ratio.
 
 
21
Mineralized Material Estimate
On June 30, 2015, Tuun Consulting Inc. and AKF Mining Services Inc. delivered an amended
technical report (the "Report") on the silver and zinc mineralization at the Sierra Mojada project in
accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101. The Report includes an update on the silver
and zinc mineralization that was estimated from 1,363 diamond drill holes, 24 reverse circulation drill
holes, 9,027 channel samples and 2,346 underground long holes. Using a net smelter return economic
cut-off, the Report indicates mineralized material in the Lerchs-Grossman optimized pit of 56.8 million
tonnes at an average silver grade of 50 grams/tonne silver, an average zinc percentage of 3.4%, an
average copper percentage of 0.04% and an average lead percentage of 0.3%. In addition using the
net smelter return economic cut-off, the Report indicates underground mineralized material outside the
Lerchs-Grossman optimized pit of 1.9 million tonnes at an average zinc percentage of 9.4%, an
average copper percentage of 0.02% and an average lead percentage of 0.4%. Mineralized material
estimates do not include any amounts categorized as inferred resources.
"Mineralized material" as used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, although permissible under the
Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC's") Industry Guide 7, does not indicate "reserves" by
SEC standards.  We cannot be certain that any part of the Sierra Mojada project will ever be confirmed
or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7-compliant "reserves."  Investors are cautioned not to assume
that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that
mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.
Drilling
A 3,000 meter drill program had been planned with approximately seven holes targeting sulfide
mineralization which we believe represent the extension of our mineralized zone at depth. We recently
completed a high resolution magnetic survey over the target areas, and are working to identify the best
drill locations incorporating this data. Drilling is expected to commence in October, depending on when
and if the applicable permits are received.
Metallurgical Studies
During May 2015, we selected and shipped samples of high grade zinc material to a lab in Denver,
Colorado for "fine bubble" flotation test work and to a group in Australia to assess their proprietary
hydrometallurgy process. Previous test work completed by Silver Bull using mechanical flotation has
shown an 87% recovery of zinc from the white zinc zone to produce a rough concentrate of 43% zinc,
and a 72.5% recovery of zinc from the red zinc zone to produce a rough concentrate of 30% zinc. The
"fine bubble" flotation test work that was performed did not improve recovery, but based on analysis of
the results, it was determined that the "fine bubble" flotation test process may be able to be adjusted to
improve recovery. Further testing is not planned at this time.
Test work completed by Hazen Research Inc. in 2012 focused on roasting high grade zinc in a rotary
kiln to fume off the zinc and collect it as a zinc oxide concentrate. Recoveries of up to 98% of the zinc
were recorded. The roasting of the zinc samples aims to simulate a "Waelz Kiln," a kiln that is used
extensively to recycle zinc from steel dust and which regularly achieves recoveries in excess of 90%.
In considering this process, the zinc mineralization at Sierra Mojada has a number of possible
advantages, including the fact that it lies in the state of Coahuila, which is the largest coal producing
state in Mexico, and it has an existing gas pipeline nearby that may be able to be extended to the
project. Either option could provide the fuel to run the kiln. The project also has a functioning railway
right to site to potentially allow for transport of coal to the site and of the zinc concentrate from the site.
Due to market conditions, no further test work on kilning is currently planned.
In addition, we previously conducted a metallurgical program to test the recovery of the silver
mineralization using the agitation cyanide leach method and recovery of the zinc mineralization using
the SART process (sulfidization, acidification, recycling, and thickening). The test work on the silver
zone focused on cyanide leach recovery of the silver using "Bottle Roll" tests to simulate an agitation
leach system and to determine the recovery of low-grade zinc that occurs in the silver zone and high-
grade zinc from the zinc zone that had been blended with mineralization from the silver zone to the
leach solution. The silver was recovered from the cyanide leach solution using the Merrill Crowe
technique, and the zinc was recovered from the leach solution using the SART process. The SART
process is a metallurgical process that regenerates and recycles the cyanide used in the leaching
process of the silver and zinc and allows for the recovery of zinc that has been leached by the cyanide
solution. The results showed an overall average silver recovery of 73.2% with peak values of 89.0%
and an overall average zinc recovery of 44% in the silver zone.
 
 
22
Gabon Property
On January 23, 2015, we closed the sale of 100% of the issued and outstanding securities of the
Company's former subsidiary Dome International Global Inc. ("Dome International") (the "Gabon
Sale"), including Dome International's wholly-owned subsidiary Dome Ventures SARL Gabon ("Dome
Gabon"), which held a 100% interest in the Ndjole concession to BHK Mining Corp. (formerly BHK
Resources, Inc.). Under the terms of the share purchase agreement, we received cash consideration of
$1,500,000 and reimbursement of certain expenses of $75,000 in cash.
 
Results of Operations
Three Months Ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015
For the three months ended July 31, 2016, we experienced a net loss of $1,078,000, or approximately
$0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $635,000, or approximately $nil per share, during the
comparable period last year. The $443,000 increase in net loss was primarily due to a $492,000
increase in exploration and property holding costs, which was partially offset by a $49,000 decrease in
general and administrative expenses compared to the comparable period last year as described
below.
Exploration and Property Holding Costs
Exploration and property holding costs increased $492,000 to $746,000 for the three months ended
July 31, 2016, compared to $254,000 for the comparable period last year. This increase was mainly
due to a $589,000 concession impairment as we decided to reduce our concession holdings in Sierra
Mojada, Mexico, which was partially offset by a decrease in exploration and property holdings costs as
a result of reduced employees, reduced property concessions' taxes as we decided to reduce our
concessions' holdings and the decrease in the value of the Mexico Peso ("$MXN") compared to the
U.S. dollar in the three months ended July 31, 2016.
General and Administrative Costs
We recorded general and administrative expenses of $313,000 for the three months ended July 31,
2016 as compared to $362,000 for the comparable period last year. The $49,000 decrease was mainly
the result of a $12,000 decrease in personnel cost, a $57,000 decrease in professional costs, a
$15,000 decrease in directors' fees and a $2,000 decrease in provision for uncollectible value added
taxes, which was partially offset by a $37,000 increase in office and administrative expenses.
Personnel costs decreased $12,000 to $114,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2016 as
compared to $126,000 for the same period last year. This decrease was mainly due to reduced
salaries for certain employees, the decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar ("$CDN") compared to
the U.S. dollar and the decrease in stock-based compensation expense to $13,000 in the three months
ended July, 31, 2016 from $19,000 in the comparable period last year as a result of stock options
vesting in the three months ended July 31, 2016 having a lower fair value than stock options vesting in
the comparable period last year.
Office and administrative expenses increased $36,000 to $139,000 for the three months ended July 31,
2016 compared to $103,000 for the comparable period last year. This increase is mainly due to
increased investor relations activities related to the 2016 private placements which was partially offset
by a decrease in the value of $CDN compared to the U.S. dollar in the three months ended July 31,
2016.
Professional fees decreased $57,000 to $25,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2016 compared
to $82,000 for the comparable period last year. This decrease is mainly due to a decrease in
accounting and legal fees.
 
 
23
Directors' fees decreased $15,000 to $33,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2016 as compared
to $48,000 for the comparable period last year. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the
number of directors and a $7,000 decrease in stock-based compensation as a result of stock options
vesting in the three months ended July 31, 2016 having a lower fair value than stock options vesting in
the comparable period last year.
We recorded a provision of $1,000 for uncollectible value-added taxes ("VAT") for the three months
ended July 31, 2016 as compared to $3,000 in the comparable period last year. The allowance for
uncollectible taxes was estimated by management based upon a number of factors, including the
length of time the returns have been outstanding, responses received from tax authorities, general
economic conditions in Mexico and Gabon and estimated net recovery after commissions.
Other Income (Expenses)
We recorded other expense of $19,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2016, which was similar to
$16,000 for the comparable period last year.
Nine Months Ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015
For the nine months ended July 31, 2016, we experienced a net loss of $1,857,000, or approximately
$0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $1,891,000, or approximately $0.01 per share, during the
comparable period last year. The $34,000 increase in the net loss was primarily due to a $263,000
decrease in general and administrative expenses and $100,000 in other income in the nine months
ended July 31, 2016 compared to $102,000 in other expenses in the comparable period last year. This
was partially offset by a $311,000 increase in the exploration and property holding costs and $125,000
in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (including a gain on sale of assets of
discontinued operations of $284,000, net of income taxes)  in the comparable period last year as
described below.
Exploration and Property Holding Costs
Exploration and property holding costs increased $311,000 to $1,008,000 for the nine months ended
July 31, 2016 compared to $697,000 for the comparable period last year. This increase was mainly
due to a $589,000 property concession impairment as we decided to reduce our concession holdings
in Sierra Mojada, Mexico, which was partially offset by a decrease in exploration and property holdings
costs as a result of reduced employees, reduced property concessions' taxes as we decided to reduce
our concessions' holdings and the decrease in the value of the $MXN compared to the U.S. dollar in
the nine months ended July 31, 2016 compared to the nine months ended July 31, 2015.
General and Administrative Costs
General and administrative expenses decreased $263,000 to $948,000 for the nine months ended July
31, 2016 as compared to $1,211,000 for the comparable period last year. This decrease was mainly
the result of a $81,000 decrease in personnel cost, a $65,000 decrease in office and administrative
cost, a $55,000 decrease in professional fees, a $53,000 decrease in directors' fees and an $8,000
decrease in provision for uncollectible value-added taxes.
Personnel costs decreased $81,000 to $330,000 for the nine months ended July 31, 2016 as
compared to $411,000 for the same period last year. This decrease was mainly due to the reduced
salaries for certain employees, the decrease in the value of the $CDN compared to the U.S. dollar and
the decrease in stock-based compensation expense to $52,000 in the nine months ended July, 31,
2016 from $66,000 in the comparable period last year as a result of stock options vesting in the nine
months ended July 31, 2016 having a lower fair value than stock options vesting in the comparable
period last year.
Office and administrative expenses decreased $65,000 to $323,000 for the nine months ended July 31,
2016 as compared to $388,000 for the comparable period last year. This decrease was mainly the
result of a decrease in the value of the $CDN compared to the U.S. dollar in the nine months ended
July 31, 2016 and a decrease in listing fees due to voluntarily delisting our shares of common stock
from the NYSE MKT on June 26, 2015, which was partially offset by increased investor relations
activities related to the 2016 private placements.
 
 
24
Professional fees decreased $55,000 to $192,000 for the nine months ended July 31, 2016 compared
to $247,000 for the comparable period last year. This decrease is mainly due to a decrease in
accounting fees.
Directors' fees decreased $53,000 to $102,000 for the nine months ended July 31, 2016 as compared
to $155,000 for the comparable period last year. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the
number of directors, a decrease in director fees and a $13,000 decrease in stock-based compensation
as a result of stock options vesting in the nine months ended July 31, 2016 having a lower fair value
than stock options vesting in the comparable period last year.
We recorded a provision of $1,000 for the nine months ended July 31, 2016 for uncollectible VAT
compared to a provision of $9,000 in the comparable period last year. The allowance for uncollectible
taxes was estimated by management based upon a number of factors, including the length of time the
returns have been outstanding, responses received from tax authorities, general economic conditions
in Mexico and Gabon and estimated net recovery after commissions.
Other Income (Expenses)
We recorded $100,000 in other income for the nine months ended July 31, 2016 as compared to other
expenses of $102,000 for the comparable period last year. The significant factors contributing to other
income was $133,000 in miscellaneous income, which was partially offset by a $32,000 foreign
currency transaction loss compared to a $102,000 foreign currency transaction loss for the comparable
period last year.
The miscellaneous income in the nine months ended July 31, 2016 was primarily the result of a
$133,000 gain on the sale of office and mining equipment at the Sierra Mojada Property. The foreign
currency transaction loss in the nine months ended July 31, 2015 was primarily the result of the
depreciation of the $CFA and the resulting impact on the intercompany loans between Silver Bull and
our Gabonese subsidiaries.
Results of Discontinued Operations
Pursuant to GAAP, Dome International and Dome International's wholly owned subsidiary, Dome
Ventures, have been reported in discontinued operations for the nine months ended July 31, 2015. 
Loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense for the nine months ended July 31, 2015
was $159,000, which is mainly exploration and property holding costs of $86,000 and a foreign
currency translation loss of $70,000 due to the depreciation of the $CFA and the resulting impact on
intercompany loans between Silver Bull and our Gabonese subsidiaries. In addition, for the nine
months ended July 31, 2015, as a result of the Gabon Sale, we realized a gain on sale of assets of
discontinued operations of $284,000, net of income taxes.
Material Changes in Financial Condition; Liquidity and Capital Resources
2016 Private Placements
On May 19, 2016, June 3, 2016 and June 29, 2016, we completed a three-tranche private placement
for an aggregate of 11,362,310 units at a purchase price of $CDN 0.13 per Unit (the "$CDN 0.13 Unit")
for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,138,000 ($CDN 1,477,100). Each $CDN 0.13 Unit consists of one
share of our common stock and one warrant (the "$CDN 0.13 Warrant").  Each $CDN 0.13 Warrant
entitles the holder thereof to acquire one share of common stock at a price of $CDN 0.16 for the period
of 12 months from the closing of the transaction of the private placement. If the closing price of our
common stock on the OTCQB Venture Marketplace is $0.18 or higher for five consecutive trading days,
then the $CDN 0.13 Warrant will expire 30 trading days from such fifth consecutive day. We paid an
8% finder's fee totaling $20,000 to certain agents with respect to certain purchasers who were
introduced by these agents. We incurred other costs of $37,000 related to this private placement. On
August 5, 2016, the warrant expiry acceleration clause contained in the $CDN 0.13 Unit Warrants was
triggered following a period of five consecutive trading days in which the closing price of our common
shares on the OTCQB Venture Marketplace was $0.18 or higher. In total, 11,362,310 $CDN 0.13 Unit
Warrants have been accelerated with a new expiration date of September 19, 2016.
 
 
25
On July 20, 2016, we completed a private placement of an aggregate of 4,340,000 units at a purchase
price of $CDN 0.15 per Unit (the "$CDN 0.15 Unit") for aggregate gross proceeds of $505,000 ($CDN
651,000). Each $CDN 0.15 Unit consists of one share of our common stock and one warrant (the
"$CDN 0.15 Warrant").  Each $CDN 0.15 Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one share of
common stock at a price of $CDN 0.16 for the period of 36 months from the closing of the private
placement. If, commencing on the date that is four months after the closing of the private placement, the
closing price of our common stock on the TSX is higher than $CDN 0.30 for 20 consecutive trading
days, then on the 20th consecutive trading day (the "Acceleration Trigger Date") the expiry date of the
$CDN 0.15 Warrants may be accelerated to the 20th trading day after the Acceleration Trigger Date by
the issuance, within three trading days of the Acceleration Trigger Date, of a news release announcing
such acceleration. We paid a 6% finder's fee totaling $23,000 to a placement agent with respect to
certain purchasers who were introduced by this agent. In addition, the placement agent received
200,400 non-transferable warrants (the "Placement Agent's Warrants"). Each Placement Agent's
Warrant entitles the placement agent to acquire one share of common stock until the date that is two
years following closing of the private placement at $CDN 0.205 and is subject to the acceleration
provision noted above. The fair value of the Placement Agent's Warrants was determined to be
$12,000, and we incurred other offering costs of $28,000.
Cash Flows
During the nine months ended July 31, 2016, we primarily utilized cash and cash equivalents to fund
exploration activities at the Sierra Mojada Property and for general and administrative
expenses. Additionally, during the nine months ended July 31, 2016, we received net cash proceeds of
$1,534,000 from the private placements. As a result of the net cash proceeds received from the private
placements, which was partially offset by cash expenditures on exploration activities and general and
administrative expenses, cash and cash equivalents increased from $951,000 at October 31, 2015 to
$1,511,000 at July 31, 2016.
Cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended July 31, 2016 was $1,106,000 as
compared to $1,911,000 for the comparable period in 2015.  This decrease was mainly due to the
decreased exploration work at the Sierra Mojada Property and decreased general and administrative
expenses. In addition, accounts payable increased $55,000 in the nine months ended July 31, 2016
compared to a decrease of $140,000 in the comparable period last year.
Cash flows provided by investing activities for the nine months ended July 31, 2016 was $142,000 in
proceeds from the sale of office and mining equipment. Cash flows provided by investing activities in
the comparable period last year was $1,412,000, which was significantly related to the Gabon Sale
proceeds of $1,362,000.
Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended July 31, 2016 was $1,534,000
as compared to $nil for the comparable period last year. The cash flow provided by financing activities
was due to the private placements we completed.
Capital Resources
As of July 31, 2016, we had cash and cash on hand of $1,511,000 and working capital of $1,244,000
as compared to cash and cash on hand of $951,000 and working capital of $832,000 as of October 31,
2015. The increase in our liquidity and working capital was primarily the result of the private
placements we completed and the proceeds from the sale of office and mining equipment, which was
partially offset by cash and cash equivalents used by exploration activities at the Sierra Mojada
Property and general and administrative expenses.
Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our achieving a future financing or strategic
transaction such as  obtaining adequate equity financing, joint venture opportunities on the Sierra
Mojada Property, asset divestitures or some other strategic transaction. However, there is no
assurance that we will be successful in pursuing these financing and strategic options. Accordingly,
even after taking into account the proceeds from our recent private placements, there is substantial
doubt as to whether our existing cash resources and working capital are sufficient to enable us to
continue our operations for the next 12 months as a going concern.
Any future additional financing in the near term will likely be in the form of the issuance of equity
interests, which will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. Moreover, we may incur significant
fees and expenses in the pursuit of a financing or other strategic transaction, which will increase the
rate at which our limited cash and working capital is depleted.
26
Capital Requirements and Liquidity; Need for Subsequent Funding
Our management and board of directors monitor our overall costs, expenses, and financial resources
and, if necessary, will adjust our planned operational expenditures in an attempt to ensure we have
sufficient operating capital. We continue to evaluate our costs and planned expenditures, including for
our Sierra Mojada Property as discussed below. As noted above, however, if we are unable to obtain
adequate additional financial resources, there is substantial doubt as to whether our existing cash
resources and working capital are sufficient to enable us to continue our operations for the next 12
months as a going concern.
The continued exploration of the Sierra Mojada Property will require significant amounts of additional
capital. As a result of completion of the private placements, our board approved an updated budget for
the Sierra Mojada Property in September 2016. Our updated exploration budget for the Sierra Mojada
Property for the period from September 2016 to December 2016 is $0.6 million for exploration and
property holding costs compared to $0.1 million for exploration and property holding costs in the
original budget. As of August 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.3 million of cash on hand. We will
continue to evaluate our ability to obtain additional financial resources, and we will attempt to reduce
expenditures on the Sierra Mojada Property and general and administrative costs if we determine that
additional financial resources are unavailable or available on terms that we determine are
unacceptable. However, if we are unable to fund future operations by obtaining additional financial
resources, including through public or private offerings of equity, there is substantial doubt as to
whether we can continue our operations for the next 12 months as a going concern. Debt or equity
financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Equity financing, if available, will
likely result in substantial dilution to existing shareholders. Moreover, the continued exploration and if
warranted, development, of the Sierra Mojada Property ultimately will require us to raise significant
additional capital or identify a strategic partner.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our
stockholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
The critical accounting policies are defined in our consolidated financial statements and notes
therefore contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2015 filed on
January 19, 2016.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in the Nine-Month Period Ended July 31, 2016
Effective November 1, 2015, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB")
Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-08, "Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205)
and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures
of Disposals of Components of an Entity." Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals representing a strategic
shift in operations are presented as discontinued operations. In addition, ASU 2014-08 requires
expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide additional information about the
assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. ASU 2014-08 also requires
disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that
does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The adoption of this update did not have a
material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting," which amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transaction,
including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows. These changes become effective for our fiscal year
beginning November 1, 2017. We have not determined the effects of this update on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
 
 
27
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases," which will require lessees to recognize
assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on the balance sheet. These
changes become effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2019. Modified retrospective
adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, is required with an
option to use certain transition relief. We have not determined the effects of this update on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments – Overall: Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," which (i) requires equity investments
(except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation
of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii)
requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial
instruments for disclosure purposes, (iii) requires separate presentation of financial assets and
financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and (iv) eliminates the
requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to
estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized
cost. These changes become effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2018. Early
application is permitted. We have not determined the effects of this update on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,"
which requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities
as noncurrent. These changes become effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2017. Early
application is permitted.  We have not determined the effects of this update on our financial position,
and disclosures at this time.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-
Period Adjustments," which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the
financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business
combination is consummated. These changes become effective for our fiscal year beginning
November 1, 2016. We have not determined the effects of this update on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Deferral of the Effective Date", which defers the
effective date of ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" to become effective for our
fiscal year beginning November 1, 2018. We have not determined the effects of this update on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory," which
provides a revised, simpler measurement for inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net
realizable value. These changes become effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2017. We
have not determined the effects of this update on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows and disclosures at this time.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of  Debt Issuance Costs,"
which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented as a
reduction to the carrying amount of that debt liability, not as an asset. These changes become effective
prospectively for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2016. We have not determined the effects of
this update on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis," which amends the consolidation requirements in Accounting Standards
Codification 810. These changes become effective prospectively for our fiscal year beginning
November 1, 2016. We have not determined the effects of this update on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements—Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability To Continue as a
Going Concern." ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether
there is substantial doubt about an organization's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide
related footnote disclosures. The update provides guidance to an organization's management, with
principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures
that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The
amendments are effective for our fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after
November 1, 2017. Early application is permitted. We have not determined the effects of this update on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task
Force) and the SEC did not or are not believed to have a material impact on our present or future
consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
On May 19, 2016, June 3, 2016 and June 29, 2016, the Company completed a three-tranche private
placement for an aggregate of 11,362,310 units at a purchase price of $CDN 0.13 per unit (the "$CDN
0.13 Unit) for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,137,643 ($CDN 1,477,100).  Each $CDN 0.13 Unit
consists of one share of the Company's common stock and one warrant (the "$CDN 0.13 Warrant"). 
Each $CDN 0.13 Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one share of common stock at a price of
$CDN 0.16 for the period of 12 months from the closing of the tranche of the private placement.  If the
closing price of the common stock of the Company on the OTCQB Venture Marketplace is $0.18 or
higher for five consecutive trading days, then the $CDN 0.13 Warrant will expire 30 trading days from
such fifth consecutive day.  The Company paid an 8% finder's fee totaling $19,644 to certain agents
with respect to certain purchasers who were introduced by these agents.  The Company incurred other
costs of $36,843 related to this private placement.  In the "$CDN 0.13 Unit private placement, the
securities were issued to non-U.S. persons in off-shore transactions pursuant to the exemption from
registration provided for under Regulation S, promulgated under the Securities Act.  Each investor
represented that he, she or it was not a "U.S. person" as such term is defined in Regulation S.
On July 20, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of an aggregate of 4,340,000 units at a
purchase price of $CDN 0.15 per unit (the "$CDN 0.15 Unit") for aggregate gross proceeds of
$504,729 ($CDN 651,000).  Each $CDN 0.15 Unit consists of one share of the Company's common
stock and one warrant (the "$CDN 0.15 Warrant").  Each $CDN 0.15 Warrant entitles the holder thereof
to acquire one share of common stock at a price of $CDN 0.16 for the period of 36 months from the
closing of the private placement.  If, commencing on the date that is four months after the closing of the
private placement, the closing price of the common stock on the TSX is higher than $CDN 0.30 for 20
consecutive trading days, then on the 20th consecutive trading day (the "Acceleration Trigger Date")
the expiry date of the $CDN 0.15 Warrants may be accelerated to the 20th trading day after the
Acceleration Trigger Date by the issuance, within three trading days of the Acceleration Trigger Date,
of a news release announcing such acceleration.  The Company paid a 6% finder's fee totaling
$23,326 to a placement agent with respect to certain purchasers who were introduced by this agent.  In
addition, the placement agent received 200,400 non-transferable warrants (the "Placement Agent's
Warrants").  Each Placement Agent's Warrant entitles the placement agent to acquire one share of
common stock until the date that is two years following closing of the private placement at $CDN 0.205
and is subject to the acceleration provision noted above.  The fair value of the Placement Agent's
Warrants was determined to be $11,621, and the Company incurred other offering costs of $28,146. 
The Company relied on the exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or
Rule 506 of Regulation D, or Regulation S, for purposes of the $CDN 0.15 Unit private placement.
