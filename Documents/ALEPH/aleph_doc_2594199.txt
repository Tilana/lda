Commenting on the Financial Results, Evolution’s Executive Chairman Jake Klein said:
“The 2016 financial year was transformational for  Evolution with the acquisition and integration 
of  Cowal  and  Mungari.  Importantly,  we  were  able  to  stay  focused  on  driving  down  costs  and 
delivering  a  strong  financial  outcome  from  our  portfolio  of  seven  assets.  Record  production  at 
record  low  costs  resulted  in  a  record  underlying  net  profit  of  A$226.9  million.  Thank  you  to 
everyone who pulls on an Evolution shirt every day for their outstanding efforts.” 
 
“We are committed to maintaining this focus and to continue to deliver strong results. The three 
year guidance we recently released indicates that the performance we achieved in FY16 is not 
only sustainable, but should get even better. This positive outlook has enabled us to double the 
dividend rate we expect to return to shareholders going forward.”
1.  All-in  Sustaining  Cost  includes  C1  cash  cost,  plus  royalty  expense;  sustaining  capital;  and  general  corporate  and  administration
expenses on a per ounce sold basis
2.  Calculated using an average AUD:USD exchange rate for FY16 of US$0.7284
Evolution  posted  a  record  underlying  profit  after  tax  of  A$226.884  million  (30  June  2015:  profit  A$106.050 
million) and a statutory net loss after tax of A$24.349 million (30 June 2015: profit A$100.115 million) for the 
year  ended  30  June  2016.  This  increase  in  underlying  profit  after  tax  was  driven  by  record  production,  a 
strong focus on cost control and a favourable Australian dollar gold price. 
 
The  statutory  net  loss  after  tax  includes  one-off  transaction  and  non-operating  costs  which  have  been 
excluded from Evolution’s underlying profit after tax. These costs include acquisition and integration costs of 
A$54.681  million,  impairment  of  goodwill  of  A$35.270  million,  and  fair  value  amortisation  and  expenses  of 
A$88.317 million incurred  on  the  Cowal,  Mungari and Phoenix  Gold  acquisitions.  Evolution  also incurred  an 
impairment on assets of A$77.330 million as a result of reclassifying the Pajingo asset to held for sale. 
 
The unwind of the fair value uplift (acquisition accounting) in FY2017 will be A$25 – 35 million for Cowal and 
A$25 – 35 million for Mungari.   
 
Total production for the year increased 84% to 803,476oz despite a decline in the average grade processed 
by  9%  to  1.77g/t (30  June  2015:  437,570oz,  1.94g/t).  This  was  largely  achieved  as  a result  of  the  first  year 
inclusion of Cowal and Mungari which contributed 29% and 17% of Evolution’s total production respectively. 
Mt Carlton was the largest contributor of the existing assets with 14% of the Evolution’s total, a 45% increase 
on the prior year. 
 
A  record  net  mine  cash  flow  of  A$428.203  million  (30  June  2015:  A$137.793  million)  was  also  achieved 
during the year, representing a 211% improvement over the prior year. All operations were cash flow positive 
after all sustaining and major capital expenditure, including capital stripping. 
 
Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2016 was up 100% to A$1.329 billion (30 June 2015: A$665.958 million) 
largely as a result of the first year inclusion of Cowal and Mungari which contributed revenues of  A$375.346 
million and A$232.549 million respectively. The original five mine sites contributed A$720.719 million which is 
an  increase  on  the  prior  year  of  8%.  This  can  be  largely  attributed  to  an  outstanding  performance  at  Mt 
Carlton  which  offset  operational  issues  at  two  sites  along  with  a  7%  increase  in  the  achieved  gold  price  to 
A$1,597/oz (30 June 2015: A$1,489/oz). 
 
Deliveries into the hedge book were 264,322oz at an average price of  A$1,594/oz (30 June 2015: 85,147oz, 
A$1,571/oz). The remaining 551,266oz were sold at spot price achieving an average price of A$1,591/oz (30 
June 2015: 279,646oz, A$1,526/oz). Additionally, the Company acquired a further 245,985oz of gold delivery 
contracts  as  part  of  the  La  Mancha  acquisition,  with  scheduled  quarterly  deliveries  from  September  2015 
through to December  2017.  Evolution’s  outstanding hedge  book  as  at 30  June 2016  totals  706,989oz  at  an 
average price of A$1,624/oz for deliveries to June 2020. 
 
Operating  costs,  excluding  depreciation,  amortisation  and  fair  value  adjustments  of  A$422.766  million, 
increased to A$674.226 million (30 June 2015: A$360.525 million) as a result of the first year of inclusion of 
Cowal  and  Mungari.  These  two  new  assets  accounted  for  operating  costs  of  A$153.108  million  and 
A$117.487 million respectively. The operating costs for the existing five mine sites were A$403.631 million, an 
increase  of  12%  on  prior  year  operating  costs  (30  June  2015:  A$360,525  million).  Evolution  continues  to 
place a strong focus on cost control over operating activities and anticipates further efficiencies in FY17. 
 
Evolution’s  AISC  decreased  2%  to  A$1,014/oz  (30  June  2015:  A$1,036/oz)  despite  a  9%  drop  in  average 
grade mined during the year. The two new assets, Cowal and Mungari delivered low cost ounces producing at 
an  AISC    of  A$776/oz  and  A$1,024/oz  respectively.  Mt  Carlton  was  Evolution’s  lowest  cost  asset  with  an 
AISC of A$742/oz representing a decrease of 23% on the prior year (30 June 2015: A$912/oz). 
 
Total  exploration  expenditure  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  was  A$27.823  million  (30  June  2015: 
A$23.981 million) with an exploration expense of A$13.801 million (30 June 2015: A$6.968 million).
Capital  expenditure  has  increased  19%  to  A$200.214  million  (30  June  2015:  A$168.197  million).  This 
consists  of  sustaining  capital,  including  near  mine  exploration  and  resource  definition  of  A$106.970  million 
(30  June  2015:  A$77.012  million)  and  mine  development  of  A$93.244  million  (30  June  2015:  A$91.185 
million).  
 
This announcement is a summary of the FY16 Financial Results. Full details of the FY16 Financial Results 
are  available  in  the  Appendix  4E  and  Annual  Financial  Report  released  today  and  available  at  the 
Company’s website. 
 
Dividend Payment 
 
In  June  2016,  the  Directors  approved  a  change  to  the  dividend  policy  of  whenever  possible  paying  a  half-
yearly  dividend equivalent  to 4%  of the  Evolution’s sales revenue. The change in policy doubled the payout 
ratio  from  the  previous  level  of  2%  to  4%  of  revenue  (relating  to  sales  in  the  six  month  period  to  30  June 
2016). The change is effective immediately and has been applied to the final dividend for 2016. 
 
The  Board  has  confirmed  that  Evolution  is  in  a  position  to  pay  a  final  dividend  for  the  current  period  to  30 
June  2016  of  2  cents  per  share  unfranked,  totalling  A$29.365  million.  Evolution  shares  will  trade  excluding 
entitlement to the dividend on 24 August 2016, with the record date being 26 August 2016 and payment date 
of 23 September 2016 
 
Evolution has  a Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan  that  allows  shareholders  to  elect  to reinvest  all  or  part  of  any 
dividends  payable  on  their  Evolution  shares  to  acquire  additional  Evolution  shares.  The  allotted  shares  in 
respect of the FY16 final dividend will be issued at a 5.0% discount to the volume-weighted average price for 
the five days immediately after the Record Date.
Outlook for FY17
Following  the  sale  of  Pajingo,  Evolution  is  now  forecasting  FY17  Group  gold  production  of  745,000  – 
800,000 ounces of gold at an AISC of A$970 – A$1,030 per ounce1.

Forward Looking Statements
This announcement includes forward looking statements. Often, but not always, forward looking statements can 
generally  be  identified  by  the  use  of  forward  looking  words  such  as  “may”,  “will”,  “expect”,  “intend”,  “plan”, 
“estimate”,  “anticipate”,  “continue”,  and  “guidance”,  or  other  similar  words  and  may  include,  without  limitation, 
statements  regarding  plans,  strategies  and  objectives  of  management,  anticipated  production  or  construction 
commencement dates and expected costs or production outputs.
Forward  looking  statements  inherently  involve  known  and  unknown  risks,  uncertainties  and  other  factors  that 
may  cause  the  Company’s  actual  results,  performance  and  achievements  to  differ  materially  from  any  future 
results,  performance  or  achievements.  Relevant  factors  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  changes  in 
commodity prices, foreign exchange fluctuations and general economic conditions, increased costs and demand 
for  production  inputs,  the  speculative  nature  of  exploration  and  project  development,  including  the  risks  of 
obtaining necessary licenses and permits and  diminishing quantities or  grades of reserves,  political  and social 
risks,  changes  to  the  regulatory  framework  within  which  the  Company  operates  or  may  in  the  future  operate, 
environmental  conditions  including  extreme  weather  conditions,  recruitment  and  retention  of  personnel, 
industrial relations issues and litigation.
Forward looking statements are based on the Company and its management’s good faith assumptions relating 
to  the  financial,  market,  regulatory  and  other  relevant  environments  that  will  exist  and  affect  the  Company’s 
business  and  operations  in  the  future.    The  Company  does  not  give  any  assurance  that  the  assumptions  on 
which  forward  looking  statements  are  based  will  prove  to  be  correct,  or  that  the  Company’s  business  or 
operations will not be affected in any material manner by these or other factors not foreseen or foreseeable by 
the Company or management or beyond the Company’s control.
Although the Company attempts and has attempted to identify factors that would cause actual actions, events or 
results  to  differ  materially  from  those  disclosed  in forward  looking statements,  there  may  be  other  factors  that

intended,  and  many  events  are  beyond  the  reasonable  control  of  the  Company.    Accordingly,  readers  are 
cautioned  not  to  place  undue  reliance  on  forward  looking  statements.    Forward  looking  statements  in  these 
materials  speak  only  at  the  date  of  issue.  Subject  to  any  continuing  obligations  under  applicable  law  or  any 
relevant  stock  exchange  listing  rules,  in  providing  this  information  the  Company  does  not  undertake  any 
obligation  to  publicly  update  or  revise  any  of  the  forward  looking  statements  or  to  advise  of  any  change  in
