<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 15/2 
by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and 
consequences, Gulnara Shahinian. In chapter II, the Special Rapporteur summarizes her 
activities since her previous report to the Council, and in chapters III&#8211;VII she discusses and 
makes recommendations on combating contemporary forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Activities of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Visits to countries and follow-up activities 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur conducted official country visits to Kazakhstan from 24 
September to 1 October 2012 and to Madagascar from 10 to 20 December 2012 to engage 
in dialogue with the Governments about policies, programmes, plans and activities aimed at 
combating contemporary forms of slavery (see A/HRC/24/43/Add.1 and 
A/HRC/24/43/Add.2). She wishes to thank the Governments of Kazakhstan and 
Madagascar for acceding to her request for a visit. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur participated in two follow-up workshops focused on the 
recommendations that she made upon concluding her country visits. On 12 and 13 
November 2012, she participated in a follow-up workshop in Brasilia, at which the 
participants produced an action plan for the implementation of her recommendations on 
forced and bonded labour in agriculture and textile industry. She also participated in a 
follow-up workshop in Lima on 15 and 16 November 2012, at which the participants 
focused on the status of implementation of her recommendations on contemporary forms of 
slavery in Lima. They developed time-bound action plans to follow up on forced and 
bonded labour, child slavery in mining and domestic servitude. 
</p>
<p>4. Both workshops were organized jointly by the relevant Governments and the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The participants included 
relevant Government officials, and representatives of civil society organizations and United 
Nations agencies. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Governments of Brazil and 
Peru for their continued cooperation and commitment to implementing the 
recommendations made in her reports (A/HRC/15/20/Add.4 and A/HRC/18/30/Add.2, 
respectively). 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would appreciate receiving invitations from the other 
countries to which she has sent requests to visit: Bangladesh, Ghana, Nepal, Niger, Sudan 
and Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Communications and other activities 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur issued numerous press statements, either individually or 
jointly with other special procedure mandate holders. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Challenges and lessons in combating contemporary forms of 
slavery 
</b></p>
<p>7. The closest figure for the number of individuals subjected to contemporary forms of </p>


<p>slavery is that of 21 million victims of forced labour worldwide.1 This obviously does not 
include other forms of slavery that the Special Rapporteur has covered such as servile 
marriage, domestic servitude, child slavery and bonded labour which would show in a 
much higher number of victims. 
</p>
<p>8. Contemporary forms of slavery can be found around the world, but there are certain 
regions where it is more prevalent. For the 2012 International Labour Organization (ILO) 
estimate, the number of persons in conditions of forced labour are broken down by region: 
the Middle East had 600,000 persons in forced labour, &#8220;developed economies and the 
</p>
<p>European Union&#8221; had 1.5 million, Central and South-Eastern Europe and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States had 1.6 million, Latin America and the Caribbean 
had 1.8 million, Africa had 3.7 million, and Asia and the Pacific had 11.7 million. Despite 
having the second lowest number of victims of forced labour, Central and South-Eastern 
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States registered the highest rate of forced 
labour, at 420 per 100,000 inhabitants.2 
</p>
<p>9. Women are also more often in charge of children, which adds pressure on them to 
work and provide for their households. Owing to the need to work, women may be 
financially obliged to remain in undesirable jobs and thus forced to endure less than ideal 
working conditions. In many countries, women are also at a disadvantage due to cultural 
traditions. Finally, women and girls are often denied equal access to education, which 
makes them less attractive in the labour market and fuels the cycle of poverty and 
vulnerability to slavery.  
</p>
<p>10. Servile marriage and domestic servitude are two forms of contemporary slavery that 
disproportionately affect women and girls. In a previous report, the Special Rapporteur 
defined servile marriage as an arrangement &#8220;in which a spouse is reduced to a commodity 
</p>
<p>over whom any or all the powers of ownership are attached&#8221; (A/HRC/21/41, summary). 
Practices such as polygamy and &#8220;bride price&#8221;, especially when coupled with the prevalence 
of domestic violence, are possible indicators of servile marriage. Women&#8217;s bodies are 
</p>
<p>directly tied to a family&#8217;s honour in many cultures, and if a girl refuses to marry, &#8220;she can 
</p>
<p>be subject to character assassination or kidnapping by the man or his family to force her 
into marriage or to rape her&#8221; (ibid., para. 71). There is little to no legal protection for 
women in these situations in many countries. Some countries have gone so far as to enact 
legislation that acquits perpetrators of rape if they marry their victim. If a woman enters 
into a servile marriage, she essentially becomes a slave to her husband and his family.  
</p>
<p>11. Servile marriages are still practised today; for example, in Papua New Guinea. 
According to a 2012 report by The Projection Project, &#8220;women are victims of forced, 
fraudulent, servile, fraudulently brokered, and temporary marriages. Children may also 
become victims of exploitative marriage&#8221;.3  
</p>
<p>12. Domestic work is one of the largest service industries in the world, but it is among 
the least visible due to its location in the private sphere. Many women in domestic work 
find themselves physically and socially isolated and their right to organize is significantly 
restricted. Live-in workers are often expected to work 16&#8211;17 hours a day, frequently 
without a day off or vacation time. The work can be extremely taxing, including carrying 
heavy loads and handling toxic substances. Physical, emotional and sexual abuse occur in 
situations of domestic servitude. Employers often confiscate domestic workers&#8217; passports or

<p>identity papers and withhold their wages for &#8220;safe keeping&#8221;, which makes it very difficult 
for them to leave their employment. 
</p>
<p>13. During her mission to Lebanon, the Special Rapporteur was informed that migrant 
domestic workers made up 25 per cent of the Lebanese workforce and faced &#8220;physical 
</p>
<p>abuse, a category encompassing physical suffering caused by working a minimum of 18 
hours per day and physical assault &#8230; non-payment of wages, sexual abuse, moral 
harassment, food deprivation, sexual harassment, forced labour &#8230; physical threats, forced 
prostitution, non-renewal of papers and employment of minors&#8221; (A/HRC/21/41/Add.1, 
para. 9). The Governments of Madagascar, Philippines and Sri Lanka have since prohibited 
their citizens from working in domestic service in Lebanon due to these extremely poor 
conditions and the fact that there is virtually no system in place in Lebanon to protect 
domestic workers. Article 7 of the Lebanese Labour Code of 1946 specifically excludes 
domestic workers from its provisions (ibid., para. 21). 
</p>
<p>14. Children working as domestic servants experienced a variety of abuses, including 
physical and sexual abuse, long working hours, isolation and little to no access to 
education. According to the University of Nairobi, &#8220;child domestics [experience] 
significantly more psychological problems than other children (both working and non-
working children). Frequent headaches, eating problems, nightmares, tiredness and 
unhappiness were found to be very common amongst child domestics&#8221;. These children 
were found to be extremely vulnerable to becoming victims of slavery.4  
</p>
<p>15. Discrimination based on race, ethnicity and caste also plays a role in increasing 
vulnerability to contemporary forms of slavery. Bonded labour in Asia, for example, 
disproportionately affects people with disadvantaged social statuses such as a low caste and 
the majority of forced labour victims in South America were from indigenous cultures, 
while strict social hierarchies in West Africa can dictate a person&#8217;s status as a slave. In 
many societies, racism is very common and typically the darker the skin, the more abuse 
that follows.  
</p>
<p>16. In Nepal, a debt bondage system, the labourers of which are known as Haliyas, can 
be found in the agricultural sector. Haliya means &#8220;one who ploughs&#8221;. Ploughing land is 
considered to be dirty and unskilled work that only lower-class citizens should perform, 
making it the work of &#8220;untouchables&#8221; or Dalits.5 Haliyas are either paid very little for their 
work or paid only in small amounts of food.6 Debt quickly accrues as workers take out 
loans for personal expenses,7 while landowners take advantage of them by charging 
exorbitant interest rates. According to a Centre for Human Rights and Global Justice report, 
&#8220;such discrimination is intentionally designed to keep alive a system of debt bondage&#8221;.8  
</p>
<p>17. In September 2008, the Government of Nepal officially liberated all Haliyas and 
pardoned their debts to landowners. However, in 2010, the Asia Human Rights 
Commission reported that most Haliyas were still working for their landlords, despite 
formal liberation. It is very difficult for former Haliyas to integrate into the labour force as

<p>they have little to no education or technical skills and 97 per cent do not own land. 
Approximately 150,000 people were estimated to be affected by the Haliya system in 
2010.9 All Haliyas are male because females are not allowed to plough and cannot get loans 
to own land of their own. However, women still assist their husbands&#8217; landlords by 
collecting food for the animals or carrying manure to the farms. Children of Haliyas are 
often involved in the work as cattle herders, and therefore miss out on educational 
opportunities. 
</p>
<p>18. Migrant workers are also disproportionately affected by contemporary forms of 
slavery. Many are especially vulnerable because they are employed far from their homes, 
lack language skills and familiarity with host country legal systems, may be undocumented, 
hired through recruitment agencies, are unprotected by laws in host jurisdictions, rarely 
receive adequate training, lack access to effective grievance mechanisms, are vulnerable to 
contract substitution, and/or are severely underpaid. Limitations on migrant workers&#8217; 
</p>
<p>freedom of movement greatly increase their chances of becoming victims of contemporary 
slavery. Employers may confiscate their passports or identity papers and migrant workers 
are often employed in remote locations where they are dependent on their employers even 
for basic necessities.  
</p>
<p>19. In informal artisanal mining, contemporary slavery is prevalent and freedom of 
movement is severely curtailed. Mines are often located far from population centres and 
many small, informal mines operate in areas outside the purview of the law. Therefore, it is 
very difficult for authorities to locate and identify victims of slavery in the sector. There are 
no labour inspections at many informal mines and violence, crime, and substance abuse are 
rampant. Working hours are often long, work is extremely dangerous, living conditions are 
poor and workers are often paid illegally low wages.10 Debt bondage and child slavery are 
also common.  
</p>
<p>20. Another vulnerable group of workers are <i>Pallaris</i>, women who work outside the 
mines separating out minerals from piles of dirt. Interviews with in-country labour experts 
indicate that <i>Pallaris</i> generally lack formal work contracts, are paid at piece rates set by 
mineral brokers and must obtain authorization from the mine owners or administrators to 
work outside the mines. This authorization can be rescinded at any time, which makes 
<i>Pallaris </i>extremely vulnerable. Sometimes <i>Pallaris</i> are forced to provide sexual favours or 
do additional work to obtain or maintain their authorization. Children often work alongside 
their mothers or in the gold mines themselves. Children as young as 8 have been known to 
work underground with their fathers, small children are often sent down small mine shafts, 
and children are made to carry extremely heavy loads and exposed to toxic chemicals in 
gold extraction and processing.11  
</p>
<p>21. In addition to domestic work and mining, contemporary forms of slavery can be 
found in many other industries. According to the ILO 2012 estimate, 90 per cent of the 20.9 
million victims of forced labour were employed in the private economy.12 Slavery can also 
be found in fishing, domestic work, quarrying, brick kilns and illegal activities. Forced 
labour is prominent in agriculture, logging, mining, apparel and electronics manufacturing, 
personal-care services, construction and food processing.13

</p>
<p>abolished without further delay&#8221;, 26 August 2010. Available from www.humanrights.asia/news/alrc-

<p>22. Malaysia is currently the world&#8217;s second largest producer of palm oil. According to 
a recent report, in order for Malaysia to &#8220;meet the growing global demand for cheaply 
</p>
<p>produced palm oil, some producers are relying on forced labor and other forms of modern 
slavery&#8221;.14 Agricultural work is not an attractive form of employment for the majority of 
Malaysians. Therefore, men, women, and children &#8211; primarily from Indonesia and 
Philippines &#8211; migrate to Malaysia in order to work on these plantations. Many of these 
workers are undocumented, poor and isolated, making them extremely vulnerable to 
contemporary forms of slavery. The Secretary General of Indonesia&#8217;s Commission for 
Child Protection reported that tens of thousands of Indonesian migrant workers and their 
children had been &#8220;systematically enslaved&#8221; on Malaysian plantations. The number of 
Indonesian children in forced labour in Sabah, Malaysia, is estimated to be as high as 
72,000. Children born at the plantations are not issued birth certificates, preventing them 
from attending school and forcing them to stay at the plantations and work.15<b>  
</b></p>
<p>23. ILO has reported that 69 per cent of child labour occurs in the agricultural sector, 
where there is a high incidence of the worst forms of child labour.16 Because agricultural 
work is generally low-paid, carried out by temporary and migrant workers and occurs in 
isolated rural areas subject to little government oversight, both child and adult agricultural 
workers are vulnerable to contemporary forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p>24. A number of sources have reported that children are subjected to contemporary 
slavery in Ghanaian fisheries by &#8220;fisher-entrepreneurs&#8221;17 or middlemen who take them far 
from their homes to work in fisheries. Recruiters reportedly deceive families with promises 
of educational opportunities in exchange for a few hours of work each day. Children are 
also often promised cash or in-kind payments for their labour, such as a cow for boys or a 
sewing machine for girls.18 Parents may be offered an advance for their child&#8217;s work, thus 
placing the child in a situation of debt bondage. Lake Volta is a popular destination for 
child slaves, as fishery resources have been depleted and children are considered cheap 
sources of labour.19 Tasks in the fishing sector are gendered: boys paddle canoes, pull in 
nets and carry fish; girls sort, pack and transport fish; and both boys and girls are often 
tasked with deep-water diving to clear entangled nets. Children usually work six to seven 
days a week, at least 12 hours a day, and fishing expeditions can last for many days. These 
children are exposed to dangerous working conditions, long hours, sexual and physical 
abuse, and even death due to drowning, snake bites or physical abuse at the hands of boat or 
equipment owners.20 
</p>
<p>25. According to recent reports, migrant workers in the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland are subject to contemporary forms of slavery in the 
construction sector. By nature, work in this sector is seasonal, time-sensitive and 
temporary, qualities that can lead to poor working conditions. Construction companies also

<p>use subcontracted labour, which can be exploited more easily. A 2003 survey estimated that 
88,000 non-British workers were employed in construction. Migrant workers are attractive 
to construction companies because they are often seen as cheap, disposable labour. It is not 
possible for migrant workers to obtain a work permit for construction work, so they must 
enter the United Kingdom on a self-employed visa, which adds to their vulnerability and 
invisibility.21  
</p>
<p>26.  Children as young as 3 years old were reportedly working in mines and quarries in 
Sierra Leone in 2012,22 with children as young as 10 subjected to contemporary forms of 
slavery in diamond mines.23 Children break apart, shovel and wash gravel all day, six days 
a week, for little to no compensation, with wages ranging from USD 0.15&#8211;0.60 per day. 
They are vulnerable to disease, injury and death due to collapsing mine pits.24 Children 
working in mines are denied educational opportunities, preventing them from escaping the 
cycle of poverty and enslavement. Families often cannot afford to send their children to 
school because they need their labour to supplement family earnings, as 60 per cent of the 
population lives in poverty, according to the United Nations Development Programme. The 
civil war in the country exacerbated children&#8217;s vulnerability to slavery, as numerous child 
soldiers abducted by armed factions were subsequently forced to work in mining, many 
children lost their parents and schooling for most children was interrupted.25 
</p>
<p><b> IV. International legal framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Slavery 
</b></p>
<p>27. Article 1 of the 1926 Slavery Convention defines slavery as the &#8220;the status or 
condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of 
ownership are exercised&#8221;. The Convention calls for the &#8220;complete abolition of slavery in all 
its forms&#8221;, including the &#8220;capture, acquisition, sale or exchange, and disposal&#8221; of persons 
(art. 2, in conjunction with art. 1). Since the drafting of the Convention, most international 
legal frameworks have included articles concerning the prohibition of slavery, including 
article 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), article 8, paragraph 1, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) and, more recently, the Protocol 
to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (the 
Palermo Protocol). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Debt bondage and serfdom 
</b></p>
<p>28. Since 1926, a number of other international instruments have been drafted in order 
to address the varied forms of modern-day slavery that occur in the ever-changing social, 
political and economic environment. The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of 
Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, adopted in 1956,

debt bondage<b> </b>as &#8220;the status or condition arising from a pledge by a debtor of his personal 
services or of those of a person under his control as security for a debt, if the value of those 
services as reasonably assessed is not applied towards the liquidation of the debt of the 
length and nature of those services are not respectively limited and defined&#8221; (art. 1 (a)). 
Serfdom is defined as &#8220;the condition or status of a tenant who is by law, custom or 
agreement bound to live and labour on land belonging to another person and to render some 
determinate service to such other person, whether for reward or not, and is not free to 
change his status&#8221; (art. 1 (b)).  
</p>
<p><b> C. Servile marriage 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Supplementary Convention also addresses the practice of servile marriage<b> </b>as a 
form of slavery, although it does not label it as such. The Convention outlaws practices in 
which: a woman is &#8220;promised or given in marriage on payment&#8221;; &#8220;the husband of a woman, 
his family, or his clan, has the right to transfer her to another person&#8221;; and &#8220;a woman on the 
death of her husband is liable to be inherited&#8221; (art. 1 (c)). States Parties to the Convention 
are asked to establish suitable minimum ages of marriage. Servile marriage was also 
alluded to in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 16 establishes that 
&#8220;marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending 
spouses&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Child slavery 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Supplementary Convention also alludes to child slavery. The Convention 
requires the abolition of &#8220;any institution or practice whereby a child or young person under 
</p>
<p>the age of 18 years, is delivered by either or both of his natural parents or by his guardian to 
another person, whether for reward or not, with a view to the exploitation of the child or 
young person or his labour&#8221; (art. 1 (d)). Article 10, paragraph 3, of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states that, &#8220;children and young persons 
should be protected from economic and social exploitation. Their employment in work 
harmful to their morals or health or dangerous to life or likely to hamper their normal 
development should be punishable by law.&#8221; Drawing on this, ILO Convention No. 182 
(1999) concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst 
Forms of Child Labour defines and prohibits the worst forms of child labour, including 
child slavery (arts. 1 and 3). 
</p>
<p><b> E. Domestic servitude 
</b></p>
<p>31. Domestic servitude can be another contemporary form of slavery, although it has not 
garnered as much attention in the international human rights frameworks of the twentieth 
century. Domestic servitude is implicitly prohibited in the articles of the Slavery 
Convention, the Covenants and Declarations that make up the International Bill of Human 
Rights, ILO Convention No. 105 (1959) concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour and the 
1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and ILO Convention No. 182 both protect children against 
conditions akin to domestic servitude. In June 2011, ILO adopted Convention No. 189 
concerning decent work for domestic workers, which similarly addresses such issues. The 
Convention sets out protections against domestic servitude, outlining specific rights for 
domestic workers, including fair terms of employment, decent working and living 
conditions, respect for their privacy, and protection against all forms of abuse, harassment, 
and violence (arts. 5 and 6). </p>


<p><b> F. Forced labour 
</b></p>
<p>32. Slavery and compulsory or forced labour are separate practices that are addressed 
independently in most international human rights documents. The Slavery Convention 
establishes that States should &#8220;take all necessary measures to prevent compulsory or forced 
</p>
<p>labour from developing into conditions analogous to slavery&#8221; (art. 5). ILO Convention No. 
29 (1930) concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour defines forced labour as, &#8220;all work or 
service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which 
the said person has not offered himself voluntarily&#8221; (art. 2). The Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families, ILO Convention No. 182 and the European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1950) all address forced labour. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Challenges in combating contemporary forms of slavery 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal and policy challenges 
</b></p>
<p>33. There are a number of legal limitations that present challenges in protecting 
individuals from becoming the victims of contemporary forms of slavery. First, some 
countries have failed to ratify the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, 
the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, including El Salvador, 
Liberia and Peru. In other cases, many countries that have ratified the Convention have not 
brought their domestic legislation into line with international standards. Still other countries 
also fail to explicitly define, prohibit or sanction specific forms of slavery, making it 
difficult to prosecute such cases. In Colombia, for example, the law does not specify 
sanctions for forced labour, except in cases involving trafficking in persons, while in 
Philippines, labour experts have noted that many laws prohibiting contemporary forms of 
slavery only cover children, victims of trafficking and victims of forced labour subjected to 
violence or debt bondage.  
</p>
<p>34. Legal loopholes that fail to cover certain categories of workers may also allow for 
their exploitation. This is the case in France and a number of other countries, where labour 
laws do not cover domestic workers (A/HRC/15/20, para. 74). In Guatemala, the law fails 
to provide special protections for agricultural workers and instead includes legislation that 
discriminates against them. It was not until 2011, for example, that the minimum wage for 
agricultural workers was set at the same level as that for workers in other sectors, while 
payments in kind, a remnant of peonage in Guatemala, are still permitted in the agricultural 
sector.26 
</p>
<p>35. Even if prosecutors are able to successfully prosecute cases, penalties and fines are 
often too low to be dissuasive. For example, in Morocco, employers found guilty of using 
forced labour are subject to fines of approximately USD 3,000&#8211;3,500 for a first offence and 
double for a subsequent offence, along with a jail sentence of 6&#8211;90 days.27 However, these 
sanctions are not sufficiently dissuasive. 
</p>
<p>36. Certain countries also have laws that make migrant workers vulnerable to slavery-
like practices. For example, in the Dominican Republic, temporary migrants must be

<p>provided with a &#8220;temporary worker card&#8221;.28 This <i>carnet </i>only allows them &#8220;to perform the 
gainful activity for which they were admitted, for the authorized period of time and within 
the authorized area&#8221;. Migration Law 285-04 stipulates that employers should &#8220;repatriate&#8221; 
workers once their <i>carnets </i>expire, giving employers the authority to deport workers. This 
creates a legal restriction on migrant workers&#8217; freedom of movement, links them to a 
specific employer and creates an inherent menace of penalty of deportation for leaving their 
jobs or workplaces.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional and implementation challenges 
</b></p>
<p>37. There are a number of institutional deficits that may prevent the full enforcement of 
laws against contemporary forms of slavery. Although countries may have ratified laws and 
international conventions that explicitly prohibit and sanction such exploitation, many 
Governments have not taken adequate action to enforce these laws. In some cases, central 
Governments&#8217; failure to recognize the existence of contemporary slavery severely limits 
their enforcement activities. For example, the Government of the Dominican Republic has 
not recognized the existence of forced labour in any economic sector in the country, 
including sugar.29 For this reason, there are no plans or programmes designed to combat the 
abuse.  
</p>
<p>38. In many countries in which slavery occurs, victims are poor, have few political 
connections and have little power to voice their grievances. These communities are 
normally marginalized and discriminated against as a result of their caste, race, gender 
and/or their origin as migrants or indigenous populations. In contrast, perpetrators may be 
wealthy, well-connected individuals who are able to influence policy and enforcement. This 
can result in corruption and a system in which there is little pressure on authorities to take 
action to combat exploitation. In Peru, gold generates tremendous profits and breeds 
corruption at every level, making it extremely difficult to combat labour abuses in illegal 
gold mining, including significant indicators of slavery. Such corruption facilitates the 
continued operation of illegal mines and gold-laundering and frustrates government 
enforcement efforts. In many cases, even when authorities have the will to carry out 
enforcement, they lack the training and resources to adequately do so. 
</p>
<p>39. A lack of resources and low levels of awareness and understanding often manifest 
themselves in deficiencies in labour inspectorates and other public enforcement institutions, 
severely limiting Governments&#8217; ability to detect victims of contemporary forms of slavery. 
For example, one of the biggest factors impeding the ability of the Government of 
Guatemala to protect agricultural workers from exploitation is its deficient labour 
inspection system. Problems facing the Labour Inspectorate include a lack of staff and 
funding, the inability of inspectors to set fines and labour inspectors&#8217; fear of carrying out 
</p>
<p>inspections in the agricultural sector due to high levels of violence in the country.30  
</p>
<p>40. Even in countries in which authorities have the will and resources to combat 
contemporary slavery, they face the difficulty of locating victims. Contemporary forms of 
slavery often involve hidden populations, some of whom perform illicit work. Slavery often

<p>  
 28 According to Article 55, the <i>carnet</i> must contain the following information: the name and photograph 
</p>
<p>of the worker; the type of job they will be carrying out; their country of origin; an identification 
number; their date of birth; gender; date and place of entry; length of stay; extension of stay (if 
relevant); the area where the worker lives and works; the worker&#8217;s signature and fingerprints; and the 
employer&#8217;s name, address, and economic activity.  
</p>

Derechos Econ&#243;micos Sociales y Culturales</i>, 3 November 2011, Geneva, interview with the Director 
of Inspections, Federico Gomera.

<p> 30 See Verit&#233;,<i> Research on Indicators of Forced Labor</i>.  </p>


<p>occurs in isolated areas and access can be challenged or compromised when workers are 
involved in illegal activities, when they are geographically isolated, or when they work in 
violent or politically unstable countries or regions. The challenge of accessing women and 
children can increase in countries with cultural norms that restrict them from having contact 
with outsiders or strangers, or their general freedom of movement. For example, the Special 
Rapporteur has reported that it is difficult to access forced child labourers working in mines 
and quarries located in remote areas (see A/HRC/18/30).  
</p>
<p>41. It can also be difficult to identify victims of contemporary forms of slavery. Unlike 
child labour or dangerous working conditions, in which inspectors may identify victims by 
sight, it is difficult to identify victims of slavery without conducting extensive assessments. 
As most victims may not show visible signs of entrapment, authorities must ascertain 
whether they are being forced to work against their will. They must assess whether workers 
are employed under conditions to which they originally consented and whether there is the 
menace of penalty for leaving their employment. In some cases, a victim of slavery may be 
labouring alongside a freely employed worker. This requires authorities to have a much 
higher level of training, time and resources at their disposal.  
</p>
<p>42. Yet, even when inspectors are trained to identify victims of slavery, many victims 
may be afraid to talk because of threats made against them. This is especially true with 
migrant workers, many of whom are afraid that authorities may harass, detain or deport 
them. In the United States of America, for example, some migrant workers have reported 
that they are afraid to talk to neighbours or unable to do so owing to language barriers. In 
some cases, their employers have threatened to report them to immigration authorities if 
they try to leave.31 
</p>
<p>43. The State&#8217;s ability to enforce the law can also be weak in remote and isolated areas. 
In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, for example, the State had a weak presence in the 
Chaco region, resulting in a failure to comply with ILO Convention No. 29.32<b> </b>In<b> </b>Peru, 
research indicates that the Government&#8217;s capacity to enforce labour and criminal law in 
protected and remote areas is limited by the danger and costliness of entering them. Owing 
to a fear of heavily armed groups operating illegally, the authorities are not able to enter 
protected areas unless they are provided with military support. 
</p>
<p>44. Lack of prosecutions and convictions for contemporary forms of slavery can also be 
a significant problem. One reason for this is poor integration and cooperation among 
government institutions. The Special Rapporteur noted that, during some of her missions, 
there was lack of integration between the criminal, labour and civil law specifically 
addressing forced labour, which impeded enforcement efforts. This lack results in 
inadequate investigations and sanctioning of slavery-like practices. The Special Rapporteur 
has noted that multi-sectoral commissions must have representation from relevant 
concerned government offices in order for them to effectively combat slavery.  
</p>
<p>45. Another challenge in combating contemporary forms of slavery is the failure of 
Governments in some countries to adequately protect victims, while in other countries 
punitive actions by the State can exacerbate worker vulnerability, in some cases forcing 
workers deeper underground and making it harder to detect victims.

consultant as part of this study (2010).  </p>


<p><b> VI. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>46. There has been a series of improvements to legal frameworks on both an 
international and national level that represent best practice in combating contemporary 
forms of slavery. At the national level, a wide range of countries have passed 
comprehensive legislation prohibiting and sanctioning contemporary forms of slavery. For 
example, in 2007 Mauritania passed a law criminalizing slavery. Additionally, in Brazil, 
article 149 of the Penal Code establishes a sentence of between two and eight years&#8217; 
imprisonment for subjecting a person to forced labour, arduous or degrading working 
conditions or holding workers at workplaces through surveillance, debt bondage, restriction 
of movement and retention of personal identification documents or property. The sentence 
is increased by 50 per cent for cases involving children or discrimination based on religion, 
gender or race. Brazilian law also prohibits and penalizes other activities related to forced 
labour, including debt bondage. Nevertheless, owing to the variety of mechanisms used to 
subject individuals to slavery, many countries have also necessarily looked beyond 
traditional laws on forced labour and human trafficking. For example, some have 
established mechanisms to combat exploitative recruitment and hiring practices which 
increase the risk of contemporary forms of slavery. The Contract Act in Bangladesh, for 
example, establishes that all employment contracts must be made with the free consent of 
all parties without coercion, undue influence, fraud or misrepresentation.  
</p>
<p>47. Other countries have also stepped up efforts to regulate private employment 
agencies, as required by ILO Convention No. 181 (1997) concerning Private Employment 
Agencies. In 2011, the Government of Malaysia amended its Employment Act of 1955, 
defining the term &#8220;labour contractor&#8221; and requiring that wages paid to domestic workers be 
</p>
<p>deposited into a bank account, that labour contractors register employees with the Director 
General of Labour and that the termination of foreign workers&#8217; employment be reported to 
the Director General of Labour. This amendment created a new type of legal labour 
relationship between third-party contractors and employees. In the Czech Republic, the 
Employment Act was amended in January 2011 to require the regulation of employment 
agencies. Such agencies must now be insured, pass a criminal record check and report 
statistics on the number and nationality of workers placed in employment.  
</p>
<p>48. A number of countries have also established specific protections for migrant 
workers, many of whom are extremely vulnerable to contemporary forms of slavery. In 
2011, the Czech Republic made several legislative changes to improve protections for 
migrants and reduce their vulnerability to exploitation. The Act on Residence of Foreign 
Nationals was amended to require that employers cover the costs of repatriation when 
foreign nationals exit the country before the expiration of their work permit. Taiwanese law 
requires government oversight of the agencies through which migrant workers are recruited 
in order to ensure that they are not charged excessive service fees.33 In the United Arab 
Emirates, Ministerial Resolution No. 1186 of 2010 allows migrant workers to transfer from 
one employer to another after their contracts expire. In 2007, the Mexican National 
Migration Institute improved labour protections for migrant agricultural workers with the 
intent of regularizing and reducing abuses of migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>49. Some countries of origin of migrant workers have also taken important steps. They 
have established protections for their citizens to reduce the risk of contemporary forms of 
slavery when migrating overseas for employment. The Nepalese Foreign Employment Act 
</p>
<p>  
 33 See Government of China (Taiwan Province of China), Council of Labour Affairs, <i>Council of Labour 
</i></p>
<p><i>Affairs Newsletter</i>, vol. 69 (September 2004).  </p>


<p>of 2007 delineates the role of the Government in the management of overseas employment 
through the regulation of licences for recruitment agencies. It also defines the process of 
recruitment for overseas employment; sets minimum wage, labour contract and insurance 
requirements; requires pre-departure training; and sets procedures for filing complaints. 
However, it failed to cover employment of Nepali migrants in India.34 In May 2012, the 
Government of Nepal announced a policy of mandatory verification of migrant workers&#8217; 
documents by Nepali missions abroad and that it was working with receiving-country 
Governments to establish a minimum salary for Nepali migrant workers in Malaysia, Qatar, 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are amongst the largest employers of 
Nepali workers.  
</p>
<p>50. As business has become increasingly global, the international community has also 
responded by adopting non-binding global frameworks that are addressed to business. For 
example, the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights offer companies guidance 
on key labour and human rights issues relevant to contemporary forms of slavery. These 
principles, which were endorsed by the Human Rights Council in June 2011, cover all 
aspects of human rights, including reference to ILO core labour standards; and provide a 
common, authoritative standard and reference point for mitigating the risk of negative 
human rights impacts.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Enforcement  
</b></p>
<p>51. Alongside the development of new laws, many countries have also taken steps to 
ensure that laws are effectively enforced. This is often more difficult, resource-intensive 
and time-consuming than getting laws passed. However, a number of countries have taken 
efforts to overcome challenges to successfully combat contemporary forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p>52. In order to do so, some sending and receiving countries of migrant workers have 
signed bilateral agreements or memoranda of understanding. Argentina and Peru, for 
example, recently established a Memorandum of Understanding on migrant domestic 
workers (see A/HRC/15/20, para. 82), while a new one for the employment of Indonesian 
maids was signed between the Governments of Indonesia and Malaysia in 2011 to update a 
2006 agreement. This agreement requires an employment contract, sets recruitment fees, 
provides for a weekly day of rest, allows maids to keep their passports and requires the 
month-long training of Indonesian maids prior to entering Malaysia as workers. The 
agreement lifted a two-year ban that Indonesia had imposed on migration to Malaysia for 
domestic work. 
</p>
<p>53. Some countries have developed national strategies or action plans against 
contemporary forms of slavery. These initiatives can take various forms, including high-
level interministerial commissions or new departments within existing government 
agencies. During her missions, the Special Rapporteur has encouraged countries to develop 
national action plans that incorporate country-level efforts into wider regional and 
international initiatives, which should be adapted to each country&#8217;s context, and incorporate 
</p>
<p>all relevant stakeholders. In-country research in Peru indicates that the Ministry of Labour&#8217;s 
new National Plan to Combat Forced Labour for 2013&#8211;2017 includes many of these 
elements, as well as a number of other advances. This new plan includes improved 
definitions of forced labour; explicit acknowledgement of forced labour in the country; a 
baseline study to address a lack of statistics; pilot interventions to combat forced labour; 
and strategic, progressive and measurable goals. In Brazil, the National Commission for the 
Eradication of Slave Labour was established in 2003 to bring representatives of the 
</p>
<p>  
 34 See Narayan Manandhar and Jagnath Adhikari, <i>Study of Issues on the Recruitment of Migrant Labour 
</i></p>
<p><i>in Nepal</i>, submitted to the World Bank Country Office, Nepal (2010).  </p>


<p>legislative, executive and judiciary branches of the Government of Brazil together with 
representatives of the United Nations and civil society to combat contemporary forms of 
slavery. This well-funded, permanent Commission, which is responsible for developing 
national plans to combat slavery and carrying out national awareness-raising campaigns, 
has been considered a leading example of successful efforts to combat slavery.  
</p>
<p>54. One of the most important steps in ensuring the successful implementation of laws 
on contemporary forms of slavery is the provision of training to authorities, including law 
enforcement officers, labour inspectors, judges and immigration officials. Training should 
cover relevant law, victim protection mechanisms and techniques for identifying victims.  
</p>
<p>55. Labour inspectorates and labour courts are extremely important entities, as they are 
on the frontline of detection and sanctioning of contemporary forms of slavery. It is 
therefore essential that they function properly and include measures such as increased fines 
for labour law violations; reduced timelines for processing cases and imposing fines; 
increased funding for the labour inspectorate; provision of police assistance; establishment 
of a unit to verify employer compliance with labour court orders; criminal prosecution of 
employers who fail to comply; and monitoring of enforcement of labour court orders. 
</p>
<p>56. Some countries have also taken action to punish perpetrators of contemporary forms 
of slavery and compensate their victims. In Argentina, in one notable court case, a judge 
ordered the owners of a garment factory that was employing Bolivian workers under 
conditions of forced labour to turn the factory over to the workers.35 In the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia, the Government has confiscated land on which individuals were subject to 
forced labour and turned it over to those who were forced to work on it.36 In 2013, the state 
of S&#227;o Paulo in Brazil passed a law that makes companies liable for contemporary forms of 
slavery in their production chains (including in the operations of their subcontractors). The 
law allows the state government to cancel complicit companies&#8217; tax registration for 10 
years, thereby making it impossible for them to continue operating legally. In May 2013, 
the Governor of S&#227;o Paulo signed a decree enacting the above-mentioned Law 14.946, and 
the Senate of Brazil was considering passing the Proposed Constitutional Amendment 
(PEC) 57A/1999, which allows for the expropriation of the property of companies that have 
subjected workers to contemporary forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p>57. At the regional level, courts have also enforced slavery laws. For example, in 2008, 
Niger &#8211; which had criminalized slavery in 2003 &#8211; was brought before the Economic 
Community of West African States Community Court of Justice, which ruled that Niger 
was responsible for failing to protect 24-year-old Hadijatou Mani from slavery. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Awareness-raising and prevention  
</b></p>
<p>58. One of the most important elements in combating contemporary slavery is 
awareness-raising and prevention. Some countries have set up innovative systems to raise 
awareness of contemporary forms of slavery. For example, in 2009, ILO noted that, as part 
of the National Policy and Plan of Action of Pakistan, the Government incorporated 
information on bonded labour into the curriculum of judicial officials, police and the civil 
service.37  
</p>
<p>  
 35 See Patrick Belser and David Duarte, <i>La eliminaci&#243;n de todas las formas de trabajo forzoso u

(2010). Available from 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>59. There have also been recent awareness-raising campaigns on an international level 
that focus on awareness among global companies. Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) 
has laid out a series of good practice examples on global migration to which businesses 
should adhere. BSR establishes specific standards regarding the legal status of migrant 
workers, worker rights, recruitment, orientation and training, wages and benefits, 
withholding of documents, living conditions, leave, grievance mechanisms, and termination 
and repatriation.38 ILO has also developed a handbook for employers and business on 
forced labour, which seeks to raise their awareness and understanding of the issue.39 
</p>
<p>60. Unions have also become increasingly involved in global initiatives to raise 
awareness of contemporary forms of slavery. For example, the International Union of Food, 
Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers&#8217; Associations has 
recently published a tool for its affiliates on migrant workers&#8217; vulnerability.40 The Italian 
General Confederation of Labour (CGIL) has carried out a mass media campaign to raise 
awareness about slave-like conditions under which workers are employed in the Italian 
agricultural sector. The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines has also set up 
information desks at airports, bus and train stations; shown videos on public transportation; 
and established community education programmes and a website to educate potential 
victims on risks of contemporary forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p>61. Consumer-based initiatives and public awareness campaigns have also begun to 
focus on contemporary forms of slavery. The International Organization for Migration 
&#8220;Buy Responsibly&#8221; campaign looks at consumer products like cocoa, coffee, sugar and 
</p>
<p>shrimp, and identifies how each of these can be linked to forced labour in global supply 
chains.41 The Slavery Footprint campaign personalizes modern-day slavery by asking 
consumers &#8220;how many slaves work for you?&#8221; It raises awareness about the effects of each 
person&#8217;s consumption, including products such as electronics, food, apparel and other 
</p>
<p>household items.42 Finally, the Free2Work application for mobile phones provides 
consumers with information about specific products and how they relate to modern-day 
slavery. It rates companies based on their anti-slavery commitments, assigning them a letter 
grade from &#8220;A&#8221; to &#8220;F&#8221; to inform consumers and promote ethical consumerism.43 
</p>
<p><b> D. Victim identification, protection and rehabilitation  
</b></p>
<p>62. Despite the progress that has been made in recent years, awareness-raising and 
prevention have not been fully effective and victims of contemporary forms of slavery still 
abound. This requires the identification, protection and rehabilitation of victims.  
</p>
<p>63. The identification of victims is greatly aided by strengthening the capacity of labour 
inspectorates and other public institutions, such as police and immigration authorities, and 
by raising the awareness of authorities regarding laws on contemporary forms of slavery 
and techniques for identifying victims. The creation of specialized units to identify victims 
is also crucial. In the Czech Republic, a special police department aimed at uncovering 
forced labour was established in April 2006.44 Brazil also offers an important and highly

<p>64. Government measures to ensure that victims receive full protection and support 
when they are identified are also important. Such measures guarantee that perpetrators do 
not retaliate against victims for reporting abuses and help those victims to feel safe 
whenever they do report. Victims and their family members may be provided with safe 
houses, protection services and legal assistance. To this end, some countries have 
established specific protections for workers. For example, in Guatemala, article 10 of the 
Labour Code prohibits any form of reprisals against workers that are intended to completely 
or partially restrict them from exercising their legal rights.  
</p>
<p>65. In addition to identifying and protecting victims, Governments have also taken steps 
to rehabilitate them and reintegrate them into communities and labour markets. Victims 
may need psychological counselling to overcome the trauma they have experienced; they 
may also need compensation, social support, job training, social welfare and assistance with 
finding new employment to ensure that they do not fall prey to slavery again.  
</p>
<p>66. Nevertheless, Government-run rehabilitation and reintegration efforts are not always 
effective. In these cases, other stakeholders can offer assistance. Unions and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) in sending and receiving countries have cooperated in 
order to facilitate the reintegration of victims when return home. In Nepal, where 
government reintegration services have been limited, two NGOs rehabilitate and reintegrate 
returned migrant workers. Pouraki Nepal was initiated by women migrant workers, while 
Pravasi Nepali Coordination Committee advocates for the rights of male migrants. In-
country research in Nepal also indicates that a new foundation to aid migrant workers has 
been established, with a free training centre in Kathmandu that helps rehabilitate and 
reintegrate returned migrant workers, including a counselling centre for female returnees.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Multi-stakeholder initiatives  
</b></p>
<p>67. In cases in where Governments are unwilling or unable to take action to combat 
contemporary forms of slavery or where complex problems require the coordinated action 
of multiple stakeholders, new initiatives have been formed to tackle these issues. While 
national authorities are the primary entities responsible for combating slavery, other 
stakeholders have recently emerged to aid their efforts, including intergovernmental 
organizations, unions, NGOs and companies. 
</p>
<p>68. ILO followed this up in October 2008 with the publication of its handbook for 
employers on <i>Combating Forced Labour</i>, which sought to &#8220;encourage a broad partnership 
approach to the fight against forced labour and trafficking through the active engagement of 
business actors in global action&#8221; (p. 7). 
</p>
<p>69. Unions have also been active in combating contemporary forms of slavery. For 
example, the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) established a best practice 
manual for trade unions on <i>How to Combat Forced Labour and Trafficking</i> in order to 
&#8220;provide trade unionists and other interested individuals and organisations with a useful 
tool for increasing awareness of what forced labour is and how it can be effectively 
challenged&#8221;.45  
</p>
<p>70. A large number of NGOs have taken up the fight against contemporary forms of 
slavery and engaged other stakeholders to successfully do so. For example, Anti-Slavery 
International has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with ITUC in order to form a 
</p>
<p>  
 45 ITUC, <i>How to Combat Forced Labour and Trafficking: Best practices manual for trade unions</i>, </p>
<p>(Brussels, 2009), p. 10.  </p>


<p>Global Trade Union Alliance to Combat Forced Labour and Trafficking. They have agreed 
to share skills and experience on combating contemporary forms of slavery and integrate 
their members to reach a common goal. Under this auspice, they have formed a multi-
stakeholder group in Europe comprised of unions and NGOs whose goal is to protect 
women and young people from contemporary forms of slavery. The Brazilian NGOs 
Rep&#243;rter Brasil and Ethos have created the National Pact for the Elimination of Slavery, 
which brings the Government, ILO, NGOs and companies together to combat forced 
labour. Over 130 companies had signed the pact as of the end of 2010, including large 
companies such as Wal-Mart Brazil, committing to not buying goods produced with forced 
labour. 
</p>
<p>71. There have also been successful cases in which international associations of 
employers and employment agencies have established agreements with other stakeholders 
in order to improve efforts to combat contemporary forms of slavery. For example, the 
International Confederation of Private Employment Agencies signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding with the Global Union for Skills and Services in 2008. This Memorandum 
established a global partnership with other stakeholders to combat contemporary forms of 
slavery, policy advocacy and cooperation with ILO to encourage ratification and 
application of ILO conventions. 
</p>
<p>72. Some countries have taken proactive efforts to form multi-stakeholder initiatives to 
ensure more effective efforts to combat contemporary forms of slavery. This includes 
multi-stakeholder committees responsible for combating contemporary forms of slavery, 
which include members of civil society. These committees are important in holding 
Governments accountable for enforcing laws on contemporary forms of slavery. In cases in 
which the Government fails to carry out its commitments, it is necessary for these 
stakeholders to engage the media, form alliances and mobilize public support in order to 
exert pressure on the authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Sourcing 
</b></p>
<p>73. Recently, stakeholders have made efforts to influence the sourcing decisions of 
companies and national and local governments in order to reduce the level of contemporary 
forms of slavery. It is now generally accepted that Governments are responsible for 
preventing contemporary forms of slavery and holding companies accountable &#8211; whether a 
product is produced in the country, manufactured by a company based in the country or 
imported and consumed by its citizens. Additionally, civil society organizations have also 
taken steps to promote responsible sourcing decisions and have provided guidance to 
companies on ways to prevent contemporary forms of slavery in their supply chains.  
</p>
<p>74. Some Governments in countries that produce goods associated with contemporary 
forms of slavery have taken steps to publicize and punish individuals and companies that 
produce these goods. For example, Brazil passed a decree in 2003 containing a list, 
commonly referred to as &#8220;the Dirty List&#8221; of 52 individuals and entities that use or have used 
slave labour. The individuals and entities on the biannually updated list are barred from 
receiving national subsidies or tax exemptions and from engaging in financial arrangements 
with a number of public financial institutions. The Bank of Brazil denies financing to 
landowners who employ slave labour and the Ministry of National Integration 
recommended that private sector lenders also deny them financing. The Ministry of 
Labour&#8217;s &#8220;dirty list&#8221; included 165 employers of slave labourers in 17 states in 2009, 220 
</p>
<p>employers in 2010 and 294 employers at the end of 2011.  
</p>
<p>75. In other cases, Governments have taken efforts to reward companies that take 
positive steps to combat contemporary forms of slavery, including by offering access to 
State contracts. In Argentina, the National Institute for Industrial Technology recently 
established a comprehensive national certification system for companies operating in the </p>


<p>textile industry. The agency offers &#8220;certificates of quality&#8221; to firms that refrain from using 
forced labour and provide their employees with decent working conditions. Participating 
companies granted the certificate are eligible to bid on lucrative State textile contracts. In a 
similar spirit, the Plurinational State of Bolivia operates a certification programme called 
the Triple Seal, which is designed to encourage compliance with national labour laws and 
awarded to companies that prohibit child labour, discrimination and forced labour across 
their entire supply chains. 
</p>
<p>76. Consumer countries and countries in which companies are headquartered have also 
taken action to prevent contemporary forms of slavery. In the United States, the California 
Transparency in Supply Chains Act, which took effect on 1 January 2012, states that human 
trafficking and forced labour are state, federal and international crimes. The Act requires 
that all retailers and manufacturers with annual worldwide revenues in excess of USD 100 
million disclose information about their efforts to eradicate contemporary forms of slavery 
from their supply chains so that consumers&#8217; purchasing decisions can be better informed. 
These disclosures must be posted on the companies&#8217; websites and include information 
</p>
<p>about efforts to eradicate slavery from their supply chains, including verification, supplier 
audits, certifications, accountability standards and training. Failure to disclose this 
information by 30 November 2012 could allow for legal actions brought by the Attorney 
General of California.  
</p>
<p>77. Of course, companies are ultimately responsible for meeting their legal and moral 
obligations to prevent contemporary forms of slavery in their supply chains, and NGOs and 
multi-stakeholder initiatives have emerged to provide practical guidance to companies 
seeking to meet their obligations under national law, international standards and voluntary 
principles. The Fair Hiring Toolkit, developed by Verit&#233; and launched in 2011, gives 
companies comprehensive guidance on improving their codes of conduct, strengthening 
their social audits, and better understanding the complexities and risks of contemporary 
forms of slavery in their supply chains. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>In recent years, contemporary slavery has drawn increasing attention from 
Governments and stakeholders around the world, although this attention remains 
</b></p>
<p><b>insufficient to the task of its eradication. A number of international instruments have 
</b></p>
<p><b>defined and prohibited, inter alia, debt bondage, serfdom, servile marriage, child 
</b></p>
<p><b>slavery, forced labour and traditional forms of slavery.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>A number of stakeholders have begun to take action to combat slavery in its 
contemporary forms. However, there are key challenges that prevent the reduction of 
</b></p>
<p><b>slavery, including legal and policy challenges and institutional and implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges. Among the legal and policy challenges are the absence of legislation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>some countries, deficiencies and loopholes in legal frameworks, insufficiently 
</b></p>
<p><b>dissuasive sanctions and laws that increase the vulnerability of workers. Institutional 
</b></p>
<p><b>and implementation challenges include corruption, government failure to recognize 
</b></p>
<p><b>the existence of contemporary slavery, a lack of political will and/or resources, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>difficulty of locating and identifying victims, and a failure to adequately protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected workers and provide sustained programmes for their effective rehabilitation.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Nevertheless, a series of good practices at international, regional, and country 
levels provide us with examples of the way forward. Among these are improvements 
</b></p>
<p><b>to legislation, enforcement efforts, awareness-raising and prevention activities, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the identification, protection and rehabilitation of victims. The Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>held follow up workshops in Brazil, Ecuador, Mauritania and Peru which resulted in 
</b></p>
<p><b>action plans to implement her recommendations. Her recommendations included the </b></p>


<p><b>need to include and strengthen these good practices and show the commitment and 
</b></p>
<p><b>will of Governments to tackle slavery. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Multi-stakeholder initiatives and recent efforts to encourage responsible 
sourcing to protect workers also have the potential to strengthen the global fight 
</b></p>
<p><b>against slavery.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Slavery and slavery-like practices are often clandestine. The majority of those 
affected are from the poorest, most vulnerable and marginalized social groups in 
</b></p>
<p><b>society such as indigenous and caste-based groups. In order to effectively eradicate 
</b></p>
<p><b>such exploitation in all its forms, Governments and other stakeholders must address 
</b></p>
<p><b>the root causes of poverty, social exclusion and all forms of discrimination. At the 
</b></p>
<p><b>heart of these campaigns, poverty reduction, the promotion of the Millennium 
</b></p>
<p><b>Development Goals, the protection of human dignity and the establishment of robust 
</b></p>
<p><b>protections against human and labour rights abuses, including effective access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedy, should guide national and international strategies.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>To strengthen global efforts, the following recommendations are made to 
Governments, international organizations and businesses. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations to Governments 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>To successfully combat contemporary forms of slavery, Governments should 
consider the good practices identified above and the recommendations presented 
</b></p>
<p><b>below.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Governments should introduce or amend, where necessary, laws to effectively 
combat exploitation; strengthen implementation and enforcement; harmonize 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislative and policy approaches to ensure greater coherence, efficiency and efficacy; 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop and effectively monitor and implement national plans of action; introduce 
</b></p>
<p><b>specialized agencies or institutions with the specific mandate to tackle contemporary 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of slavery; and ensure all such efforts are appropriately resourced and staffed.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Governments should promote and ensure access to basic rights such as 
education, work and health for all living within their country.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>To detect and remedy contemporary forms of slavery, Governments should 
improve the capacity of labour inspectorates and other public enforcement bodies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide them with adequate resources and training; enable them to carry out their 
</b></p>
<p><b>duties in regions and sectors where individuals are vulnerable; and establish systems 
</b></p>
<p><b>to effectively verify legal compliance, payment of fines and adherence to remediation 
</b></p>
<p><b>orders.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Governments should also ensure that other institutions and stakeholders are 
appropriately resourced and trained to detect, report and prosecute cases, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>by providing:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Training for labour ministries, police, prosecutors, judges, NGOs, 
</b></p>
<p><b>service providers and health workers;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Establishing effective and reliable systems for reporting cases and 
</b></p>
<p><b>referring victims to support services;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Promoting greater public awareness of contemporary forms of slavery 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the labour and human rights of workers and citizens; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Providing victims with free legal assistance, compensation, social 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection, and long-term strategies for community and labour-market reintegration, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including vocational training and job placement services. </b></p>


<p>89. <b>Governments must create long-term and nationwide awareness campaigns to 
disseminate information about relevant laws and risks of slavery, and mechanisms to 
</b></p>
<p><b>detect, report and combat it must be widely disseminated to all stakeholders, not just 
</b></p>
<p><b>to workers. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations to international agencies and donors 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Supporting the engagement of national Governments should be a priority for 
the international community and donor agencies.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>To effectively tackle the contemporary forms of slavery, Governments at 
national and sub-national levels need sustainable, reliable and systematic assistance 
</b></p>
<p><b>both of a technical and financial kind.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>International agencies can assist Governments to develop strong legal and 
regulatory frameworks or revise existing frameworks, and promote the 
</b></p>
<p><b>mainstreaming of policies against contemporary slavery, including across ministries 
</b></p>
<p><b>and mandates such as poverty reduction, education, labour, social protection, health, 
</b></p>
<p><b>trade, immigration and internal affairs.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>International organizations should also support government efforts to build law 
enforcement capacity within public institutions; raise awareness of relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders; build broad-based support for policies to eliminate contemporary 
</b></p>
<p><b>slavery; develop and implement measures to assist victims of exploitation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecute perpetrators; and lead mobilization efforts for further financing and 
</b></p>
<p><b>support.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Without sustained assistance from the international donor community, national 
Governments will lack the resources they need to effectively challenge the diverse and 
</b></p>
<p><b>complex forms of abuse described in the present report. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Recommendations to businesses 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Businesses must also take action both inside and outside of their supply chains. 
They need to find creative and effective ways to work with business peers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>partners, NGOs, trade unions, Governments and international organizations.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Companies should engage with other actors across their industries and sectors; 
advocate for global action on contemporary forms of slavery both unilaterally and 
</b></p>
<p><b>through membership or multi-stakeholder organizations; adopt codes of conduct and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other corporate policies that explicitly prohibit forced labour and contemporary 
</b></p>
<p>slavery; ensure that these policies are integrated throughout the company&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>management and performance systems; train all relevant staff, suppliers and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>business partners on contemporary forms of slavery, and ensure that actions are 
</b></p>
<p><b>taken beyond the first tier of the supply chain, where risks are greatest; and carry out 
</b></p>
<p><b>risks assessments, audits and other forms of due diligence to determine, identify and 
</b></p>
<p><b>root out any potential risk of exploitation. 
</b></p>
