IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY.
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) became law in April 2012. The
Partnership is an “emerging growth Company” as defined in the JOBS Act, and it is eligible for
certain exemptions from, or reduced disclosure obligations relating to, various reporting
requirements that usually apply to public companies.
These exemptions include, among others, not being required to comply with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, any requirements adopted by
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) which require mandatory audit
firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor must provide additional
information about the audit and the issuer’s financial statements, nor with new audit rules
adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012, unless the SEC determines otherwise. The
Partnership has not yet decided whether to use any or all of the exemptions.
Additionally, under Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an “emerging growth company” is eligible for
the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the
“Act”) to comply with new or revised accounting standards. This means an “emerging growth
company” can delay adopting certain accounting standards until those standards otherwise
become applicable to private companies. However, the Partnership is electing to “opt out” of that
extended transition period, and therefore will comply with new or revised accounting standards
on the dates the standards are required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the
JOBS Act provides that the Partnership’s decision to opt out of the extended transition period for
compliance with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
The Partnership could continue to be an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of:
(i)
the last day of the first fiscal year in which it has total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or
more;
(ii)
the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of its
units pursuant to its prospectus and Registration Statement with the SEC;
(iii)
the date that it becomes a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), which would occur if the market value
of its units held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million, measured as of the last business day
of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter; or
(iv)
the date on which it has, during the preceding three year period, issued more than $1 billion in
non-convertible debt.
The Partnership anticipates that it will continue to be an emerging growth company until the
termination of the five year period described in (ii), above.

MDS ENERGY PUBLIC 2013-A LP
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2016
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
On May 3, 2012 (date of inception), MDS Energy Public 2013-A LP (Partnership), a Delaware
limited partnership, was formed for the purpose of drilling developmental natural gas wells. The
Partnership has a maximum 50-year term, although the Partnership intends to terminate when all
of the wells invested in by the Partnership become uneconomical to continue to operate, which
may be approximately 15 years or longer. The Partnership was formed by MDS Energy
Development, LLC (MDS), a related party, as the Managing General Partner (MGP) and M/D
Gas, Inc. (M/D), a related party. In accordance with the terms of the limited partnership
agreement, the MGP is authorized to manage all activities of the Partnership and initiates and
completes substantially all transactions.
In our opinion, the accompanying condensed financial statements contain all adjustments
necessary for a fair presentation of the Partnership’s financial statements for interim periods in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.
GAAP) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC.
Accordingly, pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain notes and other financial information
included in audited financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The information
presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the
Partnership’s audited financial statements and notes thereto included in its 2015 Form 10-K. The
results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of
operations to be expected for the full year.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Proved Property Impairment - The Partnership assesses its producing natural gas properties for
possible impairment, upon a triggering event, by comparing net capitalized costs to estimated
undiscounted future net cash flows on a well by well basis using estimated production based
upon prices at which the Partnership reasonably estimates the commodities to be sold.  The
estimates of future prices may differ from current market prices of natural gas.  Certain events,
including but not limited to, downward revisions in estimates to the Partnership’s reserve
quantities, expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs, could result in a
triggering event and, therefore, a possible impairment of the Partnership’s proved natural gas
properties.  If net capitalized costs exceed undiscounted future net cash flows, the measurement
of impairment is based on estimated fair value utilizing a future discounted cash flows analysis,
which is predominantly unobservable data or inputs, and is measured by the amount by which
the net capitalized costs exceed their fair value.  Estimated undiscounted future net cash flows
are determined using prices from the forward price curve at the measurement date.  Estimated
discounted future net cash flows are determined utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate that is
based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in
the development of the underlying natural gas reserves.  Due to the decrease in natural gas
prices, as further discussed in Note 4, the Partnership reviewed its proved natural gas properties
for impairment at June 30, 2016 and did not recognize an impairment charge for the second
quarter 2016.  The Partnership has an accumulated impairment charge of proved natural gas
properties of approximately $11,810,700 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Asset Retirement Obligations - The Partnership applies the provisions of “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations” and “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” and
accounts for asset retirement obligations by recording the fair value of its plugging and
abandonment obligations when incurred, which is at the time the well is completely drilled. Upon
initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the Partnership increases the carrying amount
of the long-lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the asset retirement
obligations are accreted, over the estimated life of the related asset, for the change in their
present value. The initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets,
through charges to depreciation, depletion and amortization. If the fair value of the estimated
asset retirement obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement
obligation and the asset retirement cost. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from
revisions of estimated inflation rates, escalating retirement costs and changes in the estimated
timing of settling asset retirement obligations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements - In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting
Standards Board issued their converged standard on revenue recognition that provides a single,
comprehensive model that entities will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and
timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue
to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be
entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The standard outlines a five-step approach to
apply the underlying principle: (a) identify the contract with the customer, (b) identify the separate
performance obligations in the contract, (c) determine the transaction price, (d) allocate the
transaction price to separate performance obligations and (e) recognize revenue when (or as)
each performance obligation is satisfied. The revenue standard is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting
period, and can be adopted under the full retrospective method or simplified transition method.
Early adoption is not permitted. The Partnership plans to adopt the revenue standard beginning
January 1, 2018 and is currently evaluating the impact that these changes will have on our
condensed financial statements.
5
In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15, Disclosures
of Uncertainties About an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, new guidance related
to the disclosures around going concern. The new standard provides guidance around
management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s
ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The new
standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted.
NOTE 3 - CONCENTRATION OF RISK
Accounts Receivable - This Partnership’s accounts receivable are from purchasers of natural gas
production. The Partnership sells substantially all of its gas production to a customer who
purchases from other Partnerships managed by the Partnership’s MGP. Inherent to the
Partnership’s industry is the concentration of natural gas sales to a limited number of customers.
This industry concentration has the potential to impact the Partnership’s overall exposure to
credit risk in that its customers may be similarly affected by the changes in economic and
financial condition, commodity prices and other conditions.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership did not record an allowance for
doubtful accounts. In making the estimate for receivables that are uncollectible, the MGP
considers, among other things, subsequent collections, historical write-offs and overall
creditworthiness of the Partnership’s customers. It is reasonably possible the estimate for
uncollectable receivables will change periodically. Historically neither MDS nor any of the other
Partnerships managed by the Partnership’s MGP, have experienced uncollectable accounts
receivable. The Partnership did not incur any losses on accounts receivable for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.
NOTE 4 - PARTICIPATION IN COSTS AND REVENUES
For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, approximately $129,000 of gross revenue from the sale of
natural gas had been received or estimated for approximately 99,000 MCF at an average price of
$1.30 per MCF. Royalties for this period were approximately $13,000. In addition approximately
$88,700 of gross revenue from the sale of natural gas had been recorded as revenue as a result
of the Partnership estimating revenue not yet received, which is 65,000 MCF at an average price
of $1.37. These amounts are recorded as accounts receivable net of royalties approximating
$79,500. The total estimate of expenses to be deducted from those amounts is approximately
$63,300, which are typically transportation, well maintenance and lease operating expense.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2015, approximately $69,400 of gross revenue from the sale of
natural gas had been received or estimated for approximately 46,700 MCF at an average price of
$1.49 per MCF. In addition approximately $128,000 of gross revenue from the sale of natural gas
had been recorded as revenue as a result of the Partnership estimating revenue not yet received,
which is 93,400 MCF at an average price of $1.37. These amounts are recorded as accounts
receivable net of royalties approximating $14,000. The total estimate of expenses to be deducted
from those amounts is approximately $73,000, which are typically transportation, well
maintenance and lease operating expenses.
NOTE 5 - PARTNERS’ CAPITAL
The Partnership Agreement provides that MDS shall review the accounts of the Partnership at
least monthly to determine whether cash distributions are appropriate and the amount to be
distributed, if any.
The Partnership Agreement provides for the enhancement of investor cash distributions if the
Partnership does not meet a performance standard defined in the agreement during the first 8
years of operations beginning the earlier of the first full year of operation after all wells begin
production or 12 months after the final closing of the Partnership. In general, if the cumulative
distributions to the investors is less than 10% of their subscriptions for years 1 through 5 and
7.5% of their subscriptions for years 6 through 8, MDS will subordinate up to 60% of its share, as
MGP, of Partnership gross production revenues. As a result of the trend of lower revenue per
MCF that the industry is currently experiencing, the MGP has subordinated 60% of it revenue
interest beginning in August 2014 and continuing through June 2016. During the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, MGP subordinated $11,633
and $51,002, respectively, which was distributed to investors. The MGP’s share of expenses
exceeds its share of revenue, due to the subordination, thus, the MGP is not currently receiving
distributions and owes the Partnership approximately $31,000 and $19,500 which is included
with Accounts Receivable from Managing General Partner at June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 respectively.
6
NOTE 6 - TRANSFERS AND PRESENTATIONS
There is no established public trading market for the Partnership’s units and the Partnership does
not anticipate that a market for the Partnership’s units will develop. The Partnership’s units may
be transferred only in accordance with the provisions of the Partnership Agreement which
require:
●the MGP may require an opinion of counsel that registration under applicable federal and state
law is not required;
●the transfer not result in materially adverse tax consequences to the Partnership; and
● the transfer must not contravene any terms of the Partnership Agreement.
An assignee of a unit may become a substituted partner only upon meeting the following
conditions:
● the assignor gives the assignee the right;
●the assignee pays to the Partnership all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
substitution; and
the assignee executes and delivers the instruments, which the MGP requires to effect the
substitution and to confirm his or her agreement to be bound by the terms of the Partnership
Agreement.
●
A substitute partner is entitled to all of the rights of full ownership of the assigned units, including
the right to vote.
Investor Partners may request that the MGP repurchase their units at any time beginning with the
fifth anniversary after December 31, 2013 provided that certain conditions are met. The
repurchase price is set at the greater of the partner’s share of (i) predominantly 70% of the
Partnership’s present worth of future net revenues from the proved reserves as determined under
the last reserve report and is reduced by an amount equal to all of the Partnership’s debts or (ii)
an amount equal to three times the total amount of distributions paid by the Partnership to the
participant during the previous twelve months. The MGP is also permitted to adjust the purchase
price under certain conditions for changes occurring after the date of the presentment request.
Repurchase requests are fulfilled by the MGP on a first-come, first-served basis and may not
exceed 5% of the total units outstanding. The MGP may suspend the presentment feature at any
time if it determines that it does not have sufficient cash flow or it is unable to borrow funds on
terms it deems reasonable. As of June 30, 2016 the MGP has not repurchased any limited
partnership units.
NOTE 7 - NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES
The Partnership is engaged solely in natural gas activities, all of which are located in Armstrong
County, Pennsylvania. Costs capitalized for these activities are as follows:

 $ 654,303
During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Partnership recorded an Asset Retirement
Obligation of $131,698 and incurred an Accretion expense of $2,068 for the same period.
The above accretion expense is included in depreciation, depletion and amortization in the
Partnership’s statement of operations. As of June 30, 2016 the Partnership’s estimate of the costs
to plug it’s wells was $60,000, which has increased from it’s initial assessment at June 30, 2015
of $21,000 due to better data available in regards to plugging of vertical Marcellus wells. The
Partnership’s asset retirement obligation is measured using a discount rate of 5.57% and
estimated useful lives of 4.8 to 20 years.

NOTE 9 - RELATED-PARTY ACTIVITIES
MDS, through entities under common ownership, performs well services for the Partnership and
is paid at competitive rates for these services. In addition, gathering, transportation and gas
marketing is provided by Snyder Brothers, Inc. (“Snyder Brothers”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Snyder Associated Companies, Inc. Snyder Associated Companies, Inc. is controlled by the
father and uncle’s of Michael D. Snyder who is Chief Executive Officer and President of the MGP
and the sole shareholder of MDS Associated Companies, Inc., the parent company of the MGP.
Mr. Snyder is a minority shareholder of Snyder Associated Companies, Inc. The MGP also
receives a fully accountable reimbursement for actual administrative costs. As of June 30, 2016
and 2015 the Partnership paid MDS approximately, $28,800 respectively in each period for well
maintenance fees related to the revenue producing wells and this amount is included in the due
to managing general partner account on the balance sheet. The Partnership also has an accrued
liability of approximately $76,000 and $82,000 due to the MGP as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.
NOTE 10 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
This Partnership's fair value measurements were estimated pursuant to a fair value hierarchy that
requires this Partnership to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, giving
the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in
different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these cases, the lowest level input that is significant
to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value
hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its
entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the
valuation of the assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
The carrying value of the financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities
approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The MGP utilizes fair value, on a non-recurring basis, to perform impairment testing on this
Partnership's natural gas properties by comparing net capitalized costs, or carrying value, to
estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. If net capitalized costs exceed undiscounted future
net cash flows, the measurement of impairment is based on estimated fair value and is measured
by the amount by which the net capitalized costs exceed their fair value, which is generally
determined using the discounted cash flows.
The fair values were determined using the income approach and were based on the expected
present values of the future cash flows from proved reserves. Significant level 3 assumptions
associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment analysis
included estimates of production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of
reserves, appropriate risk – adjusted discount rates and other relevant data.
NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Environmental
Due to the nature of the natural gas industry, the Partnership is exposed to environmental risks
through the services provided to it by affiliated companies.
The affiliated companies have various policies and procedures to avoid environmental
contamination and mitigate the risks from environmental contamination. The affiliated companies
conduct periodic reviews to identify changes in their environmental risk profile. Liabilities are
accrued when environmental assessments and/or clean-ups are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. The MGP is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of June 30,
2016. However, there can be no assurance that current regulatory requirements will not change
or unknown past noncompliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the
Partnership’s properties.
Legal
Neither the Partnership nor the MGP are party to any pending legal proceeding that the MGP
believes would have a materially adverse effect on the Partnership’s business, financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Overview
Business of the Partnership, the Managing General Partner and Certain Relationships
The Partnership drilled development wells which means a well drilled within the proved area of a
natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. Only vertical
natural gas wells in the Marcellus Shale area in western Pennsylvania were drilled. The
Partnership Agreement governs the rights and obligations of the partners. The investment return
will depend solely on the operations and success or lack of success of the Partnership.
The Partnership has been formed as a limited partnership under the Delaware Revised Uniform
Limited Partnership Act. 1,508.53 units have been sold for an aggregate price of $15,001,000.
The MGP of the Partnership is MDS, a Pennsylvania limited liability company which also serves
as MGP of ten private drilling partnerships, in the aggregate.
The gas marketing is handled by Snyder Brothers. The MGP receives fees and profits in
connection with the Partnership’s business.
Governance
The Partnership has no executive officers and currently does not have any directors. Because
the Partnership itself does not employ any persons, the MGP has determined that the Partnership
will rely on a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics adopted by the MGP that applies to the
executive officers, employees and other persons performing services for the MGP.
The MGP, on behalf of the investor members, is currently evaluating the deregistering of the
Partnership in an effort to reduce direct costs to the Partnership.
Conflicts of Interest
Conflicts of interest are inherent in natural gas and oil partnerships involving non-industry
investors because the transactions are entered into without arms’ length negotiation. The
interests of the investors and those of the MGP and its affiliates may be inconsistent in some
respects, and the MGP’s actions may not be the most advantageous to investors.
The Partnership does not directly employ any of the persons responsible for its management or
operation. Rather, the personnel of the MGP manage and operate the Partnership’s business,
and they will also spend a substantial amount of time managing the business and affairs of the
MGP’s other affiliates, which creates a conflict regarding the allocation of their time between the
Partnership’s business and affairs and the MGP’s other business interests. In this regard, the
Partnership’s policies and procedures for reviewing, approving or ratifying related party
transactions with the MGP are set forth in the partnership agreement. Due to the family
relationship between Mr. Snyder and the principals and certain executive officers of Snyder
Brothers, transactions between Snyder Brothers and its affiliates and the Partnership are subject
to similar restrictions and conditions as transactions between the Partnership and affiliates of the
MGP.

Natural Gas Sales
The Partnership currently uses the “net-back” method of accounting for arrangements related to
its commodity sales. This Partnership sells commodities at the wellhead and collects a price and
recognizes revenues based on the wellhead sales price as transportation costs downstream of
the wellhead are incurred by the purchaser and reflected in the wellhead price.
As of June 30, 2016, all of the aggregate capital from our offering of the units has been
expended; fourteen wells have been completed and are producing revenue. As of June 30, 2016,
approximately $167,000 of gross revenue from the sale of natural gas had been received for
approximately 138,000 MCF of production with an average realized price of $1.21 per MCF. In
addition approximately $88,700 of gross revenue from the sale of natural gas had been recorded
as revenue as a result of the Partnership estimating revenue from production for which the
proceeds of the sale of the natural gas had not yet been received and those amounts are
recorded as accounts receivable. The average realizable price per MCF for this estimated
revenue is $1.36 per MCF for estimated production of 65,000 MCF of production.
Natural gas pricing is predominately driven by the supply and demand in the physical and
financial markets. Natural gas is sold under various purchase contracts with monthly pricing
provisions based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials. Natural gas prices vary by locality,
depending upon the distance to markets, availability of pipeline capacity and supply and demand
relationships in that region. The Marcellus shale region, where this production is derived from,
has a negative price differential making the prices we are realizing lesser than NYMEX.
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period for 2015 natural gas
production decreased approximately 19% as a result of the Partnership wells depleting inline
with normal depletion curves during the six month period ended June 30, 2016. Additionally,
there was a decrease in the average price per MCF for the six month period ended June 30,
2016. The average price per MCF for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was approximately
$1.26 compared to $1.79 per MCF for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
For the three month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period for 2015 natural
gas production decreased approximately 30%, due to the normal decline associated with these
wells. Additionally, there was a slight decrease in the average price per MCF for the three month
period ended June 30, 2016. The average price per MCF for the three months ended June 30,
2016 was approximately $1.31 compared to $1.41 per MCF for the same period in 2015.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership recognized approximately
$129,000 of gross revenue from the sale of approximately 99,000 MCF’s as compared to
approximately $198,000 of gross revenue from the production of 140,000 MCF’s of production in
the three month period ended June 30, 2015. The three month gross revenues from June 30,
2016 compared to the same period in 2015 decreased approximately 35% while the average
price per MCF decreased 7%.
Natural Gas Production Costs
Generally, natural gas production costs vary with changes in total natural gas production
volumes. In addition, general field services and all other costs vary and can fluctuate based on
services required, but are expected to increase as wells age and require more extensive repair
and maintenance. These costs include water hauling and disposal, equipment repairs and
maintenance, snow removal, environmental compliance and remediation and service rig
workovers. Production costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were approximately
$78,200, compared to the same period in 2015 natural gas production costs decreased
approximately $7,800. A factor in the decrease of natural gas production cost was associated
with some of the wells being classified as stripper wells and thus the impact fees that were being
paid on said wells has stopped being assessed during 2016.
Natural gas production costs for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same
period in 2015 decreased approximately $51,000. A factor in this decrease is similar as to what is
discussed above and in a direct result of these wells being classified as stripper wells and not
being required to submit impact fee payments.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was approximately $79,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 from production of 202,800 MCFs, compared to the same period in
2015 which has an expense of $344,000 from production of 272,600 MCFs. The DD&A expense
rate per MCF is estimated to be $0.39 for 2016 as compared to $1.26 for 2015. The decrease is
due to the impairment charge recognized during the third and fourth quarters of 2015.
DD&A expense related to natural gas properties is directly related to proven reserves and
production volumes. DD&A expense decreased approximately $149,000 for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to a decrease in
production volumes, and the decreased DD&A rate.
10
Direct costs - general and administrative
Direct costs slightly increased for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the
same period in 2015. Direct cost for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 was
approximately $29,000. Direct costs are professional fees and other miscellaneous
administrative expenses of the Partnership.
Direct costs for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015
increased $6,000 due to an increase in professional fees and other miscellaneous administrative
expenses of the Partnership.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Partnership’s primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operating activities.
Fluctuations in this Partnership’s operating cash flows are substantially driven by changes in
commodity prices and sales volumes. This source of cash has been primarily used to fund this
Partnership’s operating costs, direct cost-general and administrative, capital program and
distributions to the investors and the MGP.
The Partnership’s future operations are expected to be conducted with available funds and
revenues generated from natural gas production activities. Natural gas production from existing
properties is generally expected to continue a gradual decline in the rate of production over the
remaining life of the wells. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production
revenues, advances or waiving/suspending of fees from the MGP.
Working Deficit
At June 30, 2016, the Partnership had working deficit of $(48,400), compared to working deficit of
$(17,000) at December 31, 2015. The decrease of $31,400 between June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase of professional fees, impact fees and well
maintenance expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016. At the current time, the MGP
has permitted the Partnership to not reimburse the MGP for certain expenses until market
conditions become more favorable that amounted approximately $120,000 and $57,000 at June
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively. Should the MGP require payment before that time
the Partnership may be unable to do so. In addition, the MGP has informed the Partnership that it
may be able to borrow funds from the MGP on a limited basis to sustain its operating activities.
The MGP has subordinated distributions thus creating and accounts receivable balance on the
balance sheet, this accounts receivable balance will be relieved once the subordination period
ends pursuant to the Private Placement Memorandum or an increase is pricing is recognized.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
The Partnership's cash flows from operating activities in the second quarter of 2016 were
primarily impacted by commodity prices, operating costs, professional fees and reduced
production.
Net cash flows from operating activities were $44,050 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $199,534 for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease in cash from operating
activities was primarily due to a decrease in natural gas pricing and production.
Financing Activities
The Partnership distributed $30,684 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 for the comparable
period in 2015 the Partnership distributed $199,876. During the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, the MGP subordinated $11,633 and $5,012, respectively, which was distributed to
investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of the Partnership’s financial condition is based upon the
Partnership’s condensed balance sheets, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The Partnership will base its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, and the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. The Partnership will evaluate its estimates on an on-
going basis.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A
discussion of significant accounting policies the Partnership has adopted and followed in the
preparation of its financial statements is included within “Notes to Financial Statements” in Part I,
Item 1, “Financial Statements” in this quarterly report and in its Form 10-K dated March 14, 2016.

ITEM 4.          CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The MGP on behalf of the Partnership, with the participation of the MGP’s management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and President and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016. The
term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and
other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Partnership’s
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in
evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Under the supervision of the MGP’s Chief Executive Officer and President, and Chief Financial
Officer, the MGP has carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the
MGP’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and President and the Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, at June 30, 2016, the Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting for the
Partnership during the three months ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting.
As an emerging growth company, the Partnership is exempt from the requirement to obtain an
attestation report from the Partnership’s independent registered public accounting firm on the
assessment of the Partnership’s internal controls pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
until 2018, or such time that the Partnership no longer qualifies as an emerging growth company
in accordance with the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.
PART II OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.          LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The MGP is not aware of any legal proceedings filed against the Partnership.
Affiliates of the MGP are party to various routine legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course
of their collective business. The MGP’s management believes that none of these actions,
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the MGP’s or Partnership’s
financial condition or results of operations.
