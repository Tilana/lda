NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Note 1: Basis of Preparation    
The financial report has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and interpretations issued by the 
Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act 2001.
The financial report has been prepared on an accruals basis and is based on historical costs except as modified by revaluation of 
certain non-current assets and, except where stated, does not take into account either changing money values or current valuations of 
non-current assets. Cost is based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange for assets. 
 
Note 2: Going Concern Basis 
 
The Company and controlled entities (the Group) generated an operating loss after income tax of $458,130 and net cash outflows from 
operations of $541,397 in the year ended 30 June 2016. At 30 June 2016 the Group had net assets of $1,766,899 and cash balances 
of $479,089. 
 
These matters give rise to a material uncertainty that may cast doubt whether the Group can continue as a going concern and realise 
its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the ordinary course of business and at the amounts stated in the Financial Statements. The 
continuing viability of the Group and its ability to continue as a going concern and meet its debts and commitments as and when they 
fall due are dependent upon the Group being successful in the following:
  Commercialisation of the Optiflox® System with resultant increased product sales and technology leasing fees; 
 

The raising of sufficient capital by way of either additional debt and/or equity capital; and  
The receipt of proceeds from the sale of non-core assets.
The Directors are of the opinion that sufficient additional funding will be secured and are themselves likely to participate in any future 
equity capital raising. The Financial Report has therefore been prepared on the basis of a going concern.  This basis presumes that 
funds from the above sources will be available to finance future operations, and to repay liabilities and that the realisation of assets and 
settlement of liabilities will occur in the normal course of business.   
 
However, the Directors note that if sufficient funds are not raised through the abovementioned sources, the going concern basis may 
not be appropriate with the result that the group may have to realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities other than in the ordinary 
course of business and in amounts different from those stated in the Financial Report.
Note 3: Accounting Policies  
The Appendix 4E does not include notes of the type normally included within the annual financial report and therefore cannot be 
expected to provide as full an understanding of the financial performance, financial position and the financing and investing activities of 
the Group as the full financial report. The Appendix 4E should be read in conjunction with the Half-Year Financial Report of the Group 
as at 31 December 2015 and the Annual Financial Report of Intec, due to be released in September 2016, for the year ended 30 June 
2016. It is also recommended that the Appendix 4E be considered together with any public announcements made by the Group since 
commencement of the 2015/16 financial year on 1 July 2015 in accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations arising under the 
Corporations Act, 2001. 
 
Note 4: Material Factors Affecting the Revenues and Expenses of the Economic Entity for the Current Year 
On 22 August 2016, the Company announced that it had agreed a six-month extension to the term i.e. to 28 February 2017, of its 
option to acquire the remaining 50% of Science Developments Pty Ltd. 
 
No other matters or circumstances have arisen since 30 June 2016 that have significantly affected or may significantly affect the 
Group’s operations in future financial years, or the results of those operations in future financial years, or the Group’s state of affairs in 
future financial years.  
 
There are no franking credits available. The Company is not expected to declare a dividend in the short term.
Compliance Statement  
 
The financial report is based on accounts which are in the process of being audited.
