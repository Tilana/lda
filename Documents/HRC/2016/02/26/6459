<p><i> Recalling</i> resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 1980 of the Commission on Human

Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced

</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the adoption of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/177 of 
20 December 2006, and recognizing that its entry into force as soon as possible through its 
ratification by 20 States will be a significant event, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> in particular by the increase in enforced or involuntary disappearances 
in various regions of the world, including arrest, detention and abduction, when these are part of 
or amount to enforced disappearances, and by the growing number of reports concerning 
harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of witnesses of disappearances or relatives of persons 
who have disappeared, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the fact that acts of enforced disappearance are crimes against humanity, as 
defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,<b>1 </b></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> resolutions 2004/40 of 19 April 2004 and 2005/27 of 19 April 2005 of the

<p> (<i>c</i>) To prevent the occurrence of enforced disappearances, including by guaranteeing 
that any person deprived of liberty is held solely in officially recognized and supervised places of 
detention, guaranteeing access to all places of detention by authorities and institutions whose </p>

 <p></p>

</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To make provisions in their legal systems for victims of enforced or involuntary

<p> (<i>d</i>) To address the specific needs of the families of disappeared persons; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 6. <i>Reminds</i> States that:

<p> (<i>a</i>) As proclaimed in article 2 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearances, no State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced 
disappearances; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) All acts of enforced or involuntary disappearance are crimes punishable by 
appropriate penalties, which should take due account of their extreme seriousness under criminal 
law;

impartial inquiries in all circumstances where there is reason to believe that an enforced 
disappearance has occurred in territory under their jurisdiction; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) If there is reason to believe that an enforced disappearance has occurred in territory 
under their jurisdiction, all the perpetrators of that disappearance must be brought to justice; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Impunity is simultaneously one of the underlying causes of enforced disappearances 
and a major obstacle to the elucidation of such cases; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) As proclaimed in article 11 of the Declaration, all persons deprived of liberty must be 
released in a manner permitting reliable verification that they have actually been released and, 
further, have been released in conditions in which their physical integrity and ability fully to 
exercise their rights are assured;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses</i>: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Its thanks to the many Governments that have cooperated with the Working Group 
and replied to its requests for information and to the Governments that have accepted visits of 
the Working Group to their countries, requesting them to give all necessary attention to the 
</p>
<p>Working Group&#8217;s recommendations and inviting them to inform the Working Group of any 
action they take on those recommendations; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Its appreciation to the Governments that are investigating, cooperating at the 
international and bilateral levels, and have developed or are developing appropriate mechanisms 
to investigate any claims of enforced disappearance that are brought to their attention, and 
encourages all Governments concerned to expand their efforts in this area; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites</i> States to take legislative, administrative, legal and other steps, including when 
a state of emergency has been declared, at the national and regional levels and in cooperation 
with the United Nations, if appropriate through technical assistance, and to provide the Working

preventing enforced and involuntary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set

those organizations to continue their cooperation; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to continue: 
</p>
