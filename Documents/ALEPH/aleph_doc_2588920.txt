The accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed consolidated financial
statements.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at June 30,
2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be
read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's
December 31, 2015 audited financial statements. The results of operations for the periods ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.
NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN
The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the
realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company
has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and
allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until
it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to
cease operations.
In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional
capital resources. Management's plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining
capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating
expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any
assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to
successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure
other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern.
NOTE 3 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
F-5
NOTE 3 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements included all of the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, C2R, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, and Jett Rink Oil,
LLC, a Kansas Limited Liability Company. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of
the Company’s financial statements. The Company’s management believes that these recent
pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and financial instruments which mature within
six months of the date of purchase.
Oil and Gas Properties
The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties. Under
this method, all acquisition, exploration and development costs, including certain payroll, asset
retirement costs, other internal costs, and interest incurred for the purpose of finding oil and
natural gas reserves, are capitalized. Internal costs that are capitalized are directly attributable to
acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include costs related to
production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Costs associated with production
and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. Proceeds from the sale of
oil and natural gas properties are applied to reduce the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas
properties unless the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and
proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
Capitalized costs associated with impaired properties and capitalized costs related to properties
having proved reserves, plus the estimated future development costs, and asset retirement costs
under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) Topic 410 “Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations” (FASB ASC 410), are
amortized using the unit-of-production method based on proved reserves. Capitalized costs of oil
and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and deferred income taxes, are
limited to the total of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves,
discounted at ten percent, plus the cost of unevaluated properties.  Under certain specific
conditions, companies could elect to use subsequent prices for determining the estimated future
net cash flows. The use of subsequent pricing is no longer allowed. There are many factors,
including global events that may influence the production, processing, marketing and price of oil
and natural gas. A reduction in the valuation of oil and natural gas properties resulting from
declining prices or production could adversely impact depletion rates and capitalized cost
limitations. Capitalized costs associated with properties that have not been evaluated through
drilling or seismic analysis, including exploration wells in progress at June 30, 2016, are
excluded from the unit-of-production amortization. Exclusions are adjusted annually based on
drilling results and interpretative analysis.
F-6
NOTE 3 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Oil and Gas Properties (Continued)
Sales of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to the net full cost pool
with no gain or loss recognized, unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship
between capitalized costs and proved reserves. If it is determined that the relationship is
significantly altered, the corresponding gain or loss will be recognized in the statements of
operations.
Costs of oil and gas properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method. For the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $-0- and $-0-, respectively, of
depletion expense related to oil and gas production during the period.
Ceiling Test
In applying the full cost method, the Company performs an impairment test (ceiling test) at each
reporting date, whereby the carrying value of property and equipment is compared to the value of
its proved reserves discounted at a ten percent interest rate of future net revenues, based on
current economic and operating conditions, plus the cost of properties not being amortized, plus
the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties included in costs being amortized,
less the income tax effects related to book and tax basis differences of the properties.  During the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $-0- and $-0-, respectively, of
impairment expense in connection with the full cost ceiling test calculation.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues from the sale of oil and natural gas are recognized when the product is delivered at a
fixed or determinable price, title has transferred, and collectability is reasonably assured.  For oil
sales, this occurs when the customer takes delivery of oil from the operators’ storage tanks.
Earnings (Loss) per Share
The Company has adopted ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share,” (“EPS”) which requires presentation
of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital
structures, and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS
computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In the
accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net
income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period. The Company had 1,200,000 potential dilutive shares of common stock as of June 30,
2016 that were excluded as their effect was anti-dilutive.
NOTE 4 – OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES
On April 3, 2014, the Company signed an election to participate in the first of three wells with
Toto Energy, LLC in Cowley County, Kansas. The Company will earn a 30 percent working
interest and a 24.45 percent net royalty interest in the well. The Company capitalized $213,000 of
cash payments made to commence operations development of the well.
F-7
NOTE 4 – OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES (Continued)
On May 10, 2014, the Company signed an election to participate in the second of three wells with
Toto Energy, LLC in Cowley County, Kansas. The Company will earn a 30 percent working
interest and a 24.45 percent net royalty interest in the well. The Company capitalized $189,000 of
cash payments made to commence operations development of the well.
Oil and gas properties are stated at cost. The Company recognized impairment expense totaling
$404,837 during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, oil and gas properties, net consisted of the following:

NOTE 5 – CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE
On January 3, 2014, the Company received $600,000 in connection with a convertible note
financing commitment, the terms of which call for the Company to receive three tranches of
$200,000 each on a callable convertible note wherein the Company borrows the sum at five
percent interest for one year and the investor can elect to continue to receive the interest on the
note or have the Company issue the investor shares of common stock of the Company at $0.50
per share to retire the debt. The notes came due on December 12, 2014, and as of June 30, 2016
the notes were in default. At June 30, 2016 accrued interest on the notes totaled $74,575.
NOTE 6 – NOTES PAYABLE
On May 6, 2015 the Company borrowed $5,000 from an unrelated third-party entity. Pursuant to
the terms of the note, the principal accrues interest at a rate of five percent per annum, is
unsecured, and is due in full on May 6, 2016. At June 30, 2016 accrued interest on the note
totaled $288.
NOTE 7 – NOTES PAYABLE – RELATED PARTY
On June 11, 2015 the Company borrowed $5,000 from a related-party entity. Pursuant to the
terms of the note, the principal accrues interest at a rate of five percent per annum, is unsecured,
and is due in full on June 11, 2016. Subsequent to the initial borrowing the Company borrowed
an additional $35,000 from the same lender under the same terms. At June 30, 2016 the total
outstanding principal balance due to the lender was $40,000, and aggregate accrued interest on
the notes totaled $1,203.
On March 7, 2016 the Company borrowed $10,000 from a related-party. Pursuant to the terms of
the note the principal accrues interest at a rate of five percent per annum, is unsecured, and is
due in full on May 6, 2017. On May 2, 2016 the Company borrowed an additional $4,000 under
the same terms. At June 30, 2016 accrued interest on the notes totaled $190.
F-8
NOTE 8 – ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
The total future asset retirement obligation is estimated by management based on the
Company’s net working interests in all wells and facilities, estimated costs to reclaim and
abandon wells and facilities and the estimated timing of the costs to be incurred in future periods.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company estimated the undiscounted cash flows
related to asset retirement obligation to total approximately $105,500. The actual costs to settle
the obligation are expected to occur in approximately 25 years. Through June 30, 2016, the
Company established an asset retirement obligation of $9,860 for the wells acquired by the
Company, which was capitalized to the value of the oil and gas properties. The fair value of the
liability at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is estimated to be $11,722 and $11,915,
respectively, using a risk free rate of 9.31 percent and inflation rates between 3.87 and 4.81
percent. Total accretion expense on the asset retirement obligation was $381 and $349 for the
six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
NOTE 9 – STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT
The Company has 1,000,000 preferred shares authorized at a par value of $0.001 and
74,000,000 common shares authorized at par value of $0.001.  As of June 30, 2016 the
Company has 42,013 shares of preferred stock and 42,728,159 shares of common stock issued
and outstanding.
NOTE 10 – RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company owed its Chief Financial Officer $22,000
and $16,000, respectively, in accrued director fees. An additional $8,000 was owed to the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer in accrued director fees and notes payable.
NOTE 11 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company became party to a legal action brought
about by an unrelated third-party individual, wherein the plaintiff alleges the Company
“participated and/or conspired in a scheme to disseminate spam emails” which were misleading
in order to encourage individuals to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at an
artificial and/or inflated stock price. As of June 30, 2016, the matter remains in the discovery
stage; however, the Company deems the matter to be frivolous and will vigorously defend itself in
the matter. The Company’s legal counsel calculates the probability of a negative outcome to be
minimal; therefore the Company has not accrued any reserve for potential damages pursuant to
this matter.
NOTE 12 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In accordance with ASC 855-10, Company management reviewed all material events through
the date of this report and there are no material subsequent events to report.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.
This 10Q contains certain forward-looking statements and our future operating results could differ
materially from those discussed herein. Such forward-looking statements involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance
or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We disclaim any
obligation to update any such factors or to announce publicly the results of any revisions of the
forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.
Going Concern
The future of our company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future
profitable operations from the sale of products and services through our websites. Management
has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its

report dated April 13, 2016 included in our annual report on Form 10-K because uncertainties
raise doubts about the Issuers ability to continue as a going concern.
Corporate Overview
Unless otherwise indicated, in this 10Q, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” “TGRO”
refer to Tiger Oil and Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (formerly UTEC, Inc.). Future plans
include the exploration, development and production of oil and gas in the United States. Our
current focus is to secure financing to increase our holdings and develop our current oil and gas
assets over the next twelve months.
The Company through its acquisition of Jett Rink LLC owns interests in two oil and gas wells for
approximately 50 acres located in Creek County, State of Oklahoma, together with any personal
property and lease equipment located thereon. These two wells are shut-in and produce no
revenue.
On April 9, 2014 we elected to partner with TOTO Energy LLC and drill our first well on the
Cowley County leases. The Company paid $24,000 for a 30% WI in the Stalnaker lease and
agreed to spend $239,000 for our share of drilling costs of the Stalnaker 17-1 well. (paid). The
operator intends to frac this well in the late spring of 2015.
On May 10, 2014 we elected to partner with TOTO Energy LLC and drill our second well on the
Cowley County leases. The Company holds a 30% WI in the DeFore lease and agreed to spend
$189,000 for our share of drilling costs of the DeFore 19-1 well. (paid). This well was fracked and
is producing oil and revenue to the Company, although due in part to low oil prices the DeFore
well did not produce or earn revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Our current focus is to secure financing to increase our holdings and develop our current oil and
gas assets over the next twelve months.
For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016, and 2015
Revenues
Revenues for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 were $-0-, compared to $4,341 for the
comparable period of 2015. This decrease resulted from a decrease in the oil and gas production
from the Company’s Defore 19-1 well that commenced during 2015. No oil and gas was
produced during the three months ended June 30, 2016, due in part to low oil prices. As oil prices
increase the Company anticipates increased production and revenues will be derived from the
DeFore well.

Revenues

Other Income (Expenses)
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized interest expense

amounts of $54,205 and $43,535, respectively. The increased net loss was largely the result of

been through the sale of common stock. Such funding that is required to maintain liquidity will
come in the form of equity sales of common stock.
Cash used in operations totaled $33,520 and $23,072 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash used in operations results primarily from an

2016 and 2015, respectively.

Not applicable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of June 30, 2016 under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a — 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of
Sec. 240.13a-15 or 240.15d-15 the disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.
The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed under the securities Exchange Act,
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that this
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS.
There was no change in our internal controls or in other factors that could affect these controls
during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect
our internal control over financial reporting.
The Company has not taken any steps at this time to address these weaknesses but will
formulate a plan before fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.
PART II - Other Information.
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company became party to a legal action brought
about by an unrelated third-party individual, wherein the plaintiff alleges the Company
“participated and/or conspired in a scheme to disseminate spam emails” which were misleading
in order to encourage individuals to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at an
artificial and/or inflated stock price. As of June 30, 2016, the matter remains in the discovery
stage; however, the Company deems the matter to be frivolous and will vigorously defend itself in
the matter. The Company’s legal counsel calculates the probability of a negative outcome to be
minimal; therefore the Company has not accrued any reserve for potential damages pursuant to
this matter.
