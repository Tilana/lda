<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This is my third thematic report to the Human Rights Council in my capacity as the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, submitted pursuant 
to Human Rights Council decision 1/102, and resolution 7/24. Chapter I highlights my activities 
in 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, and Chapter II addresses the political economy of women&#8217;s 
human rights. 
</p>
<p> The current political economic order, too often neglected in the analyses of women&#8217;s 
human rights, profoundly affects both the prevalence of violence against women and efforts to 
eliminate it. Women&#8217;s physical security and freedom from violence are inextricably linked to the 
material basis of relationships that govern the distribution and use of resources and entitlements, 
as well as authority within the home, the community and the transnational realm. Cultural 
rationales for limiting or negating women&#8217;s rights are thus, grounded in particular economic 
interests and power dynamics.  
</p>
<p> Preventing violence against women and ensuring gender equality in a neoliberal global 
environment requires a holistic approach to women&#8217;s human rights beyond the current 
dichotomized treatment of rights into civil and political on the one hand, and economic and 
social on the other. Unless women&#8217;s agency is recognized and their capabilities supported 
through social, economic and political empowerment the human rights they are promised will 
remain abstract concepts. This report identifies how the economic and social rights inherent in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are directly linked to women&#8217;s socio-economic 
security and their capacity to assert their will and resist violence. 
</p>
<p> Nowhere in the world do women share equal social and economic rights or equal access 
to productive resources. The neoliberal policy environment and the proliferation of armed 
conflicts, often caused by struggles to control power and productive resources, have set back 
women&#8217;s access to such resources and increased their exposure to violence. Conflicts, as well as 
post-conflict and post humanitarian crisis situations, often build on prevailing gender, class, and 
ethnic inequalities - deepening some and/or creating new ones in the process; thus reconfiguring 
entitlement structures, which rarely benefit women.  
</p>
<p> Yet, although globalization, conflicts and the current economic recession hold new risks 
for women and challenges for human rights protection, they also offer new opportunities for 
taming globalization and patriarchy. Particularly the unprecedented entry of women into paid 
employment with global restructuring has created new contradictions with the potential to 
rupture the long-standing structures of inequalities that perpetuate women&#8217;s subordination. 
</p>
<p> The report concludes with recommendations to Governments and non-State actors on ways 
to enhance women&#8217;s enjoyment of the full range of their rights; as a key strategy for the 
prevention, the protection and prosecution of violence against women. To this end, the report 
calls for gender-aware/competent governance and joint international responsibility for the 
integration of initiatives to end violence against women in the context of the larger struggle for 
social and economic equality within the human rights movement. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In my capacity as Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, I hereby submit my third report to the Human Rights Council pursuant to 
Human Rights Council decision 1/102 and resolution 7/24. In Chapter I, I summarize my 
activities in 2008 and until 31 March 2009; and in Chapter II, I discuss the political economy of 
women&#8217;s human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. I draw the attention of the Council to the addenda to the present report. Addendum 1 
contains summaries of alleged human rights violations related to violence against women, its 
causes and consequences, which were brought to the attention of Governments concerned, and 
Government responses. Addendum 2 is a report on my mission to Tajikistan; Addendum 3, on 
my mission to Saudi Arabia, and Addendum 4, on that to the Republic of Moldova; Addendum 5 
contains a review of the last 15 years of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women; and Addendum 6, contains the research on the political economy of women&#8217;s 
rights, which provides a basis for the present report.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><b>ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Fact-finding missions 
</b></p>
<p>3. In 2008, I visited Saudi Arabia (4-13 February), Tajikistan (15-23 May), and the Republic 
of Moldova (4-11 July) at the invitation of the Governments concerned. From 31 October 
to 1 November 2008, together with the European Parliament Rapporteur on Women&#8217;s Rights in 
Turkey, I undertook a two-day visit to Turkey at the invitation of the Government in order to 
assess the provision of shelters for women victims of violence, including those trafficked. 
Although there have been significant efforts in recent years to respond more effectively to 
violence against women in Turkey, the number of safe houses remain insufficient. Furthermore, 
there are discrepancies in the conceptual approach to shelters and the standard of services 
provided as well as in monitoring. 
</p>
<p>4. An invitation and dates for a mission were also set with the Government of Kyrgyzstan, 
which I unfortunately had to postpone, but which I hope can be rescheduled. I have also made 
requests to the Governments of Jordan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to visit those countries.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>5. On 24 October 2008, I addressed the Third Committee of the General Assembly. I 
informed the Assembly of the findings contained in my 2007 mission reports and my preliminary 
observations from the country visits carried out in 2008. I also drew attention to my annual 
report which addressed the importance of indicators on violence against women and State 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  I would like to thank Professor Jacqui True, at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, for 
</p>
<p>her research on the political economy of women&#8217;s rights, as contained in Addendum 6. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>response and reiterated my interest in continuing my collaboration with all relevant stakeholders 
on this issue, and in providing support to the United Nations Statistical Commission, which the 
General Assembly mandated to develop indicators on violence against women. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Regional consultations 
</b></p>
<p>6. As in previous years, I attended regional consultations with non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs). I am pleased to report that three such consultations were held in 2008. 
</p>
<p>7. From 17 to 19 September 2008, I attended the &#8220;Non-Governmental East European 
and Central Asian Regional Consultation&#8221;, which was held in St. Petersburg. From  
15-16 October 2008, I attended a regional consultation with NGOs from the Asia-Pacific region, 
in New Delhi, India, which was held jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, and focused on violence against 
indigenous women in Asia and the Pacific region.  
</p>
<p>8. From 5 to 6 December 2008, I attended the &#8220;Regional Consultations on Violence against 
Women in the Context of Conflict in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa Region&#8221;, which were 
held jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and took 
place in Nairobi. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Other meetings 
</b></p>
<p>9. Throughout 2008, and during the first quarter of 2009, I participated in numerous events in 
my capacity as Special Rapporteur, some of which are listed below.  
</p>
<p>10. From 21 to 26 January 2008, I attended meetings and consultations on the fight against 
impunity and justice for women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, held in Montreal and 
in New York; from 27 February to 1 March 2008, the fifty-second session of the Commission 
on the Status of Women in New York and a number of events organized by Governments, 
United Nations entities and NGOs. On 27 and 28 March 2008, I participated in the annual board 
meeting of the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development in Geneva. From 6 to 
8 May 2008, I convened an expert consultation in Istanbul, in conjunction with my thematic 
report on political economy of women&#8217;s human rights (referred hereafter as &#8220;expert 
consultation&#8221;), which was made possible with support from the United Nations Population 
Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), and Bilgi 
University. I also attended from 4 to 6 August the Economic and Social Commission for Asia 
and the Pacific (ESCAP) forum on women&#8217;s empowerment and the meeting of Women&#8217;s 
Empowerment in the Muslim Context Consortium advisory group (WEMC-CAG), in Bangkok; 
from 7 to 11 September 2008, a panel on sexual violence in conflict zones, in Cologne; and 
on 12 September 2008, a conference organized in Stockholm by the Swedish International 
Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) on gender-based violence. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>11. On 5 and 6 November 2008, I held a series of meetings with key Catalan authorities and 
organizations in Barcelona, and made a presentation at the Human Rights Forum on Gender and 
International Relations, on advances in international legislation on violence against women 
(VAW) since the Beijing Conference; on 19 November 2008, a keynote speech at a conference </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>on the impact of VAW on the family, in Doha, Qatar; and a presentation on recent trends and 
emerging forms of VAW to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Conference on Parliamentary 
Responses to VAW, held from 2 to 4 December 2008 in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>12. In the first three months of 2009, I participated in the following: 21 January, a 
Genocide Expert Seminar in Geneva, where I highlighted the gender impact and dimensions of 
this grave crime; after which I engaged in a dialogue with the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women. I made a keynote speech at a global meeting of Musawah on 
equality and justice in the Muslim family, held from 13 to 15 February in Kuala Lumpur. On 
17 February, I attended a workshop on medical and legal responses to VAW, in Alexandria; 
from 2 to 6 March, the fifty-third session of the Commission on the Status of Women, where I 
reported on my activities, informed the Commission on my thematic report for this year. I also 
took part in a number of events organized by NGOs and United Nations agencies, including a 
panel discussion on the occasion of the United Nations commemoration of International 
Women&#8217;s Day, and another on enhancing gender advocacy and the cooperation between NGOs 
and the United Nations human rights system.  
</p>
<p>13. The latest engagements which I undertook during the last months of my mandate include 
participation in: the Second Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations in Istanbul (6-7 April); the 
Durban Review Conference in Geneva (21-23 April); public hearing on women in Turkey at the 
European Parliament in Brussels (30 April); conference on democracy and gender equality in the 
Muslim world, at the University of Chicago Law School (8-9 May); and the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe meeting of national contact parliamentarians, in Istanbul 
(15 May 2009).  
</p>
<p><b>E. Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
and Occupied Palestinian Territory 
</b></p>
<p>14. Following Human Rights Council resolutions 7/20 and S-8/1, I contributed to the 
&#8220;Combined report of seven thematic special procedures on technical assistance to the 
Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and urgent examination of the 
situation in the east of the country&#8221;, which was submitted to the Council at its tenth session 
(A/HRC/10/59). In my review of the situation of VAW in the country since my official visit in 
July 2007, I reported with regret that VAW remains rampant throughout the country even where 
war has ended, as does the lack of care and the conditions of extreme poverty for survivors.  
</p>
<p>15. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-9/1 on grave violations of human rights in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) particularly due to the recent Israeli military attacks 
against Gaza, I also reviewed the situation of VAW in the OPT since my official visit there 
in 2005 and in the aftermath of the military attacks. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Communications and press releases 
</b></p>
<p>16. During the reporting period and as of 2 April 2009, I sent 93 communications bringing 
alleged human rights violations to the attention of Governments. As of 27 April 2009 I received 
38 government replies to communications. An analysis of these communications can be found in 
Addendum 1. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. In 2008 and until 31 March  2009, I issued, often jointly with other Special Rapporteurs, 
press releases on various occasions, including on: International Women&#8217;s Day on 8 March 
in 2008 and 2009; United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture  
(26 June 2008); with regard to the serious human rights violations in Eastern Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (28 November 2008); in relation to the ongoing crackdown on women&#8217;s 
rights defenders in the Islamic Republic of Iran (27 November 2008); with regard to the 
situation in Zimbabwe in the aftermath of the 29 March parliamentary and presidential elections 
(29 April 2008).  
</p>
<p><b>II.  POLITICAL ECONOMY OF WOMEN&#8217;S HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>18. The current report follows from my report on &#8220;The due diligence standard as a tool for the 
elimination of violence against women&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/61), where cultural discourses and global 
economic restructuring were identified as major challenges to the achievement of gender 
equality and to the elimination of VAW. Cultural discourse was the theme of my report in 2007 
entitled &#8220;Intersections between culture and violence against women&#8221; (A/HRC/4/34), which 
argued that<b> </b>a viable strategy in addressing the issue of culture and VAW must include a political 
economy perspective in order to understand the link between culture and relations of power and 
domination. The present report aims in part to respond to that need.<b>2</b> The report is also relevant 
in the context of the current global economic crisis, which is predicted to have a disproportionate 
negative impact on women and girls.  
</p>
<p>19. Using a political economy approach, the report aims to analyse the challenges of the 
neoliberal policy environment and go beyond mere distributional aspects of the differential 
access to economic and social rights, and to identify discriminatory policies, practices and 
entitlement structures that determine the gendered manifestations of these rights. The report also 
addresses the long-standing feminist critique of the dichotomization between the &#8220;first 
generation&#8221; and &#8220;second generation&#8221; rights as contained in the twin Covenants.<b>3</b>  
</p>
<p>20. The political economy approach avoids the compartmentalization and selective treatment 
of VAW that disconnects the problem from its underlying causes and consequences. It provides a 
framework for States and other actors to realize their obligations to prevent violations and 
protect and fulfil women&#8217;s human rights whether in good times or bad.

</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on violence against women (E/CN.4/2000/68; E/CN.4/2001/73); reports from 
United Nations and other international institutions, civil society organizations and research 
institutes; on an expert consultation and online discussion forum; and responses to questionnaires 
sent to Governments and non-State actors. See Annex for lists of Governments and 
persons/organizations who participated in the questionnaire or consultations.

Press, 1994, pp. 85-115. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>21. In the first section of the report, I consider the parameters of a political economy approach 
and the limitations of the current human rights paradigm and practice in recognizing and 
responding to the socio-economic conditions that underlie gender-based discrimination and 
violence. In the second section, I examine the interconnections between specific social and 
economic rights and women&#8217;s vulnerability to violence. This is followed by a discussion of the 
implications of global processes such as neoliberal economic policies, armed conflict, natural 
disasters and other crises as well as reconstruction efforts on existing gender inequalities and 
risks of VAW. The report ends with recommendations on ways to ensure women are able to 
achieve their full human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  A political economy approach 
</b></p>
<p>22. The international human rights framework has been slow to address women&#8217;s human 
rights. The bias towards violations of human rights in the public sphere tended to privilege male 
victims and their authority in the private sphere. As a result, women were excluded from redress 
under international human rights law and the principle of non-discrimination in the protection, 
prevention and enjoyment of human rights failed to be upheld. Further compounding the 
gendered bias of the public-private dichotomy, violations of women&#8217;s rights have often been 
subject to both relativist and essentialist cultural discourses that overlook unequal and potentially 
exploitative hierarchical systems and treat women&#8217;s rights as expendable.  
</p>
<p>23. Responses to VAW by governments and international institutions have been fragmented 
and treated in isolation from the wider concern for women&#8217;s rights and equality. Despite the fact 
that article 3 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights requires 
States to ensure women&#8217;s enjoyment of their economic and social rights, governments rarely 
integrated socio-economic factors into their legislative and policy responses to VAW. &#8220;When 
one thinks of women&#8217;s human rights issues, one usually thinks about VAW and not about 
poverty, housing, unemployment, education, water, food security, trade and other related 
economic and social rights issues.&#8221;<b>4</b> Thus the detachment of VAW within the human rights 
movement from the broader struggle for social and economic equality has led to its perception as 
women&#8217;s only problem.<b>5</b>  
</p>
<p>24. In its &#8220;in-depth study on violence against women&#8221;, the Secretary-General has noted the 
lack of a comprehensive and integrated approach to VAW (A/61/122/Add.1). This is evident, for 
example, in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) which do not explicitly identify 
elimination of VAW as a distinct goal. Similarly, although the Secretary-General UNITE 
campaign launched to end gender-based violence by 2015 mentions the structural, underlying

 <p> 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences of violence, the campaign fact sheet does not explore the linkages 
between the achievement of women&#8217;s rights to political participation, their degree of social and 
economic equality and the prevalence of the problem.<b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>25. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, on the other hand, 
has recognized the linkages between VAW, and more specifically trafficking, domestic violence 
and exploitation, and women&#8217;s lack of enjoyment of economic and social rights in many of their 
comments on State reports. The Committee has also expressed concern about the effects of the 
current international financial and economic crisis upon the full realization of the rights of 
women and girls worldwide, including the potential increase in violence against them.<b>7</b>  
</p>
<p>26. According to the International Labour Office (ILO), the impact of the economic crisis is 
expected to be more detrimental to women&#8217;s employment than to men&#8217;s in most regions of the 
world.<b>8</b> Women migrant and domestic workers have already been among the first to be laid off, 
reflecting their location in part-time, flexible and vulnerable work, as well as gender biases that 
consider women&#8217;s labour as dispensable.<b>9</b> Women&#8217;s concentration in export sectors such as 
manufacturing and high-value agriculture, the drop in remittances from migrant women&#8217;s care 
work and the tightened conditions for microfinance lending to women farmers and entrepreneurs 
are also expected to adversely affect women&#8217;s incomes and livelihoods.<b>10</b> The World Bank 
predicts that up to 53 million more people will be driven to poverty in developing countries this 
year, bringing the total number of those living on less than $2 a day to over 1.5 billion. This will 
seriously jeopardize the achievement of the MDGs which aim to slash poverty, hunger, infant 
and maternal mortality, and illiteracy by 2015. These worrisome signs are likely to result in 
serious setbacks to the realization of gender equality and elimination of VAW.

formatted.pdf). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Key elements of a political economy approach to violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>27. In contrast to conventional economics, a political economy approach makes explicit the 
interconnections between the economic, social and political realms, demonstrating that power 
operates not only through coercion but also through the structured relations of production and 
reproduction that govern the distribution and use of resources, benefits, privileges and authority 
within the home and society at large. Political economy interacts with, alters and reconfigures 
the institutional and ideological formations of society where gender identities and statuses are 
shaped and the boundaries of rights and freedoms demarcated.  
</p>
<p>28. There are three key structural elements highlighted by the<b> </b>political economy approach that 
affect the likelihood and prevalence of VAW.  
</p>
<p>29. First is the sexual-division of labour within the public and private spheres, supported by 
gender ideologies that hold women primarily responsible for unremunerated, and often invisible 
unpaid work in the household, thus creating inequalities in bargaining power in the household 
between men and women. Caring professions in the public sphere and labour market akin to the 
unpaid care work women traditionally do in the home are also devalued. The internationalization 
of reproductive work has extended this division of labour to the transnational realm as women 
from developing countries migrate to provide care services for families in wealthier countries.<b>11</b> 
The strict division of roles in the domestic sphere constrains women&#8217;s public participation and 
their access to economic opportunities in the market, thus creating hierarchical structures that 
entrap many women into potentially violent environments. 
</p>
<p>30. The second element highlighted in the political economy analysis of women&#8217;s rights is the 
contemporary global, macroeconomic environment. Capitalist competition has fuelled the quest 
for cheap sources of labour and for investment conditions that maximize profits locally and 
transnationally. In this context, the relocation of industries to the periphery has disrupted local 
economies and dramatically changed labour markets, increasing a poorly regulated economy of 
low pay and insecure jobs, and attracting women from developing societies into wage 
employment on a scale unseen before.

<p>31. While the neoliberal policy environment has led to the expansion of women&#8217;s employment, 
it has also led to the intensification of their workload in the market and at home, and to the 
feminization of poverty especially among unskilled and marginalized poor women, who lack 
access to productive resources and basic capabilities. Such poverty, marginalization and lack of 
protective mechanisms, make women easy targets for abuse and undermines the prospects for the 
progressive realization of their rights.<b>12</b>

<p>32. Neoliberal policies have also reduced the State&#8217;s capacity to regulate and tax capital, 
resulting in an enforcement problem,<b>13</b> with regard to both property rights and contracts, and the 
withdrawal of public services and social security provisions. Under such circumstances, a return 
to community-based enforcement and survival strategies - based largely on women&#8217;s initiatives - 
have become essential. One outcome of the communal/&#8220;tribalizing&#8221; tendencies was the 
strengthened role of culture/religion based non-State actors in determining identity politics, often 
based on conservative/fundamentalist ideals, and in providing services to impoverished groups. 
These trends have posed new challenges for the universal application of human rights norms, in 
particular, women&#8217;s claims for rights and equality.<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>33. Ironically, the current financial crisis presents a crucial opportunity for governments and 
international institutions to invest in public services and infrastructure to create jobs, improve 
productivity and revive economic demand. Such investment, if planned well, has the potential to 
expand women&#8217;s economic opportunities and employment and their access to a wide range of 
other entitlements. Studies show that women&#8217;s economic participation and incomes contribute 
significantly to overall economic development and societal well-being; their presence in 
financial and administrative institutions is associated with decreases in corruption;<b>15</b> they tend 
towards less risky investments and receive better returns on their investments than men.<b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>34. The third element of the political economy approach to women&#8217;s rights is related to the 
gendered dimensions of war and peace, which are intimately connected to patriarchy and the 
differential gender impacts of globalization. Violent conflict, often related to control over power 
and productive resources, normalizes violence and spreads it throughout society. Both State and 
group-sanctioned violence frequently celebrates masculine aggression and perpetuates impunity

<p>with regard to men&#8217;s violence against women. My mission reports with respect to countries in 
conflict and post-conflict zones have documented the link between VAW, conflict and 
militarism.<b>17</b>  
</p>
<p>35. Conflict, war and the security agenda have impoverished societies as they have made 
trade-offs between military spending and spending for development and human rights protection, 
particularly that of women.<b>18</b> Post-conflict reconstruction may thus involve privatization of 
public services and infrastructure that regresses women&#8217;s rights by placing greater burden on 
their labour in the household,<b>19</b>  as well as the establishment of political and legal systems with 
limited or no significant participation by women.<b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>36. A political economy approach stresses that stability without justice is not possible. The 
prioritization of national security and electoral machinery by governments over human security 
in many post-conflict situations has proven to be destabilizing in the long run. Insofar as women 
are unable to access justice, physical security and socio-economic rights, their vulnerability to 
violence continues in peace time.<b>21</b>  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Integrating economic and social rights with civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>37. The tensions emanating from the dichotomization of the twin Covenants on civil and 
political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, which have privileged the former over 
the latter, have constrained efforts to transform the conditions that underlie gender inequality and 
violence against women. In this respect, the Committee on economic, social and cultural rights in 
its statement at the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 noted that, &#8220;&#8230; States and

<p>international community as a whole continue to tolerate all too often breaches of economic, 
social, and cultural rights, which, if they occurred in relation to civil and political rights, would 
provoke expression of horror and outrage and would lead to concerted calls for immediate 
remedial action&#8221; (E/1993/22, Annex III, para. 5).  
</p>
<p>38. The conception of economic, social and cultural (ES)<b>22</b> rights largely as &#8220;aspirational&#8221; 
rights that can be progressively realized depending on the resources available to a State by 
contrast with civil and political (CP) rights conceived as &#8220;obligatory&#8221; rights to be guaranteed 
immediately has also been criticized by feminist scholars, who have argued that the fulfilment of 
the latter can also be seen as a process of progressive realization.<b>23</b> Both Covenants impose 
positive duties on governments to comply with their obligations without discrimination. While 
the implementation of all human rights have an economic and material aspect,<b>24</b>  budgetary 
limitations do not excuse a State of non-discriminatory compliance with its obligation to improve 
the socio-economic conditions of people within its jurisdiction. States cannot for example, 
introduce macroeconomic reforms in conjunction with multilateral economic institutions or trade 
liberalization policies that might undermine its obligations under the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.<b>25</b>  
</p>
<p>39. Despite these human rights obligations, States in responding to VAW have tended to 
focus more on reforming juridical and legal structures and less on alterations in economic 
and social structures. Advancing women&#8217;s ES rights imposes &#8220;an affirmative obligation on 
States to meet basic needs&#8221; and the implementation of practical strategies to ensure that this 
outcome is achieved.<b>26</b> In the context of global change and crises this is particularly crucial not 
only to women&#8217;s enjoyment of ES rights but also for preventing the deepening of gender 
disparities.

</p>
<p>40. It is important to note here that global restructuring has increased the role of corporate 
power and that of international institutions relative to State power over macroeconomic 
processes. This calls for expanding the concept of affirmative obligation to include these 
non-State actors.<b>27</b>  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Economic and social rights 
</b></p>
<p>41. The impact of globalization and women&#8217;s ability to benefit from its opportunities while 
avoiding its risks is undermined by gender inequality, unequal entitlement structures, economic 
insecurities of global capitalism, as well as weakening State capacity for regulation and 
distributional justice. Poor women who are systematically denied access to ES rights are 
particularly at risk of greater hardship and abuse.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>42. This section aims to establish the linkages between VAW and women&#8217;s ES rights, 
including the right to adequate housing, property, inheritance, food, water, education, health, and 
the right to decent work and social security. These rights are recognized in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and guaranteed by the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>43. The right to adequate housing includes not only security of tenure but also access to public 
services, and participation in the physical, social, legal and economic environments. Lack of 
adequate housing can trigger VAW and vice versa.<b>28</b> Those especially at risk of violence due to a 
lack of access to alternative housing include internally displaced (IDP) and refugee women, 
domestic workers, poor single mothers, and women victims of violence living in countries 
without safe shelters or affordable long term housing for abused women.  
</p>
<p>44. Deprivation of housing is closely linked to violent and forced displacement, as in civil 
strife situations. The risk of violence is particularly acute for IDP and refugee women and girls 
who live in camps that lack privacy and may be forced to live in the same quarters or in close 
proximity to male strangers, which increases their vulnerability. Sexual violence has been 
documented as a serious problem in such environments. Once the conflict has ended women who

<p>are repatriated may no longer have houses or land to return to due to destruction, forced 
relocation to a different locality, discriminatory inheritance laws, lack of property titles, and 
secondary occupants, etc.  
</p>
<p>45. Large development projects or major international events may involve large-scale evictions 
of poor people from their homes and land in order to free up desired locations or build 
infrastructure for the event. The impact of these forced evictions, often by militia or armed 
forces, is profoundly devastating for women and is correlated with heightened rates of physical, 
psychological and economic violence before, during and after the evictions.<b>29</b> This is true both in 
terms of VAW at the hands of State authorities, non-State actors, community members, as well 
as domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>46. The violation of women&#8217;s right to adequate housing has also led to gender-based violence 
both during and in the aftermath of natural and humanitarian disasters. A study of housing 
reconstruction in the context of the international response to the tsunami in Sri Lanka and 
Tamil Nadu revealed gross disregard for women&#8217;s and girls rights.<b>30</b> Compensation was 
generally handed out to male-heads of the family who, in many cases, did not share it with the 
women or surviving women-only households.<b>31</b>  
</p>
<p>47. Forced evictions and displacement also have implications for all other rights discussed in 
this section. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Property, land and inheritance rights 
</b></p>
<p>48. The right to adequate housing is integrally related to property, land ownership and 
inheritance rights. The gender gap in land ownership and its effective control is the single most 
critical contributor to the gender gap in economic well-being, social status and empowerment in 
the agrarian economies of most developing countries.<b>32</b> Property is a livelihood sustaining asset 
that can generate income as well as security. Owning land gives women economic rights and 
opportunities to avoid situations where they are vulnerable to violence. It also increases their 
bargaining power within the family and society at large.

<p>49. Research in Kerala found that women&#8217;s independent ownership of property strengthens 
their fall-back position, thus playing a crucial preventive role in deterring domestic violence.<b>33</b> In 
Kenya, as in many other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, a woman&#8217;s access to property hinges on 
her relationship to a man. When she separates from her husband or when he dies, she risks losing 
her home, land, household goods and other property. Failure to ensure equal property rights upon 
separation or divorce discourages women from leaving violent marriages, as women may be 
forced to choose between violence at home and destitution in the street.<b>34</b> Women who lack 
independent resources for survival may also yield to demands for unprotected sex, despite the 
danger of contracting HIV/AIDS and other diseases.<b>35</b> Rural women in South Africa frequently 
live in female-headed households, in chronic poverty and are subject to spiralling levels of 
violence, as well as a disproportionately high prevalence of HIV. Many of these women were 
forcibly evicted from their ancestral land by the apartheid system.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>50. Women&#8217;s difficulty in claiming their rights to property and land is linked with other 
sex-discriminatory laws including male-biased marriage and divorce laws, and biases within land 
dispute bodies which are made up of men and exclude women from the decision-making process. 
Situations of violent conflict reveal in a more blatantly direct way how violations of the right to 
property and land are inseparable from acts of physical VAW. In the Ugandan armed conflict 
militarized rape was used strategically in order to acquire women&#8217;s assets, including land and 
homes, some of which were needed for the war effort, or indeed, were among the reasons for the 
conflict. Forced into poverty and often, displacement, women are far more vulnerable to ongoing 
violence.<b>37</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Right to food and food security 
</b></p>
<p>51. Women&#8217;s right to food is impaired by their limited access to and control over other 
productive resources as a result of discrimination in education, lower incomes, inequality in

<p>intra-household food distribution, inadequate public health care and exclusion from 
decision-making processes. Women disproportionately bear the impact of food supply crises, 
food price rises and the privatization of the food supply. Women&#8217;s role as food providers and 
carers for their families, together with their general lack of property and labour rights, makes 
them particularly vulnerable when entitlement failure with respect to food occurs. For instance, 
in order to put food on the table for their families, women may go into prostitution putting 
themselves at risk of violence and of HIV/AIDS. In IDP camps, many girls and women have 
reportedly also been forced to engage in &#8220;survival sex&#8221; to obtain food. 
</p>
<p>52. Women agricultural producers suffer the most negative effects of trade liberalization and 
changes in agricultural markets. Although they make up the majority of agricultural workers in 
many of the developing countries, due to lack of access to resources, secure tenure, credit, 
equipment, training and market know-how, poor rural women are further marginalized by trade 
liberalization that favours large-scale export cash crop production. Food security reflects one of 
the most distorted outcomes of the uneven distribution of international trade. 
</p>
<p>53. Trade liberalization locks in tariff reductions which have reduced the availability of funds 
for agricultural investment and the provision of agriculture-related services that could help 
women to produce food more efficiently including for export markets.<b>38</b> Although the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture allows for some exemptions from 
liberalization obligations for food security purposes, it is not clear whether these exceptions will 
enhance food security for the poorest people in poor countries. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Right to water 
</b></p>
<p>54. The task of collecting and providing clean water for their families and communities 
exposes women to similar risks and challenges as that of providing food. Women often have to 
walk long distances to fetch water in communities where access to clean water is lacking. 
Narratives of pregnant Nepalese women describe how women labour to fetch water for their 
families and suffer miscarriages on the journey.<b>39</b> Likewise, there are reports of Nigerian women 
who are raped by men or mauled by wild animals on their way to collect water.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>55. Contamination of the water supply also has a particularly detrimental impact on women. 
Because women collect the water with which they prepare the food they may be blamed for the 
health consequences, or they may have to travel ever greater distances to gather clean water if 
local sources are no longer available. Poor Bangladeshi women suffering from arsenic poisoning

<p>are socially ostracized, and get less medical attention and nutrition therein increasing their 
chances of experiencing violence.<b>41</b> Chemical saturation of the water supply on the 
United States/Mexican border poisons babies in their mothers&#8217; wombs while more women are 
diagnosed with breast cancer.<b>42</b> Women face spousal abuse and social censure when fighting for 
access to clean water, as has been documented in Coporaque, Peru.<b>43</b> The struggle for clean 
water also affects intergenerational violence, as within the Native American culture resulting 
from the flooding of the Cree lands in Canada by the James Bay hydroelectric dam.<b>44</b> 
</p>
<p>56. The privatization of water, often encouraged by World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) policies in developing countries, has created natural monopolies leading 
to price rises, particularly burdening the urban poor in accessing water. 
</p>
<p>57. Easy access to clean water on the other hand has been associated with girls&#8217; and women&#8217;s 
empowerment and their protection from violence. Equitable access to water for productive 
use can address some of the root causes of poverty and gender inequality that fuel VAW.  
It frees up girls so they can improve their school attendance, and improves income-generating 
opportunities and access to economic resources that are known to lessen women&#8217;s vulnerability 
to violence.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>58. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified VAW as an underlying determinant 
of health.<b>46</b> In a multinational study, WHO found that &#8220;women who at some time experienced 
physical or sexual violence, or both, reported health problems with greater probability than those

<p>women who never experienced violence by their partner&#8221;. Women who experienced abuse 
declared having problems walking and in carrying out their daily work, feeling pains, loss of 
memory, dizziness [and miscarriage] in the four weeks preceding the survey.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p>59. VAW affects women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health, which is a key aspect of women&#8217;s 
right to health.<b>48</b> The experience of violence adversely affects reproductive health regardless of 
wealth.<b>49</b> Survivors of VAW have the right to adequate reparation and rehabilitation that covers 
their physical and mental health.<b>50</b> But this support is often not provided. The privatization of 
health services may affect women survivors&#8217; access to health care since the introduction of 
user-fees for patients has been shown to greatly reduce women&#8217;s attendance at health clinics.<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p>60. VAW is also considered to be a leading cause of HIV/AIDS, affecting women&#8217;s right to 
health.<b>52</b> Given the increasing feminization of HIV/AIDS,<b>53</b> eliminating VAW is a critical 
intervention to reduce the pandemic. VAW or fear of it also prevents many women from asking 
their partners to practise safe sex leading to higher HIV rates. Many women also experience 
severe violence at the hands of their partners as soon as their diagnosis becomes known. In order 
to care for family members with HIV/AIDS, they may feel forced into high-risk work such as the 
sex industry or keep children, especially girls, out of school to help with tasks - thereby 
entrenching the intergenerational transmission of poverty and violence.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Right to education

greater self-confidence. Educational levels have also been found to be positively correlated with

<p>increased access to knowledge and better health. Lack of it on the other hand, can be a major 
source of marginalization and isolation within and outside the home, leading to lower status and 
increased vulnerability to abuse. 
</p>
<p>62. Although girls&#8217; education is on the rise in many parts of the world, their right to education 
is frequently violated by economic circumstances. For instance, when the cost of living and food 
are driven up by financial crisis, privatization or import liberalization, girls are far more likely to 
drop out of school than boys. Of the estimated 150 million children currently enrolled in primary 
school that will drop out before completion, at least 100 million will be girls.<b>55</b> Child 
marriage - a form of violence against girls - is associated with lower educational attainment for 
girls, limiting their employment opportunities and economic security as well as their access to 
social and economic resources and decision-making in the family.<b>56</b> 
</p>
<p>63. Although higher levels of education are generally associated with a lesser risk to women of 
experiencing violence, some studies reveal contradictory patterns. &#8220;Educated women know their 
rights and are therefore not prepared to follow orders unquestioningly. Asking questions leads to 
conflicts which then lead to violence.&#8221;<b>57</b> These findings can be interpreted as a patriarchal 
backlash against women&#8217;s newfound empowerment through education and the challenge that this 
represents to male domination in the family and society at large. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Rights to work, livelihood and social security 
</b></p>
<p>64. Paid work, particularly under market conditions, secures a livelihood for women and their 
family and provides them with a degree of independence. In so doing, it enhances women&#8217;s 
ability to escape poverty and potentially abusive environments such as &#8220;crowded living 
conditions, limited scope of action, as well as psychological strain&#8221;.<b>58</b> While evidence shows that 
women&#8217;s earnings can trigger spousal resentment that end in violence, <b>59</b> access to paid work 
provides women with better bargaining power or the option to leave an abusive relationship in

<p>both the Global North and the South.<b>60</b> Gender equality in income and employment has been 
shown to have a stronger impact on women&#8217;s status and gender equality than education alone.<b>61</b> 
Employment can empower women to more effectively resist patriarchal control and practices 
such as early marriage, polygamy, and discriminatory inheritance and land rights that increase 
the risks of VAW.<b>62</b> 
</p>
<p>65. Women&#8217;s employment opportunities often manifest at the intersections of patriarchy and 
capitalism where the male breadwinner model and uneven market entitlement structures 
disadvantage particularly poor women who have little or no resources at their disposal. The 
majority of working women lack access to public provisions, such as, childcare services, social 
security benefits and old-age pensions.<b>63</b> Competitive globalization, while expanding women&#8217;s 
employment opportunities, has done so under precarious employment conditions, including 
subcontracting, outsourcing and offshore production, among others, which by nature are 
temporary, insecure and unregulated. 
</p>
<p>66. Many of the poor women from the Global South, who have entered the labour market in 
home country or abroad as migrants, often work in jobs that lack minimum labour and human 
rights standards. In some Northern countries women have been encouraged to take on part-time 
employment that does not guarantee economic independence and job security or opportunities 
for career development.<b>64</b> These contexts, by and large, contribute to sustaining women&#8217;s 
subordinate position and in some situations expose women to increased risk of violence and 
exploitation. At the same time, however, the feminization of the workforce, including migrant 
labour are creating new contradictions that can potentially rupture patriarchal formations and 
expand women&#8217;s autonomy. Public policy in this regard can play a critical role in either 
empowering patriarchy or advancing women&#8217;s human rights.

</p>
<p><b>D.  The impact of global change and crises 
</b></p>
<p>67. This section focuses on the linkages between VAW and patterns of global transformations 
by identifying strategic sites where political-economic processes can be seen to be accentuating 
existing gender inequalities or creating new patterns of inclusion and marginalization.<b>65</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Competitive globalization 
</b></p>
<p>68. Neoliberal policies open up economies to global competition and seek to lower the costs of 
production. This has given rise to unprecedented opportunities for women&#8217;s access to paid work 
that can potentially empower them. However, due to economic volatility, job insecurity, 
subcontracting and loss of livelihoods of poor women, particularly those in developing countries, 
have encountered new vulnerabilities and risks. 
</p>
<p>69. Furthermore, under such conditions marked by insecurity and unemployment, men may 
become dispossessed and dislocated; conditions under which masculinities and power relations 
get altered. This may heighten aggression against women and children in the home and in public 
spaces, compensating for the loss of control.<b>66</b> A recent study in post-apartheid South Africa 
showed that men facing chronic unemployment justified their violent behaviour towards their 
female partners by referring to their feelings of powerlessness.<b>67</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Transitions to market economies 
</b></p>
<p>70. Patterns of economic destabilization associated with macroeconomic policies, including 
structural adjustment policies that facilitate the integration of global markets, have varied from 
country to country. However, similar cross-country trends in inequalities and vulnerabilities for 
women have been observed. For instance, the market transitions in Central and Eastern Europe 
and the former Soviet Union led to widespread increases in poverty, unemployment, hardship, 
income disparities, discontent, breakdown of social support networks and a general loss of status 
for women. These factors increased women&#8217;s dependency and raised their vulnerability to abuse 
within and outside the home.<b>68</b> Some have viewed Eastern Europe and Central Asia as &#8220;test 
regions&#8221; for judging the impact of neoliberal policies.<b>69</b> Notwithstanding exceptions, many of the 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>65
</b>  The report does not claim to make causal links between neoliberal policy and the violation of 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights but rather, on the basis of available empirical evidence, it aims to identify trends 
and tendencies.

<p>transition countries experienced regressions in women&#8217;s economic and social status,<b>70</b> 
compelling hundreds of thousands of young women to migrate in order to escape domestic 
violence and provide for their children, many of which became trafficked for sexual and labour 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p>71. Similarly, the impact of the Asian financial crisis (1997-1998) on women and girls was 
also disproportionate. Girls were removed from school to help at home or forced to work in the 
sex sector to support family sustenance as a result of cutbacks in public service jobs and 
salaries.<b>71</b> In some East Asian countries, women&#8217;s paid labour intensified while in others, notably 
South Korea, their labour participation shrunk. The resulting economic and political insecurity 
strained intra-household relationships, boosted suicides, domestic violence and abandonment,<b>72</b> 
and provoked private and public backlash against women&#8217;s rights that was often defended on the 
basis of culture and tradition.<b>73</b> The lessons learned from these experiences are particularly 
important for monitoring and responding to the current financial and economic crisis. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Free trade zones and migrant women 
</b></p>
<p>72. Trade liberalization has facilitated the shift from import substitution to export-led 
strategies which entailed the establishment of labour-intensive &#8220;free trade&#8221; or export processing 
zones (EPZs) exempt from many government regulations. EPZs have attracted young, migrant 
women from rural areas who are hired on temporary and insecure contracts. VAW, including 
incidents of involuntary pregnancy tests, sexual harassment, rape, and femicide<b>74</b> have been

<p>  While the femicides are said to have different motives, including domestic violence, many of 
the murdered women worked in precarious jobs, including the export industries. Organized 
crime, such as trafficking in drugs and persons that also grew in Ciudad Juarez following trade 
liberalization is said to contribute to the conditions that account for the femicides. See &#8220;Report 
on Mexico produced by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
under article 8 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention, and reply from the Government of 
Mexico&#8221; (CEDAW/C/2005/OP.8/MEXICO) (http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/ 
cedaw32/CEDAW-C-2005-OP.8-MEXICO-E.pdf); also the report on my mission to Mexico, 
(E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.4). </p>

</p>
<p>documented in some of these free trade zones in developing countries.<b>75</b> The liberalization of 
industries may also involve importing foreign male workers.<b>76</b> If the local economic context is 
impoverished, their presence may encourage the development of prostitution and sex trafficking 
as well as gender-based violence.73. The demand for women&#8217;s cheap labour, low-wages and 
flexible labour under globalization is not limited to the EPZs but spans over a wide range of 
forms and space, including trafficking of women and children for sexual and labour exploitation, 
emigration for employment in unregulated, informal and domestic sectors, as well as regulated 
service sector occupations such as nursing. The former has become a lucrative business with 
high profits for both legal and illegal contractors, while the latter is an important source of hard 
currency for migrant sending countries. &#8220;The overall outcome is a significant feminizing of 
global survival - not just of the women themselves but of their households, of governments and 
of economic actors.&#8221;<b>77</b> 
</p>
<p>74. It has been argued that, &#8220;(t)he same set of processes that have promoted the location of 
plants and offices abroad also have contributed to a large supply of low wage jobs&#8221; in global 
cities that facilitated women&#8217;s migration.<b>78</b> The growing presence of women, immigrants, and 
people of colour in large cities along with a declining middle class has facilitated the operation 
of devalorization processes. The fact of gendering, e.g. the devaluing of female-typed jobs, 
facilitates the devalorization of a broad range of jobs executed by the growing and mostly female 
&#8220;serving classes&#8221; in global cities.<b>79</b> 
</p>
<p>75. With respect to the impact of migration on migrant women themselves, existing evidence 
reveals both empowering and disempowering tendencies. By and large, due to the highly unequal 
power relations of the work situation and the fact that women concentrate in sectors which 
escape regulatory mechanisms, migrant women find themselves in abusive environments based

<p>  For example, the presence of multinational companies in the fisheries and forestry industries 
in the Pacific Islands which import foreign male workers has been linked to the sex-trade, child

<p>on multiple oppressions of gender, class, nationality and ethnicity.<b>80</b> Their vulnerability to 
violence is particularly aggravated by working in poor conditions with low social status, living in 
degrading housing situations, and lacking basic legal protections and opportunities for redress. 
</p>
<p>76. International institutions, employers, business, and Governments are complicit in the 
human rights abuse and violence against migrant domestic workers since these do not enjoy the 
basic labour protections guaranteed to other workers.<b>81</b> Employers may evade domestic labour 
laws, and Governments rarely monitor the observance of these in relation to domestic workers.<b>82</b> 
Labour-sending countries often have an economic incentive to ignore their breach as they benefit 
from high levels of remittances and do not wish to jeopardize their relations with relevant host 
countries. Bilateral and multilateral agreements are insufficient in providing protection to 
migrants, particularly women.<b>83</b> 
</p>
<p>77. Migrant women working in the sex sector and those trafficked for sexual exploitation face 
particular vulnerabilities. Trafficking is the dark underside of migration and inseparable from 
processes of globalization and trade liberalization.<b>84</b> State policies that treat trafficked women as 
criminals or mere victims in need of rescue and rehabilitation fail to take account of their 
economic agency and their human rights in the prevention, protection and prosecution of 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Post-crisis reconstruction and State-building

<p>often linked with attempts to control economic resources such as oil, metal, diamonds, drugs or 
contested territorial boundaries.<b>86</b> VAW is often one way to achieve this control, demonstrated in 
many of the recent armed conflicts. 
</p>
<p>79. Women and girls displaced by natural disasters have also been subject to rape, sexual 
abuse, early and forced marriage, and trafficking,<b>87</b> with long-term impact on women&#8217;s rights 
and welfare in the post-crisis or post-conflict situation.<b>88</b> The stigmatization, and sometimes even 
forced displacement, of women who have been raped for instance, often results in their 
impoverishment and in continued violence against them. 
</p>
<p>80. The failure to address women&#8217;s ES rights in post-conflict situations, contributes to 
women&#8217;s poverty and material insecurity and thus, their vulnerability to abuse, including 
trafficking.<b>89</b> The invisibility of VAW during and after the conflict/disaster is over exacerbates 
gender inequalities and marginalizes women in reconstruction and State-building processes 
despite Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security in which the 
Council recognizes the right of women to participate in these processes.<b>90</b> Research suggests that 
women can be empowered in post-crisis situations<b>91</b> if endemic problems in society are 
addressed and the ES rights of citizens during the rebuilding of societies after crises are ensured 
in a non-discriminatory manner.<b>92</b>

<p><b>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Violence against women is a violation of the right to life and to personal security but 
also of a whole range of basic economic and social rights. Yet the differential treatment and 
implementation of the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
and on Civil and Political Rights remains a major barrier greatly limiting Government and 
non-State actor efforts to achieve the full and equal realization of women&#8217;s human rights in 
order to prevent VAW from occurring in the first place.</b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>Against this backdrop the present report has examined the interconnections between 
the current global political economic order and women&#8217;s enjoyment of their human rights, 
in particular the implications for VAW; arguing that economic and social rights are 
essential in enhancing women&#8217;s capabilities and creating enabling conditions, such that 
women do not bear the brunt of globalization and economic crisis disproportionately, and 
can effectively avoid/resist the risk of violence. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>While competitive globalization has created new opportunities for some groups of 
women, it has disadvantaged others, who have entered the workforce under insecure and 
unregulated conditions, thus creating new risks and vulnerabilities to abuse and 
exploitation. At the same time, globalization has undermined State capacity for 
enforcement and the provision of public goods and services. This has resulted in a return to 
community-based enforcement and survival systems, which have not only intensified 
women&#8217;s workload in order to compensate for the erosion of crucial public services and 
entitlements but also subordinated women to increasingly conservative cultural discourses 
that challenge the universality of rights and equality of women.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>The feminization of migration, along with feminization of the labour force, two 
important outcomes of globalization, hold new risks and vulnerabilities as well as 
opportunities for women&#8217;s empowerment. But neoliberal policies that fail to attend to the 
basic social and economic entitlements of individuals and families make violence a more 
likely outcome for women than their empowerment. Restrictive immigration policies 
focused on national security and a narrow construal of economic interests often limit the 
options of migrant women workers for safe and independent survival in an alien 
environment. The challenge lies in creating the guarantees for women to migrate safely and 
with dignity</b>.<b>93</b> 
</p>
<p>85. <b>The current financial crisis, which clearly reflects the inherent instabilities of 
unregulated markets, offers a crucial opportunity for Governments and international 
institutions to invest in public services and infrastructure to create jobs, improve 
productivity and revive economic demand. Such investment, if well designed, has the 
potential to expand women&#8217;s economic opportunities and enhance livelihood security. The 
State, no doubt, is not the only authority to be held accountable for violations of women&#8217;s 
human rights. Sovereignty in the new global order must be understood as the responsibility 
of nation States, as well as the shared responsibility of the international community at 
</b>

<p><b>large. Therefore, promotion and protection of women&#8217;s economic and social entitlements to 
prevent and protect them from violence must be pursued transnationally. The future of 
human rights and distributive justice will require democratizing cultural, political and 
economic hegemony.</b> 
</p>
<p>86. <b>In view of the above discussion, a viable strategy to address the underlying 
socio-economic causes of VAW must include, but not be limited, to the following broad 
guidelines, which apply to Governments as well as local and international non-State  
actors.</b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>Creation of a gender-sensitive knowledge base as follows: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Develop indicators and generate sex-disaggregated data on risk and preventive 
factors on VAW that include economic and political factors; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Generate sex-disaggregated data on VAW, its causes and consequences in 
conflict, post-conflict and other reconstruction processes; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Document shortfalls in economic and social rights of women parallel to 
violations in political and civil rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Include indicators and targets for eliminating VAW with measures of women&#8217;s 
economic and political participation in MDG 3 on empowering women, and the UNDP 
Gender and Development and Gender Empowerment Indexes. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Establishing gender-competent policy and programming as follows: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Design public works programmes in the social and service sectors to promote 
women&#8217;s employment and support their role as economic agents by contributing to greater 
social provisioning needs in the household and community; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Provide non-discriminative economic opportunities and reconstruction 
programmes that address the economic and social dimensions of women&#8217;s empowerment in 
post-conflict and crisis societies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Codify economic and social rights in enforceable national law, including 
guarantees for minimum level of income, food, health care, etc.; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Evaluate all policies of Governments and international financial institutions 
from a gender-perspective guided by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All</b> <b>Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, with the view to preventing negative consequences for women of economic 
liberalization, financial and structural adjustment policies and programmes, and trade 
agreements - at a minimum, these policies should &#8220;do no harm&#8221;; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Factor in VAW, its causes and consequences in financing for development 
initiatives, including the Gender Equality Fund and other partnerships devoted to new 
institutional mechanisms, research, data and action plans; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Adopt gender-responsive budgeting strategies at local, national and 
international levels. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Monitoring progress as follows: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure that economic stimulus and reconstruction/recovery packages do not 
privilege physical over social infrastructure investment and/or support for men&#8217;s over 
women&#8217;s jobs, and full-time over part-time economic opportunities in different economic 
sectors; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Establish intermediary institutions to manage and monitor the rights of foreign 
domestic workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Use cross-national data on trends or patterns that reveal linkages between VAW 
and women&#8217;s socio-economic status (i.e. control over income</b> <b>and productive resources) and 
monitor over time throughout an individual or family&#8217;s life cycle.</b> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>In the field of transnational cooperation: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Invest in public services and infrastructure to create jobs, improve productivity 
and revive economic demand; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Develop mechanisms to hold non-State actors, including corporations and 
international organizations accountable for human rights violations and for instituting 
gender-sensitive approaches to their activities and policies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Channel international assistance for the realization of economic and social 
rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Establish transnational mechanisms to promote and protect the full range of 
women&#8217;s rights and eliminate VAW. </b></p>
