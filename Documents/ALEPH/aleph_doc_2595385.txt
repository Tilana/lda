NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS:
Timberline  Resources  Corporation  (“Timberline”  or  “the  Company”,  “we”,  “us”,  “our”)  was
incorporated in August of 1968 under the laws of the State of Idaho as Silver Crystal Mines, Inc.,
for the purpose of exploring for precious metal deposits and advancing them to production.  In
2008, we reincorporated into the State of Delaware pursuant to a merger agreement approved by
our shareholders.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
a.
Basis of Presentation and Going Concern – The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements  have  been  prepared  by  the  Company  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, as well as the
instructions  to  Form  10-Q.  Accordingly,  the  financial  statements  do  not  include  all  of  the
information  and  footnotes  required  by  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United
States  of  America  for  complete  financial  statements.  In  the  opinion  of  our  management,  all
adjustments  (consisting  of  only  normal  recurring  accruals)  considered  necessary  for  a  fair
presentation  of  the  interim  financial  statements  have  been  included.  Operating  results  for  the
three and nine month periods ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the full year ending September 30, 2016.  All amounts presented are in
U.S. dollars.  For further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.
The consolidated financial statements for the three and nine month periods ended June 30, 2016
were  prepared  on  the  basis  that  the  Company  is  a  going  concern,  which  contemplates  the
realization  of  its  assets  and  the  settlement  of  its  liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  operations.
These  financial  statements  do  not  reflect  adjustments  that  would  be  necessary  if  the  going
concern  assumption  were  not  appropriate.    The  Company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going
concern is dependent upon its ability to receive cash flow from its operations or to successfully
obtain  additional  financing.  While  the  Company  has  been  successful  in  the  past  in  obtaining
financing, there is no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or
that such financing will be on terms acceptable to the Company.  These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
b.
Net Income (Loss) per Share  –  Basic  earnings  per  share  (“EPS”)  is  computed  as  net  income
(loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through
stock options, warrants, and other convertible securities.
The  dilutive  effect  of  convertible  and  outstanding  securities,  in  periods  of  future  income  as  of
June 30, 2016 and 2015, would be as follows:
Stock options
Warrants
    Total possible dilution
2016
360,419 
10,012,506 
10,372,925
2015
594,189
25,000
619,189
At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the effect of the Company’s outstanding options and common stock
equivalents would have been anti-dilutive.
c.
Asset retirement obligation – We account for asset retirement obligations by following the uniform
methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs as prescribed by
authoritative accounting guidance.  This guidance provides that the fair value of a liability for an
asset  retirement  obligation  (“ARO”) will be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The ARO is capitalized as part of the carrying
value of the assets to which it is associated, and depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
Adjustments are made to the liability for changes resulting from passage of time and changes to
either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation. We
have  an  ARO  associated  with  our  exploration  program  at  the  Lookout  Mountain  exploration
project.
d.
Available-for-sale  equity  securities  –  Available-for-sale  equity  securities  are  recorded  at  fair
value.  Unrealized gains and losses relating to equity securities classified as available-for-sale
are  recorded  as  a  component  of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  in
stockholders’ equity unless an other-than-temporary impairment in value has occurred, in which
case such accumulated loss would be charged to current period net income (loss).  Unrealized
gain and losses originally included in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified
to the current period net income (loss) when the sale or determination of other-than-temporary
impairment  of  securities  occurs.    Realized  gains  and  losses  on  the  sale  of  securities  are
recognized on a specific identification basis.

NOTE 4 – ENTRY INTO PROPERTY OPTION AGREEMENT:
On  March  12,  2015  (the  “Effective  Date”),  we  entered  into  a  property  option  agreement
(“Agreement”)  with  Gunpoint  Exploration  Ltd.  (“Gunpoint”),  which  closed  on  March  31,  2015.
Gunpoint granted us an exclusive and irrevocable option (“Option”) to purchase a 100% interest
in Gunpoint’s Talapoosa project (the “Project”) in western Nevada.  Pursuant to the Agreement,
we have the right to exercise the Option at any time beginning on March 31, 2015 and ending
within thirty (30) months of March 12, 2015, unless sooner terminated (“Option Period”).
As consideration for the Option, we agreed to issue two million (2,000,000) shares of common
stock and pay $300,000 in cash.  A $100,000 cash payment was made on March 31, 2015.  The
common  stock  was  valued  at  fair  value  on  the  Effective  Date  and  capitalized  with  the  cash
payment of $100,000 for a total of $1,300,000.  The remaining $200,000 cash payment was paid
on September 23, 2015.  The common stock was issued on March 31, 2015 and is being held in
escrow.    The  shares  are  irrevocable  and  will  be  released  to  Gunpoint  as  follows:    25%  on
September 12, 2015; 25% on March 12, 2016; 25% on September 12, 2016; and 25% on March
12,  2017.    Gunpoint  will  receive  the  total  of  2,000,000  shares  even  if  the  Company  does  not
exercise the Option.
At any time during the Option Period, we may purchase 100% of Talapoosa by providing written
notification  thereof  and  paying  to  Gunpoint  $10  million  in  cash  (the  “Option  Payment”)  within
ninety  (90)  days  of  the  notification  date.    Upon  the  date  that  Gunpoint  receives  the  Option
Payment (the “Closing Date”), we will have earned a 100% interest in the Project.
For a period of five years following the Closing Date (“Contingent Payment Period”), should the
daily price of gold (as determined by the London PM Fix) be fixed at or above $1,600 per ounce,
on any single day during the Contingent Payment Period (the “Initial Threshold Event”) and at
any time after the Initial Threshold Event during the Contingent Payment Period the daily price of
gold  (as  determined  by  the  London  PM  Fix)  averages  U.S.$1,600  per  ounce  or  greater  for  a
period of ninety (90) consecutive trading days (the “Trigger Event”), we shall be required to pay or
cause to be paid to Gunpoint an additional payment of $10 million (the “Contingent Payment”)
within  ninety  (90)  days  of  the  date  that  the  Trigger  Event  is  deemed  to  have  occurred.    The
Contingent Payment shall consist of $5 million in cash, and the remainder shall be paid either in
cash or in shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our sole discretion.
Following our exercise of the Option, effective as of the Closing Date, Gunpoint reserves a net
smelter returns royalty in all minerals mined and removed from the Project, in the amount of one
percent (1%).  We may purchase the royalty from Gunpoint at any time for a cash payment of $3
million.
NOTE 5 – INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE AND OTHER INVESTMENTS:
In  July  2009,  we  entered  into  a  joint  venture  operating  agreement  (the  “Agreement”)  with
Highland Mining, LLC (“Highland”).  The joint venture entity, Butte Highlands JV, LLC (“BHJV”)
was created for the purpose of developing and mining the Butte Highlands Gold Project.  As a
result of our contribution of our 100% interest in the Butte Highlands Gold Project, carried on our
balance  sheet  at  cost,  we  held  a  50%  interest  in  BHJV.    Under  terms  of  the  Agreement,  our
interest in BHJV would be carried to production by Highland, which would fund all future project
exploration and mine development costs.
8
NOTE 5 – INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE AND OTHER INVESTMENTS, (continued):
Under  the  Agreement,  Highland  contributed  property  and  agreed  to  fund  all  future  mine
development  costs  at  Butte  Highlands.    Both  the  Company’s  and  Highland’s  share  of
development  costs  would  be  paid  from  proceeds  of  future  mine  production.    The  Operating
Agreement stipulated that Highland would appoint a manager of BHJV and that Highland would
manage BHJV until such time as all mine development costs, less $2 million (the deemed value
of our contribution of property to BHJV), were distributed to Highland out of the proceeds from
future mine production.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, we executed a Member Interest Purchase Agreement
(the “Purchase Agreement”) with New Jersey Mining Company (“NJMC”) pursuant to which we
sold  all  of  our  50%  interest  in  the  Butte  Highlands,  JV,  LLC  (the  “JV  Interest”).    We  received
$225,000 in cash and 3 million restricted shares of common stock of NJMC (the “NJMC Shares”)
as  consideration  for  the  sale  of  the  JV  Interest.    The  NJMC  Shares  were  valued  at  $222,900
based on the closing price of the NJMC Shares ($0.0743) on the OTCQB market on January 29,
2016, the closing date of the transaction.  The total value of the consideration at the closing date
was $447,900.  A loss of $180,050 was incurred on the sale of the JV Interest after reducing our
investment by the amount received from an expired road use bond ($14,500).  At June 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015 we had an investment in joint venture of nil and $642,450, respectively.
At  June  30,  2016  and  September  30,  2015,  we  have  a  receivable  from  BHJV  for  expenses
incurred on behalf of BHJV in the amount of nil and $5,761, respectively.
During  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  we  sold  2,980,000  shares  of  Rae-Wallace  Mining
Company (“RWMC”), which had been previously written off, for $5,000.  At June 30, 2016, we do
not own any shares of RWMC.
NOTE 6 – AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE EQUITY SECURITIES:
Available-for-sale  equity  securities  are  comprised  of  3,000,000  restricted  shares  of  common
stock  in  New  Jersey  Mining  Company  (“NJMC”)  (the  “NJMC  Shares”)  (See  Note  5).    The
following table summarizes the Company’s available-for-sale equity securities:

NOTE 7 – COMMON STOCK, WARRANTS AND PREFERRED STOCK:
Private Placements
In September 2015, we closed a private placement of our common stock.  We sold 1,331,861
shares of common stock at a price of $0.375 per share for gross proceeds of $499,448.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we closed three tranches of a private placement offering
of  Units  of  the  Company  at  a  price  of  $0.15  per  Unit.    Each  Unit  consisted  of  one  share  of
common  stock  of  the  Company  and  one  common  share  purchase  warrant  (each  a  “Warrant”),

a price of $0.25 per share until May 31, 2019.  In the aggregate of the three tranches, accredited
investors subscribed for 10,000,006 Units on a private placement basis at a price of $0.15 per
unit for total proceeds of $1,500,000.00.  As a result, 10,000,006 shares of common stock of the
Company and 10,000,006 Warrants were issued and 10,000,006 shares of common stock were
reserved for issuance pursuant to Warrant exercises.
Stock Issued for Mineral Rights, Property and Equipment
In October, 2014, pursuant to a mineral property lease and option agreement for mineral claims,
we  issued  83,334  restricted  common  shares  with  a  value  of  $80,000  based  upon  the  closing
price of our shares of common stock on the date of issuance as quoted on the NYSE MKT.  The

Stock Issued for Stock Unit Awards
On March 3, 2016, we issued 675,000 common shares upon the exercise of Stock Unit Awards
granted  to  certain  employees  in  October  2015  for  compensation  related  to  modifications  to
employment  contracts.    These  Stock  Unit  Awards  had  a  value  of  $337,500,  which  was
recognized as salaries and benefits expense during the quarter ended December 31, 2015.
Warrants
10,000,006 and nil warrants were issued during the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and the
year ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  No warrants were exercised or expired during the
year ended September 30, 2015.  12,500 warrants expired during the nine months ended June
30, 2016.  There are 12,500 warrants outstanding with an exercise price of $3.00 per share that
expire  on  September  9,  2016,  and  10,000,006  warrants  outstanding  with  an  exercise  price  of
$0.25 per share that expire on May 31, 2019 .
Preferred Stock
We  are  authorized  to  issue  up  to  10,000,000  shares  of  preferred  stock,  $0.01  par  value.  Our
board of directors is authorized to issue the preferred stock from time to time in series, and is
further authorized to establish such series, to fix and determine the variations in the relative rights
and preferences as between series, to fix voting rights, if any, for each series, and to allow for the
conversion of preferred stock into common stock.
NOTE 8 – STOCK-BASED AWARDS:
During the year ended September 30, 2015 our Board of Directors adopted and our stockholders
approved the adoption of the Company’s 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan. This plan replaces our
2005 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended.  The aggregate number of shares that may be issued to
employees, directors, and consultants under all stock-based awards made under the 2015 Stock
and  Incentive  Plan  is  4  million  shares  of  our  common  stock.    Upon  exercise  of  stock-based
awards, shares are issued from the available authorized shares of the Company.  Option awards
are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of our stock at the date of grant.
The 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, terminated on May 28, 2015 and no stock or option
awards may be granted under this plan after it was terminated.   At June 30, 2016, 360,419 stock
options remain outstanding at an average exercise price of $1.32 and may be exercised under
the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended.
During  the  nine  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  43,837  stock  options  and  675,000  stock  unit
awards  were  granted  to  certain  employees  by  the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors  and  vested
immediately.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, 90,526 stock options expired, including
the  43,837  stock  options  granted  during  the  nine  months  ended  June  30,  2016.    Stock  unit
awards  are  awards  granted  under  the  Company’s  2015  Stock  and  Incentive  Plan  which  are
payable in common shares of the Company upon the occurrence of certain events, achievement
of  certain  milestones,  or  at  a  future  date.    Total  compensation  cost  of  options  and  stock  unit
awards for employees was $351,967 and $125,911 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015 respectively.  These costs are classified under salaries and benefits expense.  Total
compensation cost of options and stock unit awards for employees was nil for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  The fair value of the stock unit awards was determined by the
closing price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE MKT on the grant date.

Company’s 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
the stock at the time of the grant of $0.40 per share, vested immediately, and have a term of five
years.    The  Company  estimates  that  the  aggregate  value  of  the  options  issued  was
approximately $525,000.
In July 2016, the Company issued 100,000 shares of common stock of the Company to a
consultant pursuant to the terms of a January 2016 resignation and consulting agreement.  The
shares were not granted by our Board of Directors until July 2016 and were valued at $41,000
based upon the closing price of our shares of common stock on the date of issuance as quoted
on the OTCQB.

Corporate Background and History
We became an exploration-stage company in January 2004 with the change in the management
of the Company.  From January 2004 until March 2006, we were strictly a mineral exploration
company.  With our acquisition of a drilling services company and the acquisition of the Butte
Highlands  Gold  Project,  we  diversified  our  business  plan  to  include  drilling  services  and  an
exploration property with the potential to develop an underground mine with possible future gold
production.  Prior to the purchase of Timberline Drilling (formerly known as Kettle Drilling), we
had no reported revenues and only had accumulated losses. In June 2010, we acquired Staccato
Gold  Resources  Ltd.  (“Staccato”),  a  Canadian-based  resource  company  listed  on  the  TSX
Venture  Exchange  that  was  in  the  business  of  acquiring,  exploring  and  developing  mineral
properties with a focus on gold exploration in the dominant gold producing trends in Nevada.  As
a result of this acquisition, we obtained Staccato’s Eureka Property, which included their flagship
gold  exploration  project,  the  Lookout  Mountain  Project  (“Lookout  Mountain”)  and  the  Windfall
project,  along  with  several  other  projects  at  various  stages  of  exploration  in  the  Battle
Mountain/Eureka gold trend in Nevada, along with Staccato’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, BH
Minerals USA, Inc.  In September 2011, we announced that we had entered into a non-binding
letter of intent to sell Timberline Drilling to a private company formed by a group of investors,
including certain members of the senior management team of Timberline Drilling.  The sale of
Timberline  Drilling  was  completed  in  November  2011  for  a  total  value  of  approximately  $15
million and enabled the Company to focus exclusively on its core business of gold exploration
and development.  In August 2014, we acquired Wolfpack Gold (Nevada) Corp. (“Wolfpack”), a
U.S.  company  that  was  in  the  business  of  acquiring,  exploring,  and  developing  mineral
properties with a focus on gold exploration in the dominant gold producing trends in Nevada.  As
a result of this acquisition, we obtained cash and several projects at various stages of exploration
in the gold trends of Nevada.
Corporate Overview
Our  business  is  mineral  exploration,  with  a  focus  on  district-scale  gold  projects  such  as  the
advanced Talapoosa project and our Eureka project in Nevada.
Recent Events
On  March  12,  2015  (the  “Effective  Date”),  we  entered  into  a  property  option  agreement
(“Agreement”)  with  Gunpoint  Exploration  Ltd.  (“Gunpoint”),  which  closed  on  March  31,  2015.
 Gunpoint granted us an exclusive and irrevocable option (“Option”) to purchase a 100% interest
in Gunpoint’s Talapoosa project (the “Project”) in western Nevada.  Pursuant to the Agreement,
we have the right to exercise the Option at any time beginning on March 31, 2015 and ending
within thirty (30) months of March 12, 2015, unless sooner terminated (“Option Period”).  (See
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the transaction.)
14
On December 21, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company received a letter of resignation
from Mr. Kiran Patankar, pursuant to which Mr. Patankar resigned as Chief Executive Officer and
President of the Company effective January 20, 2016. Mr. Patankar claimed in his letter to the
Board  that  his  resignation  was  for  “good  reason”  as  set  forth  in  Mr.  Patankar’s  employment
agreement dated August 28, 2015.  As such, Mr. Patankar would be owed severance payments
by  the  Company  as  set  forth  in  the  agreement.    The  Company’s  Board  disagrees  with  Mr.
Patankar’s  characterization  of  the  resignation.    On  January  19,  2016,  the  Board  dismissed
effective  immediately  Mr.  Kiran  Patankar  as  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the
Company.
No amounts have been accrued in the Company’s financial statements as of June 30, 2016 for
severance benefits or claims.
Effective January 19, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company accepted the resignation of
Mr. Randal Hardy as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Hardy continues to serve as a
consultant to the Company.  Effective January 19, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company
appointed Mr. Steven A. Osterberg to serve as the Company’s President and Chief Executive
Officer and a director of the Company.
On  April  26,  2016,  Mr.  William  M.  Sheriff  resigned  from  the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors
effective  immediately.    Mr.  Sheriff  indicated  that  his  resignation  was  due  to  the  significant
demands  on  his  time  from  his  other  obligations.    He  expressed  confidence  in  Timberline’s
leadership and projects, and he further indicated that he intends to remain a large shareholder of
Timberline.
Mr. Leigh Freeman has been appointed to succeed Mr. Sheriff as the Chairman of Timberline’s
Board of Directors.  Mr. Freeman has been a director of Timberline for over three years and has
over 35 years of mining industry experience in a variety of technical, managerial and executive
positions with junior and senior mining and service companies, including Co-Founder of Orvana
Minerals and Chief Geophysicist at Placer Dome.  He is currently self-employed as a consultant
and serves in leadership roles for the Society of Mining Engineers and as an Advisor to Montana
Tech, University of Arizona, and South Dakota School of Mines.
Mineral Exploration
Talapoosa, Nevada
Talapoosa is a 14,870 acre district-scale property comprising US Bureau of Land Management
(“BLM”) claims, fee lands, and water rights.  Mineralized material at Talapoosa consists of 42.5
million tons of in-place bulk tonnage with an average grade of 0.03 ounces of gold per ton and
0.37 ounces of silver per ton.  The project was fully permitted by Miramar Mining Corporation with
the  BLM  and  the  State  of  Nevada  in  1996,  but  remained  undeveloped  due  to  low  prevailing
metals  prices.    The  deposit  is  open  on  strike,  and  we  believe  potential  exists  to  expand  the
quantity of mineralized material with additional exploration.  The acquisition includes the 4 mile-
long Appaloosa zone located one mile to the north of and parallel to the Talapoosa mineralized
area.  The Appaloosa zone outcrops as epithermal-type sinter and breccia with vein fragments
and is untested but for six historic, shallow drill holes.
In March, 2015, we completed a National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) compliant Technical
Report entitled “Technical Report and Resource Estimate on the Talapoosa Project, Nevada,”
dated March 24, 2015 (the “Talapoosa Technical Report”) substantiating the mineralization for
the Talapoosa project.  Upon completion of the Talapoosa Technical Report, we initiated an NI
43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) on the property.  Results of the PEA were
released on April 27, 2015 and reported positive results on a potential open pit mine with heap
leach  processing  and  Merrill  Crowe  recovery  of  gold  and  silver.    To  support  the  PEA,  we
completed due diligence reviews on the gold and silver mineralization; historic studies including
metallurgy, geotechnical pit wall stability, hydrology, geochemistry, mining methods, facility siting
for the previously proposed operation, and mine permitting.  A metallurgical and geotechnical test
program  is  currently  in  progress  and  is  designed  to  assess  the  potential  to  improve  heap
permeability and enhance gold and silver leach efficiency for the processing of the mineralized
material at the Talapoosa gold and silver deposit. The program has been designed to increase
the  already-substantial  metallurgical  test  results  incorporated  into  the  Company’s  Preliminary
Economic Assessment issued in May 2015.
Follow-up  work  is  planned  to  include  additional  metallurgical  studies,  drilling  for  additional
samples and to increase our level of confidence for certain parts of the mineralized zone, and
initiation  of  studies  to  update  historic  permits  to  current  standards.    These  activities  will  be
completed as soon as possible, subject to availability of sufficient financing.  Pending availability
of such financing, these activities will be completed and results will be incorporated into a NI 43-
101 compliant Preliminary Feasibility Study.
15
There  are  no  proven  and  probable  reserves  as  defined  under  United  States  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission’s  Industry  Guide  7  (“Guide  7”)  at  Talapoosa  and  our  activities  there
remain exploratory in nature.
Cautionary  Note  to  U.S.  Investors:  The  Talapoosa  Technical  Report  and  the  PEA  use  the
terms “mineral resource,” “measured mineral resource,” “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred
mineral  resource”.  We  advise  investors  that  these  terms  are  defined  in  and  required  to  be
disclosed  by  Canadian  regulations  (NI  43-101);  however,  these  terms  are  not  defined  terms
under Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements
filed with the SEC. As a reporting issuer in Canada, we are required to prepare reports on our
mineral properties in accordance with NI 43-101. We reference the Talapoosa Technical Report
and  the  PEA  in  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  for  informational  purposes  only  and  the
Technical Report and PEA are not incorporated herein by reference.  Investors are cautioned not
to assume that all or any part of a mineral deposit in the above categories will ever be converted
into Guide 7 compliant reserves.  “Inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty
as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be
assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher
category.  Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis
of  feasibility  or  pre-feasibility  studies,  except  in  rare  cases.    Investors  are  cautioned  not  to
assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally
mineable.
Eureka Project, Nevada
The  Eureka  Project,  which  includes  Lookout  Mountain,  comprises  an  area  of  approximately
15,000 acres, or more than 23 square miles.  The Eureka Project is located within the southern
portion of Nevada’s Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trend and includes three structurally controlled
zones of gold mineralization, each approximately 3- 4 miles in strike length, all zones of which
are  open  and  will  require  additional  in-fill  and  step-out  drilling.  The  project  has  an  extensive
exploration, drilling, and gold production history by a number of companies since 1975, including
Idaho  Mining  Corp.,  Norse-Windfall  Mining,  Amselco,  Echo  Bay  Mines,  Newmont  and  Barrick
Gold.  A  total  of  533  holes,  totaling  267,000  feet,  were  drilled  on  the  property  prior  to  its
acquisition by Timberline in 2010. Gold mineralization tested to date is typical sediment-hosted
“Carlin-type”  gold  mineralization,  most  of  which  may  be  amenable  to  low-cost,  heap-leach
processing.
In 2010-2011, we completed an exploration program that culminated in the release of an NI 43-
101  compliant  technical  report,  entitled, Technical  Report  on  the  Lookout  Mountain  Project,
Eureka County, Nevada, USA, dated May 2, 2011 (the “Lookout Mountain Technical Report”).
  The  Lookout  Mountain  Technical  Report  was  prepared  by  Mine  Development  Associates
(“MDA”) of Reno, Nevada under the supervision of Michael M. Gustin, Senior Geologist, who is a
qualified  person  under  NI  43-101. 
  The  Lookout  Mountain  Technical  Report  details
mineralization at Lookout Mountain.
Cautionary  Note  to  U.S.  Investors:  The  Lookout  Mountain  Technical  Report  uses  the  terms
“mineral  resource,”  “measured  mineral  resource,”  “indicated  mineral  resource”  and  “inferred
mineral  resource”.  We  advise  investors  that  these  terms  are  defined  in  and  required  to  be
disclosed  by  Canadian  regulations  (NI  43-101);  however,  these  terms  are  not  defined  terms
under Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements
filed with the SEC. As a reporting issuer in Canada, we are required to prepare reports on our
mineral properties in accordance with NI 43-101. We reference the Lookout Mountain Technical
Report in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for informational purposes only and the Lookout
Mountain Technical Report is not incorporated herein by reference.  Investors are cautioned not
to assume that all or any part of a mineral deposit in the above categories will ever be converted
into Guide 7 compliant reserves.  “Inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty
as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be
assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher
category.  Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis
of  feasibility  or  pre-feasibility  studies,  except  in  rare  cases.    Investors  are  cautioned  not  to
assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally
mineable.
The  Lookout  Mountain  Technical  Report  was  modeled  and  estimated  by  MDA  by  statistically
evaluating  available  drill  data,  utilizing  geologic  interpretations  provided  by  Timberline  to
interpret gold mineral domains on cross sections spaced at 50- to 100-foot intervals across the
extent of the Lookout Mountain mineralization, rectifying the mineral-domain interpretations on
level plans spaced at 10-foot intervals, analyzing the modeled mineralization using geostatistics
to  aid  in  the  establishment  of  estimation  parameters,  and  interpolating  grades  into  a  three-
dimensional block model.
In  2012,  we  released  updated  exploration  data  for  Lookout  Mountain  and  filed  an  updated
Lookout  Mountain  Technical  Report.      As  a  result  of  the  most  recently  completed  exploration
program, we have successfully extended the mineralized zone at Lookout Mountain 600 feet to
the  south  of  the  mineralized  zone  boundary  defined  in  the  2011  Lookout  Mountain  Technical
Report, and have expanded mineralization along the west margin of the deposit. Results from
Lookout Mountain, and from the South Adit area, significantly increased the currently reported
mineralization at Lookout Mountain.  In early 2013, we completed our 2012 exploration program
at  Lookout  Mountain,  including  26,140  feet  total  of  infill-drilling.    This  program  focused  on
expansion of mineralization, metallurgical, geotechnical, and permitting studies.
16
Assay  results  from  drilling  were  incorporated  into  an  updated  Lookout  Mountain  Technical
Report which was completed in early 2013.  Drilling also provided data for on-going metallurgical
studies directed at characterization of gold mineralization recovery, and for initial assessment of
pit-slope stabilities.  Permitting-related activities were advanced through completion of quarterly
monitoring, and installation of three monitoring wells. Initial site facilities (heap leach pads, mine
rock storage, access roads) have also been prepared.
In  2013,  we  continued  geochemical  waste  rock  environmental  characterization,  completed
independent  metallurgical  leach  testing,  continued  water  quality  monitoring  and  defined
hydrologic  work  plans.    We  also  continued  the  baseline  environmental  data  collection  and
analysis at Lookout Mountain.  In addition, we reduced costs by consolidating our Elko field office
into our Eureka facility.
During most of 2014, the Company limited exploration related activities to low cost field surveys
including soil and rock sampling, drill site reclamation, site archeological surveys, and geologic
mapping.  The mapping led to identification of new targets on each of the three structural zones
of gold mineralization.  In December, 2014 drilling resumed at Eureka with an initial test of one
new target completed before year-end.  Reverse circulation (RC) drill hole BHSE-171 identified a
new zone of gold mineralization and intersected 25 feet of 0.144 ounces of gold per ton (opt)
(7.62 meters (m) of 4.93 grams of gold per tonne (g/t)) within a longer 65 foot interval assaying
0.094 opt (19.82 m of 3.22 g/t) in the Lookout Mountain area.  This hole was offset 140 feet from
BHSE-152 (drilled in 2012) which first encountered the new zone in 2012 but was not completed
due to drilling difficulties.
In follow-up to the successful results in RC drill hole BHSE-171, two diamond drill core holes
were completed in January, 2015.  BHSE-172 intersected 25.2 feet of 0.15 opt (7.7 m of 5.02 g/t)
within an interval of 46.6 feet of 0.10 opt (14.2 m of 5.02 g/t).  BHSE-173 intercepted 57.4 feet of
0.06 opt (17.5 m @ 1.92 g/t).  The two core hole intercepts of the mineralized zone were offset
approximately 140 feet from BHSE-171.  The intercepts are well-correlated, as the gold occurs in
mineralized  collapse  breccia  within  the  pyritic  Dunderberg  Shale-Hamburg  Dolomite  contact
zone.    The  intercepts  are  thought  by  Timberline  geologists  to  be  related  to  stratigraphic  traps
associated  spacially  with  a  higher  grade  feeder  system  as  recognized  in  many  Carlin-type
systems.
Two  additional  RC  holes  were  completed  as  infill  drilling  within  the  existing  resource  area  at
Lookout Mountain.  Results were highlighted by hole BHSE-174 which intercepted 75.0 feet of
0.02 opt (22.9 m of 0.57 g/t) which is very consistent with surrounding intercepts.
We also completed a six-hole RC drill program on the Windfall target within the Eureka project.
 The drilling successfully tested on-strike, offset, and down-dip extensions of gold mineralization
that  was  previously  mined  at  Windfall.    Six  drill  holes  completed  over  a  strike  length  of
approximately  3,000  feet  intersected  gold  mineralization  consistent  with  results  from  over  600
historic drill holes, highlighted by BHWF-40 which intersected 80 feet at 0.09 opt of gold (6.1 m
@ 8.79 g/t).    The data for Windfall will support potential development of a resource estimate of
the gold mineralization at the project.
In order to prioritize our resources toward the development of Talapoosa, we are not planning
any material exploration expenditures at the Eureka Project in 2016.
There are no proven and probable reserves as defined under Guide 7 at the Eureka Project and
our activities there remain exploratory in nature.
Summary
We believe the global economic environment and monetary climate continue to favor a relatively
steady gold price for the foreseeable future.  While volatility is to be expected, our expectation is
that we can identify and pursue opportunities to advance our projects in spite of the current gold
price and market volatility.
As a company, we are considering strategic corporate opportunities with our focus on providing
for the advancement of our Talapoosa project.  In May 2015, we finalized a positive Preliminary
Economic Assessment (“PEA”) at Talapoosa, the results of which had been announced on April
27,  2015.    The  test  programs  currently  in  progress  are  designed  to  increase  the  level  of
confidence in the metallurgical conclusions that were incorporated into the Talapoosa PEA.
We  believe  that  with  appropriate  funding,  the  Talapoosa  project  can  advance  toward  the
preparation  of  a  pre-feasibility  study  for  an  anticipated  open-pit  mining  operation.    Subject  to
available capital, exploration programs at the Lookout Mountain and Windfall areas within our
Eureka project and at Seven Troughs may also continue.  We believe that management and our
board of directors have the knowledge and experience to evaluate strategic opportunities and to
provide for the advancement of our Talapoosa project toward a production decision.

Our consolidated net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $463,868 compared to
a consolidated net loss of $681,923 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  The year-over-
year difference is primarily attributed to significantly decreased exploration activity in 2016, which
led  to  decreased  manpower  and  lower  overall  costs.    These  costs  were  partially  offset  by
increased fees related to marketing our private placement financing.  Exploration expenditures
during  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2016  decreased  as  we  materially  reduced  our
exploration program expenditures due to our financial condition.
Our consolidated net loss for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 was $1,660,364 compared to
a consolidated net loss of $2,983,313 for the nine months ended June 30, 2015.  The year over
year cost reduction is primarily attributed to significantly decreased exploration activity in the nine
months ended June 30, 2016, which led to decreased manpower and lower overall costs.  These
costs  were  partially  offset  by  higher  stock  option  and  stock  issuance  expense  and  the  loss
incurred related to the sale of our interest in Butte Highlands JV, LLC.  In the nine months ended
June  30,  2015,  we  terminated  the  property  lease  on  the  Iron  Butte  property,  resulting  in  a
$426,000  charge  to  impairment  of  mineral  rights.    Exploration  expenditures  during  the  nine
months  ended  June  30,  2016  decreased  as  we  significantly  reduced  our  exploration  program
expenditures due to our financial condition.
Subsequent to the completion of our private placement financing in June 2016, we initiated a
metallurgical and geotechnical test program designed to assess the potential to improve heap
permeability and enhance gold and silver leach efficiency for the processing of the mineralized
material  at  Talapoosa.    Initial  program  results  from  the  crushing  and  permeability  testing  are
expected in August 2016, with further results expected by the end of 2016.  Subject to test results
and sufficient funding, additional metallurgical testing is anticipated to be performed in late 2016
and early 2017.
Subject  to  adequate  funding,  expenses  for  the  advancement  of  Talapoosa  and  exploration  at
Eureka are expected to continue in 2016.

Financial Condition and Liquidity
At June 30, 2016, we had assets of $17,198,559, consisting of cash in the amount of $770,627;
property, mineral rights and equipment, net of depreciation of $15,389,719, restricted cash held
for exploration bonds of $694,157, restricted common stock of NJMC valued at $300,000, and
other assets in the amount of $44,056.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company is a
going  concern,  which  contemplates  the  realization  of  our  assets  and  the  settlement  of  our
liabilities in the normal course of our operations. Disruptions in the credit and financial markets
over  the  past  several  years  have  had  a  material  adverse  impact  on  a  number  of  financial
institutions and investors and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies.  In
addition, commodity prices and mining equities have seen significant volatility which increases
the risk to precious metal investors.     Credit and market disruptions, among other things, make it
more  difficult  for  us  to  obtain,  or  increase  our  cost  of  obtaining,  capital  and  financing  for  our
operations.  Our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at
all.    If  we  are  unable  to  obtain  financing  through  equity  investments,  we  will  seek  multiple
solutions including, but not limited to, return of excess restricted cash held for exploration bonds,
asset sales, credit facilities or debenture issuances in order to continue as a going concern.
At June 30, 2016, we had working capital of $741,205.  As of the date of this report, we have
approximately $275,000 outstanding in current liabilities and a cash balance of approximately
$475,000.  As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not anticipate that we will
be able to continue as a going concern and execute our business plan for the next 12 months
without  receiving  significant  additional  capital.    Therefore,  we  expect  to  engage  in  financial
transactions  to  increase  our  cash  balance  or  decrease  our  cash  obligations  in  the  near  term,
which  may  include  equity  financings,  refunds  of  excess  restricted  cash  held  for  exploration
bonds, joint venture agreements, sales of non-core assets, credit facilities, debenture issuances,
or other strategic transactions.
We  are  working  to  increase  and  maintain  sufficient  working  capital  by  prioritizing  our
expenditures toward added-value activities and advancing transactions aimed at improving our
cash  position.    We  have  implemented  significant  across-the-board  salary  reductions;  reduced
staff, curtailed discretionary exploration expenditures; and reduced professional fees to preserve
cash.    We  are  also  working  to  increase  our  working  capital  by  exploring  multiple  financing
alternatives and the return of restricted cash deposits to fund the execution of our business plan.
We  recognize  that  we  will  not  be  able  to  execute  our  operating  plans  with  our  current  cash
balances.    However,  with  our  current  cash  balance,  our  expected  ability  to  acquire  additional
capital  and  complete  necessary  financing  transactions,  our  ability  to  curtail  discretionary
exploration  expenditures  as  needed  and  obtain  the  refund  of  excess  restricted  cash  held  for
exploration bonds, we believe that we will have sufficient working capital to meet our ongoing,
non-discretionary operating expenses for the next 12 months and maintain our primary mineral
properties.    Additional  capital  may  be  obtained  through  financing  transactions  such  as  equity
investments, asset sales, joint ventures, debt facilities, or other types of strategic arrangements.
We  plan,  as  funding  allows,  to  follow-up  on  our  completed  PEA  of  Talapoosa  with  a  pre-
feasibility  study,  which  is  expected  to  include  trade-off  studies,  further  metallurgical  tests,  and
analysis of milling and other processing scenarios.  Also subject to available capital, we may
continue prudent exploration programs on our material exploration properties and/or fund some
exploratory activities on early-stage properties.  We are revising our corporate and exploration
budgets  based  upon  potential  funding  opportunities  with  a  focus  on  the  advancement  of  the
Talapoosa pre-feasibility study.  While we believe our current working capital is sufficient to meet
our  currently  planned  exploration  costs  and  general  corporate  and  administrative  expenses
through the end of fiscal 2016, we recognize that we will require additional funding in order to
execute our operating plans and advance toward development of our properties.
Given current market conditions, we cannot provide assurance that necessary financing will be
available  to  us  on  acceptable  terms  or  at  all.    We  have  significantly  curtailed  our  corporate,
exploration and other expenditures, and we have strengthened our treasury by way of our recent
private placement financing; however, we recognize that we will still require additional funding to
provide  sufficient  capital  to  meet  our  planned,  non-discretionary  expenditures  for  the  next  12
months  and  maintain  our  primary  mineral  properties.    If  we  cannot  obtain  sufficient  additional
financing,  we  may  be  unable  to  make  required  property  payments  on  a  timely  basis  and  be
forced to return some or all of our leased or optioned properties to the underlying owners.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current
or  future  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  revenues,  results  of  operations,  liquidity  or  capital
expenditures.
19
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
See Note 2 to the financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report for a summary of the
significant  accounting  policies  used  in  the  presentation  of  our  financial  statements.  We  are
required  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  and  related
disclosures  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenue  and  expenses.    We  believe  that  our  most  critical
accounting estimates are related to asset impairments and asset retirement obligations.
Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows:
Asset Impairments
Significant property acquisition payments for active exploration properties are capitalized.  The
evaluation of our mineral properties for impairment is based on market conditions for minerals,
underlying  mineralized  material  associated  with  the  properties,  and  future  costs  that  may  be
required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale.  If no mineable ore body is
discovered,  or  market  conditions  for  minerals  deteriorate,  there  is  the  potential  for  a  material
decline in the value assigned to such mineral properties.
We review the carrying value of equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash
flows  expected  to  result  from  our  use  and  eventual  disposition.  In  cases  where  undiscounted
expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized
equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The factors
considered  by  management  in  performing  this  assessment  include  current  operating  results,
trends  and  prospects,  the  manner  in  which  the  equipment  is  used,  and  the  effects  of
obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors.
Asset Retirement Obligations
We  have  an  obligation  to  reclaim  our  properties  after  the  surface  has  been  disturbed  by
exploration methods at the site. As a result, we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the
reclamation costs we expect to incur at our Lookout Mountain Project.  We estimate applicable
inflation and credit-adjusted risk-free rates as well as expected reclamation time frames. To the
extent that the estimated reclamation costs change, such changes will impact future reclamation
expense  recorded. A  liability  is  recognized  for  the  present  value  of  estimated  environmental
remediation  (asset  retirement  obligation)  in  the  period  in  which  the  liability  is  incurred  if  a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The offsetting balance is charged to the related
long-lived asset. Adjustments are made to the liability for changes resulting from passage of time
and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the
obligation.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Not applicable.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Conclusions  of  Management  Regarding  Effectiveness  of  Disclosure  Controls  and
Procedures
At  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q,  an  evaluation  was
carried  out  under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  the  Company’s  management,
including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operations of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a – 15(e) and Rule 15d – 15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the
Company’s management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial
Officer, has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to
be disclosed by the Company in reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized
and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  applicable  rules  and  forms  and  (ii)  material
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
20
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred prior
to the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter and have continued to occur during the Company’s
most  recent  fiscal  quarter  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Prior to this fiscal quarter, due to changes in management and the temporary consolidation of the
offices of Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, the Company’s management
believes that such consolidation is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting and may result in material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting, including appropriate segregation of duties, review and signature authority,
and  accounting  knowledge  and  competency.  The  Company  has  addressed  these  potential
material  weaknesses  by  retaining  the  Company’s  previous  Chief  Financial  Officer  on  a
consulting basis to address accounting, financial, reporting, and other administrative obligations
and responsibilities.  The Company anticipates remediating these potential material weaknesses
on a long-term basis by appointing a new Chief Financial Officer in the near future and thereby
separating the offices of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer.
PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
We  are  not  aware  of  any  material  pending  litigation  or  of  any  proceedings  known  to  be
contemplated  by  governmental  authorities  which  are,  or  would  be,  likely  to  have  a  material
adverse  effect  upon  us  or  our  operations,  taken  as  a  whole.    No  director,  officer  or  affiliate  of
Timberline and no owner of record or beneficial owner of more than 5% of our securities or any
associate of any such director, officer or security holder is a party adverse to Timberline or has a
material interest adverse to Timberline in reference to any currently pending litigation.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
September  30,  2015  which  was  filed  with  the  SEC  on  December  29,  2015,  investors  should
carefully consider the following risk factors.
Management  changes  and  the  temporary  consolidation  of  the  offices  of  Principal
Executive  Officer  and  Principal  Financial  Officer  may  be  reasonably  likely  to  materially
affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
Certain  recent  changes  in  management  and  the  temporary  consolidation  of  the  offices  of
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer may be reasonably likely to materially
affect  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  may  result  in  material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, including appropriate segregation of
duties,  review  and  signature  authority,  and  accounting  knowledge  and  competency.  The
Company  has  addressed  these  potential  material  weaknesses  by  retaining  the  Company’s
previous Chief Financial Officer on a consulting basis to address accounting, financial, reporting,
and other administrative obligations and responsibilities.  The Company anticipates remediating
these potential material weaknesses on a long-term basis by appointing a Chief Financial Officer
in  the  near  future  and  thereby  separating  the  offices  of  the  Principal  Executive  Officer  and
Principal Financial Officer.
ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.
All unregistered sales of equity securities have previously been disclosed on Form 8-K.
ITEM 3.  DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.
None.

ITEM 4.  MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
We consider health, safety and environmental stewardship to be a core value for the Company.
Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
of 2010, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other
mine  in  the  United  States  are  required  to  disclose  in  their  periodic  reports  filed  with  the  SEC
information  regarding  specified  health  and  safety  violations,  orders  and  citations,  related
assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities with respect to mining operations
and properties in the United States that are subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and
Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine
Act”). During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, our U.S. exploration properties were not subject to
regulation by the MSHA under the Mine Act.
