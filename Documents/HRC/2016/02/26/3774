<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> the commitments made by the international community to achieve

Heads of State and Government, as expressed in the United Nations Millennium

drinking water, and to halve the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation, as 
agreed in the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development 
(&#8220;Johannesburg Plan of Implementation&#8221;) and the outcome document adopted at the High-
level Plenary Meeting of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on the Millennium

</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> World Health Assembly resolution 64/24 of May 2011, in which the 
Assembly urged Member States to, inter alia, &#8220;ensure that national health strategies 
contribute to the realization of water- and sanitation-related Millennium Development 
Goals while coming in support to the progressive realization of the human right to water 
and sanitation that entitles everyone, without discrimination, to water and sanitation that is 
sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable for personal and domestic 
uses&#8221;;   
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that approximately 884 million people lack access to improved

sanitation as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Fund in their 2010 Joint Monitoring Programme report, and alarmed that, every year, 
approximately 1.5 million children under five years of age die and 443 million school days 
are lost as a result of water- and sanitation-related diseases,  
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> the need to focus on local and national perspectives in considering the 
issue, leaving aside questions of international watercourse law and all transboundary water 
issues, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the recognition of the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, and the affirmation by 
the latter that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived from the right 
to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right to the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as the right to life and human 
dignity; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on the right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, including the progress in collecting good practices, the 
comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations conducted with relevant and 
interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports and collection of good practices, 
as well as the undertaking of country missions;  </p>

on practical solutions with regard to the implementation of the human right to safe drinking 
water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i> that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full 
realization of all human rights, and must take steps, nationally and through international 
assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its 
available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the right to safe drinking 
water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of 
legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Also reaffirms</i> the important role that national plans of action can play as 
tools for the promotion and protection of human rights, as highlighted in the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights 
on 25 June 1993, including for the promotion and protection of the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls upon </i>States:

the right to safe drinking water and sanitation on the basis of the criteria of availability, 
quality, acceptability, accessibility and affordability; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To assess existing policies, programmes and activities in the sectors of water 
and sanitation, giving due consideration to waste-water management, including treatment 
and reuse, and to monitor resources allocated to increase adequate access, as well as to 
identify actors and their capacity; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To develop comprehensive plans and strategies, including the definition of 
responsibilities for all water and sanitation sector actors, to achieve progressively the full 
realization of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation for all, or re-examine and revise

with the right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and to repeal, amend or adapt it in order 
to meet human rights standards and principles;

implementation of plans of action, projects and programmes in the sectors of water and

and non-discriminatory participation of all people and communities concerned, particularly 
people living in disadvantaged, marginalized and vulnerable situations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To set access targets to be reached in short-time periods for universal service 
provision, giving priority to realizing a basic level of service for everyone before improving 
service levels for those already served;  
</p>

<p> (<i>g</i>) To set indicators, including disaggregated data, based on human rights 
criteria,<footnote name="3">See A/65/254, paras. 22-48 and 53-60.  </footnote><b> </b>to monitor progress and to identify shortcomings to be rectified and challenges to 
be met; 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) To ensure financing to the maximum of available resources in order to 
implement all the necessary measures to ensure that water and sanitation systems are 
sustainable and that services are affordable for everyone, while ensuring that allocated 
resources are not limited to infrastructure but also include resources for regulatory 
activities, operation and maintenance, the institutional and managerial structure and 
structural measures, including increasing capacity; 
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) To provide for a regulatory framework aimed at ensuring that all water and 
sanitation service providers respect and protect human rights and do not cause human rights 
violations or abuses, and to ensure that national minimum standards, based on human rights 
criteria, are in place when water and sanitation services are decentralized, in order to ensure 
coherence and countrywide compliance with human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>) To provide for a framework of accountability that provides for adequate 
monitoring mechanisms and legal remedies, including measures to overcome obstacles in 
access to justice and other accountability mechanisms, and lack of awareness of the law, 
human rights and opportunities to claim these rights; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites</i> States to continue to promote, at all levels, including at the highest 
level, the full realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in 
forthcoming national, regional and international initiatives, inter alia, the Global Forum on

October 2011, in Mumbai, India, and the sixth World Water Forum in March 2012, in 
Marseille, France;

assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system, 
international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, in particular in the 
timely achievement of the relevant Millennium Development Goals, and urges development 
partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing 
development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action related to the 
right to safe drinking water and sanitation;
