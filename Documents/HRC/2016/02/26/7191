<p><b>                                          Human Rights Council 
7th Special Session 
</b></p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p><b>Resolution S-7/1.  The negative impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on 
the realization of the right to food for all 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions and decisions on the issue of the right to food 
</p>
<p>adopted in the framework of the United Nations, in particular by the General Assembly, in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 62/164 of 18 December 2007, and the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 7/14 
</p>
<p>of 27 March 2008, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> paragraph 10 of General Assembly resolution 60/251, in which the 
</p>
<p>Assembly stipulates, inter alia, that the Human Rights Council shall be able to hold special 
</p>
<p>sessions, when needed, at a request of a member of the Council with the support of one third of 
</p>
<p>the membership of the Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including its provision that 
</p>
<p>everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself or 
</p>
<p>herself and that of his or her family, including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication 
</p>
<p>of Hunger and Malnutrition and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in particular the 
</p>
<p>first Millennium Development Goal of eradicating hunger and extreme poverty by 2015, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights, especially its article 11(2), which recognize the fundamental right of every person to be 
</p>
<p>free from hunger, and the duty of States to take, individually and through international 
</p>
<p>cooperation, the measures needed to implement this right by improving the methods of 
</p>
<p>production, conservation and distribution of food, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit 
</p>
<p>Plan of Action of November 1996, and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years 
</p>
<p>later, adopted in Rome on 13 June 2002, </p>

<p>A/HRC/S-7/L.2 
page 2 
 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind also </i>the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, and 
</p>
<p>recommending the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing 
</p>
<p>for the fight against hunger and poverty, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to 
</p>
<p>Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food 
</p>
<p>and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
</p>
<p>footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming further</i> that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
</p>
<p>environment, at both the national and international levels, is the essential foundation that will 
</p>
<p>enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the complex character of the worsening of the current global food crisis, in 
</p>
<p>which the right to adequate food is threatened to be violated on a massive scale, as a combination 
</p>
<p>of several major factors, including macroeconomic factors, also impacted negatively by 
</p>
<p>environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, natural disasters and the 
</p>
<p>lack of the necessary technology to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries and 
</p>
<p>least developed countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>the situation of one sixth of the world population, mainly in developing and 
</p>
<p>least developed countries, suffering from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, and alarmed 
</p>
<p>at the particular effects of the current global food crisis on many net food importing countries, 
</p>
<p>and especially on least developed countries in Africa, Asia and Latin American and the 
</p>
<p>Caribbean, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that the international community should provide its assistance to populations in 
</p>
<p>need in an effective and coordinated manner, with the consent and in principle on the basis of the 
</p>
<p>appeal by the affected country, in order to ensure that such humanitarian assistance, including 
</p>
<p>the supply of food, reaches affected populations, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/S-7/L.2 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the United Nations Task Force established by the Secretary-General, and 
</p>
<p>supporting the Secretary-General to continue his efforts in this regard, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses</i> grave concern at the worsening of the world food crisis, which seriously 
</p>
<p>undermines the realization of the right to food for all; 
</p>
<p>2.  <i>Also expresses</i> grave concern that this crisis threatens to further undermine the 
</p>
<p>achievement of Millennium Development Goals, in particular Goal 1 aiming at halving by 2015 
</p>
<p>the proportion of people who suffer from hunger; 
</p>
<p>3.  <i>Calls upon </i>States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, 
</p>
<p>relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all necessary measures 
</p>
<p>to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to 
</p>
<p>consider reviewing any policy or measure which could have a negative impact on the realization 
</p>
<p>of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting 
</p>
<p>such a policy or measure; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Stresses</i> that States have a primary obligation to make their best efforts to meet the 
</p>
<p>vital food needs of their own populations, especially of the vulnerable groups and households, 
</p>
<p>such as through enhancing programmes to combat mother-child malnutrition, and to increase 
</p>
<p>local production for this purpose, while the international community should provide, through a 
</p>
<p>coordinated response and upon request, support to national and regional efforts by providing the 
</p>
<p>necessary assistance for increasing food production, particularly through transfer of technology, 
</p>
<p>as well as food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> States members of the United Nations and other relevant stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>participate actively in the High-level Conference on World Food Security: the Challenges of 
</p>
<p>Climate Change and Bioenergy, to be held from 3 to 5 June 2008, in Rome, organized by the 
</p>
<p>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, while taking note of the results of the 
</p>
<p>special meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council on this issue, held on 20 
</p>
<p>May 2008; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Invites </i>the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to extend an 
</p>
<p>invitation to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and to the Special </p>

<p>A/HRC/S-7/L.2 
page 4 
 
Rapporteur on the right to food to attend and actively participate in the afore-mentioned High-
</p>
<p>level Conference, so as to help to mainstream a human rights perspective in the analysis of the 
</p>
<p>world food crisis, with a focus on the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p>7.  <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to make a presentation to the Council at its eighth 
</p>
<p>session on his participation in the meeting mentioned in paragraph 5 above, and on his initial 
</p>
<p>recommendations regarding actions required, at all levels, to promote, respect and protect the 
</p>
<p>right to food and freedom from hunger in the midst of the current food crisis, when actions are 
</p>
<p>called for to promote mid- and long-term food security; 
</p>
<p>8.  <i>Also requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to present a report to the Council at its ninth 
</p>
<p>session, inviting comments from States and other relevant actors, on the impact of the global 
</p>
<p>food crisis on the protection of the right to food and the required remedies from a human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective; 
</p>
<p>9.  <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner for Human Rights to bring the present resolution to 
</p>
<p>the attention of all relevant international organizations and agencies; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue reporting on further 
</p>
<p>developments on this issue to the Council and the General Assembly; 
</p>
