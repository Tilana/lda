PRELIMINARY JOINT CONSENT STATEMENT/ PROXY STATEMENT /
PROSPECTUS — SUBJECT TO COMPLETION — DATED AUGUST 15, 2016
EXPLANATORY NOTE
On May 30, 2016, SemGroup Corporation (“SemGroup”), PBMS, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of SemGroup (“Merger
Sub,” and together with SemGroup, the “SemGroup Parties”), Rose Rock Midstream, L.P. (“Rose Rock”) and Rose Rock
Midstream GP, LLC, the general partner of Rose Rock (the “Rose Rock General Partner,” and together with Rose Rock, the “Rose
Rock Parties”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
Merger Sub will merge with and into Rose Rock, with Rose Rock being the surviving entity in the Merger as an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of SemGroup (the “Merger”).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of the common units representing limited partner interests in Rose Rock outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Rose Rock Common Units”) other than those (i) subject to outstanding
restricted unit awards of Rose Rock (the “Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards”) and (ii) held directly or indirectly by SemGroup or
any of SemGroup’s direct or indirect subsidiaries (all such Rose Rock Common Units, the “Rose Rock Public Units”), will be
converted into the right to receive 0.8136 shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable SemGroup Class A Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“SemGroup Common Stock,” and such number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock, the
“Merger Consideration”), and, upon such conversion, will be canceled and will cease to exist. No fractional shares of SemGroup
Common Stock will be issued in the Merger, and each registered holder of Rose Rock Public Units (each “Rose Rock Public
Unitholder”) who otherwise would have received a fractional share of SemGroup Common Stock in the Merger will instead
receive from the exchange agent a cash payment, without interest, in lieu of such fractional shares.
Prior to the Merger, SemGroup will hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the “SemGroup Special Meeting”) to approve (i) the
issuance of SemGroup Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement in connection with the Merger (the “Stock
Issuance”) and (ii) the adjournment of the SemGroup Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the SemGroup Special Meeting to approve the Stock Issuance (the
“Adjournment”).
At a meeting duly called and held on May 30, 2016, the board of directors of SemGroup (the “SemGroup Board”) unanimously
determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger and
the Stock Issuance, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, SemGroup and the holders of SemGroup Common
Stock (such holders, the “SemGroup Stockholders”); authorized and approved the Merger Agreement (in the form delivered to the
SemGroup Board) and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger and the Stock Issuance;
and directed that the approval of the Stock Issuance be submitted to a vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting and recommended
that the SemGroup Stockholders vote in favor of the Stock Issuance (such recommendation, the “SemGroup Board
Recommendation”).
The conflicts committee of the board of directors of the Rose Rock General Partner (such conflicts committee, the “Rose Rock
Conflicts Committee” and such board of directors, the “Rose Rock Board”) resolved, by a unanimous vote held on May 30, 2016,
that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including both the Merger and the execution, delivery and
performance of the Support Agreement, as defined below (such transactions, collectively, the “Merger Transactions”) are in the
best interests of Rose Rock considering the interests of the holders of outstanding Rose Rock Common Units other than
SemGroup and its affiliates (such holders, the “Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders”); approved the Merger Agreement and the
Merger Transactions, including the Merger (such approval constituting “Special Approval” as defined in the
Table of Contents
second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of Rose Rock (the “Rose Rock LP Agreement”)); and
recommended the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
Transactions, including the Merger, to the Rose Rock Board.
Based upon such approval and recommendation, at a meeting duly called and held on May 30, 2016, the Rose Rock Board
unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger
and the Support Agreement; declared it advisable and in the best interests of the Rose Rock General Partner that the Rose Rock
General Partner, on its own behalf and on behalf of Rose Rock, execute, deliver and perform the Merger Agreement and the
Support Agreement, and consummate the Merger and engage in all transactions related thereto, including the Merger; and, on
behalf of the Rose Rock General Partner, authorized and directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the holders
of outstanding Rose Rock Common Units (such holders, the “Rose Rock Common Unitholders”) and, as permitted by the Rose
Rock LP Agreement, authorized the Rose Rock Common Unitholders to act by written consent without a meeting in connection
with consenting to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
The SemGroup Board has set August 22, 2016 as the record date (the “SemGroup Vote Record Date”) for determining SemGroup
Stockholders entitled to vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting. If you are a SemGroup Stockholder of record as of the close of
business on the SemGroup Vote Record Date, you may vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting. See the section titled “The
SemGroup Special Meeting of Stockholders” beginning on page 29 of this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus.
The approval of the Stock Issuance requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the
aggregate voting power present at the SemGroup Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, provided a
quorum is present. The approval of the Adjournment requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a
majority of the aggregate voting power present at the SemGroup Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof,
regardless of whether a quorum is present.
The approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Merger by Rose Rock requires the affirmative vote or
consent of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Rose Rock Common Units (the “Required Rose Rock
Common Unitholder Written Consent”). Pursuant to the terms of a Support Agreement, dated as of May 30, 2016, by and
between Rose Rock Midstream Holdings, LLC (“Rose Rock Holdings”) and Rose Rock (such agreement, the “Support
Agreement”), Rose Rock Holdings, which as of August 9, 2016 beneficially owned 20,704,418 Rose Rock Common Units
representing approximately 56.2% of the outstanding Rose Rock Common Units, has irrevocably and unconditionally
agreed to deliver a written consent adopting and approving in all respects the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger (the “Rose Rock Holdings Written Consent”), within two business days after
the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus forms a
part. Once a sufficient number of consents to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, have been received, the consent process will conclude. The delivery of the
Rose Rock Holdings Written Consent by Rose Rock Holdings will be sufficient to approve the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, on behalf of Rose Rock.
The Rose Rock Board has set August 22, 2016 as the record date (the “Rose Rock Record Date”) for determining
holders of Rose Rock Common Units entitled to execute and deliver written consents with respect to the Merger. If you
are a Rose Rock Common Unitholder of record as of the close of business on the Rose Rock Record Date, please
complete, date and sign the enclosed written consent and promptly return it to Rose Rock. See the section titled “Written
Consents of Rose Rock Common Unitholders” beginning on page 28 of this joint consent statement/proxy
statement/prospectus.
This joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information about the proposed
Merger, the proposed Stock Issuance and related matters. SemGroup and Rose Rock both encourage you to read the
entire document carefully. In particular, please read “Risk Factors” beginning on page 21 of this joint consent
statement/proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of risks relevant to the Merger and the combined company.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following section provides brief answers to certain questions that you may have regarding the Merger Agreement,
the proposed Merger and the Stock Issuance. Please note that this section does not address all issues that may be
important to you as a SemGroup Stockholder and/or a Rose Rock Common Unitholder. Accordingly, you should
carefully read this entire joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus, including each of the annexes, and the
documents that have been incorporated by reference into this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus.
General Questions and Answers
Q. Why am I receiving these materials?
A. SemGroup and the Rose Rock General Partner have agreed to merge Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of
SemGroup, with and into Rose Rock, with Rose Rock being the surviving entity in the Merger as an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of SemGroup.
Each of SemGroup and Rose Rock is sending these materials to the SemGroup Stockholders and the Rose Rock
Common Unitholders, as applicable, to help them decide how to vote their shares of SemGroup Common Stock, or
deliver their consent with respect to their Rose Rock Common Units, regarding the matters described herein.
This document constitutes (i) both a proxy statement and prospectus of SemGroup and (ii) a consent statement of Rose
Rock. This document is a proxy statement because the SemGroup Board is soliciting proxies from the SemGroup
Stockholders in connection with the approval of the proposed Stock Issuance. This document is a consent statement
because the Rose Rock Common Unitholders are being afforded the opportunity to sign a written consent to the Merger
using this document. This document is a prospectus because SemGroup, in connection with the Merger, is offering
SemGroup Common Stock in exchange for outstanding Rose Rock Public Units.
Q. What will happen to Rose Rock as a result of the Merger?
A. If the Merger is successfully completed, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Rose Rock, with Rose Rock being
the surviving entity in the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of SemGroup. In addition, if the Merger is
successfully completed, Rose Rock Common Units will no longer be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange
(the “NYSE”). SemGroup is currently considering consummating certain internal “clean-up” mergers after the Merger
occurs, which would ultimately result in Rose Rock merging into SemGroup, with SemGroup being the surviving entity of
that merger.
Q. Why are SemGroup and Rose Rock proposing the Merger?
A. SemGroup and Rose Rock believe that the Merger will benefit both SemGroup Stockholders and Rose Rock Common
Unitholders. See “The Merger — Recommendation of the SemGroup Board and Its Reasons for the Merger” and “The
Merger — Reasons for the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee’s Recommendation.”
Q. When will the Merger be completed?
A. SemGroup and Rose Rock are working to complete the Merger as soon as possible. A number of conditions must be
satisfied before SemGroup and Rose Rock can complete the Merger. Although SemGroup and Rose Rock cannot be
sure when all of the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied, SemGroup and Rose Rock expect to complete the Merger
as soon as practicable following the SemGroup Special Meeting (assuming the Stock Issuance is approved at the
SemGroup Special Meeting). See the section titled “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Merger.”
Table of Contents

Q. What percentage of outstanding SemGroup Common Stock will Rose Rock Public Unitholders own after the
successful consummation of the Merger?
A. If the Merger is successfully completed, based on the number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock and Rose Rock
Common Units outstanding as of the date of this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus, Rose Rock Public
Unitholders will collectively own approximately 19.9% of the outstanding shares of SemGroup Common Stock following

Q. What are the interests in the Merger Transactions of the respective officers and directors of each of SemGroup and
Rose Rock?
A. In considering the recommendations of the SemGroup Board, SemGroup Stockholders should be aware that all of the
current executive officers and certain of the directors of SemGroup have interests in the Merger Transactions that may
differ from, or may be in addition to, the interests of SemGroup Stockholders generally. These interests may present
such executive officers and directors with actual or potential conflicts of interests, and these interests, to the extent
material, are described in the section titled “Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger Transactions” beginning on page
85 of this document. The SemGroup Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters,
prior to providing its approval and recommendation with respect to the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby.
In considering the recommendations of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and the Rose Rock Board, Rose Rock
Common Unitholders should be aware that all of the current executive officers and directors (and certain of the former
executive officers and directors who served since January 1, 2015) of the Rose Rock General Partner have interests in
the Merger Transactions that may differ from, or may be in addition to, the interests of Rose Rock Common Unitholders
generally. These interests may present such executive officers and directors with actual or potential conflicts of
interests, and these interests, to the extent material, are described in the section titled “Interests of Certain Persons in
the Merger Transactions” beginning on page 85 of this document. The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and the Rose
Rock Board were aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, prior to providing their respective
approvals and recommendations with respect to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Q. What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the SemGroup Special Meeting or the Rose Rock
action by written consent?

written consent and the materials may include multiple proxy cards, written consents, or voting instruction cards, as
applicable. For example, you will receive a separate set of voting materials for each brokerage account in which you hold

Questions and Answers Specific to SemGroup Stockholders
Q. When and where will the SemGroup Special Meeting be held?
A. The SemGroup Special Meeting will be held on                     , 2016 at             , local time, at Doubletree by Hilton Hotel
Tulsa at Warren Place, 6110 South Yale Avenue, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74136.
Q. Who is entitled to vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting?
A. If you are a record holder of SemGroup Common Stock as of the close of business on the SemGroup Vote Record
Date, you may vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting. See the section titled “The SemGroup Special Meeting of
Stockholders” beginning on page 29 of this document.
Q. Who may attend the SemGroup Special Meeting?
A. SemGroup Stockholders (or their authorized representatives) and SemGroup’s invited guests may attend the
SemGroup Special Meeting. All attendees should be prepared to present government-issued photo identification (such
as a driver’s license or passport) for admittance.
Q. What am I being asked to vote on at the SemGroup Special Meeting?
A. SemGroup Stockholders are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
•
Stock Issuance Proposal. A proposal to approve the issuance of SemGroup Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement in connection with the Merger.
Adjournment Proposal. A proposal to approve the adjournment of the SemGroup Special Meeting from time to time, if
necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the SemGroup Special
Meeting to approve the Stock Issuance Proposal.
Q. Why is the Stock Issuance, but not the Merger or the Merger Agreement, being considered and voted upon by
SemGroup Stockholders?
A. Under Delaware law, a vote of the SemGroup Stockholders is not required to approve the Merger or adopt the Merger
Agreement. Under NYSE rules, stockholder approval is required prior to the issuance of SemGroup Common Stock if the
number of shares of common stock to be issued equals 20% or more of the number of shares of common stock
outstanding prior to the issuance. The Stock Issuance is expected to result in the issuance of a number of shares of
SemGroup Common Stock equal to approximately 25.1% of the shares of SemGroup Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. Accordingly, SemGroup Stockholders are being asked to consider
and vote upon the Stock Issuance.
Q. What vote is required to approve each of the Proposals?
A. The approval of the Stock Issuance requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of
the aggregate voting power present at the SemGroup Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof,
provided a quorum is present. The approval of the Adjournment requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of
the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power present at the SemGroup Special Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, regardless of whether a quorum is present.
Table of Contents
viii
Q. What constitutes a quorum for the SemGroup Special Meeting?
A. The presence, in person or by proxy, of SemGroup Stockholders representing a majority of the shares of SemGroup
Common Stock outstanding on the SemGroup Vote Record Date will constitute a quorum for the SemGroup Special
Meeting.
Q. What if I do not vote my SemGroup Common Stock or if I abstain from voting?
A. The approval of the Stock Issuance Proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a
majority of the aggregate voting power present at the SemGroup Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, provided a quorum is present. The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote (in
person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power present at the SemGroup Special Meeting
or any adjournment or postponement thereof, regardless of whether a quorum is present. If you abstain from voting on
either of the Proposals, your shares of SemGroup Common Stock will be counted as present for purposes of
establishing a quorum, but the abstention will have the same effect as a vote against the Proposal from which you
abstain. If you fail to vote on either of the Proposals, such failure to vote will not affect the adoption of such Proposal,
except with respect to the Stock Issuance Proposal to the extent that your failure to vote prevents the establishment of a
quorum at the SemGroup Special Meeting.
The obligations of the parties to complete the Merger are conditioned upon approval of the Stock Issuance Proposal (the
“SemGroup Stockholder Approval”). Accordingly, a vote against or an abstention with respect to the Stock Issuance
Proposal, or a failure to vote on the Stock Issuance Proposal, to the extent such failure prevents the establishment of a
quorum, will have the same effect as a vote against the Stock Issuance Proposal and the Merger (although no vote for or
against the Merger is taking place).
Q. What proposals must be passed in order for the Merger to be completed?
A. The Merger will not be completed unless the Stock Issuance Proposal is approved.
Q. How does the SemGroup Board recommend that the SemGroup Stockholders vote?
A. The SemGroup Board recommends that SemGroup Stockholders vote FOR the Stock Issuance Proposal and FOR the
Adjournment Proposal.
On May 30, 2016, the SemGroup Board determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger and the Stock Issuance, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, SemGroup
and its stockholders. The SemGroup Board unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger and the Stock Issuance, and recommends that the SemGroup Stockholders
vote FOR the Stock Issuance Proposal and FOR the Adjournment Proposal. For more information regarding the
recommendation of the SemGroup Board, see “The Merger — Recommendation of the SemGroup Board and Its
Reasons for the Merger.”
In considering the recommendation of the SemGroup Board, SemGroup Stockholders should consider that some of the
directors and executive officers of SemGroup may have interests that differ from, or are in addition to, their interests as
SemGroup Stockholders. See the section titled “The Merger — Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger Transactions.”
Q. How do I submit my proxy for the SemGroup Special Meeting?
A. If you are a stockholder of record, you may submit a proxy via the Internet, by phone, or by mail. If you hold your
SemGroup Common Stock in “street name” with a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the instructions
provided by your broker, bank or other nominee. See the section titled “The SemGroup Special Meeting of
Stockholders” beginning on page 29 of this document.

ix
A. SemGroup Stockholders have one vote per share of SemGroup Common Stock on each proposal to be voted upon.
Q. If my shares of SemGroup Common Stock are held in street name by my bank, broker or other nominee, will my bank,
broker or other nominee automatically vote my shares for me?
A. No. If your shares of SemGroup Common Stock are held in street name, you must instruct the broker, bank or other
nominee on how to vote your shares. See the section titled “The SemGroup Special Meeting of Stockholders” beginning
on page 29 of this document.

A. Yes. Whether or not you plan to attend the SemGroup Special Meeting, you should vote by proxy. Your SemGroup
shares will not be voted if you do not vote by proxy or do not vote in person at the SemGroup Special Meeting.
Q. What happens if I sell my SemGroup Common Stock after the SemGroup Vote Record Date but before the SemGroup
Special Meeting?
A. If you transfer shares of your SemGroup Common Stock after the SemGroup Vote Record Date but before the date of
the SemGroup Special Meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting.
Q. May I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy card?
A. Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you can change your vote within the regular voting deadlines by voting again
by telephone or via the Internet, executing and returning a later dated proxy card, attending the annual meeting and
voting in person, or by delivering a written notice of your revocation to SemGroup’s Corporate Secretary at Two Warren
Place, 6120 S. Yale Avenue, Suite 700, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74136-4216. If you hold your SemGroup Common Stock in street
name, you should follow the instructions provided by your banker, broker or other nominee. See the section titled “The
SemGroup Special Meeting of Stockholders” beginning on page 29 of this document.
Q. Will I receive anything as a result of the Merger?

Public Unitholders will receive consideration in connection with the Merger. SemGroup Stockholders will not be entitled
to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.

Agreement and the Merger.

Q. What am I being asked to consider and vote on through the Rose Rock action of written consent?
A. Rose Rock Common Unitholders are being asked to consider and provide written consent for approval of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby pursuant to the terms of the Rose Rock LP Agreement.
Q. What Rose Rock Common Unitholder approval is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A. The approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Merger by Rose Rock requires the affirmative vote or
consent of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Rose Rock Common Units. Pursuant to the terms of the
Support Agreement, Rose Rock Holdings, which as of August 9, 2016 beneficially owned 20,704,418 Rose Rock
Common Units representing approximately 56.2% of the outstanding Rose Rock Common Units, has irrevocably agreed
to deliver the Rose Rock Holdings Written Consent within two business days after the effectiveness of the registration
statement of which this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus forms a part. Once a sufficient number of
consents to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
have been received, the consent process will conclude. The delivery of the Rose Rock Holdings Written Consent by
Rose Rock Holdings will be sufficient to adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the Merger on behalf of Rose
Rock.
Q. Can holders of Rose Rock Common Units change or revoke their written consents?
A. Yes. If you are a record holder of Rose Rock Common Units as of the close of business on the Rose Rock Record
Date, you may revoke your consent or, if you have previously revoked your consent, submit a new written consent at
any time before the consents of a sufficient number of Rose Rock Common Units to approve the Merger Agreement
have been delivered to the secretary of Rose Rock. As described immediately above, the delivery of the Rose Rock
Holdings Written Consent by Rose Rock Holdings (which delivery will be within two business days after the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus forms a
part) will be sufficient to adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the Merger on behalf of Rose Rock. If you
wish to change or revoke your consent before that time, you may do so by sending in a new written consent with a later
date by one of the means described in the section entitled “Written Consents of Rose Rock Common Unitholders —
Submission of Consents,” or by delivering a notice of revocation to the secretary of Rose Rock. If you hold your Rose
Rock Common Units in street name with a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by
your broker, bank or other nominee.
Q. How does the Rose Rock Board recommend that the Rose Rock Common Unitholders vote?
A. The Rose Rock Board recommends that the Rose Rock Common Unitholders vote FOR the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby.
On May 30, 2016, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and Rose Rock Board each unanimously determined that the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including both the Merger and the execution, delivery
and performance of the Support Agreement, are in the best interests of Rose Rock considering the interests of the Rose
Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders. The Rose Rock Board recommends that the Rose Rock Common Unitholders vote FOR
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. For more information, see “The Merger —
Recommendation of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and the Rose Rock Board.”
In considering the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger by the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and the
Rose Rock Board, Rose Rock Public Unitholders should consider that the directors and executive officers of the Rose
Rock General Partner may have interests that differ from, or are in addition to, their interests as Rose Rock Public
Unitholders. See the section titled “The Merger — Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger Transactions.”

Table of Contents
Q. Should holders of Rose Rock Common Units deliver their Rose Rock Common Units now?
A. No. After the Merger is completed, holders of Rose Rock Common Units (other than Rose Rock Restricted Unit
Awards) who hold their Rose Rock Common Units in certificated or book entry form will receive written instructions for
exchanging their Rose Rock Common Units. If you own Rose Rock Common Units (other than Rose Rock Restricted
Unit Awards) in street name, the shares of SemGroup Common Stock you will receive in connection with the Merger
should be credited to your account in accordance with the policies and procedures of your bank, broker or other
nominee within a few days following the closing date of the Merger.
Q. What will Rose Rock Public Unitholders be entitled to receive in the Merger?
A. Each Rose Rock Public Unitholder will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each Rose Rock
Public Unit held by such Rose Rock Public Unitholder. No fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock will be issued
in the Merger, and each registered holder of Rose Rock Public Units who otherwise would have received a fractional
share of SemGroup Common Stock in the Merger will, instead, receive, from the exchange agent, a cash payment,
without interest, in lieu of such fractional shares representing such registered holder’s proportionate interest in the
proceeds from the sale by the exchange agent of the aggregate number of fractional shares of SemGroup Common
Stock that Rose Rock Public Unitholders would have otherwise been entitled to receive. For additional information
regarding exchange procedures, please read “The Merger Agreement — Exchange of Units; Fractional Units.”
Q. What will holders of Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards be entitled to receive in the Merger?
A. At the effective time of the Merger, each Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award that is not vested and does not vest in
accordance with its terms (as set forth in an applicable award agreement) as a result of the Merger and that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, will cease to represent an award with respect to
Rose Rock Common Units and will be converted into an award with respect to shares of SemGroup Common Stock (a
“SemGroup Award”). Each such SemGroup Award will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were
applicable to the corresponding Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger,
with the number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock subject to each such SemGroup Award equal to the number of
Rose Rock Common Units that were subject to each such Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger multiplied by 0.8136 (the “Exchange Ratio”) (rounded down to the nearest whole share). Any
corresponding accrued but unpaid unit distribution rights (“UDRs”, as defined in the Rose Rock Equity Incentive Plan)
with respect to any converted Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards will remain outstanding and will continue to represent
an obligation with respect to the applicable SemGroup Award.
Q. Where will Rose Rock Common Units trade after the Merger?
A. Rose Rock Common Units will no longer be publicly traded following the Merger and will be delisted from the NYSE.
Q. What happens to future distributions with respect to Rose Rock Public Units?
A. If the Merger is successfully consummated, all outstanding Rose Rock Public Units (i) will be converted into the right
to receive SemGroup Common Stock and (ii) will no longer receive quarterly distributions from Rose Rock. For a
description of the differences between the rights of holders of SemGroup Common Stock and holders of Rose Rock
Common Units, please read “Comparison of Rights of SemGroup Stockholders and Rose Rock Common Unitholders.”
Q. What will happen to Rose Rock’s outstanding senior notes and secured credit facility in the Merger?
Table of Contents
xii
A. Rose Rock’s currently outstanding senior notes will remain outstanding after the Merger is completed, and no
“change of control” will occur thereunder. SemGroup is currently considering consummating certain internal “clean-up”
mergers after the Merger is completed, which would ultimately result in Rose Rock merging with and into SemGroup, with
SemGroup being the surviving entity of that merger. If SemGroup determines to consummate these internal mergers
after the Merger is completed, SemGroup, upon consummation, would directly assume and become the successor
issuer of Rose Rock’s outstanding senior notes. If SemGroup determines not to consummate these internal mergers
after the Merger is completed, then it is contemplated that SemGroup and its subsidiaries that currently are guarantors of
SemGroup’s outstanding senior notes will provide guaranties of Rose Rock’s senior notes once the Merger is
completed. In addition, it is contemplated that Rose Rock and its subsidiaries that currently are guarantors of Rose
Rock’s outstanding senior notes will provide guaranties of SemGroup’s senior notes and secured revolving credit
facility once the Merger is completed. In connection with the completion of the Merger, Rose Rock’s existing senior
secured revolving credit facility is contemplated to be terminated and SemGroup’s senior secured revolving credit
facility is contemplated to be amended and upsized to accommodate the needs of the combined company.
Q. What are the expected U.S. federal income tax consequences to a Rose Rock Public Unitholder as a result of the
Merger?
A. The receipt of SemGroup Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock in
exchange for Rose Rock Public Units pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders (as defined in
the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder
will generally recognize capital gain or loss on the receipt of SemGroup Common Stock and any cash received in lieu of
fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock in exchange for Rose Rock Public Units. However, a portion of this gain
or loss, which portion will likely be substantial, will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss to the
extent attributable to assets giving rise to depreciation recapture or other “unrealized receivables” or to “inventory
items” owned by Rose Rock and its non-corporate (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) subsidiaries. Passive losses
that were not deductible by a U.S. holder in prior taxable periods because they exceeded a U.S. holder’s share of Rose
Rock’s income may become available to offset a portion of the gain recognized by such U.S. holder. See the section
titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” for a more complete discussion of certain U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the Merger.
Q. What are the expected U.S. federal income tax consequences for a Rose Rock Public Unitholder of the ownership of
shares of SemGroup Common Stock after the Merger is completed?
A. SemGroup is classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, SemGroup (and not its
stockholders) is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income. A distribution of cash by SemGroup to a
stockholder who is a U.S. holder (as defined in the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”) will
generally be included in such U.S. holder’s income as ordinary dividend income to the extent of SemGroup’s current and
accumulated “earnings and profits” as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Any portion of the cash
distributed to SemGroup Stockholders by SemGroup after the Merger that exceeds SemGroup’s current and
accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital reducing a U.S. holder’s adjusted tax
basis in such U.S. holder’s shares of SemGroup Common Stock and, to the extent the distribution exceeds such
stockholder’s adjusted tax basis, as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such shares of SemGroup Common Stock.
See the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” for a more complete discussion of certain U.S.
federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of shares of SemGroup Common Stock.
Q. What are the expected U.S. federal income tax consequences to a holder of Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards as a
result of the Merger?
Table of Contents
xiii
A. The conversion of Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards into SemGroup Awards is not expected to be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the terms of the Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award agreements,
recipients of Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards must agree not to make elections under Section 83(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) at the time of grant. Accordingly, a holder of a Rose Rock Restricted
Unit Award will recognize ordinary income if and when the award, as converted into a SemGroup Award, vests. Such a
holder will recognize capital gain or loss, with the holding period measured from the date of vesting, if and when any
shares of SemGroup Common Stock underlying the as-converted SemGroup Award are disposed of. For more
information on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of shares of SemGroup Common
Stock following the vesting of any SemGroup Awards, see the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences.”
Q. Are holders of Rose Rock Common Units entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger?
A. No. Holders of Rose Rock Common Units do not have appraisal rights under applicable law or contractual appraisal
rights under the Rose Rock LP Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

Reasons for the Rose Rock Conflict Committee’s Recommendation; Recommendation of the Rose Rock Board (page
47)
The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee considered the benefits of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger
Transactions as well as the associated risks, and resolved, by a unanimous vote held on May 30, 2016, that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including both the Merger and the execution, delivery and
performance of the Support Agreement, are in the best interests of Rose Rock considering the interests of the Rose
Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders; approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger Transactions, including the Merger (such
approval constituting “Special Approval” as defined in the
Table of Contents
2

the consummation of the Merger Transactions, including the Merger, to the Rose Rock Board. For a discussion of many

Based upon such approval and recommendation, at a meeting duly called and held on May 30, 2016, the Rose Rock

Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the Rose Rock Common Unitholders and, as permitted by the Rose Rock
LP Agreement, authorized the Rose Rock Common Unitholders to act by written consent without a meeting in
connection with consenting to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger Transactions (page 85)
In considering the recommendations of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee to the Rose Rock Board and of the Rose
Rock Board, Rose Rock Common Unitholders should be aware that all of the current executive officers and directors
(and certain of the former executive officers and directors who served since January 1, 2015) of the Rose Rock General
Partner have interests in the Merger Transactions that may differ from, or may be in addition to, the interests of Rose
Rock Common Unitholders generally. These interests include:
Certain of the executive officers of the Rose Rock General Partner are also executive officers of SemGroup, and certain of
the directors of the Rose Rock General Partner are also directors of SemGroup.
The directors (including the members of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee) and officers of the Rose Rock General Partner
are entitled to continued indemnification (including advancement of expenses) and insurance coverage under the Merger
Agreement.
All of the executive officers and directors of the Rose Rock General Partner beneficially own Rose Rock Common Units, and
these executive officers and directors will receive the Merger Consideration upon completion of the Merger for each Rose
Rock Common Unit they hold.
All of the executive officers and directors of the Rose Rock General Partner hold outstanding Rose Rock Restricted Unit
Awards that have not yet vested. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each Rose Rock
Restricted Unit Award that is not vested and does not vest in accordance with
•

Table of Contents
its terms (as set forth in an applicable award agreement) as a result of the Merger and that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the effective time of the Merger, will cease to represent an award with respect to Rose Rock Common Units and will
be converted into a SemGroup Award. Each such SemGroup Award will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture
provisions as were applicable to the corresponding Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to the effective time
of the Merger, with the number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock subject to each such SemGroup Award to be equal to
the number of Rose Rock Common Units subject to each such Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), with any
corresponding accrued but unpaid UDRs with respect to any Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards to be assumed, remain
outstanding and continue to represent an obligation with respect to the applicable SemGroup Award. As described in greater
detail in “Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger Transactions — Treatment of Equity Awards” below, although there will
be no single trigger accelerated vesting of the outstanding and unvested Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards in connection
with the Merger, each Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award agreement pursuant to which the executive officers of the Rose
Rock General Partner have been granted Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards provides that the award will vest and become
nonforfeitable upon certain termination events, including a resignation by the executive officer for “Good Reason” (as defined
in the applicable award agreement) within two years following a “Change of Control” (as defined in the Rose Rock Equity
Incentive Plan). The Merger will constitute a “Change of Control” for these purposes.
•
All of the executive officers and certain of the directors of the Rose Rock General Partner beneficially own shares of
SemGroup Common Stock.
In considering the recommendations of the SemGroup Board, SemGroup Stockholders should be aware that all of the
executive officers and certain of the directors of SemGroup have interests in the Merger Transactions that may differ

incorporated by reference into this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus. You are encouraged to read the
Merger Agreement because it is the legal document that governs the Merger. For a summary of the material terms of the
Merger Agreement, please read the section entitled “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 92.
Structure of the Merger
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Rose Rock, and each Rose Rock
Public Unitholder will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange for each Rose Rock Common Unit that
such holder owns immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the separate existence
of Merger Sub will cease and Rose Rock and its subsidiaries will become wholly owned subsidiaries of SemGroup.
When the Merger Becomes Effective
The parties to the Merger Agreement have agreed to close the Merger on the next business day after the day on which
the last condition to completing the Merger is satisfied or waived or at such other time as the parties may agree. The
Merger will then become effective at the time and on the date on which a certificate of merger is filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State or at such later time and date on which the parties agree and specify in the certificate of merger. This
time is referred to as the “effective time of the Merger.”
Effect of the Merger
At the effective time of the Merger:
•
•
•
•
•
Each Rose Rock Public Unit will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and, upon such conversion,
will be canceled and will cease to exist.
Each Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award will cease to represent an award with respect to Rose Rock Common Units and will
be converted into a SemGroup Award as described in “Treatment of Rose Rock Equity Awards” below.
Each Rose Rock Common Unit owned by Rose Rock will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist and no
consideration will be paid in connection with such cancellation.
Each Rose Rock Common Unit held by SemGroup or any of SemGroup’s direct or indirect subsidiaries (excluding Rose
Rock and the Rose Rock General Partner) will remain outstanding following the Merger.
The limited liability company interests in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger will be converted into an aggregate number of Rose Rock Common Units equal to the number of Rose Rock Public
Units that are converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger.
If, before the effective time of the Merger, the issued and outstanding Rose Rock Common Units or shares of SemGroup
Common Stock are changed into a different number of units or shares, as applicable, as a result of any unit or share
split, distribution, combination, reorganization or other similar transaction, an appropriate adjustment will be made to the
Exchange Ratio.

comparative rights of Rose Rock Common Unitholders and SemGroup Stockholders, please read “Comparison of
Rights of SemGroup Stockholders and Rose Rock Common Unitholders” and “Description of SemGroup Common
Stock.”

Treatment of Rose Rock Equity Awards
At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award that is not vested and does not
vest in accordance with its terms (as set forth in an applicable award agreement) as a result of the Merger and that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will cease to represent an award with respect to
Rose Rock Common Units and will be converted into a SemGroup Award. Each such SemGroup Award will be subject to
the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to the corresponding Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, with the number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock subject to
each such SemGroup Award to be equal to the number of Rose Rock Common Units subject to each such Rose Rock
Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded
down to the nearest whole share), with any corresponding accrued but unpaid UDRs with respect to any Rose Rock
Restricted Unit Awards to be assumed, remain outstanding and continue to represent an obligation with respect to the
applicable SemGroup Award.

SemGroup Board Recommendation and SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change
At a meeting duly called and held on May 30, 2016, the SemGroup Board unanimously determined that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger and the Stock Issuance,
are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, SemGroup and the SemGroup Stockholders; authorized and
approved the Merger Agreement (in the form delivered to the SemGroup Board) and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger and the Stock Issuance; and directed that the approval of the Stock
Issuance be submitted to a vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting and recommended that SemGroup Stockholders vote
in favor of the Stock Issuance.
Subject to the exceptions described below, the Merger Agreement provides that SemGroup will not, through the
SemGroup Board:
•
•
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Rose Rock, the
SemGroup Board Recommendation; or
fail to include the SemGroup Board Recommendation in this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus.
SemGroup taking any of the actions described above is referred to as a “SemGroup Adverse Recommendation
Change.”
Subject to the conditions described below, the SemGroup Board may, at any time prior to the SemGroup Stockholders
approving the Stock Issuance Proposal, effect a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change if the SemGroup Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with SemGroup’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure
to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the SemGroup Stockholders
under applicable law.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the SemGroup Board (i) is not permitted to make a SemGroup Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a SemGroup Acquisition Proposal that does not constitute a SemGroup
Designated Proposal (each as defined below) and (ii) may not effect a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change
unless:
•
•
SemGroup has provided prior written notice to Rose Rock of its intention to make a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation
Change, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for effecting the SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change
(including, in the case of a SemGroup Designated Proposal, a description of the material terms of such SemGroup
Designated Proposal and a copy of any definitive agreement reflecting such SemGroup Designated Proposal) at least five
days in advance of its making a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change, unless at the time such notice is required to
be given there are fewer than five days remaining prior to the SemGroup Stockholder Meeting, in which case SemGroup is
required to provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the “SemGroup Notice
Period”); and
during the SemGroup Notice Period the SemGroup Board has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate,
with Rose Rock (to the extent Rose Rock desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement so that the failure to effect such SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change would not be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the SemGroup Board’s fiduciary duties to SemGroup Stockholders under applicable law
(provided that in the event of any material amendment to the terms of a SemGroup Designated Proposal, SemGroup is
required to provide a new notice as described above and a new SemGroup Notice Period will begin upon Rose Rock’s
receipt of such notice, except that such new SemGroup Notice Period in connection with any material amendment will be for
three days from the time Rose Rock receives such notice (as opposed to five days)).

Table of Contents
For purposes of the Merger Agreement:
•
•
the term “SemGroup Acquisition Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or “group” (as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), other than the Rose Rock Parties
or any subsidiaries of Rose Rock, relating to any direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions and whether by merger, consolidation, share exchange, share issuance, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation or otherwise):
•
•
•
of assets of SemGroup and its partially or wholly owned subsidiaries (including securities of subsidiaries), other than
NGL Energy Holdings, equal to 25% or more of the assets of SemGroup and its partially or wholly owned subsidiaries,
other than NGL Energy Holdings, taken as a whole;
of assets of SemGroup and its partially or wholly owned subsidiaries (including securities of subsidiaries), other than
NGL Energy Holdings, to which 25% or more of the revenues or earnings of SemGroup and its partially or wholly
owned subsidiaries, excluding NGL Energy Holdings (for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of
SemGroup’s most recently completed fiscal quarter), taken as a whole, are attributable; or
of “beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13 under the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of any outstanding
class of equity securities of SemGroup; and
the term “SemGroup Designated Proposal” means a bona fide written SemGroup Acquisition Proposal obtained after the
date of the Merger Agreement, which the SemGroup Board determines in good faith to be more favorable to the SemGroup
Stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, taking into account
all financial, legal, financing, regulatory and other aspects of such offer and any changes to the terms of the Merger
Agreement that as of the time of determination had been committed to by Rose Rock and the Rose Rock General Partner in
writing (provided that for purposes of the definition of “SemGroup Designated Proposal,” references in the term “SemGroup
Acquisition Proposal” to “25%” are deemed to be references to “50%”).
Termination
The parties to the Merger Agreement may mutually agree to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the
effective time of the Merger. In addition, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement on its own prior to the effective
time of the Merger if:
•
•
the Merger has not been consummated on or before December 31, 2016, provided that right to terminate the Merger
Agreement shall not be available to the party seeking to terminate if such party failed to perform or observe in any material
respect its obligations under the Merger Agreement in any manner that shall have been the principal cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date;
a governmental entity has issued a final and non-appealable order, decree, or ruling, or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, so long as the party seeking termination has complied with its
obligations under the Merger Agreement regarding certain filings, the SemGroup Stockholder Meeting, the SemGroup Board
Recommendation, commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to occur, and other further assurances;
the other party breaches any of its representations, warranties, or agreements in the Merger Agreement, or if any of the other
party’s representations or warranties becomes untrue and such breach (i) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, prior to
the Termination Date, and (ii) results in a condition to the Merger not being satisfied, provided that the party seeking
termination is not in breach of its representations and warranties under the Merger Agreement so as to give rise to a failure of
the condition to the other party’s obligation to close under the Merger Agreement;
•
Table of Contents

•
•
the SemGroup Stockholder Approval has not been obtained upon the conclusion of the SemGroup Special Meeting and any
adjournment or postponement thereof (provided that SemGroup is not permitted to terminate in such circumstance if the
failure to obtain SemGroup Stockholder Approval is proximately caused by a withdrawal, modification, or qualification of the
SemGroup Board Recommendation in a manner that is not permitted under the Merger Agreement); or
a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred in connection with a SemGroup Designated Proposal.
Separately, Rose Rock may terminate the Merger Agreement on its own prior to the effective time of the Merger if a
SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change occurs other than in connection with a SemGroup Designated Proposal.
In such circumstance, Rose Rock may only terminate the Merger Agreement within five business days after Rose Rock
and the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee have been notified, or otherwise become aware, of the SemGroup Adverse
Recommendation Change. However, if within such five business day period, Rose Rock does not provide SemGroup
with written notice of its intention not to terminate the Merger Agreement, then the Merger Agreement will be deemed
terminated.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (page 135)
The receipt of SemGroup Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock in
exchange for Rose Rock Public Units pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes to U.S. holders (as defined in the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”).
A U.S. holder who receives SemGroup Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock
in exchange for Rose Rock Public Units pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference between:
•
•
the sum of (i) the fair market value of SemGroup Common Stock received, (ii) the amount of any cash received in lieu of
fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock, and (iii) such U.S. holder’s share of Rose Rock’s nonrecourse liabilities
immediately prior to the Merger; and
such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Rose Rock Public Units exchanged therefor (which includes such U.S. holder’s
share of Rose Rock’s nonrecourse liabilities immediately prior to the merger).
Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder will generally be taxable as capital gain or loss. However, a portion of this gain
or loss, which portion is likely to be substantial, will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss under
Section 751 of the Code to the extent attributable to assets giving rise to depreciation recapture or other “unrealized
receivables” or to “inventory items” owned by Rose Rock and its non-corporate (for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
subsidiaries. Passive losses that were not deductible by a U.S. holder in prior taxable periods because they exceeded a
U.S. holder’s share of Rose Rock’s income may become available to offset a portion of the gain recognized by such U.S.
holder.
The conversion of Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards into SemGroup Awards is not expected to be a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the terms of the Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award agreements, recipients of
Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards must agree not to make elections under Section 83(b) of the Code at the time of grant.
Accordingly, a holder of a Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award will recognize ordinary income if and when the award, as
converted into a SemGroup Award, vests. Such a holder will recognize capital gain or loss, with the holding period
measured from the date of vesting, if and when any shares of SemGroup Common Stock underlying the as-converted
SemGroup Award are disposed of.

The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to a Rose Rock Common Unitholder will depend on such
unitholder’s own personal tax situation. Accordingly, you are strongly urged to consult your tax advisor for a full
understanding of the particular tax consequences of the merger to you.
For additional information, read the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”
Other Information Related to the Merger
No Appraisal Rights (page 91)
Neither the Rose Rock Common Unitholders nor the SemGroup Stockholders have appraisal rights in connection with
the Merger under applicable law. In addition, (i) Rose Rock Common Unitholders do not have contractual appraisal rights
under the Rose Rock LP Agreement or the Merger Agreement and (ii) SemGroup Stockholders do not have contractual
appraisal rights under the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of SemGroup (the “SemGroup Amended
and Restated Certificate”) or the amended and restated bylaws of SemGroup (the “SemGroup Amended and Restated
Bylaws,” and together with the SemGroup Amended and Restated Certificate, the “SemGroup Organizational
Documents”).
Regulatory Matters (page 91)
In connection with the Merger, SemGroup and Rose Rock intend to make all required filings under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and the Exchange Act, as well as any required filings or applications with the
NYSE and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. SemGroup and Rose Rock are unaware of any other
requirement for the filing of information with, or the obtaining of the approval of, governmental authorities in any
jurisdiction that is applicable to the Merger.
The Merger is not reportable under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR
Act”), and therefore no filings with respect to the Merger were required with the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) or
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”).
Listing of SemGroup Common Stock to be Issued in the Merger (page 91)
SemGroup expects to obtain approval to list the SemGroup Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
Agreement on the NYSE, which approval is a condition to the Closing.
Accounting Treatment (page 91)
The Merger will be accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification 810, Consolidation — Overall — Changes in a Parent’s Ownership Interest in a Subsidiary. As SemGroup
controls Rose Rock and will continue to control Rose Rock after the Merger, the changes in SemGroup’s ownership
interest in Rose Rock will be accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss will be recognized in
SemGroup’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as a result of the Merger.
Comparison of Rights of SemGroup Stockholders and Rose Rock Common Unitholders (page 104)
SemGroup is a Delaware corporation and Rose Rock is a Delaware limited partnership, so there are significant
differences under applicable Delaware state law in the rights of SemGroup Stockholders and Rose Rock Common
Unitholders. For more information concerning these differences, please read “Comparison of the Rights of SemGroup
Stockholders and Rose Rock Common Unitholders,” beginning at page 104.

You should consider carefully all the risk factors together with all of the other information included in this joint consent
statement/proxy statement/prospectus before deciding how to vote (in the case of SemGroup Stockholders) or whether
to deliver your written consent (in the case of Rose Rock Common Unitholders). Some of these risks include, but are not

“Risk Factors — Tax Risks Related to the Merger” and “Risk Factors — Risks Inherent in an Investment in SemGroup”:

The Merger is subject to closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the Merger not being consummated,
which may cause the market price of the Rose Rock Common Units and/or SemGroup Common Stock to decline.
Financial projections regarding SemGroup and Rose Rock may not prove accurate.
The number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock that Rose Rock Public Unitholders will receive in the Merger is based
upon the Exchange Ratio, which is a fixed exchange ratio. As a result, the market value of the shares of SemGroup Common
Stock that Rose Rock Public Unitholders receive for their Rose Rock Public Units in the Merger could decrease prior to the
consummation of the Merger.
The Rose Rock LP Agreement limits the duties of the Rose Rock General Partner to Rose Rock Common Unitholders and
restricts the remedies available to Rose Rock Common Unitholders for actions taken by the Rose Rock General Partner in
connection with the Merger that might otherwise constitute breaches of its duties.
The directors and executive officers of the Rose Rock General Partner may have interests that differ in certain respects from
those of the Rose Rock Public Unitholders, including potential accelerated vesting of their outstanding and unvested Rose
Rock Restricted Unit Awards upon certain qualifying termination events within two years after the completion of the Merger.
Certain directors and executive officers of SemGroup may have interests that differ in certain respects from those of the
SemGroup Stockholders.
SemGroup and Rose Rock will incur transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger.
Under the Merger Agreement, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, SemGroup
would be required to pay to Rose Rock either (but not both) (i) Rose Rock’s expenses up to $3.8 million or (ii) a termination
fee of $15.5 million, which could discourage a third party from making a favorable transaction proposal to acquire
SemGroup.
Rose Rock has no ability to enter into a transaction that is not approved by the Rose Rock General Partner, which is

affect the consummation of the Merger, SemGroup’s and Rose Rock’s respective businesses, operating results and
financial conditions, and the value of an investment in SemGroup Common Stock. This joint consent statement/proxy
statement/prospectus also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please read
“Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Risks Related to the Merger
The Merger is subject to closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the Merger not being
consummated, which may cause the market price of Rose Rock Common Units and/or SemGroup Common Stock to
decline.
The obligation of the parties to the Merger Agreement to complete the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
certain conditions, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
the delivery of this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus to Rose Rock Common Unitholders at least 20
business days prior to the Closing;
the receipt of all governmental consents and approvals, the absence of which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on SemGroup or Rose Rock;
the delivery of the Required Rose Rock Common Unitholder Written Consent in accordance with applicable law;
the continued effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus
forms a part;
the approval for listing on the NYSE of the SemGroup Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, subject to official notice of
issuance;
the absence of any decree, order, injunction or law that prohibits the Merger or makes the Merger unlawful; and
the SemGroup Stockholder Approval having been obtained in accordance with applicable law and SemGroup’s governing
documents.
The parties’ obligations are also separately subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:
•
•
•
certain fundamental representations and warranties of the other party relating to organization and existence, authorization to
enter into the Merger Agreement and to complete the transactions contemplated thereby and capitalization being true and
correct as of the Closing in all material respects;
the representations and warranties of the other party relating to the absence of changes that would have a material adverse
effect on such party and the absence of material damage, destruction, or loss to any material portion of assets of such party
or its subsidiaries being true and correct as of the Closing;
all other representations and warranties of the other party being true and correct as of the Closing, other than certain failures
to be true and correct that would not in the aggregate result in a material adverse effect on the party making the
representation or warranty; and
Table of Contents
21
•
the other party having performed or complied with all agreements and covenants required to be performed by it under the
Merger Agreement in all material respects.
If these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not occur, which may cause the market price of Rose Rock
Common Units and/or SemGroup Common Stock to decline.
Financial projections regarding Rose Rock and SemGroup may not prove accurate.
In performing their financial analyses and rendering their fairness opinions, the financial advisors to the Rose Rock
Conflicts Committee and the SemGroup Board reviewed and relied on, among other things, internal financial analyses
and forecasts for Rose Rock and SemGroup, which were prepared by employees of SemGroup, including those who
normally render services to Rose Rock. These financial projections include assumptions regarding future operating
cash flows, expenditures and income of Rose Rock and SemGroup. These financial projections were not prepared with a
view to public disclosure, are subject to significant economic, competitive, industry and other uncertainties, and may not
be achieved in full, at all, or within projected timeframes. The failure of Rose Rock’s or SemGroup’s businesses to
achieve projected results, including projected cash flows, could have a material adverse effect on the price of SemGroup
Common Stock, SemGroup’s financial position and SemGroup’s ability to maintain or increase its dividends following
the Merger.
The number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock that Rose Rock Public Unitholders will be entitled to receive in the
Merger is based upon the Exchange Ratio, which is a fixed exchange ratio. As a result, the market value of the shares of
SemGroup Common Stock that Rose Rock Public Unitholders receive for their Rose Rock Public Units in the Merger
could decrease prior to the consummation of the Merger.
The Exchange Ratio is fixed, meaning that it does not change and is not dependent upon the relative values of Rose
Rock Public Units and SemGroup Common Stock. Therefore, there is no “price protection” mechanism contained in the
Merger Agreement that would adjust the number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock that Rose Rock Public
Unitholders will receive based on any decreases in the trading price of SemGroup Common Stock or increases in the
trading price of Rose Rock Common Units. If the price of SemGroup Common Stock decreases because of changes in
SemGroup’s business, operations, or prospects, market reactions to the Merger, general market and economic
conditions, or any other factors, such as an announcement by SemGroup that it will pursue another merger or
acquisition or an equity or debt offering, the market value of the shares of SemGroup Common Stock received by Rose
Rock Public Unitholders will also decrease. If SemGroup engages in any such transactions and the market price of
SemGroup Common Stock declines in value as a result, Rose Rock Public Unitholders will receive less value for their
Rose Rock Public Units than the value calculated pursuant to the Exchange Ratio on the date the Merger was
announced. For historical and current market prices of Rose Rock Common Units and SemGroup Common Stock,
please read the “Market Price and Cash Distribution Information” section of this joint consent statement/proxy
statement/prospectus.
The Rose Rock LP Agreement limits the duties of the Rose Rock General Partner to Rose Rock Common Unitholders
and restricts the remedies available to Rose Rock Common Unitholders for actions taken by the Rose Rock General
Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of its duties.
Under the Rose Rock LP Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest arises between the Rose Rock General
Partner or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and Rose Rock, its subsidiaries or any partner of Rose Rock, on the
other, any resolution or course of action by the Rose Rock General Partner or its affiliates in respect of such conflict of
interest will be permitted and deemed approved by all partners of Rose Rock and will not breach the Rose Rock LP
Agreement or any duty in law or equity, if such resolution or course of action is:
•
•
approved by a majority of the members of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee acting in good faith (as referred to elsewhere
in this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus, such approval constituting “Special Approval” under the Rose
Rock LP Agreement);
approved by the vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding Rose Rock Common Units (excluding Rose Rock Common
Units owned by the Rose Rock General Partner and its affiliates);
Table of Contents
22
•
•
on terms no less favorable to Rose Rock than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties; or
fair and reasonable to Rose Rock, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including
other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to Rose Rock).
For more information concerning the differing applications of duties to corporations and limited partnerships, please
read “Comparison of the Rights of SemGroup Stockholders and Rose Rock Common Unitholders — Fiduciary Duties;
Conflicts of Interest” beginning at page 128.
In light of potential conflicts of interest between SemGroup and the Rose Rock General Partner, on the one hand, and
Rose Rock and the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders, on the other hand, the Rose Rock Board submitted the Merger
and related matters to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee for Special Approval.
The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee reviewed, negotiated and evaluated the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreement,
the Merger and related matters on behalf of Rose Rock and the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders. The Rose Rock
Conflicts Committee resolved, by a unanimous vote held on May 30, 2016, that the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including both the Merger and the execution, delivery and performance of the
Support Agreement, are in the best interests of Rose Rock considering the interests of the Rose Rock Unaffiliated
Unitholders; approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger Transactions, including the Merger; and recommended the
approval of the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement and the consummation of the Merger Transactions,
including the Merger, to the Rose Rock Board. As described above, the duties of the Rose Rock General Partner, the
Rose Rock Board and the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee to Rose Rock Common Unitholders in connection with the
Merger are substantially limited by the Rose Rock LP Agreement.
The directors and executive officers of the Rose Rock General Partner may have interests that differ in certain respects
from those of the Rose Rock Public Unitholders, including potential accelerated vesting of their outstanding and
unvested Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards upon certain qualifying termination events within two years after the
completion of the Merger.
In considering the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger by the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and the
Rose Rock Board, Rose Rock Public Unitholders should consider that some of the directors and executive officers of
the Rose Rock General Partner who are not members of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee may have interests that
differ from, or are in addition to, their interests as Rose Rock Public Unitholders. See the section titled “The Merger —
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger Transactions” beginning on page 85 of this document.
In particular, all of the executive officers and directors of the Rose Rock General Partner (and all of the executive officers
and certain of the directors of SemGroup in connection with services provided to Rose Rock) hold outstanding Rose
Rock Restricted Unit Awards that have not yet vested. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the
Merger, each Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award that is not vested and does not vest in accordance with its terms (as set
forth in an applicable award agreement) as a result of the Merger and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger, will cease to represent an award with respect to Rose Rock Common Units and will be
converted into a SemGroup Award. Each such SemGroup Award will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture
provisions as were applicable to the corresponding Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to the effective
time of the Merger, with the number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock subject to each such SemGroup Award to be
equal to the number of Rose Rock Common Units subject to each such Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award immediately
prior to the effective time of the Merger multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), with
any corresponding accrued but unpaid UDRs with respect to any Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards to be assumed,
remain outstanding and continue to represent an obligation with respect to the applicable SemGroup Award.
Table of Contents
23
Although there will be no acceleration of vesting of any of the outstanding and unvested Rose Rock Restricted Unit
Awards in connection with the Merger, as described further below, certain provisions applicable to the Rose Rock
Restricted Unit Awards that will carry over to the SemGroup Awards could, under certain circumstances, result in the
accelerated vesting of as-converted SemGroup Awards. In particular, each Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award agreement
pursuant to which the executive officers of the Rose Rock General Partner have been granted Rose Rock Restricted Unit
Awards provides that all unvested Rose Rock Restricted Units held by an executive officer will vest and become
nonforfeitable on certain termination events, including the executive officer’s termination of his or her employment for
“Good Reason” (as defined in the award agreement) within two years after a “Change of Control” (as defined in the Rose
Rock Equity Incentive Plan). These provisions will carry over and apply to the as-converted SemGroup Awards. In
particular, because the Merger will constitute a “Change of Control” for purposes of the Rose Rock Restricted Unit
Awards, the vesting acceleration described above would be triggered by an executive officer’s termination of his or her
employment for “Good Reason” within two years after the effective time of the Merger.
Certain directors and executive officers of SemGroup may have interests that differ in certain respects from those of the
SemGroup Stockholders.
In considering the SemGroup Board Recommendation, the SemGroup Stockholders should consider that some of the
directors and executive officers of SemGroup may have interests that differ from, or are in addition to, their interests as
SemGroup Stockholders. See the section titled “The Merger — Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger Transactions”
beginning on page 85 of this document.
SemGroup and Rose Rock will incur transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger.
SemGroup and Rose Rock expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with
completing the Merger, which are currently estimated to total approximately $8 million. Non-recurring transaction costs
include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial, and accounting advisors, filing fees, and printing costs. There
can be no assurance that the elimination of certain costs as a result of the Merger will offset the incremental transaction-
related costs over time. Thus, any net cost savings may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all.
Under the Merger Agreement, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, SemGroup
would be required to pay to Rose Rock either (but not both) (i) Rose Rock’s expenses up to $3.8 million or (ii) a
termination fee of $15.5 million, which could discourage a third party from making a favorable transaction proposal to
acquire SemGroup.
The Merger Agreement provides that SemGroup is required to reimburse the expenses of Rose Rock in an aggregate
amount not to exceed $3.8 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Rose Rock or SemGroup pursuant to a
failure to obtain the SemGroup Stockholder Approval at the SemGroup Special Meeting, and not following the
occurrence of a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change made for any reason.
The Merger Agreement provides that SemGroup is required to pay a termination fee of $15.5 million to Rose Rock if the
Merger Agreement is terminated by:
•
•
•
•
Rose Rock following a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change made in connection with a SemGroup Designated
Proposal;
Rose Rock following a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change for any reason;
Rose Rock or SemGroup, pursuant to a failure to obtain the SemGroup Stockholder Approval at the SemGroup Special
Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) following the occurrence of a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation
Change made in connection with a SemGroup Designated Proposal; or
SemGroup following a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change made in connection with a SemGroup Designated
Proposal.
Table of Contents
24
These provisions could discourage third parties that may have interest in acquiring all or a significant part of SemGroup
from considering or proposing such an acquisition, or could result in a potential acquirer of SemGroup proposing to pay
a lower price than it would otherwise have proposed to pay if the added expense of either the expense reimbursement or
termination fee was not payable. See “The Merger Agreement — SemGroup Board Recommendation and SemGroup
Adverse Recommendation Change,” “The Merger Agreement — Termination,” and “The Merger — Expense
Reimbursement and Termination Fee.”
Rose Rock has no ability to enter into a transaction that is not approved by the Rose Rock General Partner, which is
controlled by SemGroup.
SemGroup controls the Rose Rock General Partner, which in turn controls Rose Rock. Accordingly, any transaction
entered into by Rose Rock would need to be approved by the Rose Rock General Partner. Because SemGroup controls
the Rose Rock General Partner, SemGroup could effectively block Rose Rock from entering into any transaction that
SemGroup does not support.
Tax Risks Related to the Merger
The tax liability of a Rose Rock Public Unitholder as a result of the Merger could be more than expected.
As a result of the Merger, a Rose Rock Public Unitholder will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
equal to the difference between the amount realized and its adjusted tax basis in its Rose Rock Public Units. Rose Rock
Public Unitholders will receive SemGroup Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of SemGroup Common
Stock as the Merger Consideration. Because the value of any SemGroup Common Stock received in the Merger will not
be known until the effective time of the Merger, a Rose Rock Public Unitholder will not be able to determine its amount
realized, and therefore its taxable gain or loss, until such time. In addition, because prior distributions in excess of a
Rose Rock Public Unitholder’s allocable share of Rose Rock’s net taxable income decrease such Rose Rock Public
Unitholder’s tax basis in its Rose Rock Public Units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to
such Rose Rock Public Units will, in effect, become taxable income to a Rose Rock Public Unitholder if the aggregate
value of the consideration received in the Merger is greater than such Rose Rock Public Unitholder’s adjusted tax basis
in its Rose Rock Public Units, even if the aggregate value of the consideration received in the Merger is less than such
Rose Rock Public Unitholder’s original cost basis in its Rose Rock Public Units. Furthermore, a portion of this gain or
loss, which portion will likely be substantial, will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss to the
extent attributable to assets giving rise to depreciation recapture or other “unrealized receivables” or to “inventory
items” owned by Rose Rock and its subsidiaries.
For a more complete discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, please read “Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”
Rose Rock Public Unitholders will receive no cash consideration, other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of
SemGroup Common Stock, with which to pay any potential tax liability resulting from the Merger.
Although Rose Rock Public Unitholders will receive no cash consideration in the merger other than any cash received in
lieu of fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock, the receipt of SemGroup Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock by Rose Rock Public Unitholders in exchange for Rose Rock Public
Units in the Merger will be treated as a taxable sale by such unitholders of such common units for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The amount of gain or loss recognized by each Rose Rock Public Unitholder in the Merger will vary
depending on each Rose Rock Public Unitholder’s particular situation, including the fair market value of the SemGroup
Common Stock and the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock received by such
unitholder in the Merger, the adjusted tax basis of the Rose Rock Public Units exchanged by such unitholder in the
Merger and the amount of any suspended passive losses that may be available to a particular unitholder to offset a
portion of the gain recognized by such unitholder.
Table of Contents
25
Consequently, a Rose Rock Public Unitholder will receive no cash consideration, other than cash received in lieu of
fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock, with which to pay any potential U.S. federal income tax liability resulting
from the Merger.
For a more complete discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, please read “Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”
The U.S. federal income tax treatment to Rose Rock Public Unitholders with respect to owning and disposing of any
shares of SemGroup Common Stock received in the Merger will be different than their U.S. federal income tax treatment
with respect to owning and disposing of their Rose Rock Public Units.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, Rose Rock is classified as a partnership, and thus, is not generally a taxable entity
and generally incurs no U.S. federal income tax liability. Instead, each Rose Rock Public Unitholder is required to take
into account such unitholder’s share of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction of Rose Rock in computing its U.S.
federal income tax liability, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to such Rose Rock Public Unitholder by
Rose Rock. A distribution of cash by Rose Rock to a Rose Rock Public Unitholder who is a U.S. holder (as defined in the
section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”) is generally not taxable for U.S. federal income tax
purposes unless the amount of cash distributed is in excess of the Rose Rock Public Unitholder’s adjusted tax basis in
its Rose Rock Public Units. In contrast, SemGroup is classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
and thus, SemGroup (and not its stockholders) is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income. A distribution
of cash by SemGroup to a stockholder who is a U.S. holder will generally be included in such U.S. holder’s income as
ordinary dividend income to the extent of SemGroup’s current and accumulated “earnings and profits,” as determined
under U.S. federal income tax principles. A portion of the cash distributed to SemGroup Stockholders by SemGroup after
the Merger may exceed SemGroup’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Cash distributions in excess of
SemGroup’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital, reducing a
U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such stockholder’s SemGroup Common Stock and, to the extent the cash distribution
exceeds such stockholder’s adjusted tax basis, as gain from the sale or exchange of such shares of SemGroup
Common Stock.
Please read “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” for a more complete discussion of certain U.S. federal
income tax consequences of owning and disposing of SemGroup Common Stock.
Risks Inherent in an Investment in SemGroup
The SemGroup Common Stock to be received by Rose Rock Public Unitholders as a result of the Merger has different
rights from Rose Rock Common Units.
Following completion of the merger, Rose Rock Public Unitholders will no longer hold Rose Rock Common Units, but
will instead hold shares of SemGroup Common Stock. SemGroup is a corporation and Rose Rock is a limited
partnership. There are important differences between the rights of Rose Rock Common Unitholders and the rights of
SemGroup Stockholders. See “Comparison of Rights of SemGroup Stockholders and Rose Rock Common Unitholders”
for a discussion of the different rights associated with Rose Rock Common Units and SemGroup Common Stock.
SemGroup may only declare and pay dividends in accordance with the DGCL.
Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), the SemGroup Board may not authorize
payment of a dividend unless it is either (i) paid out of surplus, as calculated in accordance with the DGCL, or (ii) if
SemGroup does not have a surplus, paid out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the
preceding fiscal year. If SemGroup is unable to authorize payment of dividends in accordance with the DGCL, a decline
in the market price or liquidity, or both, of the SemGroup Common Stock could result. This may in turn result in losses by
SemGroup Stockholders.
Table of Contents
26
The price of SemGroup Common Stock may be volatile, and holders of SemGroup Common Stock could lose a
significant portion of their assets.
The market price of SemGroup Common Stock could be volatile, and SemGroup Stockholders may not be able to resell
their shares of SemGroup Common Stock at or above the price at which they acquired such shares of SemGroup
Common Stock due to fluctuations in the market price of SemGroup Common Stock, including changes in price caused
by factors unrelated to SemGroup’s operating performance or prospects.
Specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for SemGroup Common Stock include:
•
•
•
•
•
failure to complete, or significant delays in completing, the Merger;
changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding SemGroup Common Stock, other
companies comparable to SemGroup or companies in the industries SemGroup serves;
actual or anticipated fluctuations in SemGroup’s operating results or future prospects;
reaction to SemGroup’s public announcements;
strategic actions taken by SemGroup or its competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;
•
•
•
•
•
the recruitment or departure of key personnel;
new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to SemGroup’s business and
operations;
changes in tax or accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;
adverse conditions in the financial markets or general U.S. or international economic conditions, including those resulting
from war, incidents of terrorism and responses to such events; and
sales of SemGroup Common Stock by SemGroup, members of its management team or significant stockholders.

THE SEMGROUP SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
SemGroup is providing this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus to the SemGroup Stockholders in
connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the SemGroup Special Meeting that SemGroup has called for
the purposes described below. This joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus is first being mailed to
SemGroup Stockholders on or about                     , 2016 and provides SemGroup Stockholders with the information they
need to know about the Merger and the Proposals to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the SemGroup
Special Meeting.
Date, Time and Place
The SemGroup Special Meeting will be held on                     , 2016 at             , local time, at Doubletree by Hilton Hotel Tulsa
at Warren Place, 6110 South Yale Avenue, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74136. At the SemGroup Special Meeting, SemGroup
Stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the two proposals described immediately below.
Proposal 1 — Stock Issuance Proposal
Proposal 1 is a proposal to approve the issuance of SemGroup Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement in connection with the Merger.
If the Merger is completed, each Rose Rock Public Unit outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger
will be converted into the right to receive 0.8136 shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable SemGroup
Common Stock and, upon such conversion, will be canceled and will cease to exist. Under NYSE rules, stockholder
approval is required prior to the issuance of SemGroup Common Stock if the number of shares of common stock to be
issued equals 20% or more of the number of shares of common stock outstanding prior to the issuance. The Stock
Issuance is expected to result in the issuance of a number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock equal to
approximately 25.1% of the shares of SemGroup Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger. Accordingly, SemGroup Stockholders are being asked to consider and vote upon the Stock Issuance. The
approval of the Stock Issuance requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the
aggregate voting power present at the SemGroup Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof,
provided a quorum is present.
Proposal 2 — Adjournment Proposal
Proposal 2 is a proposal to approve the adjournment of the SemGroup Special Meeting, from time to time, if necessary or
appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the SemGroup Special Meeting to
approve the Stock Issuance Proposal.
The SemGroup Special Meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to permit, among
other things, further solicitation of proxies if necessary to obtain additional votes in favor of the
Table of Contents
29
Stock Issuance Proposal. If, at the SemGroup Special Meeting, the number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock
present or represented and voting in favor of the Stock Issuance Proposal is insufficient to approve the Stock Issuance
Proposal, SemGroup intends to move to adjourn the SemGroup Special Meeting in order to enable the SemGroup Board
to solicit additional proxies for approval of the Stock Issuance Proposal. In the Adjournment Proposal, SemGroup is
asking SemGroup Stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the SemGroup Board to vote in favor of
granting discretionary authority to the proxy holders, and each of them individually, to vote to adjourn the SemGroup
Special Meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If SemGroup Stockholders
approve the Adjournment Proposal, SemGroup could adjourn the SemGroup Special Meeting and any adjourned
session of the SemGroup Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the
solicitation of proxies from SemGroup Stockholders who have previously voted. The approval of the Adjournment
Proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power
present at the SemGroup Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, regardless of whether a quorum
is present.
Board Recommendation
The SemGroup Board recommends that SemGroup Stockholders vote “FOR” each of the Proposals. See the section
titled “Recommendation of the SemGroup Board and Its Reasons.”
In considering the recommendation of the SemGroup Board with respect to the Proposals, you should be aware that
some of SemGroup’s directors and executive officers may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of SemGroup Stockholders more generally. See the section titled “Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger
Transactions.”
Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Shares Entitled to Vote
Only SemGroup Stockholders of record as of the close of business on the SemGroup Vote Record Date will be entitled to
receive notice of and to vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.
SemGroup Common Stock held by SemGroup as treasury shares will not be entitled to vote.
As of the close of business on the SemGroup Vote Record Date, there were              shares of SemGroup Common Stock
and no other shares of capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting. Each SemGroup
Stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of SemGroup Common Stock owned as of the SemGroup Vote Record
Date.
A complete list of SemGroup Stockholders entitled to vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting will be available for
inspection at SemGroup’s principal place of business during regular business hours for a period of no fewer than ten
days before the SemGroup Special Meeting and, during the SemGroup Special Meeting, at Doubletree by Hilton Hotel
Tulsa at Warren Place, 6110 South Yale Avenue, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74136.
Quorum
A quorum of SemGroup Stockholders is required to approve the Stock Issuance Proposal at the SemGroup Special
Meeting, but not to approve any Adjournment Proposal. A majority of the outstanding shares of SemGroup Common
Stock as of the SemGroup Vote Record Date must be represented in person or by proxy at the SemGroup Special
Meeting in order to constitute a quorum.
Required Vote
The approval of the Stock Issuance Proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a
majority of the aggregate voting power present at the SemGroup Special Meeting or any
Table of Contents
30
adjournment or postponement thereof, provided a quorum is present. The approval of the Adjournment Proposal
requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power present at
the SemGroup Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, regardless of whether a quorum is present.
If you abstain from voting on either of the Proposals, your shares of SemGroup Common Stock will be counted as
present for purposes of establishing a quorum, but the abstention will have the same effect as a vote against the
Proposal from which you abstain. If you fail to vote on either of the Proposals, such failure to vote will not affect the
adoption of such Proposal, except with respect to the Stock Issuance Proposal to the extent that your failure to vote
prevents the establishment of a quorum at the SemGroup Special Meeting.
The obligations of the parties to complete the Merger are conditioned upon approval of the Stock Issuance Proposal (the
“SemGroup Stockholder Approval”). Accordingly, a vote against or an abstention with respect to the Stock Issuance
Proposal, or a failure to vote on the Stock Issuance Proposal, to the extent such failure prevents the establishment of a
quorum, will have the same effect as a vote against the Stock Issuance Proposal and the Merger (although no vote for or
against the Merger is taking place).
Stock Ownership of and Voting of SemGroup’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of the SemGroup Vote Record Date, SemGroup’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were
entitled to vote, in the aggregate, approximately     % of the outstanding SemGroup Common Stock.
Voting and Submitting a Proxy for SemGroup Common Stock Held by Holders of Record
If you were a holder of record of SemGroup Common Stock at the close of business on the SemGroup Vote Record Date,
you may vote in person by attending the SemGroup Special Meeting or, to ensure that your shares are represented at the
SemGroup Special Meeting, you may authorize a proxy to vote by:
•
•
•
Internet. To vote via the Internet, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card.
Telephone. To vote by telephone, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card.
Mail. To vote by proxy card, complete and sign the proxy card and mail it to the address indicated on the proxy card.
When you submit a proxy by telephone or via the Internet, your proxy is recorded immediately. We encourage you to
submit your proxy using these methods whenever possible. If you submit a proxy by telephone or via the Internet,
please do not return your proxy card by mail.
All shares of SemGroup Common Stock represented by each properly executed and valid proxy received before the
SemGroup Special Meeting will be voted in accordance with the instructions given on the proxy. If a SemGroup
Stockholder executes a proxy card without giving instructions, the SemGroup Common Stock represented by that proxy
card will be voted “FOR” each of the Proposals.
Your vote is important. Accordingly, please submit your proxy by telephone, via the Internet, or by mail whether or not
you plan to attend the meeting in person. Proxies must be received by             , Central Time, on             .
Voting and Submitting a Proxy for SemGroup Common Stock Held in Street Name
If your SemGroup Common Stock is held in an account at a bank, broker or other nominee, you must instruct the bank,
broker or other nominee on how to vote them by following the instructions that the bank, broker or other nominee
provides to you with these proxy materials. Most banks, brokers and other nominees offer the ability for stockholders to
submit voting instructions by mail by completing a voting instruction card, by telephone and via the Internet.
Table of Contents
31
If you hold your SemGroup Common Stock in a brokerage account and you do not provide voting instructions to your
broker, your shares will not be voted on any proposal because under the current rules of the NYSE, brokers do not have
discretionary authority to vote on the Proposals. Since there are no items on the agenda that your broker has
discretionary authority to vote upon, broker non-votes will not be counted as present at the meeting if you fail to instruct
your brokerage firm on how to vote on any of the Proposals. Therefore, a broker non-vote will have no effect on the
Stock Issuance Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, except with respect to the Stock Issuance Proposal to the extent
such broker non-vote prevents the establishment of a quorum at the SemGroup Special Meeting.
If you hold shares through a bank, broker or other nominee and wish to vote your shares in person at the SemGroup
Special Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee and present it to the inspector
of election with your ballot when you vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting.
Revocability of Proxies; Changing Your Vote
If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy and/or change your vote by:
•
•
•
sending a written notice (bearing a date later than the date of the proxy) stating that you revoke your proxy to SemGroup at
Two Warren Place, 6120 S. Yale Avenue, Suite 700, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74136-4216;
submitting a valid, later-dated proxy by mail, telephone, or via the Internet; or
attending the SemGroup Special Meeting and voting by ballot in person (your attendance at the SemGroup Special Meeting
will not, by itself, revoke any proxy that you have previously given).
If you choose to revoke your proxy by written notice or submit a later-dated proxy, you must do so by         , Central Time,
on                     .
If you hold your SemGroup Common Stock in street name through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must follow the
directions you receive from such bank, broker or other nominee to revoke or change your vote.
Solicitation of Proxies
SemGroup and Rose Rock will bear equally all costs and expenses in connection with the solicitation of proxies from the
SemGroup Stockholders. SemGroup has engaged D.F. King to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the SemGroup
Special Meeting and SemGroup estimates that it will pay D.F. King an aggregate base fee of approximately $12,500 for its
services in connection with the Merger. SemGroup has also agreed to reimburse D.F. King for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with the proxy solicitation, such as phone calls with SemGroup
Stockholders. These expenses and disbursements could be substantial. SemGroup has agreed to indemnify D.F. King
against certain losses, costs and expenses. In addition, SemGroup will reimburse brokerage firms and other persons
representing beneficial owners of SemGroup Common Stock for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation
materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies also may be solicited by certain of SemGroup’s directors, officers and
employees by telephone, electronic mail, letter, facsimile or in person, but no additional compensation will be paid to
them.
No Other Business
No business shall be conducted at the SemGroup Special Meeting other than the matters described herein.
Adjournments
Adjournments may be made for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting additional proxies. If there are insufficient
votes at the SemGroup Special Meeting to approve the Stock Issuance Proposal and it is necessary or appropriate to
solicit additional proxies, the SemGroup Special Meeting may be adjourned. If a quorum is not

32
present, an adjournment may be made from time to time by the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a
majority of the aggregate voting power present at the SemGroup Special Meeting. SemGroup is not required to notify the
SemGroup Stockholders of any adjournment of 30 days or less if the time and place of the adjourned meeting are
announced at the SemGroup Special Meeting. At any adjourned meeting, SemGroup may transact any business that it
might have transacted at the original meeting, provided that a quorum is present at such adjourned meeting. Proxies
submitted by the SemGroup Stockholders for use at the SemGroup Special Meeting will be used at any adjournment or
postponement of the SemGroup Special Meeting. References to the SemGroup Special Meeting in this joint consent
statement/proxy statement/prospectus are to such SemGroup Special Meeting as may be adjourned or postponed.

THE MERGER
On May 30, 2016, SemGroup, Merger Sub, Rose Rock, and the Rose Rock General Partner entered into the Merger
Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Rose Rock, with Rose Rock being the surviving entity
in the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of SemGroup. In addition, if the Merger is successfully completed,
Rose Rock Common Units will no longer be listed and traded on the NYSE. SemGroup is currently considering
consummating certain internal “clean-up” mergers after the Merger occurs, which would ultimately result in Rose Rock
merging into SemGroup, with SemGroup being the surviving entity of that merger.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all Rose Rock Public Units outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and, upon such conversion, will be canceled
and will cease to exist. No fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock will be issued in the Merger, and each
registered holder of Rose Rock Public Units who otherwise would have received a fractional share of SemGroup
Common Stock in the Merger will instead receive from the exchange agent a cash payment, without interest, in lieu of
such fractional shares.
The approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Merger by Rose Rock requires the affirmative vote or
consent of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Rose Rock Common Units (the “Required Rose Rock
Common Unitholder Written Consent”). Pursuant to the terms of the Support Agreement, Rose Rock Holdings, which as
of August 9, 2016 beneficially owned 20,704,418 Rose Rock Common Units representing approximately 56.2% of the
outstanding Rose Rock Common Units, has irrevocably and unconditionally agreed to deliver a written consent
adopting and approving in all respects the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger (the “Rose Rock Holdings Written Consent”), within two business days after the effectiveness of the registration
statement of which this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus forms a part. The delivery of the Rose Rock
Holdings Written Consent by Rose Rock Holdings will be sufficient to approve the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, on behalf of Rose Rock.
As a condition to the Closing, the SemGroup Stockholders must approve the Stock Issuance at the SemGroup Special
Meeting. The approval of the Stock Issuance requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a
majority of the aggregate voting power present at the SemGroup Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, provided a quorum is present.
SemGroup’s Ownership Interest in and Control of Rose Rock
Rose Rock Public Unitholders should be aware that Rose Rock is controlled by SemGroup through SemGroup’s 100%
ownership of the Rose Rock General Partner. The Rose Rock General Partner owns all of the outstanding general
partner interests in Rose Rock. As a result, SemGroup appoints the members of the Rose Rock Board, a majority of
whom are affiliated with SemGroup and its affiliates, and thereby could be seen as controlling all of Rose Rock’s
decisions, other than those involving certain conflicts of interest with SemGroup or that require an affirmative vote of
holders of the limited partner interests in Rose Rock pursuant to and in the percentages specified by the Rose Rock LP
Agreement. In addition, SemGroup, through its ownership of Rose Rock Holdings, owns approximately 56.2% of the
outstanding Rose Rock Common Units.
Certain persons associated with SemGroup have a relationship with Rose Rock. See “The Merger — Interests of Certain
Persons in the Merger Transactions.”
Background of the Merger
The SemGroup Board has, from time to time, reviewed and evaluated potential strategic alternatives and operational
opportunities with the management of SemGroup, including possible business combination
Table of Contents
34
transactions. In connection with these strategic reviews, the SemGroup Board has discussed various options that could
potentially complement, enhance or improve the competitive strengths and strategic position of SemGroup, with the
ultimate objective of maximizing value for SemGroup investors. Specifically, in early 2016, SemGroup management
began evaluating several strategic options to address Rose Rock’s high cost of capital, which has been a key obstacle
to Rose Rock’s ability to finance strategic acquisitions and organic growth projects and, in turn, sustain Rose Rock’s
current quarterly cash distributions. Accordingly, given SemGroup’s dependence on Rose Rock’s quarterly cash
distributions, SemGroup management believed that addressing Rose Rock’s high cost of capital would increase value
for SemGroup investors.
On February 24, 2016, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the SemGroup Board, the members of the SemGroup Board
discussed potential strategic alternatives that could be undertaken by SemGroup, including a simplification transaction
with Rose Rock in which SemGroup would acquire all of the Rose Rock Public Units (a “Simplification”). The SemGroup
Board also discussed alternatives to the Simplification, including SemGroup providing additional general partner
support to Rose Rock, reducing the quarterly cash distributions payable on the Rose Rock Common Units and dropping
additional assets into Rose Rock. The SemGroup Board also discussed other alternative transactions including selling
various assets and raising equity at SemGroup. The SemGroup Board discussed hiring advisors in order to explore a
Simplification and/or a potential public or private transaction to raise equity capital for SemGroup (an “equity raise”). At
the conclusion of the meeting, the SemGroup Board directed management to begin considering strategic alternatives
including the Simplification and the potential equity raise, neither of which was contingent upon the execution of the
other, as well as selecting financial and legal advisors to assist with any potential transactions.
On March 16, 2016, after consideration and evaluation of various financial advisors, SemGroup engaged Barclays to act
as its financial advisor in connection with the Simplification and a potential equity raise. The scope of SemGroup’s
engagement of Barclays did not include Barclays’ providing analysis to SemGroup with respect to other transactions.
On April 4, 2016, at a meeting of the SemGroup Board at which SemGroup management and, at the request of the
SemGroup Board, representatives of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP (“Gibson Dunn”), counsel to SemGroup, and
Barclays were present, the SemGroup Board received a report from Carlin G. Conner, Director, President and Chief
Executive Officer of SemGroup, Chairman of the Rose Rock Board and President and Chief Executive Officer of Rose
Rock, in which he outlined several key reasons why the SemGroup Board should assess strategic alternatives.
Mr. Conner then provided an overview of potential strategic alternatives and their respective benefits and disadvantages,
including a Simplification, and recommended, on behalf of SemGroup management, that the Board, among other
recommended steps, explore a Simplification with the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee. In addition, Mr. Conner advised
that an equity raise may ultimately be desirable regardless of whether or not a Simplification was consummated.
Representatives of Barclays then presented Barclays’ preliminary financial analysis of the Simplification and led a
discussion regarding the various strategic alternatives for SemGroup. Representatives of Barclays responded to
numerous questions from the SemGroup Board regarding the strategic alternatives. Following discussion and
deliberation, the SemGroup Board directed management, on behalf of SemGroup, to explore a potential Simplification
with the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee.
On April 9, 2016, Mr. Conner informed Rodney L. Gray, as Chairman of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, by telephone,
that the SemGroup Board had authorized SemGroup management to begin exploration of a potential Simplification.
On April 15, 2016, at a meeting of the SemGroup Board at which SemGroup management and, at the request of the
SemGroup Board, representatives of Gibson Dunn and Barclays were present, along with Potter Anderson & Corroon
LLP (“Potter Anderson”), which had been engaged as Delaware counsel to represent the SemGroup Board, the
SemGroup Board received an update on the potential Simplification from Mr. Conner. Mr. Conner reported on his recent
notification to Mr. Gray regarding a potential Simplification and relayed that a
Table of Contents
35
meeting of the Rose Rock Board had been scheduled to consider a proposal to authorize the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee to review, evaluate and negotiate the Simplification on behalf of Rose Rock and the Rose Rock Unaffiliated
Unitholders. Representatives of Barclays then provided an update to Barclays’ preliminary financial analysis of the
Simplification provided at the April 4, 2016 SemGroup Board meeting, including highlighting changes made to the
preliminary version. Following discussion and consideration, the SemGroup Board concluded that SemGroup
management, on behalf of SemGroup, should continue to explore a potential Simplification with the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee.
On April 15, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Board at which Rose Rock management and representatives of Gibson
Dunn were present, Mr. Conner presented management’s view as to the business rationale for a possible Simplification
and responded to questions from the Rose Rock Board on the subject. Mr. Conner noted that SemGroup was also
considering an equity offering regardless of whether the Simplification was consummated. After discussion and
consideration, the Rose Rock Board unanimously determined, in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business
judgment, that it was advisable and in the best interest of Rose Rock and the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders that the
Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, to be constituted of Robert E. Dunn and Rodney L. Gray, as Chairman, (i) review,
evaluate and negotiate the Simplification on behalf of Rose Rock and the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders for the
purpose of providing, if appropriate, Special Approval (pursuant to the Rose Rock LP Agreement) and (ii) determine
whether or not to give Special Approval of the Simplification. In addition, the Rose Rock Board unanimously determined
that (i) neither of Messrs. Dunn or Gray (nor any of their family members or affiliates) had any material financial or other
interest in, or any material relationship with, Rose Rock, or SemGroup and its affiliates, nor were they otherwise involved
(other than as board members of Rose Rock) in the Simplification; and (ii) each of Messrs. Dunn and Gray were the only
members of the Rose Rock Board who satisfied the independence and other requirements to serve as members of the
Rose Rock Conflicts Committee. Based on these determinations, the Rose Rock Board concluded that Messrs. Dunn
and Gray were the most appropriate individuals to serve on the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee. After making these
determinations, the Rose Rock Board adopted resolutions authorizing the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee to, among
other things, (i) review and evaluate the terms and conditions, and determine the advisability, of the Simplification,
(ii) negotiate, or delegate the ability to negotiate to any persons, the terms and conditions of the Simplification,
(iii) determine whether or not to give approval of the Simplification, including by Special Approval pursuant to the Rose
Rock LP Agreement, and (iv) make a recommendation to the Rose Rock Board whether to approve the Simplification.
The Rose Rock Board also authorized the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee to select and retain its own independent legal
and financial advisors. Mr. Gray then reported to the Rose Rock Board that the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee expected
to engage Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP (“Akin Gump”) as its independent legal advisor and Evercore as its
independent financial advisor.
Later on April 15, 2016, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee determined to (i) retain Evercore as the committee’s
independent financial advisor with respect to the committee’s review and consideration of the Simplification, subject to
confirming the absence of any conflicts of interest and the negotiation of a mutually acceptable engagement letter; and
(ii) retain Akin Gump as the committee’s independent legal counsel with respect to the committee’s review and
consideration of the Simplification, subject to confirming the absence of any conflicts of interest. The Rose Rock
Conflicts Committee had previously retained Evercore and Akin Gump as its independent financial and legal advisors
with respect to a potential transaction in 2015 that was not ultimately entered into, and transactions in each of January
2013, December 2013 and June 2014 involving SemGroup’s contribution of interests in SemCrude Pipeline L.L.C. to
Rose Rock. Mr. Gray subsequently informed Evercore and Akin Gump of the Simplification.
On April 18, 2016, Candice L. Cheeseman, Vice President and General Counsel of SemGroup, delivered discussion
materials prepared by representatives of Barclays and a presentation prepared by SemGroup management to Akin
Gump, and requested that they be forwarded to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and Evercore, in preparation for the
upcoming meeting with the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee. In addition, SemGroup management provided Akin Gump
with a draft of a proposed confidentiality agreement to be entered into between SemGroup and Rose Rock.
Table of Contents
36
On April 19, 2016, SemGroup and Rose Rock executed a confidentiality agreement.
Also during the morning of April 19, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee at which representatives of
Evercore and Akin Gump were present as well as, at the committee’s invitation, SemGroup’s management team, and
representatives of Barclays and Gibson Dunn, SemGroup’s management team gave a presentation to the committee
regarding the Simplification. During the meeting, SemGroup management discussed with the members of the Rose Rock
Conflicts Committee: (i) an overview of the Simplification; (ii) management’s views of the current challenges facing Rose
Rock and its ability to sustain its current quarterly cash distributions; (iii) management’s rationale for considering the
Simplification, including the potential benefits of the Simplification to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders; (iv) other
alternatives to the Simplification that had been considered by management, including SemGroup providing additional
general partner support to Rose Rock, reducing the quarterly cash distributions payable on the Rose Rock Common
Units and dropping additional assets into Rose Rock; and (v) a summary overview of the assets of SemGroup and Rose
Rock. During the course of the meeting, members of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and representatives of
Evercore and Akin Gump asked questions regarding the Simplification that were responded to by members of
SemGroup management.
Following the SemGroup presentation, the representatives of SemGroup management, Barclays and Gibson Dunn left
the meeting and the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee met with representatives of Evercore and Akin Gump during which
they discussed their initial thoughts regarding the Simplification and next steps to be undertaken, including: (i) the
financial analysis to be conducted by Evercore; (ii) factors to consider in determining whether the Simplification should
be conditioned upon a separate vote of the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders; (iii) the tax implications of the
Simplification; and (iv) reactions to alternative transactions to the Simplification considered by management, as well as
to a potential reduction to the distributions paid to Rose Rock Common Unitholders, including a discussion of the
impact of distribution cuts on trading prices of common units of other publicly traded master limited partnerships, and
the value and distribution yield of the Rose Rock Common Units that would be required in order to facilitate future
sponsor drop-down transactions. The representatives of Evercore then left the meeting. The committee then discussed
the proposed terms of Evercore’s engagement with Akin Gump, approved the fees to be paid to Evercore under the
terms of its engagement, and directed Akin Gump to complete the negotiation of a mutually acceptable engagement
letter with Evercore. The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee subsequently formally engaged Evercore as the committee’s
independent financial advisor with respect to the committee’s review and consideration of the Simplification. During the
course of the committee’s review of the Simplification, the committee discussed with Evercore the potential implications
to Rose Rock and the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders of remaining with the status quo rather than approving the
Simplification; however, Evercore was not engaged by the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee or otherwise requested by
the committee to consider strategic alternatives to the Simplification. The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee also
authorized Akin Gump to proceed with the engagement of Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP (“Morris Nichols”) as the
committee’s independent Delaware legal counsel.
On April 21, 2016, SemGroup management delivered to representatives of Barclays (for, at the direction of SemGroup
management, subsequent delivery to Evercore) a model prepared by SemGroup management detailing “base case”
financial projections for each of SemGroup and Rose Rock.
On April 22, 2016, SemGroup management delivered to representatives of Barclays (for, at the direction of SemGroup
management, subsequent delivery to Evercore) a revised model, updated to demonstrate the impact of a potential sale of
SemGroup’s limited partnership interests in NGL Energy Partners LP, which transaction was then under consideration
by SemGroup management (and was subsequently consummated on April 27, 2016), detailing “base case” financial
projections for SemGroup (the “Management SemGroup Base Case Projections”) and Rose Rock (the “Management
Rose Rock Base Case Projections” and, together with the Management SemGroup Base Case Projections, the
“Management Base Case Projections”).
Also on April 22, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Board, the Rose Rock Board held a discussion regarding the
quarterly cash distribution on the Rose Rock Common Units with respect to the first quarter of
Table of Contents
37
2016. In response to a question from the Rose Rock Board, Rose Rock management discussed considerations for a
potential reduction in the distribution amount compared to the distribution with respect to the fourth quarter of 2015.
After discussion, the Rose Rock Board approved a quarterly cash distribution of $0.66 per Rose Rock Common Unit,
which did not represent a distribution reduction for such quarter.
Also on April 22, 2016, SemGroup provided access to a virtual data room to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and its
advisors in connection with the Simplification. Between April 22, 2016 and May 30, 2016, Evercore and Akin Gump
conducted due diligence in connection with the Simplification, including the submission of supplemental due diligence
requests to SemGroup regarding financial and legal due diligence matters and the Management Base Case Projections.
On April 26, 2016, Akin Gump submitted a due diligence request list with respect to legal matters to SemGroup
management. In addition, Evercore submitted a supplemental due diligence request list with respect to financial matters
to SemGroup management. Later that day, SemGroup management responded with preliminary answers to the Evercore
financial due diligence request list.
On April 28, 2016, Evercore submitted a proposed due diligence agenda to SemGroup management and representatives
of Barclays for a due diligence session scheduled to be held on May 3, 2016.
On May 3, 2016, representatives of Evercore met with members of SemGroup management and representatives of
Barclays and Gibson Dunn via teleconference to discuss due diligence questions posed by Evercore regarding the
assets and operations of SemGroup and Rose Rock and the Management Base Case Projections.
On May 5, 2016, SemGroup management had discussions with each of Evercore and Mr. Gray of the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee regarding the scheduling of a further due diligence call to be held on May 6, 2016.
On May 6, 2016, representatives of Barclays communicated, on behalf of and at the direction of the SemGroup Board,
indicative terms to a representative of Evercore under which each Rose Rock Public Unit would be acquired in exchange
for SemGroup Common Stock assuming an estimated premium of 5% to the then-current price of Rose Rock Common
Units. Based on the closing prices of SemGroup Common Stock and Rose Rock Common Units on May 5, 2016, a 5%
premium implied an exchange ratio of approximately 0.64 shares of SemGroup Common Stock for each Rose Rock
Public Unit (the “May 5th Indicative Exchange Ratio”).
On May 7, 2016 SemGroup management held a further due diligence meeting with Evercore to discuss asset-level
projections at each of SemGroup and Rose Rock.
During the afternoon on May 9, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee at which representatives of
Akin Gump and Evercore were present, representatives of Evercore discussed with the committee the due diligence that
had been conducted to date and Evercore’s preliminary financial analysis of the Simplification, based on the
Management Base Case Projections and the May 5th Indicative Exchange Ratio. During the presentation Evercore
provided, among other things: (i) a summary of the terms of the Simplification; (ii) a situation analysis for Rose Rock;
(iii) a detailed overview of Rose Rock’s assets and operations; (iv) a summary of the Management Rose Rock Base Case
Projections, including the underlying assumptions; (v) a detailed preliminary financial analysis of Rose Rock, including a
discounted cash flow analysis, a discounted distribution analysis based on various assumed distribution levels and
using the reduced future distributions under the Management Rose Rock Base Case Projections, a precedent M&A
transaction analysis, a peer group trading analysis, and a premiums paid analysis; (vi) a situation analysis for
SemGroup; (vii) a detailed overview of SemGroup’s assets and operations; (viii) a summary of the Management
SemGroup Base Case Projections, including the underlying assumptions; (ix) a detailed preliminary financial analysis of
SemGroup, including a discounted cash flow analysis, a discounted dividend analysis, a precedent M&A transaction
analysis, a peer group trading analysis, and a discussion of the valuation analysis applied to certain of SemGroup’s
expansion projects; (x) an analysis of the May 5th Indicative Exchange Ratio; and (xi) an analysis of the pro forma impact

to SemGroup stockholders and Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders from the Simplification. During the presentation, the
Rose Rock Conflicts Committee asked, and representatives of Evercore answered, questions with respect to Evercore’s
preliminary financial analysis. Following the presentation, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and its advisors
discussed the topics to be covered at the upcoming due diligence meeting with SemGroup management and next steps
in the process for evaluating the Simplification.
On May 11, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee at which representatives of Evercore and Akin
Gump were present, the committee first discussed the due diligence questions and topics to be addressed with
SemGroup management. At the committee’s request, representatives of Akin Gump also gave a presentation to the
committee regarding the Rose Rock LP Agreement and reviewed in detail the duties of the committee in connection with
its review and consideration of the Simplification. Representatives of SemGroup management, Barclays and Gibson
Dunn then joined the meeting at the committee’s request. A discussion commenced among the committee, SemGroup
management and Evercore regarding various due diligence matters relating to the assets and operations of SemGroup
and Rose Rock, and the Management Base Case Projections, with questions asked by the committee and
representatives of Evercore and answered by representatives of SemGroup management. The due diligence discussion
included questions regarding the assumptions underlying the Management Base Case Projections, including the
projected distributions to be paid on the Rose Rock Common Units, as well as the status and commercial terms of
customer contracts and plans related to SemGroup’s growth projects. At the committee’s request, management also
discussed its views regarding the sustainability of Rose Rock’s current quarterly cash distributions and the potential
benefits that the Simplification would provide to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders. Representatives of SemGroup
management, Barclays and Gibson Dunn then left the meeting and the committee continued to meet with its advisors
and discussed the information received during the meeting and next steps.
Also on May 11, 2016, Gibson Dunn delivered an initial draft of the Merger Agreement to Akin Gump.
On May 13, 2016, Akin Gump and Gibson Dunn discussed outstanding due diligence matters, the status of the draft
transaction documents and related matters. Later that day, Gibson Dunn delivered an initial draft of the Support
Agreement to Akin Gump.
On May 14, 2016, Mr. Conner contacted Mr. Gray to request that the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee respond to the
May 5th Indicative Exchange Ratio by May 17, 2016. Mr. Gray responded that the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee would
schedule a meeting with its advisors and would determine what was possible from a timing perspective.
On May 16, 2016, at a meeting of the SemGroup Board at which SemGroup management and, at the request of the
SemGroup Board, representatives of Gibson Dunn, Potter Anderson and Barclays were present, the SemGroup Board
received a status report from Messrs. Conner and Fitzgerald on the Simplification, including the status of discussions
with the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and the timing for any approvals to be sought from the SemGroup Board. The
SemGroup Board inquired of SemGroup management and its advisors regarding certain reasons for and advantages of
pursuing the Simplification. Mr. Fitzgerald also discussed with the SemGroup Board management’s consideration of
engaging Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (“Citigroup”) to assist the Company as an additional financial advisor on the
Simplification.
Following the SemGroup Board meeting on May 16, 2016, Mr. Gray contacted Mr. Conner to discuss the timing of the
requested response to the May 5th Indicative Exchange Ratio. Mr. Gray stated that he did not think that the committee
would be in a position to respond during the requested time frame, and Mr. Conner agreed that the committee should
respond when it deems appropriate. During the conversation, Mr. Gray also stated that the May 5th Indicative Exchange
Ratio was too low and would not be acceptable to the committee. Mr. Gray indicated that the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee was undertaking a careful evaluation of SemGroup’s assets and growth projects.

During the morning of May 17, 2016, at a special meeting of the SemGroup Board at which SemGroup management and
representatives of Gibson Dunn and Potter Anderson were present, the SemGroup Board convened to discuss the
process for their ongoing evaluation of a potential equity offering and the Simplification. At the Chairman’s request,
representatives of Potter Anderson discussed the SemGroup Board’s duties and a recommended process with respect
to the Board’s consideration of and any approval of the Simplification.
Also during the morning on May 17, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee at which representatives of
Evercore, Akin Gump and Morris Nichols were present, Mr. Gray discussed his recent conversations with Mr. Conner
regarding the request for a response from the committee regarding the May 5th Indicative Exchange Ratio. Mr. Gray also
noted that Mr. Conner had stated that SemGroup would not accept a term conditioning the Merger on a separate vote of
the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders. Representatives of Evercore then proceeded to discuss with the committee
certain due diligence updates, and responded to questions from the committee during the course of the discussion.
Evercore then proceeded to discuss its updated preliminary financial analysis based on (i) a potential acquisition of each
Rose Rock Public Unit assuming a 5% premium to Rose Rock’s unit price (based on the 5% premium communicated to
Evercore on behalf of SemGroup on May 6, 2016), which Evercore assumed, for purposes of its analysis, would apply to
Rose Rock’s closing common unit price of $19.86 as of May 13, 2015, or $20.85 per unit and, based on the closing price
of SemGroup Common Stock as of May 13, 2016 of $28.78 per share, implied an exchange ratio of approximately 0.725
shares of SemGroup Common Stock for each Rose Rock Public Unit (the “May 13th Indicative Exchange Ratio”); (ii) the
Management Base Case Projections; and (iii) sensitivity analyses based on the Management Base Case Projections and
prepared by Evercore at the committee’s request in order to demonstrate the potential impact of (A) SemGroup not
completing certain SemGroup growth projects and (B) lower than projected drilling activity and related volumes on
certain of SemGroup’s existing assets (collectively, the “Sensitivity Analyses”). During the course of the presentation,
representatives of Evercore noted changes from Evercore’s prior presentation, discussed an analysis of the May 13th
Indicative Exchange Ratio, and reviewed the pro forma impact to Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders and SemGroup
stockholders of the Simplification, including the estimated tax impact to Rose Rock Public Unitholders.
Following the Evercore presentation and related discussions at the meeting, Mr. Gray asked Akin Gump to report on the
draft Merger Agreement. Representatives of Akin Gump then proceeded to (i) provide the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee with an overview of the terms of the initial draft of the Merger Agreement and the related Support Agreement;
and (ii) discuss with the committee a number of potential negotiation points and recommended changes to the Merger
Agreement, including: (A) the addition of a term under which SemGroup would be obligated to pay a termination fee in
the event the SemGroup Board were to change its recommendation to SemGroup stockholders; (B) obligating
SemGroup to satisfy any expense reimbursement or termination fee payment obligations following a termination of the
Merger Agreement by a direct cash payment to Rose Rock, in lieu of a waiver of the “Incentive Distribution Rights” (as
such term is defined in the Rose Rock LP Agreement); (C) narrowing the circumstances under which the SemGroup
Board would be permitted to change its recommendation to SemGroup’s stockholders; (D) expanding the limitations on
SemGroup’s permitted activities between signing the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Simplification;
(E) confirmation that there would be no reduction in Rose Rock’s quarterly cash distributions between signing the
Merger Agreement and the closing of the Simplification; and (F) potential modifications to the definition of a SemGroup
“material adverse effect.” During the course of the meeting, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee asked, and
representatives of Akin Gump and Morris Nichols answered, various questions with respect to the drafts of the Merger
Agreement and the Support Agreement. The committee and its advisors also discussed factors to consider in
connection with determining whether the Simplification should be conditioned upon a separate vote of the Rose Rock
Unaffiliated Unitholders. The committee then asked questions and a discussion ensued regarding potential risks related
to the permitting status of the Maurepas Pipeline project. Following the discussions, the committee directed Akin Gump
to provide a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Gibson Dunn reflecting the revisions discussed with the
committee. The committee also determined to communicate to SemGroup management that an exchange ratio of
between 0.80 and 0.85 shares of SemGroup Common Stock per Rose Rock Public Unit would be more appropriate for
the Simplification.

Later in the morning of May 17, 2016, Messrs. Gray and Dunn had a telephonic conversation with Mr. Conner in which
Messrs. Gray and Dunn suggested that an exchange ratio of between 0.80 and 0.85 shares of SemGroup Common Stock
per Rose Rock Public Unit would be more appropriate for the Simplification. Messrs. Gray and Dunn also communicated
that they would have some comments to the Merger Agreement and that they were considering requesting that the
Merger should be conditioned upon a separate vote of the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders. Mr. Conner responded
that SemGroup would not agree to condition the Simplification upon a separate vote of the Rose Rock Unaffiliated
Unitholders.
Later in the afternoon on May 17, 2016, Messrs. Gray and Dunn had an additional telephonic conversation with
Mr. Conner in which Mr. Conner requested that the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee consider a lower range than the
exchange ratio of between 0.80 and 0.85 shares of SemGroup Common Stock per Rose Rock Public Unit suggested by
the Conflicts Committee.
On May 18, 2016 and May 19, 2016, representatives of Evercore and SemGroup management held a series of conference
calls to discuss due diligence questions posed by Evercore regarding the assets and operations of SemGroup and Rose
Rock and the Management Base Case Projections. SemGroup management also communicated to Evercore that an
exchange ratio of 0.80 or more shares of SemGroup Common Stock per Rose Rock Public Unit was too high. The Rose
Rock Conflicts Committee requested that SemGroup provide an exchange ratio for its consideration, but SemGroup
management declined to do so at such time.
On May 18, 2016, Messrs. Gray and Dunn had a telephonic conversation with SemGroup management and certain
SemGroup advisors to discuss the current status and anticipated timing for the completion of certain SemGroup growth
projects.
Also on May 18, 2016, Ms. Cheeseman had a discussion with a representative of Akin Gump regarding the timing of a
response to the draft Merger Agreement.
On May 19, 2016, Akin Gump provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Gibson Dunn reflecting the revisions
discussed with the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee.
On May 19, 2016 and May 20, 2016, Mr. Conner and Mr. Gray had a series of conversations regarding the Rose Rock
Conflicts Committee’s evaluation of certain assets and operations of SemGroup and Rose Rock.
During the afternoon on May 20, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee at which representatives of
Evercore and Akin Gump were present, representatives of Evercore updated the committee regarding: (i) the recent due
diligence sessions with SemGroup management; (ii) the resulting implications to Evercore’s preliminary financial
analysis; and (iii) related discussions with SemGroup management concerning the exchange ratio for the Simplification.
A discussion ensued, with the committee ultimately concluding that SemGroup needed to suggest a specific exchange
ratio for the committee to consider. The committee and its advisors then engaged in a discussion regarding: (i) the
potential benefits to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders of the Simplification; (ii) the potential implications to Rose
Rock and the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders if the committee and SemGroup management were not able to reach
agreement on a mutually acceptable exchange ratio and the committee declined to ultimately approve the Simplification
in favor of remaining with the status quo; and (iii) the next steps involved in evaluating the Simplification and negotiating
an exchange ratio.
Later in the afternoon on May 20, 2016, representatives of SemGroup management, Akin Gump and Evercore held a
conference call to discuss due diligence questions relating to certain SemGroup growth projects.
Later in the day on May 20, 2016, Mr. Fitzgerald contacted Mr. Gray to ask the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee to consider
an exchange ratio for the Simplification of 0.73 shares of SemGroup Common Stock per Rose Rock Public Unit (the “May
20th Exchange Ratio”). Mr. Gray subsequently informed Mr. Dunn and representatives of Evercore and Akin Gump of the
exchange ratio.

On May 21, 2016, Gibson Dunn provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Akin Gump. Later that day and again
on May 22, 2016, representatives of Akin Gump and Gibson Dunn discussed the draft Merger Agreement.
On May 22, 2016, Mr. Conner contacted Mr. Gray to inquire regarding the timing of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee’s
consideration of the May 20th Exchange Ratio.
In the afternoon of May 22, 2016, at a special meeting of the SemGroup Board at which SemGroup management and, at
the request of the SemGroup Board, representatives of Gibson Dunn, Potter Anderson and Barclays were present, the
SemGroup Board received a status report from Mr. Conner regarding the Simplification, including the status of
negotiations with the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and a potential equity raise. Mr. Conner noted that management
was considering recommending to the SemGroup Board bifurcation of the timing a potential equity raise and the
Simplification, and conveyed its considerations regarding such timing. Mr. Fitzgerald then reviewed with the SemGroup
Board a slide presentation addressing certain considerations of the Simplification, including the combined company’s
credit instruments and tax consequences. Representatives of Gibson Dunn then responded to questions from the
SemGroup Board regarding certain terms of the Merger Agreement requested by the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee.
Following such discussion, representatives of Potter Anderson reviewed in detail with the SemGroup Board its fiduciary
duties in connection with the Simplification.
During the afternoon on May 23, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee at which representatives of
Evercore, Akin Gump and Morris Nichols were present, representatives of Evercore summarized various due diligence
updates and then proceeded to discuss its updated preliminary financial analysis based on (i) the May 20th Exchange
Ratio; (ii) the Management Base Case Projections; and (iii) the updated Sensitivity Analyses. During the course of the
presentation, representatives of Evercore noted changes from Evercore’s prior presentation, and reviewed the pro forma
impact of the May 20th Exchange Ratio as compared to hypothetical exchange ratios of 0.80x and 0.85x. The committee
and its advisors then engaged in a discussion regarding the potential benefits to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders
of the Simplification, and the potential implications to Rose Rock and the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders if the
committee declined to ultimately approve the Simplification in favor of remaining with the status quo. During the course
of the meeting, the committee discussed its belief that the Simplification presented an attractive opportunity for Rose
Rock and the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders, but that it believed that the May 20th Exchange Ratio was too low.
Following the Evercore presentation and related discussions, representatives of Akin Gump provided a report on the
current draft of the Merger Agreement. During its report, Akin Gump summarized the changes that Gibson Dunn had
made to the draft agreement, noting, among other things, that: (i) the agreement had been revised to add a term under
which SemGroup would be obligated to pay a 2% termination fee in the event the SemGroup Board were to change its
recommendation to SemGroup stockholders in connection with certain acquisition proposals; (ii) the agreement still
provided that SemGroup would satisfy any expense reimbursement or termination fee payment obligations following a
termination of the Merger Agreement by waiving the Incentive Distribution Rights, as opposed to a direct cash payment
to Rose Rock; (iii) the circumstances under which the SemGroup Board would be permitted to change its
recommendation to SemGroup’s stockholders had not been narrowed as requested; and (iv) a number of the requested
limitations on SemGroup’s permitted activities between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the
Merger had not been accepted. Akin Gump also noted that Gibson Dunn had communicated that, as previously stated,
(i) SemGroup was unwilling to accept a term under which the Simplification would be conditioned upon a separate vote
of the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders because such separate vote was not required under the Rose Rock LP
Agreement, and (ii) SemGroup could not agree to unequivocal language that would fix Rose Rock’s quarterly cash
distributions between the signing of the Merger Agreement and Closing. During the course of the meeting, the Rose
Rock Conflicts Committee asked, and representatives of Akin Gump and Morris Nichols answered, various questions
with respect to the draft Merger Agreement. During the course of the discussions, the committee determined that it would
be willing to no longer pursue a term that would condition the Merger upon a separate vote of the Rose Rock Unaffiliated
Unitholders if the parties were able to reach an agreement on an acceptable
Table of Contents
42
exchange ratio and acceptable final terms of the Merger Agreement. The committee made this determination after
considering the economic and legal terms of the Merger, SemGroup’s stated position that it would not agree to a term
that would condition the Merger upon a separate vote of the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders, the procedural
safeguards involved in the negotiation of the Simplification and other factors discussed under “The Merger—Reasons
for the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee’s Recommendation.” The committee then asked whether any potential permitting
risk related to the Maurepas Pipeline project was addressed in the Merger Agreement, and a discussion ensued.
Following the discussions, the committee directed Akin Gump to provide a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to
Gibson Dunn reflecting the revisions discussed with the committee. The committee and its advisors then discussed next
steps and its planned response to SemGroup management, and determined that Mr. Gray would contact Mr. Conner to
communicate that the May 20th Exchange Ratio was too low and that a number of unresolved terms with respect to the
draft Merger Agreement remained, which Mr. Gray did later that day.
On May 23, 2016, Mr. Conner communicated with Mr. Gray regarding, among other things, the May 20th Exchange Ratio.
Mr. Gray indicated that the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee was still pursuing an exchange ratio of 0.80x and 0.85x and
considered certain terms of the Merger Agreement as important to an eventual agreement. In turn, Mr. Conner conveyed
to Mr. Gray that if sufficient progress was not made in the next few days, the parties would put the Simplification process
on hold for a period of time. Later in the day on May 23, 2016, Mr. Conner provided an update to the SemGroup Board
regarding recent developments in respect of the Simplification, including ongoing negotiations regarding the Merger
Agreement and the dialogue surrounding the exchange ratio, including recent trading activity of SemGroup and Rose
Rock, respectively.
On May 24, 2016, Akin Gump provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Gibson Dunn reflecting the revisions
discussed with the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee.
On May 25, 2016, representatives of Akin Gump, Morris Nichols, Gibson Dunn and Potter Anderson held a conference
call to discuss the revised draft of the Merger Agreement.
Also on May 25, 2016, Mr. Conner and Mr. Gray discussed, among other things, the May 20th Exchange Ratio and certain
terms of the Merger Agreement. Mr. Fitzgerald separately discussed with Mr. Gray the Sensitivity Analyses.
On May 26, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee at Akin Gump’s offices in Houston and at which
representatives of Evercore, Akin Gump and Morris Nichols were present, the committee first met with representatives of
Evercore and Akin Gump in order to discuss the status of negotiations regarding the exchange ratio for the
Simplification and the draft Merger Agreement. Following the meeting, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and
representatives of Evercore and Akin Gump met with representatives of SemGroup management, Barclays, Citigroup
and Gibson Dunn. The parties then engaged in a series of discussions regarding the draft Merger Agreement and
reached agreement on most of the remaining open issues relating to the Merger Agreement, including (i) that SemGroup
would be obligated to pay a termination fee in an amount of $15.5 million in the event the SemGroup Board were to
change its recommendation to SemGroup stockholders; (ii) that SemGroup would satisfy any expense reimbursement or
termination fee payment obligations following a termination of the Merger Agreement by a direct cash payment to Rose
Rock; (iii) that there would not be further limitations on the circumstances under which the SemGroup Board would be
permitted to change its recommendation to SemGroup’s stockholders; and (iv) that SemGroup would not agree to
unequivocal language fixing Rose Rock’s quarterly cash distributions between the signing of the Merger Agreement and
Closing, but that it would state, in its press release announcing the Simplification, its expectation to maintain the current
level of Rose Rock’s quarterly cash distribution during such time. SemGroup management then directed Gibson Dunn to
distribute a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to reflect the discussions at the meeting. During the course of the
meeting, the parties also engaged in discussions regarding an exchange ratio for the Simplification, but did not reach an
agreement and determined to continue discussions at a later date. Following the meeting with SemGroup management
and its advisors, the committee continued to meet with its advisors and discussed next steps.

On May 27, 2016, Gibson Dunn provided a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Akin Gump.
After market close on May 27, 2016, Mr. Conner asked Mr. Gray to consider an exchange ratio of 0.8136 shares of
SemGroup Common Stock for each Rose Rock Public Unit (the “May 27th Exchange Ratio”) which, based on the closing
prices of SemGroup Common Stock and Rose Rock Common Units on such day, represented a 0% premium.
Later in the day on May 27, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee at which representatives of
Evercore and Akin Gump were present, Evercore provided its analysis of the May 27th Exchange Ratio, noting that the
exchange ratio implied no premium to the closing price of Rose Rock Common Units on May 27, 2016 (which closing
price reflected an approximate 10% increase from the closing price on May 26, 2016). As part of the discussion, Evercore
provided a brief analysis of the Simplification at hypothetical exchange ratios, which included premiums ranging up to
5% to the May 27th closing price of Rose Rock Common Units, and offered an analysis of the Simplification at the
May 27th Exchange Ratio. Following the discussion, the committee determined to seek a premium of 1.28% to Rose
Rock’s May 27, 2016 closing price of $24.00 per common unit, which implied an exchange ratio of 0.824 shares of
SemGroup Common Stock for each Rose Rock Public Unit. Mr. Gray then left the meeting to call Mr. Conner to convey
the committee’s desired exchange ratio. In response, Mr. Conner stated that SemGroup would not agree to the
Simplification at an exchange ratio of 0.824 shares of SemGroup Common Stock for each Rose Rock Public Unit and
reiterated the May 27th Exchange Ratio. Mr. Gray then returned to the meeting and a discussion ensued after which the
committee decided to proceed with the Simplification at the May 27th Exchange Ratio (elsewhere defined herein as
Exchange Ratio), subject to the receipt of a fairness opinion from Evercore and reaching agreement on the final terms of
the Merger Agreement. Later that day, Mr. Gray communicated the committee’s position to Mr. Conner.
On May 28, 2016, Akin Gump provided comments to Gibson Dunn on the most recent draft of the Merger Agreement.
On the evening of May 29, 2016, Gibson Dunn provided Akin Gump with a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. On
May 29, 2016 and May 30, 2016, representatives of Akin Gump and Gibson Dunn negotiated the final changes to the
Merger Agreement, and reached agreement on certain final terms, including a limitation on SemGroup’s permitted
activities between the signing of the Merger Agreement and Closing.
On May 30, 2016, Mr. Conner and Mr. Gray discussed certain terms requested by the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee,
including the definition of “material adverse effect.”
On the afternoon of May 30, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee at which representatives of
Evercore, Akin Gump and Morris Nichols were present, Evercore presented its financial analysis of the Exchange Ratio
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, noting that its materials and financial analyses were substantially equivalent to
those most recently presented to the committee and had been updated to reflect the Exchange Ratio. After the
committee discussed Evercore’s presentation, representatives from Evercore then confirmed that Evercore was
prepared to deliver a fairness opinion to the committee based on the Exchange Ratio if so requested by the committee.
Representatives of Akin Gump then provided an overview of the terms of the final draft of the Merger Agreement,
explained the final negotiated changes to the agreement, and answered questions from the committee regarding the
terms of the agreement. At the request of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, Evercore then delivered its oral opinion,
which was later confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated May 30, 2016, that, as of May 30, 2016 and based upon
and subject to the factors, procedures, assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio
was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders. After further discussions and based on
prior conclusions of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee with respect to the risks and merits of the Simplification, the
Rose Rock Conflicts Committee unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the Merger Transactions
were in the best interests of Rose Rock considering the interests of the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders; (ii) approved
the Merger Agreement and the Merger Transactions, including the Merger (such
Table of Contents
44
approval constituting “Special Approval” as defined in the Rose Rock LP Agreement); and (iii) recommended the
approval of the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement and the consummation of the Merger Transactions,
including the Merger, to the Rose Rock Board.
In the afternoon of May 30, 2016, at a special meeting of the Rose Rock Board at which all members of the Rose Rock
Board as well as Rose Rock management and representatives of Gibson Dunn and Potter Anderson were present, the
Rose Rock Board received the report of Mr. Gray, in his capacity as Chairman of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee.
Mr. Gray reported that the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee had reviewed the Exchange Ratio, the Merger Agreement and
the Support Agreement and, based on the foregoing, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee delivered its Special Approval
(under the Rose Rock LP Agreement) of the Merger. In addition, Mr. Gray confirmed that the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee had received an oral fairness opinion from Evercore as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration.
Mr. Fitzgerald then provided an overview of the Merger and the necessary steps required under the Merger Agreement to
proceed to closing. Representatives of Gibson Dunn then reviewed the Merger Agreement with the Rose Rock Board,
including the Merger Consideration. After discussion and based upon the approval and recommendation of the Merger
by the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, the Rose Rock Board (i) deemed it advisable and in the best interests of Rose
Rock and the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
be consummated and therefore unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger and the Support Agreement; (ii) declared it advisable and in the best
interests of the Rose Rock General Partner that the Rose Rock General Partner, on its own behalf and on behalf of Rose
Rock, execute, deliver and perform the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement, and consummate the Merger and
engage in all transactions related thereto, including the Merger; and, (iii) on behalf of the Rose Rock General Partner,
authorized and directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the Rose Rock Common Unitholders and,
as permitted by the Rose Rock LP Agreement, authorized the Rose Rock Common Unitholders to act by written consent
without a meeting in connection with consenting to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
and recommended that the Rose Rock Common Unitholders vote in favor of the Merger.
Later in the afternoon of May 30, 2016, at a special meeting of the SemGroup Board at which all members of the
SemGroup Board as well as SemGroup management and, at the request of the SemGroup Board, representatives of
Gibson Dunn, Potter Anderson, Barclays and Citigroup were present, the SemGroup Board received a status report from
Mr. Conner regarding the Merger, who indicated that management had reached a potential agreement on the terms of the
Merger with the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, subject to the approval of the SemGroup Board. Mr. Conner reported
(i) that the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee had granted Special Approval of the Merger pursuant to the Rose Rock LP
Agreement and had recommended approval of the Merger to the Rose Rock Board and (ii) that the Merger had been
subsequently approved by the Rose Rock Board. Messrs. Conner and Fitzgerald then reviewed with the SemGroup
Board the terms of the proposed Merger, including the principal benefits of the proposed Merger, as well as financial and
strategic alternatives to the Merger and the primary reasons why such alternatives were not considered by SemGroup
management to be feasible or advantageous. In particular, SemGroup management did not believe that additional
general partner support or reducing distributions would address Rose Rock’s high cost of capital. And SemGroup
management discussed how Rose Rock’s high cost of capital made asset drop downs by SemGroup uneconomic to
Rose Rock at prices that would be fair to SemGroup. SemGroup management concluded that the proposed Merger was
preferable to any alternative because SemGroup management believed that the proposed Merger would maximize value
for SemGroup investors and provide a clear path going forward for the combined entity. For a discussion of such
principal benefits of the Merger, see “Recommendation of the SemGroup Board and Its Reasons for the Merger.”
Representatives of Barclays provided the SemGroup Board with an overview of Barclays’ fairness opinion presentation
as well as updated financial and market perspectives regarding SemGroup. Representatives of Barclays then presented
Barclays’ financial analyses regarding the Merger Consideration and delivered its oral opinion to the SemGroup Board,
which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated May 30, 2016, to the effect that, as of such date and based
upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated therein, from a financial point of view, the
Exchange Ratio to be paid by SemGroup in the Merger was fair
Table of Contents
45
to SemGroup. Representatives of Gibson Dunn reviewed with the SemGroup Board the key terms of the Merger
Agreement and responded to questions from the SemGroup Board regarding the Merger Agreement. Representatives of
Potter Anderson discussed the SemGroup Board’s fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger and, in particular, the
terms of the Merger Agreement and their impact thereon. Following review and discussions among the members of the
SemGroup Board, the members of the SemGroup Board unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger and the Stock Issuance, are advisable and
fair to, and in the best interests of, SemGroup and the SemGroup Stockholders; (ii) authorized and approved the Merger
Agreement (in the form delivered to the SemGroup Board) and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without
limitation, the Merger and the Stock Issuance; and (iii) directed that the approval of the Stock Issuance be submitted to a
vote at the SemGroup Special Meeting and recommended that SemGroup Stockholders vote in favor of the Stock
Issuance.
In the evening of May 30, 2016, the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement were executed by the parties.
In the morning of May 31, 2016, SemGroup and Rose Rock issued a joint press release announcing the Merger
Agreement.
Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standards of Conduct and Modification of Duties
The approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, by a majority of
the members of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee acting in good faith constitutes “Special Approval” under the Rose
Rock LP Agreement. Under Section 7.9(a) of the Rose Rock LP Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest
exists, such as consideration of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
any resolution or course of action by the Rose Rock General Partner or its affiliates in respect of such conflict of interest
will be permitted and deemed approved by all of the partners of Rose Rock, and will not constitute a breach of the Rose
Rock LP Agreement or of any duty under the Rose Rock LP Agreement or stated or implied by law, in equity or
otherwise, if the resolution or course of action is approved by Special Approval.
Under Section 7.10(b) of the Rose Rock LP Agreement, any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Rose Rock
General Partner in reliance upon the advice or opinion of certain advisers (including, among others, legal counsel,
accountants, appraisers, management consultants, and investment bankers), as to matters reasonably believed to be in
such adviser’s professional or expert competence, will be “conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good
faith and in accordance with such advice or opinion.”
Recommendation of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and the Rose Rock Board
The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee considered the benefits of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger
Transactions as well as the associated risks, and resolved, by a unanimous vote held on May 30, 2016, that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including both the Merger and the execution, delivery and
performance of the Support Agreement, are in the best interests of Rose Rock considering the interests of the Rose
Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders; approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger Transactions, including the Merger (such
approval constituting “Special Approval” as defined in the Rose Rock LP Agreement); and recommended the approval
of the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement and the consummation of the Merger Transactions, including the
Merger, to the Rose Rock Board. For a discussion of many of the factors considered by the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee in making their determination and approval, please read “The Merger — Reasons for the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee’s Recommendation.”
Based upon such approval and recommendation, at a meeting duly called and held on May 30, 2016, the Rose Rock
Board unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without
limitation, the Merger and the Support Agreement; declared it advisable and in the best interests of the Rose Rock
General Partner that the Rose Rock General Partner, on its own behalf and on behalf
Table of Contents
46
of Rose Rock, execute, deliver and perform the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement, and consummate the
Merger and engage in all transactions related thereto, including the Merger; and, on behalf of the Rose Rock General
Partner, authorized and directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the Rose Rock Common
Unitholders and, as permitted by the Rose Rock LP Agreement, authorized the Rose Rock Common Unitholders to act
by written consent without a meeting in connection with consenting to the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby.
Reasons for the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee’s Recommendation
The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee consulted with its independent financial and legal advisors and considered many
factors in making its determination and approvals, and the related recommendation to the Rose Rock Board. The Rose
Rock Conflicts Committee considered the following factors to be generally positive or favorable in making its
determination and approvals, and the related recommendation to the Rose Rock Board:
•
The Exchange Ratio of 0.8136 a share of SemGroup Common Stock for each outstanding Rose Rock Public Unit provides
the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders with an exchange ratio that is near the two-year high for the implied exchange ratio
for the period ending May 27, 2016 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger) based on the trading
prices of Rose Rock Common Units and shares of SemGroup Common Stock during such period, and compares favorably
to the implied exchange ratios of 0.6470, 0.5884 and 0.5901 for the thirty prior trading days, 180 prior trading days and one-
year prior trading days, respectively, for the periods ending May 27, 2016.

The Exchange Ratio of 0.8136 of a share of SemGroup Common Stock for each outstanding Rose Rock Public Unit
represents an implied premium of approximately 8.6%, 17.7% and 25.2% to the 10 trading day, 20 trading day and 30 trading
day volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of Rose Rock Common Units as of May 27, 2016, based on the VWAP for
SemGroup Common Stock for such periods.
The Exchange Ratio is fixed and therefore the value of the consideration to be received by the Rose Rock Unaffiliated
Unitholders in the Merger would increase in the event the market price of SemGroup Common Stock increased prior to
Closing.
The Merger eliminates the burden on Rose Rock’s cost of capital resulting from the level of incentive distributions payable to
SemGroup, which could from time to time make it more challenging for Rose Rock to pursue accretive acquisitions or drop-
down transactions and relatively more expensive to fund its capital program. The Merger is expected to provide Rose Rock
Unaffiliated Unitholders with equity ownership in an entity with a lower cost of capital, which is expected to provide greater
ability to pursue accretive capital projects and acquisitions.
That, in receiving SemGroup Common Stock in the Merger, Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders will be provided an
opportunity to participate in a combined entity that, after giving effect to the Merger, will have a more diversified asset base
and a stronger credit profile than Rose Rock on a standalone basis before the Merger.
SemGroup’s status as a corporation and its size following the Merger provide a number of benefits relative to Rose Rock’s
MLP structure, including that corporations generally attract a broader set of investors as compared to MLPs because certain
types of institutional investors face prohibitions or limitations on investing in entities other than corporations, and that Rose
Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders will benefit from enhanced voting and other rights as stockholders of a corporation as opposed
to unitholders of an MLP controlled by a general partner.
The Merger will simplify SemGroup’s corporate structure and eliminate potential conflicts of interests between SemGroup
and Rose Rock.
The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee’s belief that the Merger Consideration represented the greatest amount of consideration
that SemGroup would have been willing to agree to pay at the time of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee’s determination
and approval of the Merger.

The valuation analyses of Rose Rock and SemGroup prepared by Evercore and reviewed and discussed with the Rose
Rock Conflicts Committee, including discounted cash flow analysis, discounted distribution/dividend analysis, precedent
M&A transactions analysis, peer group trading analysis, and premiums paid analysis, as well as the Sensitivity Analyses.
The delivery of an opinion by Evercore to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee on May 30, 2016, to the effect that, as of that
date and based upon and subject to the factors, procedures, assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in its written
opinion, the Exchange Ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders.
Certain terms of the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement, principally:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
SemGroup’s obligation to reimburse Rose Rock for its expenses, capped at $3.8 million, through a direct cash payment
to Rose Rock in the event SemGroup or Rose Rock were to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms due
to an inability to obtain the SemGroup Stock Issuance Approval;
SemGroup’s obligation to pay Rose Rock a termination fee of $15.5 million through a direct cash payment to Rose
Rock in the event SemGroup or Rose Rock were to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms due to a
SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change;
under the Support Agreement, SemGroup Holdings has agreed to deliver a written consent adopting and approving in
all respects the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger;
the pre-closing operating covenants for SemGroup which provide protection to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders
by restricting SemGroup’s ability to take certain actions prior to Closing that could reduce the value of the Merger
Consideration; and
•
the consummation of the Merger is not conditioned on financing.
The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee believed that potential alternative transactions with third parties were not achievable
due to SemGroup’s control of the Rose Rock General Partner. In addition, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee considered
the potential implications to Rose Rock and the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders of remaining with the status quo rather
than approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, taking into account the potential financial impact to the Rose Rock
Unaffiliated Unitholders of the projected reduction in quarterly cash distributions on the Rose Rock Common Units as
reflected in the Management Rose Rock Base Case Projections, as well as concerns regarding the viability of financing
future drop down transactions involving SemGroup growth projects.
In addition, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee also considered a number of factors relating to the procedural
safeguards involved in the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, including those discussed below, each of which
supported its determination with respect to the Merger:
•
•
•
•
Each of the members of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committees satisfies the requirements for serving on the Rose Rock
Conflicts Committee, including the requirement that all members of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee be independent
directors, as defined under the Rose Rock Partnership Agreement.
In connection with the consideration of the Merger, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee retained its own independent
financial and legal advisors with knowledge and experience with respect to public merger and acquisition transactions, and
SemGroup’s and Rose Rock’s industry specifically, as well as substantial experience advising publicly traded master limited
partnerships and other companies with respect to transactions similar to the Merger.
The Merger Consideration and the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the Merger Transactions were
determined through arm’s-length negotiations between SemGroup and the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and their
respective representatives and advisors.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, SemGroup will not eliminate the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee, revoke or diminish the authority of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee or
Table of Contents
48
•
•
remove or cause the removal of any director of the Rose Rock General Partner who is a member of the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee either as a director or as a member of such committee, without the affirmative vote of the members of the Rose
Rock Board, including the affirmative vote of the other member of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee.
Under certain terms, the Merger Agreement may not be amended without the approval of the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee.
Whenever a determination, agreement, decision, approval or consent of Rose Rock or the Rose Rock General Partner is
required pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including any decision or determination by Rose Rock to terminate the Merger
Agreement, such determination, decision, approval or consent must be approved by the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee.
The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee considered the following factors to be generally negative or unfavorable in making
its determination and approvals, and the related recommendation to the Rose Rock Board:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The Merger will be a taxable transaction to the Rose Rock Public Unitholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes (See
“Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”).
The Exchange Ratio is fixed and therefore the value of the consideration to be received by the Rose Rock Public
Unitholders in the Merger would decrease in the event the market price of SemGroup Common Stock decreased prior to
Closing.
The Exchange Ratio represents a 0% implied premium based on the closing prices of Rose Rock Common Units and
SemGroup Common Stock as of May 27, 2016 (the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the Merger).
The potential risk that certain of SemGroup’s growth projects may not be completed as contemplated by the Management
SemGroup Base Case Projections.
Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders are not entitled to appraisal rights under the Merger Agreement, the Rose Rock LP
Agreement or Delaware law.
Following the Merger, the income of the resulting combined entity will be subject to double taxation (at the combined
company and shareholder levels) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, while income of Rose Rock is currently subject to
only one level of tax (at the unitholder level).
The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee was not authorized to, and did not, conduct an auction process or other solicitation of
interest from third parties for the acquisition of Rose Rock. Since SemGroup indirectly controls the Rose Rock General
Partner, it was unrealistic to expect an unsolicited third-party acquisition proposal or offer to acquire assets or control of Rose
Rock, and it was unlikely that the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee could conduct a meaningful process to solicit interest in
the acquisition of assets or control of Rose Rock.
The Merger Agreement and the Merger Transactions are not conditioned on a vote by, and the approval of, a majority of the
outstanding Rose Rock Common Units held by the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders. The Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee determined not to pursue a term requiring the Merger to be approved by such a vote after considering the
economic terms of the Merger, SemGroup’s stated position that it would not agree to such a term, the procedural safeguards
that had been involved in the negotiation of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, and the other factors discussed in this
section.
The potential benefits sought in the Merger might not be fully realized.
•
•
•
The Merger might not be completed in a timely manner, or at all, and a failure to complete the Merger could negatively affect
the trading price of Rose Rock Common Units.
Litigation may be commenced in connection with the Merger and such litigation may increase costs and result in a diversion
of management focus.
Certain members of Rose Rock management and the Rose Rock Board may have interests that are different from those of
the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders.

Certain terms of the Merger Agreement, principally:
•
•
•
the Merger is conditioned upon receiving the Stock Issuance Approval;
the provisions allowing the SemGroup Board to make a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change (as described
under “The Merger Agreement — SemGroup Board Recommendation and SemGroup Adverse Recommendation
Change”); and
the provisions allowing for the termination of the Merger Agreement, or the deemed termination thereof, under certain
circumstances following a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change (as describe under “The Merger Agreement
— Termination”).
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee is not
intended to be exhaustive, but includes material factors the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee considered. In view of the
variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the
Rose Rock Conflicts Committee did not find it useful and did not attempt to quantify or assign any relative or specific
weights to the various factors considered in making its determination and recommendation. In addition, each of the
members of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee may have given differing weights to different factors. Overall, the Rose
Rock Conflicts Committee believed that the positive factors supporting the Merger outweighed the negative factors it
considered.
The explanation of the reasoning of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and certain information presented in this
section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, the information should be read in light of the factors discussed in
the sections entitled “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”
Unaudited Financial Projections of SemGroup and Rose Rock
Neither SemGroup nor Rose Rock routinely publishes projections as to long-term future performance, earnings or
dividends and distributions. In connection with the proposed Merger, management of SemGroup prepared non-public
projections relating to the future financial and operating performance of SemGroup and Rose Rock with respect to the
period from 2016 to 2020. The Management Base Case Projections summarized below were provided to Evercore for use
and consideration in its financial analysis and in preparation of its opinion to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee. Each
of the projections summarized below were provided to Barclays for use and consideration in its financial analysis and in
preparation of its opinion to the SemGroup Board. Management did not provide any other financial projections to
Evercore or Barclays. The summary of these projections is included below to give Rose Rock Common Unitholders and
SemGroup Stockholders access to certain non-public unaudited prospective financial information that was made
available to Evercore, Barclays, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, the Rose Rock Board and the SemGroup Board in
connection with the proposed Merger.
You should be aware that uncertainties are inherent in prospective financial information of any kind. None of SemGroup
or Rose Rock or any of their affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, or representatives has made or makes any
representation or can give any assurance to any Rose Rock Common Unitholder or SemGroup Stockholder, or any
other person, regarding the ultimate performance of Rose Rock or SemGroup compared to the summarized information
set forth below or that any such results will be achieved.
The inclusion of the following summary projections in this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus should
not be regarded as an indication that Rose Rock, SemGroup, or their respective advisors or other representatives
considered or consider the projections to be a reliable or accurate prediction of future performance or events, and the
summary projections set forth below should not be relied upon as such.
The SemGroup and Rose Rock projections summarized below were prepared by employees of SemGroup. The
SemGroup and Rose Rock projections were only prepared for internal planning purposes and not with a view toward
public disclosure or toward compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the published
guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Neither
BDO USA, LLP (“BDO”), nor any other independent registered public accounting firm,
Table of Contents
50
has compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained in
the projections, and accordingly, BDO does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
BDO has not given advice or consultation in connection with the proposed Merger. The BDO reports incorporated by
reference into this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus with respect to Rose Rock and SemGroup relate
to historical financial information of Rose Rock and SemGroup, respectively. Such reports do not extend to the
projections included below and should not be read to do so. Neither the Rose Rock Board nor the SemGroup Board
prepared, and none of the Rose Rock Board, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, the Rose Rock General Partner, Rose
Rock or the SemGroup Board gives any assurance regarding, the summarized information.
The internal financial projections of SemGroup and Rose Rock are, in general, prepared primarily for internal use. Such
internal financial projections are inherently subjective in nature, susceptible to interpretation and, accordingly, such
projections may not be achieved. The internal financial projections also reflect numerous assumptions made by
management, including material assumptions that may not be realized and are subject to significant uncertainties and
contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the preparing party.
SemGroup management, consistent with past presentations to the SemGroup Board and Rose Rock Board and public
guidance representations, develops its financial projections according to several criteria, including commodity price
sensitivities (base, high and low commodity price environment cases). For internal purposes only, SemGroup
management also provides financial projections that include prospective projects, which are risked based on the status
of each project’s probability of success and final approval, among other factors. The financial projections that include
risked prospective projects are reviewed alongside the other projections in the ordinary course. As noted therein, the
financial projections presented to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee included the effects of risked prospective
projects. Prospective mergers and acquisitions were excluded from the financial projections. Accordingly, there can be
no assurance that the assumptions made in preparing the internal financial projections upon which the foregoing
projected financial information was based will prove accurate. There will be differences between actual and projected
results, and the differences may be material. The risk that these uncertainties and contingencies could cause the
assumptions to fail to be reflective of actual results is further increased due to the length of time in the future over which
these assumptions apply. Any inaccuracy of assumptions and projections in early periods could have a compounding
effect on the projections shown for the later periods. Thus, any failure of an assumption or projection to be reflective of
actual results in an early period could have a greater effect on the projected results failing to be reflective of actual
events in later periods.
All of these assumptions involve variables making them difficult to predict, and some are beyond the control of Rose
Rock and SemGroup. Although SemGroup’s management believes that there was a reasonable basis for its projections
and underlying assumptions, any assumptions for near-term projected cases remain uncertain, and the risk of
inaccuracy increases with the length of the projected period. The projections are forward-looking statements and are
subject to risks and uncertainties. See “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
In developing the projections, SemGroup’s management made numerous material assumptions with respect to
SemGroup and Rose Rock for the period from 2016 to 2020, including:
•
organic growth opportunities, and the amounts and timing of related capital expenditures and related operational cash flows;
outstanding debt during applicable periods, and the availability and cost of capital;
the cash flow from existing assets and business activities;
the prices and production of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and other hydrocarbon products, which could
impact volumes and margins;
a $200 million common equity capital raise in the third quarter of 2016 (On June 22, 2016, SemGroup closed an offering of
the SemGroup Common Stock as contemplated by this assumption. SemGroup received net proceeds of approximately
$228.4 million from such offering); and

other general business, market and financial assumptions.

In preparing the summarized projected financial information described herein, SemGroup management prepared
projections based on a “downside” case (the “Management Downside Case Projections”) and based on an “upside”
case (the “Management Upside Case Projections”). The Management Downside Case Projections assume a prolonged
low commodity price environment that would cause declines in uncommitted customer volumes and termination of
uncommitted project capital expenditures. The Management Upside Case Projections assume a higher commodity price
environment that would cause an increase in uncommitted customer volumes.
The summarized projected financial information set forth below was based on SemGroup’s and Rose Rock’s projected
results for 2016 through 2020 with respect to the Management Downside Case Projections.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (as presented in the tables above):
The unaudited financial projections of SemGroup and Rose Rock above include financial measures which are not GAAP
measures and are not intended to be used in lieu of GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have
important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures. The items presented do not represent all items that affect comparability between
the periods presented. Variations in operating results are also caused by changes in volumes, prices, exchange rates,
mechanical interruptions and numerous other factors. These types of variances are not separately identified in this
presentation.
SemGroup’s non-GAAP measures are Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for dividends (“Distributable Cash Flow”).
The GAAP presentation of net income (loss) is the most closely associated GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA
represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for selected items that SemGroup
believes impact the comparability of financial results between reporting periods. Adjusted EBITDA includes the EBITDA
from assets owned by SemGroup as well as the distributions received from Rose Rock Midstream and NGL Energy
Partners LP. Distributable Cash Flow is based on Adjusted EBITDA, as described above, adjusted to exclude cash
income taxes, cash interest expense and maintenance capital expenditures.
Rose Rock’s non-GAAP financial measures are Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow. The GAAP presentation
of net income (loss) and cash provided by (used in) operating activities are the GAAP measures most directly
comparable to Adjusted EBITDA, and net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable
cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation
and amortization, earnings from equity method investments and any other non-cash adjustments to reconcile net
income to net cash provided by operating activities plus cash distributions from equity method investments.
Distributable Cash Flow represents Adjusted EBITDA, as described above, adjusted to exclude cash income taxes, cash
interest expense and maintenance capital expenditures.
NEITHER ROSE ROCK NOR SEMGROUP INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE ABOVE PROSPECTIVE
FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE DATE SUCH PROSPECTIVE
FINANCIAL INFORMATION WAS PREPARED OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF SUBSEQUENT EVENTS, EVEN
IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL
INFORMATION ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.
Opinion of Evercore — Financial Advisor to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee
The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor in connection with evaluating the
Merger. The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee engaged Evercore based on its qualifications, experience, including prior
work for the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, and reputation. Evercore is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
leveraged buyouts, competitive biddings, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. On
May 30, 2016, at a meeting of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, Evercore rendered its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, that, as of May 30, 2016 and based upon and subject to the factors,
procedures, assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in its opinion, the Exchange Ratio was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders.
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated as of May 30, 2016, which sets forth, among other things, the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached hereto as Annex B and is incorporated by reference in its entirety into
this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus.

You are urged to read Evercore’s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore’s opinion was addressed to, and
provided information for the benefit of, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee in connection with its evaluation of the
fairness of the Exchange Ratio to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders, and did not address any other aspects or
implications of the Merger. Evercore’s opinion should not be construed as creating any fiduciary duty on Evercore’s part
to any party and such opinion is not intended to be, and does not constitute, a recommendation to the Rose Rock
Conflicts Committee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any Rose Rock Common
Unitholder or SemGroup Stockholder should act or vote in respect of the Merger. The summary of the Evercore opinion
set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion included as Annex B. Evercore’s
opinion speaks as of the date rendered, and Evercore has no obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
In connection with rendering its opinion and performing its related financial analysis, Evercore, among other things:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
reviewed certain publicly-available historical operating and financial information relating to SemGroup and Rose Rock that
Evercore deemed relevant, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and certain Current Reports on Form 8-K, in each case as filed
with or furnished to the SEC by SemGroup and Rose Rock since January 1, 2016;
reviewed certain non-public historical and projected financial and operating data and assumptions relating to SemGroup and
Rose Rock prepared and furnished to Evercore by management of SemGroup and Rose Rock;
considered the Sensitivity Analyses;
discussed the Sensitivity Analyses and certain of the assumptions therein with management of SemGroup and the Rose
Rock Conflicts Committee;
discussed the current operations of SemGroup and Rose Rock and the historical and projected financial and operating data
and assumptions relating to SemGroup and to Rose Rock with management of SemGroup and Rose Rock (including
management’s views of the risks and uncertainties of achieving such projections);
reviewed publicly-available research analyst estimates for each of SemGroup’s and Rose Rock’s future financial
performance;
reviewed the financial metrics of certain historical transactions that Evercore deemed relevant and compared such financial
metrics to those implied by the Merger utilizing forecasts and other data provided by management of SemGroup and the
Sensitivity Analyses;
compared the trading performance of SemGroup and Rose Rock utilizing forecasts and other data provided by management
of SemGroup and the Sensitivity Analyses with the trading performance (including equity market trading multiples) of public
issuers that Evercore deemed relevant;
reviewed the premiums paid in certain historical transactions that Evercore deemed relevant and compared such premiums
to those implied by the Merger;
performed discounted cash flow analyses on SemGroup and Rose Rock based on forecasts and other data provided by
management of SemGroup and the Sensitivity Analyses;
reviewed certain commercial agreements relating to certain growth projects of SemGroup;
reviewed the draft Merger Agreement, dated May 30, 2016; and
performed such other analyses and examinations, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors that
Evercore deemed appropriate.

For purposes of Evercore’s analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon, without undertaking any
independent verification of, the accuracy and completeness of all of the information publicly-available and
Table of Contents
54
all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore and upon the
assurances of the management of SemGroup and Rose Rock that they are not aware of any relevant information that has
been omitted or that remains undisclosed to Evercore, and Evercore assumes no liability therefor. With respect to the
Management Rose Rock Base Case Projections and the Management SemGroup Base Case Projections, Evercore
assumed that such data had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
good faith judgments of the management of Rose Rock and SemGroup as to the future financial performance of Rose
Rock and SemGroup, as applicable, under the assumptions therein. Evercore took into consideration the financial
impact to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders of a projected reduction in the distribution on the Rose Rock Common
Units, which was reflected in the projected financial and operating data relating to Rose Rock prepared by management
of SemGroup and Rose Rock and furnished to Evercore. In addition, at the direction of the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee, Evercore considered the Sensitivity Analyses and discussed the Sensitivity Analyses and certain of the
assumptions therein with management of SemGroup and the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee. Evercore expressed no
view as to the projected financial and operating data or any judgments, estimates or assumptions on which they were
based. With respect to the estimated tax liability calculations relating to Rose Rock, Evercore assumed they had been
reasonably and accurately prepared by Rose Rock and SemGroup and their outside advisors.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the representations
and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement, when executed, would be true and correct at the time of
execution, that each party would perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the
Merger Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger would be satisfied without material waiver
or modification thereof. Evercore further assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or
releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger would be obtained without any material delay, limitation,
restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on Rose Rock, SemGroup or the consummation of the Merger,
or materially reduce the benefits of the Merger to Rose Rock or SemGroup. Evercore assumed that the parties would
execute the final versions of all documents reviewed by it in draft form and that such documents would conform in all
material respects to the drafts reviewed by Evercore.
Evercore did not make, nor assume any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets
or liabilities of Rose Rock or SemGroup, nor was Evercore furnished with any such appraisals, nor did Evercore evaluate
the solvency or fair value of Rose Rock or SemGroup under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar matters. Evercore’s opinion was necessarily based upon information made available to Evercore as of the date
of the opinion and financial, economic, monetary, market, regulatory and other conditions as they existed and as could
be evaluated on the date of the opinion. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect Evercore’s opinion
and that Evercore does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Evercore expressed no opinion with respect to any matter other than whether the Exchange Ratio was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders. Evercore’s opinion did not express any opinion as to
the structure, terms (other than the financial terms) or effect of any other aspect of the Merger, including, without
limitation, the tax consequences of the Merger or the corporate governance changes occurring in connection therewith
except to the extent that such changes constituted financial terms of the Merger. Evercore’s opinion did not express any
view on, and its opinion does not address, the fairness of any individual element of the Merger Agreement, other than the
Exchange Ratio. Further, Evercore’s opinion does not address the fairness to the holders of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of Rose Rock or SemGroup.
Evercore assumed that any modification to the structure of the Merger Agreement would not vary in any respect material
to its analysis. Evercore’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or
financial strategies that might have been available to Rose Rock or SemGroup, nor did it address the underlying
business decision of Rose Rock to engage in the Merger. In arriving at its opinion, Evercore was not authorized to solicit,
and did not solicit, interest from any third party with respect to any

business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving Rose Rock or SemGroup, or any of their respective
affiliates. Evercore’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee or to any other
persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any Rose Rock Common Unitholders should vote in respect of the
Merger. Evercore expressed no opinion as to the price at which the Rose Rock Common Units or SemGroup Common
Stock would trade at any time. Evercore is not a legal, regulatory, accounting or tax expert and assumed the accuracy
and completeness of assessments by Rose Rock management and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory,
accounting and tax matters.
Set forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Evercore and reviewed with the Rose Rock
Conflicts Committee on May 30, 2016 in connection with rendering Evercore’s opinion to the Rose Rock Conflicts
Committee. Each analysis was provided to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee. However, the following summary does
not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. In connection with arriving at its
opinion, Evercore considered all of its analyses as a whole, and the order of the analyses described and the results of
these analyses do not represent any relative importance or particular weight given to these analyses by Evercore.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based
on market data that existed on May 27, 2016 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger), and is
not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Analysis of Rose Rock
Evercore performed a series of analyses to derive indicative valuation ranges for Rose Rock Common Units and utilized
each of the resulting implied valuation ranges and those derived for SemGroup Common Stock to derive a range of
implied exchange ratios of Rose Rock Common Units to SemGroup Common Stock, and compared these ratios to the
Exchange Ratio. Evercore performed its analyses utilizing the Management Rose Rock Base Case Projections. The
Management Rose Rock Base Case Projections were not adjusted by Evercore. In the discounted distribution analysis,
the projected distributions used by Evercore were based on various assumed distribution levels at and below a $2.64
annualized distribution per Rose Rock Common Unit.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Rose Rock by valuing the cash flows to be received by Rose
Rock based on the Management Rose Rock Base Case Projections, assuming a September 30, 2016 effective date.
Evercore calculated the per unit value range for Rose Rock Common Units by utilizing a range of discount rates with a
mid-point equal to Rose Rock’s after-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”), as estimated by Evercore based
on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”), and terminal values based on a range of estimated EBITDA exit multiples
as well as perpetuity growth rates. Evercore assumed a range of after-tax discount rates of 8.0% to 9.0%, a range of
EBITDA exit multiples of 8.0x to 10.0x, and a range of perpetuity growth rates of 1.75% to 2.25%. Tax depreciation was
assumed to be allocated to a fifteen-year modified accelerated cost recovery system (“MACRS”) schedule. The
applicable tax rate was assumed to be 35%. After adjusting for projected debt outstanding as of September 30, 2016,
projected cash as of September 30, 2016 and projected units outstanding as of September 30, 2016, Evercore
determined an implied equity value per unit range of $14.16 per unit to $25.30 per unit utilizing the Management Rose
Rock Base Case Projections.
Discounted Distribution Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted distribution analysis for Rose Rock Common Units based on the present value of the
future cash distributions to Rose Rock Common Unitholders. The projected distributions used by Evercore were based
on various assumed distribution levels at and below a $2.64 annualized distribution per Rose Rock Common Unit.
Evercore utilized a terminal yield range of 10.0% to 15.0% based on Rose Rock trading over the last three months, a cost
of equity of 9.5% to 11.5% based on CAPM and a cost of equity of 14.0% to 16.0% based on expected market total return
for similar master limited partnerships (“MLPs”). Using the Management Rose Rock Base Case Projections and the cost
of equity based on CAPM, Evercore determined
Table of Contents
56
an implied equity value per unit range of $12.53 per unit to $27.26 per unit. Using the Management Rose Rock Base Case
Projections and the cost of equity based on expected market total return, Evercore determined an implied equity value
per unit range of $11.15 per unit to $23.72 per unit.

Evercore reviewed the historical EBITDA multiples paid in the selected transactions and derived a range of relevant
implied multiples of Enterprise Value (defined below) to EBITDA of 9.0x to 11.0x for crude oil pipelines, 6.0x to 8.0x for
crude oil gathering, trucking and logistics businesses, 8.0x to 10.0x for the crude oil terminal assets and a weighted
average multiple of 7.9x to 9.9x for Rose Rock 2016E general and administrative expenses. Evercore then applied these
ranges of selected multiples to 2016E EBITDA for each of Rose Rock’s relevant segments. Evercore discounted the
resulting enterprise values to September 30, 2016 utilizing an 8.5% WACC, and subtracted the present value of growth
capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2016E utilizing an 8.5% WACC. After adjusting for projected debt
outstanding as of September 30, 2016, projected cash as of September 30, 2016 and projected units outstanding as of
September 30, 2016, Evercore determined an implied equity value per unit range of $14.79 per unit to $23.80 per unit
using the Management Rose Rock Base Case Projections.
Peer Group Trading Analysis
Evercore performed a peer group trading analysis of Rose Rock by reviewing and comparing the market values and
trading multiples of the following three publicly-traded partnerships that Evercore deemed to have certain characteristics
that are similar to those of Rose Rock:
Supply Focused Crude Oil MLPs:
•
•
•
Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P.
JP Energy Partners LP
Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.
Although the peer group was compared to Rose Rock for purposes of this analysis, no partnership used in the peer
group analysis is identical or directly comparable to Rose Rock. In order to calculate peer group trading multiples,
Evercore relied on publicly-available filings with the SEC and equity research analyst estimates.
For each of the peer group partnerships, Evercore calculated the following trading multiples:
•
•
Enterprise Value/2017 EBITDA, which is defined as market value of equity, plus debt and preferred units, less cash
(“Enterprise Value”), divided by estimated EBITDA for the calendar year 2017; and
Enterprise Value/2018 EBITDA, which is defined as Enterprise Value divided by estimated EBITDA for the calendar year
2018.
The mean and median trading multiples are set forth below. The table also includes relevant multiple ranges selected by
Evercore based on the resulting range of multiples and certain other considerations related to the specific
characteristics of Rose Rock noted by Evercore.

Analysis of SemGroup
Assumptions with Respect to SemGroup
Evercore performed a series of analyses to derive indicative valuation ranges for SemGroup Common Stock. Evercore
performed its analyses utilizing the Management SemGroup Base Case Projections. Evercore also performed its
analyses based upon the Sensitivity Analyses.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of SemGroup by valuing the cash flows to be received by
SemGroup based on the Management SemGroup Base Case Projections and the Sensitivity Analyses, assuming a
September 30, 2016 effective date. Evercore calculated the per share value range for SemGroup Common Stock by
utilizing a range of after-tax discount rates with a mid-point equal to SemGroup’s after-tax WACC, as estimated by
Evercore based on CAPM, and terminal values based on a range of estimated EBITDA exit multiples as well as perpetuity
growth rates. Evercore assumed a range of after-tax discount rates of 10.5% to 12.5%, a range of EBITDA exit multiples of
8.0x to 10.0x, and a range of perpetuity growth rates of 1.75% to 2.25%. Tax depreciation was assumed to be allocated to
a seven-year MACRS schedule. The applicable tax rate was assumed to be 35%. Evercore discounted the cash flows
projected to be received by SemGroup from certain anticipated growth projects. Using the Management SemGroup Base
Case Projections and the Sensitivity Analyses, Evercore added the implied value of the anticipated growth projects, the
implied value of Rose Rock’s “GP/IDRs” owned by SemGroup based on the SemGroup peer group trading analysis
reviewed below and the implied value of the projected Rose Rock Common Units held by SemGroup as of September 30,
2016, based on the Rose Rock peer group trading analysis reviewed above to the implied value of other directly held
SemGroup assets to produce an implied Enterprise Value range of $1,314.5 million to $2,376.6 million (as used herein,
“GP/IDR” refers to the General Partner Interest and the Incentive Distribution Rights, each as defined in the Rose Rock
LP Agreement, taken together). After adjusting for projected debt outstanding as of September 30, 2016, projected cash
as of September 30, 2016, and projected shares of SemGroup Common Stock outstanding as of September 30, 2016,
Evercore determined an implied equity value per share range of $21.47 per share to $41.89 per share using the
Management SemGroup Base Case Projections and the Sensitivity Analyses.
Discounted Dividend Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted dividend analysis of SemGroup Common Stock based on the present value of the
future cash dividends to SemGroup Stockholders. The projected dividends used by Evercore were based on the
Management SemGroup Base Case Projections and the Sensitivity Analyses, a terminal yield range of 5.75% to 9.75%
based on SemGroup trading over the last three months, cost of equity of 12.0% to 14.0% based on CAPM, and cost of
equity of 12.5% to 14.5% based on expected market total return for similar general partners. Evercore determined an
implied equity value per share range using the cost of equity based on CAPM of $21.40 per share to $34.18 per share
using the Management SemGroup Base Case Projections and the Sensitivity Analyses.
Precedent M&A Transaction Analysis
Evercore performed a valuation analysis of SemGroup Common Stock based on multiples of transaction value paid in
historical transactions involving assets similar to those of SemGroup and general partners of MLPs and the discounted
cash flows projected to be received by SemGroup from certain of SemGroup’s expansion projects, utilizing a discounted
cash flow methodology with respect to such expansion projects (the “Expansion Projects Discounted Cash Flows
Methodology”). Evercore discounted growth capital expenditures at 11.5% based on SemGroup’s after-tax WACC.

Evercore reviewed the historical multiples paid in the selected transactions and derived a range of relevant implied
multiples of Enterprise Value to EBITDA of 8.0x to 10.0x for the U.S. gathering and processing assets, 6.0x to 8.0x for the
Canadian gathering and processing assets, 7.0x to 9.0x for the refined products terminals and 6.5x to 7.5x for the asphalt
business. Evercore then applied these ranges of selected multiples to 2016E EBITDA for each of SemGroup’s relevant
assets. Evercore applied a weighted average range of multiples of 6.9x to 8.8x to SemGroup’s corporate expenses.
Evercore then (i) discounted the implied Enterprise Value for SemGroup to September 30, 2016 using a discount rate of
11.5% based on SemGroup’s WACC, (ii) subtracted the present value of growth capital expenditures, (iii) added the
implied enterprise value of certain of SemGroup’s expansion projects utilizing the Expansion Projects Discounted Cash
Flow Methodology, (iv) added the implied Enterprise Value of the 2016 GP/IDR cash flow based on 30.0x to 50.0x
multiples, and (v) added the implied value of the Rose Rock Common Units held by SemGroup as of September 30, 2016
based on the Rose Rock Precedent M&A Transaction Analysis to yield an implied Enterprise Value range for SemGroup
as of September 30, 2016 of $1,098.0 million to $2,237.1 million based on the Management SemGroup Base Case
Projections and the Sensitivity Analyses. After adjusting unconsolidated debt outstanding as of September 30, 2016,
unconsolidated cash as of September 30, 2016, and shares of SemGroup Common Stock outstanding as of
September 30, 2016, Evercore determined an implied equity value per share range of $19.56 per share to $36.07 per
share using the Management SemGroup Base Case Projections and the Sensitivity Analyses.

Evercore determined a value per share of SemGroup Common Stock based on the current market enterprise value to
EBITDA multiples of these relevant publicly-traded comparables. The cash distributions from Rose Rock’s GP/IDRs were
valued utilizing multiples based on the GP/IDR cash flow multiples of publicly-traded general partners of 11.0x to 14.0x
2017E GP/IDR Rights cash flows and 10.0x to 13.5x 2018E GP/IDR cash flows. The directly held SemGroup assets were
valued based on the EBITDA multiples of relevant peer groups. The multiples utilized for 2017E were as follows (i) 9.0x to
11.0x for SemGas and SemCAMS, (ii) 8.0x to 10.0x for SemLogistics and SemMaterials and (iii) a weighted average
multiple range of 8.8x to 10.8x for SemGroup corporate expenses. The multiples utilized for 2018E were as follows (i) 8.0x
to 10.0x for SemGas and SemCAMS, (ii) 7.0x to 9.0x for SemLogistics and SemMaterials and (iii) a weighted average
multiple range of 7.8x to 9.8x for SemGroup corporate expenses.
Evercore added the implied value of the Rose Rock Common Units held by SemGroup as of September 30, 2016 to the
implied value of Rose Rock’s GP/IDRs and implied value of other directly held SemGroup assets utilizing 2017E EBITDA
and peer group trading multiples to produce an implied Enterprise Value range of $1,260.1 million to $2,510.8 million
based on the Management SemGroup Base Case Projections and the Sensitivity Analyses. Evercore added the implied
value of the Rose Rock Common Units held by SemGroup as of September 30, 2016 to the implied value of Rose Rock’s
GP/IDRs and implied value of other directly held SemGroup assets utilizing 2018E EBITDA and peer group trading
multiples to produce an implied Enterprise Value range of $1,269.9 million to $2,644.6 million based on the Management
SemGroup Base Case Projections and the Sensitivity Analyses. After adjusting for unconsolidated debt outstanding as
of September 30, 2016, unconsolidated cash as of September 30, 2016, and shares of SemGroup Common Stock
outstanding as of September 30, 2016, Evercore determined an implied equity value per share range of $22.70 per share
to $43.96 per share using the Management SemGroup Base Case Projections and the Sensitivity Analyses.

Exchange Ratio Summary
73
Evercore analyzed the implied exchange ratios resulting from the various valuation methodologies utilized to value the
Rose Rock Common Units and SemGroup Common Stock. These valuation methodologies included Discounted Cash
Flow Analysis, Discounted Distribution Analysis, Discounted Dividend Analysis, M&A Precedent Transaction Analysis
and Peer Group Trading Analysis. When comparing the low value for Rose Rock to the high value for SemGroup, and the
high value for Rose Rock to the low value for SemGroup for each methodology, the resulting exchange ratio range was
0.192x to 1.254x using (i) the Management Rose Rock Base Case Projections and (ii) the Management SemGroup Base
Case Projections and the Sensitivity Analyses.
Evercore compared the results of the foregoing analyses to the Exchange Ratio of 0.8136x, noting that such ratio was
within the range of the implied exchange ratios reviewed by Evercore.
General
The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses or data presented by Evercore. In connection with the review of the transaction, Evercore performed a variety
of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without considering the analyses as
a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness
determination, Evercore considered the results of all the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or
with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its
determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all
the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses
and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the
ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above should not be
taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the exchange ratio. No company used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to SemGroup, no partnership used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly
comparable to Rose Rock, and no precedent transaction used is directly comparable to the Merger. Furthermore,
Evercore’s analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics
and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, partnerships or
transactions used, including judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of SemGroup, Rose
Rock and their respective advisors.
Evercore prepared these analyses solely for the information and benefit of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and for
the purpose of providing an opinion to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee as to whether the Exchange Ratio was fair,
from a financial point of view, to the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals
or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the business or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in
these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s
analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are
materially different from those forecasted in such estimates. The issuance of the opinion was approved by an opinion
committee of Evercore.
Except as described above, the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee imposed no other instruction or limitation on Evercore
with respect to the investigations made or the procedures followed by Evercore in rendering its opinion. The Merger
Consideration and the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the related terms and conditions of the
transaction were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and
SemGroup. Evercore provided advice to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee during these negotiations. However,
Evercore did not recommend any specific consideration to the Rose Rock
Table of Contents
74
Conflicts Committee or recommend that any specific consideration constitute the only appropriate consideration in the
Merger. Evercore’s opinion was only one of many factors considered by the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee in its
evaluation of the Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee
with respect to the Merger or the Exchange Ratio.
Under the terms of Evercore’s engagement letter with the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, Rose Rock agreed to pay
Evercore a fee of $2.5 million payable upon delivery of Evercore’s opinion. Evercore also received a fee of $250,000 upon
execution of its engagement letter with the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee. In addition, Rose Rock agreed to reimburse
Evercore for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including legal fees, expenses and disbursements) incurred in
connection with its engagement and to indemnify Evercore and any of its members, officers, advisors, representatives,
employees, agents, affiliates or controlling persons, if any, against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of its
engagement, or to contribute to payments which any of such persons might be required to make with respect to such
liabilities.
In September 2015, Evercore provided financial advisory services to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee with respect to
a proposed acquisition by Rose Rock of certain midstream assets (which proposed acquisition ultimately was not
pursued), for which Evercore received a fee and reimbursement of expenses. In June 2014, Evercore provided financial
advisory services to the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee with respect to a contribution of interests in SemCrude Pipeline,
L.L.C. to Rose Rock by SemGroup, for which Evercore received a fee and reimbursement of expenses. Evercore
received approximately $456,000 in aggregate fees and expense reimbursements in connection with the foregoing
services.
Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for their own accounts and the accounts of customers. In
connection with these businesses or otherwise, Evercore and its affiliates and/or their respective employees, as well as
investment funds in which any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or
short positions and may trade or otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in
debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products relating to SemGroup or Rose Rock and their
respective affiliates.
Recommendation of the SemGroup Board and Its Reasons for the Merger
On May 30, 2016, the SemGroup Board unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger and the Stock Issuance, are advisable and fair to, and in
the best interests of, SemGroup and its stockholders; authorized and approved the Merger Agreement in the form
delivered to the SemGroup Board and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger
and the Stock Issuance; and directed that the approval of the Stock Issuance be submitted to a vote at a meeting of
SemGroup’s stockholders and recommended that the SemGroup stockholders vote in favor of the Stock Issuance.
Reasons for the SemGroup Board’s Recommendation
The SemGroup Board considered many factors in making its determination and recommendation. The SemGroup Board
consulted with its financial and legal advisors and viewed the following factors as being generally positive or favorable in
coming to its determination and related recommendation:
•
•
•
Following the Merger, SemGroup management believes that (i) the Merger will be immediately accretive to SemGroup
Stockholders and (ii) the dividends to be received per share of SemGroup Common Stock will be higher than if the Merger
were not consummated.
Following the Merger, SemGroup management believes that SemGroup will have a higher dividend coverage ratio than the
current level.
The Merger is expected to enhance SemGroup’s attractiveness to equity investors (and its overall cost of capital, as a result)
due to (i) a larger total market capitalization, (ii) an increased number of shares held by the public and (iii) removal of
uncertainty concerning the future strategy of Rose Rock.
Table of Contents
75
The Merger will eliminate concerns surrounding SemGroup’s anticipated support of Rose Rock via (i) subsidized “drop-
down” transactions, (ii) the cancellation of the Incentive Distribution Rights and (iii) other supportive options available to a
general partner, all of which were potentially dilutive to SemGroup’s value.
The Merger is expected to simplify the SemGroup organizational structure and enhance SemGroup’s credit profile. As a
result, following the Merger, Rose Rock will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of SemGroup, resulting in one
equity-holder base, one dividend policy and the elimination of the existing structural subordination of indebtedness between
SemGroup and Rose Rock.
The Merger, and SemGroup’s improved access to capital and stronger balance sheet, will empower SemGroup to invest in
growth projects and strategies.

The Merger will better position SemGroup for a lower-for-longer commodity price environment.
Representatives of Barclays rendered Barclays’ opinion to the SemGroup Board that, as of May 30, 2016, and based upon
and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in Barclays’ opinion, from a financial point of view, the
Exchange Ratio to be paid by SemGroup in the Merger was fair to SemGroup.
The SemGroup Board has reviewed with its financial and legal advisors the financial and other terms of the Merger
Agreement and related documents, including the conditions to the parties’ respective obligations and the termination
provisions, including the contractual obligation of Rose Rock Holdings to support the Merger.
The consummation of the Merger requires the approval of the SemGroup Stockholders. Under the Merger Agreement, the
SemGroup Board may change its recommendation to the SemGroup Stockholders if the SemGroup Board determines in
good faith that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
SemGroup Stockholders under applicable law or in connection with a Parent Designated Proposal, subject to an expense
reimbursement or termination fee payable in certain circumstances (see “SemGroup Board Recommendation and
SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change” below).
The Merger is expected to enable SemGroup to benefit from additional tax depreciation amounts, which, based on pre-
announcement closing prices of Rose Rock Common Units, are anticipated to result in cash tax savings over the next 15
years.
The Exchange Ratio is fixed and therefore the value of the Merger Consideration payable to Rose Rock Public Unitholders
will decrease in the event that the market price of SemGroup Common Stock decreases prior to the Closing.
The SemGroup Board is familiar with, and understands, the businesses, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial
condition and competitive positions and prospects of SemGroup and Rose Rock.
The following factors are generally negative or unfavorable in making a determination and recommendation with respect
to the Merger:
•
•
•
•
The Exchange Ratio is fixed and therefore the value of the Merger Consideration payable to Rose Rock Public Unitholders
will increase in the event that the market price of SemGroup Common Stock increases prior to the Closing.
There is risk that the potential benefits sought in the Merger might not be fully realized.
There is risk that SemGroup may be obligated to consummate the Merger even if there are material negative developments
or events at Rose Rock between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger.
There is a risk that SemGroup would be required to pay an expense reimbursement or termination fee to Rose Rock if the
Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances.
76
Table of Contents
•
There is a risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner, or that the Merger might not be consummated at
all as a result of a failure to satisfy the conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, including as a result of a failure to
•
•
obtain SemGroup Stockholder Approval, and a failure to complete the Merger could negatively affect the trading price of
SemGroup Common Stock.
There is a risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner, prolonging the period of time under which
SemGroup is subject to certain covenants and restrictions on its operation of its business.
Certain upward adjustments to the Merger Consideration and other changes to the Merger Agreement for the benefit of the
Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders were negotiated by the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee. In particular, the recent
increase in the trading price of Rose Rock Common Units relative to shares of SemGroup Common Stock resulted in an
increased Exchange Ratio.
After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the SemGroup Board concluded that the
potential benefits of the Merger outweighed any negative or unfavorable considerations and determined that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger and the Stock Issuance,
are in the best interests of SemGroup and its stockholders.
The foregoing discussion is not intended to be exhaustive, but is intended to address the material information and
principal factors considered by the SemGroup Board in considering the Merger. In view of the number and variety of
factors and the amount of information considered, the SemGroup Board did not find it practicable to, and did not make
specific assessments of, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to, the specific factors considered in reaching its
determination. In addition, the SemGroup Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any
particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination, and
individual members of the SemGroup Board may have given different weights to different factors. The SemGroup Board
made its recommendation based on the totality of information presented to, and the investigation conducted by, the
SemGroup Board. It should be noted that certain statements and other information presented in this section are forward-
looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under the heading “Information
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Opinion of Barclays — Financial Advisor to SemGroup
SemGroup retained Barclays to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger. At a meeting of the SemGroup
Board duly called and held on May 30, 2016, representatives of Barclays delivered Barclays’ oral opinion to the
SemGroup Board, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated as of May 30, 2016,
to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated
therein, from a financial point of view, the Exchange Ratio to be paid by SemGroup in the Merger was fair to SemGroup.
The full text of Barclays’ written opinion, dated as of May 30, 2016, is attached as Annex C to this joint consent
statement/proxy statement/prospectus. Barclays’ written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, factors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its
opinion. You are encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays’ opinion
and the methodology that Barclays used to render its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of the opinion.
Barclays’ opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays’ Valuation and Fairness Opinion Committee, is
addressed to the SemGroup Board, addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio to
be paid by SemGroup in the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of SemGroup as to
how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. The Merger Consideration and the
other terms of the Merger were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between SemGroup, on the one hand, and
the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, on the other hand, and were approved on May 30, 2016 by a unanimous vote of the
SemGroup Board. Barclays provided advice to SemGroup
Table of Contents
77
during these negotiations. However, Barclays did not recommend any specific form or amount of consideration to
SemGroup or that any specific form or amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the
Merger. Barclays was not requested to address, and its opinion does not in any manner address, SemGroup’s
underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the Merger or the likelihood of consummation of the Merger or the
relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which SemGroup might
engage. In addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of
the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any
class of such persons, relative to the Exchange Ratio to be paid by SemGroup in the Merger or otherwise. No limitations
were imposed by the SemGroup Board upon Barclays with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by
it in rendering its opinion.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things, reviewed and analyzed:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated as of May 30, 2016, and the specific terms of the Merger;
publicly available information concerning SemGroup and Rose Rock that Barclays believed to be relevant to its analysis,
including each of SemGroup’s and Rose Rock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015
and each of SemGroup’s and Rose Rock’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016;
financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of SemGroup and Rose Rock
furnished to Barclays by SemGroup, including financial projections of SemGroup and Rose Rock (which projections
included forecasted dividend policies of SemGroup, forecasted distribution policies of Rose Rock, and financing
assumptions for both SemGroup and Rose Rock) and an estimate of SemGroup’s tax position beyond the period of the
financial projections, prepared by management of SemGroup (the “Projections”);
the pro forma impact of the Merger on the future financial performance of the combined company, including cost of capital
and credit rating implications and other financial impacts expected by the management of SemGroup to result from the
Merger (collectively, the “Expected Impacts”), as well as the amount of time that management of SemGroup anticipates will
be needed for the combined company to realize such Expected Impacts;
a trading history of SemGroup Common Stock and Rose Rock Common Units from May 27, 2013 through May 27, 2016 and
a comparison of that trading history with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
a comparison of the present financial condition of SemGroup and Rose Rock with each other and with those of other
companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
a comparison of the financial terms of the Merger with the financial terms of certain other transactions that Barclays deemed
relevant; and
published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future financial performance and price targets of
SemGroup and Rose Rock.
In addition, Barclays had discussions with the management of SemGroup concerning its and Rose Rock’s respective
business, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects, and has undertaken such other studies,
analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other
information used by Barclays without any independent verification of such information (and did not assume
responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information) and Barclays further relied upon the
assurances of the management of SemGroup that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make
such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the financial
Table of Contents
78
projections of SemGroup and Rose Rock, upon advice of SemGroup, Barclays assumed that such projections were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
SemGroup as to the future financial performance of SemGroup and Rose Rock and that SemGroup and Rose Rock will
perform substantially in accordance with such projections. Furthermore, upon the advice of SemGroup, Barclays
assumed that the amounts and timing of the Expected Impacts are reasonable and that the Expected Impacts will be
realized in accordance with such estimates. Barclays assumed no responsibility for and expresses no view as to any
such projections or estimates (including the Expected Impacts) or the assumptions on which they are based. In arriving
at its opinion, Barclays did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of SemGroup or Rose Rock
and did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of SemGroup or Rose Rock. Barclays’
opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated
as of, May 30, 2016. Barclays assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on events or
circumstances that may have occurred after May 30, 2016. Barclays expressed no opinion as to the prices at which the
shares of SemGroup Common Stock or Rose Rock Common Units would trade following the announcement of the
Merger or at which price the shares of SemGroup Common Stock would trade at any time following the consummation of
the Merger. Barclays expressed no opinion as to the credit rating of SemGroup at any time following the announcement
or consummation of the Merger. Furthermore, Barclays expressed no opinion as to any determination of the dividend
policy of SemGroup at any time following the consummation of the Merger.
Barclays assumed that the executed Merger Agreement would conform in all material respects to the last draft reviewed
by Barclays. Additionally, Barclays assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger
Agreement and all the agreements related thereto. Barclays also assumed, upon the advice of SemGroup, that all
material governmental, regulatory and third party approvals, consents and releases for the Merger would be obtained
within the constraints contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance
with the terms of the agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement
thereof. Barclays did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the Merger, nor
did Barclays’ opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Barclays understood
SemGroup had obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Barclays performed certain financial, comparative and other analyses as
summarized below. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not ascribe a specific range of values to SemGroup Common
Stock or Rose Rock Common Units but rather made its determination as to fairness, from a financial point of view, to
SemGroup of the Exchange Ratio to be paid by SemGroup in the Merger on the basis of various financial and
comparative analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various determinations
as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative analyses and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor considered by it
but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all
other analyses and factors performed and considered by it and in the context of the circumstances of the particular
transaction. Accordingly, Barclays believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole, as considering any portion
of such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays in preparing its opinion to the SemGroup
Board. Certain financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses used by Barclays, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as
the tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. In performing its analyses, Barclays
made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of SemGroup or any
Table of Contents
79
other parties to the Merger. None of SemGroup, Rose Rock, Merger Sub, Barclays or any other person assumes
responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses
are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of the businesses do not purport to be
appraisals or reflect the prices at which the businesses may actually be sold.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
In order to estimate the present value of SemGroup Common Stock and Rose Rock Common Units, Barclays performed
a discounted cash flow analysis of SemGroup and Rose Rock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation
methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of
the asset. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting
those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and
estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors. Barclays performed its
discounted cash flow analysis for each of SemGroup and Rose Rock using the Management Base Case Projections, the
Management Downside Case Projections, and the Management Upside Case Projections (as described in “Unaudited
Financial Projections of SemGroup and Rose Rock” beginning on page 50).
To calculate the estimated implied per share value of SemGroup Common Stock using the discounted cash flow method
for each of the Management Base Case Projections, the Management Downside Case Projections, and the Management
Upside Case Projections, Barclays added: (i) the forecasted distributable cash flow per share for the second half of 2016
to 2020, based on distributable cash flow projections of SemGroup furnished to Barclays by SemGroup management (as
described in “Unaudited Financial Projections of SemGroup and Rose Rock” beginning on page 50), (ii) the “terminal
value” of the forecasted distributable cash flow per share at the end of calendar year 2020, based on guidance from
SemGroup management, and (iii) the estimated value of SemGroup’s net operating losses used from 2021 through
2026 per share, based on guidance from SemGroup management, and discounted the sum of such amounts to June 30,
2016 using a range of equity cost of capital rates (as further described below).
The terminal value for SemGroup using each of the Management Base Case Projections, the Management Downside
Case Projections, and the Management Upside Case Projections was estimated by applying a range of assumed yields
of 6.5% to 8.5% to SemGroup’s forecasted calendar year 2020 distributable cash flow per share, which was adjusted to
reflect assumptions regarding SemGroup’s tax position at such time, including assumptions regarding the tax rate and
taxable income beyond the period of the projections. These assumed yields were selected based on Barclays’
professional judgment and experience, taking into account the yields of SemGroup and its peers. The cash flows for
SemGroup using each of the Management Base Case Projections, the Management Downside Case Projections, and the
Management Upside Case Projections were then discounted using assumed equity cost of capital rates ranging from
15.0% to 20.0% (the value of SemGroup’s net operating losses was calculated using a 17.5% discount rate), which were
selected based on Barclays’ professional judgment and experience, taking into account projected equity cost of capital
rates for SemGroup and its peers.
To calculate the estimated implied per unit value of Rose Rock Common Units using the discounted cash flow method
for each of the Management Base Case Projections, the Management Downside Case Projections, and the Management
Upside Case Projections, Barclays added: (i) the forecasted distributable cash flow per unit for the second half of 2016 to
2020, based on distributable cash flow projections of Rose Rock furnished to Barclays by SemGroup management (as
described in “Unaudited Financial Projections of SemGroup and Rose Rock” beginning on page 50) to (ii) the “terminal
value” of the forecasted distributable cash flow per unit at the end of calendar year 2020, based on guidance from
SemGroup management, and discounted the sum of such amounts to June 30, 2016 using a range of equity cost of
capital rates (as further described below).
The terminal value for Rose Rock using each of the Management Base Case Projections, the Management Downside
Case Projections, and the Management Upside Case Projections was estimated by applying a range of
Table of Contents
80
assumed yields of 8.0% to 13.0% to Rose Rock’s forecasted calendar year 2020 distributable cash flow per unit. These
assumed yields were selected based on Barclays’ professional judgment and experience, taking into account the yields
of Rose Rock and its peers. The cash flows for Rose Rock using each of the Management Base Case Projections, the
Management Downside Case Projections, and the Management Upside Case Projections were then discounted using
assumed equity cost of capital rates ranging from 16.0% to 21.0%, which were selected based on Barclays’ professional
judgment and experience, taking into account projected equity cost of capital rates for Rose Rock and its peers.
Based on the ranges of implied equity values per share calculated in the SemGroup discounted cash flow analysis and
the ranges of implied equity values per unit calculated in the Rose Rock discounted cash flow analysis, Barclays
calculated a range of implied exchange ratios for SemGroup Common Stock per each Rose Rock Common Unit.
Barclays calculated the high end of the implied exchange ratio range by dividing the high value of the Rose Rock implied
equity values per unit reference range by the low value of the SemGroup implied equity values per share reference
range. Barclays calculated the low end of the implied exchange ratio range by dividing the low value of the Rose Rock
implied equity values per unit reference range by the high value of the SemGroup implied equity values per share
reference range. The following reflects the results of this analysis, as compared to the Exchange Ratio in the Merger of
0.8136x:
•
•
•
For the Management Base Case Projections, an implied exchange ratio range of 0.3476x to 0.8214x
For the Management Downside Case Projections, an implied exchange ratio range of 0.3662x to 0.8763x
For the Management Upside Case Projections, an implied exchange ratio range of 0.3067x to 0.7290x
Selected Comparable Company Analysis
In order to assess how the public market values shares of similar publicly traded companies and to provide a range of
relative implied equity values per share of SemGroup Common Stock and per unit of Rose Rock Common Units by
reference to these companies, which could then be used to calculate implied exchange ratio ranges, Barclays reviewed
and compared specific financial and operating data relating to SemGroup and Rose Rock with selected companies that
Barclays deemed comparable to SemGroup and Rose Rock. The selected comparable companies with respect to
SemGroup were:
•
•
•
•
•
•
NuStar GP Holdings, LLC

Barclays calculated and compared various trading yields of SemGroup and Rose Rock and the selected comparable
companies. As part of its selected comparable company analysis, for SemGroup and its selected comparable
companies, Barclays calculated and analyzed distributable cash flow per share yields for 2016 and 2017 and the latest
quarter annualized dividend yield, and for Rose Rock and its selected comparable companies, Barclays calculated and
analyzed distributable cash flow per unit yields for 2016 and 2017. All of these calculations were performed, and based
on, publicly available financial data published by independent equity research analysts associated with various Wall
Street firms and other publicly available information.
Barclays selected the comparable companies listed above because their businesses and operating profiles are
reasonably similar to that of SemGroup or Rose Rock, as applicable. However, because of the inherent differences
between the business, operations and prospects of SemGroup or Rose Rock, as applicable, and those of the selected
comparable companies, Barclays believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the
quantitative results of the selected comparable company analysis. Accordingly, Barclays also made qualitative
judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of
SemGroup or Rose Rock, as applicable, and the selected comparable companies that could affect the public trading
values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. These qualitative
judgments related primarily to the differing sizes, growth prospects, profitability levels and degree of operational risk
between SemGroup or Rose Rock, as applicable, and the companies included in the selected company analysis.

Based on the range of implied equity value per share for SemGroup and the range of implied equity value per unit for
Rose Rock that was calculated by Barclays in its comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated a range of implied
exchange ratios for SemGroup Common Stock per each Rose Rock Common Unit. Barclays calculated the high end of
the implied exchange ratio range by dividing the high value of the Rose Rock implied equity values per unit reference
range by the low value of the SemGroup implied equity values per share reference range. Barclays calculated the low
end of the implied exchange ratio range by dividing the low value of the Rose Rock implied equity values per unit
reference range by the high value of the SemGroup implied equity values per share reference range. The result of this
analysis, as compared to the Exchange Ratio in the Merger of 0.8136x, was an implied exchange ratio range of 0.4867x to
1.1081x.
Equity Research Price Targets Analysis
Barclays evaluated the publicly available share price targets of SemGroup and unit price targets of Rose Rock published
by independent equity research analysts associated with various Wall Street firms. Barclays used these price targets,
where applicable and available, as a reference point to provide background information and

perspective. With respect to SemGroup, Barclays noted that the range of low to high share price targets, where
applicable and available, as of May 27, 2016 was $24.00 to $39.00 per share of SemGroup Common Stock. With respect to
Rose Rock, Barclays noted that the range of low to high unit price targets, where applicable and available, as of May 27,
2016 was $14.00 to $24.00 per unit of Rose Rock Common Units. Based on the ranges of low to high price targets for
each of SemGroup and Rose Rock, Barclays calculated a range of implied exchange ratios for SemGroup Common
Stock per each Rose Rock Common Unit. Barclays calculated the high end of the implied exchange ratio range by
dividing the high value of the Rose Rock implied equity values per unit reference range by the low value of the
SemGroup implied equity values per share reference range. Barclays calculated the low end of the implied exchange
ratio range by dividing the low value of the Rose Rock implied equity values per unit reference range by the high value of
the SemGroup implied equity values per share reference range. The result of this analysis, as compared to the Exchange
Ratio in the Merger of 0.8136x, was an implied exchange ratio range of 0.3590x to 1.0000x.
Premiums Paid Analysis
Barclays reviewed, for informational purposes, certain publicly available information related to selected precedent
transactions to calculate the amount of the premiums paid by the acquirers to the acquired company’s stockholders or
unitholders, as applicable. Barclays analyzed certain transactions announced for the period from May 27, 2009 to
May 27, 2016 that Barclays deemed comparable to the Merger. The following table sets forth the transactions analyzed
(and the date that each such transaction was announced):

For each of the precedent transactions analyzed, Barclays calculated premiums paid by the acquirer by comparing the
per share or per unit purchase price in each transaction to the historical stock price of the acquired company as of 1 day,
30 days and 60 days prior to the announcement date of the applicable precedent transactions. Barclays also compared
the implied Exchange Ratio premium paid in the Merger (based on the per share price of SemGroup and the per unit
price of Rose Rock as of May 27, 2016) by comparing the implied per unit price of Rose Rock, assuming the Exchange
Ratio of 0.8136x, to the historical price of Rose Rock’s units as of 1 day, 30 days and 60 days prior to the announcement
date of the Merger. In addition, Barclays compared the premiums paid in the precedent transactions to the premium in
the Merger. The table below sets forth the summary results of the analysis:

Pro Forma Accretion/Dilution Analysis
Using the Projections and estimates of the Expected Impacts resulting from the Merger provided by SemGroup
management, Barclays calculated the accretion/dilution of distributable cash flow per share of SemGroup Common
Stock as a result of the Merger. For the calendar years 2016 through 2020, Barclays compared the distributable cash flow
per share of SemGroup Common Stock after giving effect to the Merger, which is referred to as the “SemGroup Pro
Forma Scenario,” to the distributable cash flow per share of SemGroup Common Stock without giving effect to the
Merger, which is referred to as the “SemGroup Status Quo Scenario.” The analysis indicated that SemGroup Pro Forma
Scenarios would be accretive to the distributable cash flow per share of SemGroup Common Stock in each of the
calendar years 2016 through 2020. The following table summarizes the results of these calculations:

Similarly, using the Projections and estimates of the Expected Impacts resulting from the Merger provided by SemGroup
management, Barclays calculated the accretion/dilution of distributable cash flow per unit and distributions per unit of
Rose Rock Common Units as a result of the Merger. For the calendar years 2016 through 2020, Barclays compared the
distributable cash flow per unit and distributions per unit of Rose Rock Common Units after giving effect to the Merger,
which is referred to as the “Rose Rock Pro Forma Scenario,” to the distributable cash flow per unit and distributions per
unit of Rose Rock Common Units without giving effect to the Merger, which is referred to as the “Rose Rock Status Quo
Scenario.” The analysis indicated that Rose Rock Pro Forma Scenarios would be accretive to the distributable cash flow
per unit of Rose Rock Common Units in each of the calendar years 2017 through 2020 and accretive to distributions per
unit of Rose Rock Common Units in each of the calendar years 2018 through 2020. The following table summarizes the

Historical Share Price Analysis
Barclays reviewed, for informational purposes, the closing prices, average prices and/or the VWAPs of SemGroup
Common Stock and Rose Rock Common Units for various periods within the two year period from May 27, 2014 to
May 27, 2016. Barclays derived the historical exchange ratios between SemGroup Common Stock and Rose Rock
Common Units over those periods and compared those exchange ratios to the Exchange Ratio of 0.8136x payable by
SemGroup pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Exchange Ratio of 0.8136x implied, based on the May 27, 2016
closing price of Rose Rock Common Units, a nominal offer price of $24.00 payable per unit of Rose Rock Common Units.
The table below presents closing prices for SemGroup Common Stock and Rose Rock Common Units for selected
historical periods prior to and including May 27, 2016, the corresponding exchange ratio for these periods and the
implied premium that the Exchange Ratio of 0.8136x represents relative to these historical exchange ratios.

Barclays is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking activities, is
regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of
listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. The
SemGroup Board selected Barclays because of its familiarity with SemGroup and Rose Rock and its qualifications,
reputation and experience in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions
generally, as well as substantial experience in transactions in industries in which SemGroup and Rose Rock operate.
Barclays is acting as financial advisor to SemGroup in connection with the Merger. As compensation for its services in
connection with the Merger, $1,000,000 became payable by SemGroup to Barclays upon the delivery of Barclays’
opinion, which is referred to as the “Opinion Fee”. The Opinion Fee was not contingent upon the conclusion of Barclays’
opinion or the consummation of the Merger, and no further fees will be payable by SemGroup to Barclays upon the
consummation of the Merger. In addition, SemGroup has agreed to reimburse certain of Barclays’ expenses in
connection with the Merger and indemnify Barclays for certain liabilities that may arise out of Barclays’ engagement by
SemGroup and the rendering of Barclays’ opinion. Barclays has performed various investment banking and financial
services for SemGroup and Rose Rock in the past, and Barclays expects to perform such services in the future, and has
received, and expects to receive, customary fees for such services. Specifically, in the past two years, Barclays has
performed the following investment banking services for Rose Rock: (i) acted as joint bookrunner on Rose Rock’s $400
million high yield offering in June 2014, and (ii) acted as joint bookrunner on Rose Rock’s $350 million high yield offering
in May 2015. In addition, pursuant to the engagement letter Barclays entered into with SemGroup dated March 16, 2016 in
connection with the Merger, Barclays has the first opportunity to participate in any financing, refinancing, risk
management transactions, liability management and any other investment banking and financial advisory services
related to the Merger, as well as provide financial advisory services with respect to certain other transactions involving
SemGroup, and will receive customary fees in connection therewith. In addition, on June 22, 2016, SemGroup completed
a $233 million common stock offering. Barclays received approximately $5.5 million in aggregate fees and expense
reimbursements in connection with all of the foregoing services.
Barclays, its subsidiaries and its affiliates engage in a wide range of businesses from investment and commercial
banking, lending, asset management and other financial and non-financial services. In the ordinary course of its
business, Barclays and affiliates may actively trade and effect transactions in the equity, debt and/or other securities
(and any derivatives thereof) and financial instruments (including loans and other obligations) of SemGroup and Rose
Rock for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short
positions and investments in such securities and financial instruments.
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger Transactions
In considering the recommendations of the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and the Rose Rock Board, Rose Rock
Common Unitholders should be aware that all of the current executive officers and directors (and certain of the former
executive officers and directors who served since January 1, 2015) of the Rose Rock General Partner have interests in
the Merger Transactions that may differ from, or may be in addition to, the interests of Rose Rock Common Unitholders
generally. These interests may present such executive officers and directors with actual or potential conflicts of
interests, and these interests, to the extent material, are described below. The Rose Rock Conflicts Committee and the
Rose Rock Board were aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, prior to providing their
respective approvals and recommendations with respect to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby.
In considering the recommendations of the SemGroup Board, SemGroup Stockholders should be aware that all of the
current executive officers and certain of the directors of SemGroup have interests in the Merger Transactions that may
differ from, or may be in addition to, the interests of SemGroup Stockholders generally.

These interests may present such executive officers and directors with actual or potential conflicts of interests, and
these interests, to the extent material, are described below. The SemGroup Board was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, prior to providing its approval and recommendation with respect to the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Common Directors and Executive Officers
Certain of the executive officers (Carlin G. Conner, Robert N. Fitzgerald, Timothy R. O’Sullivan and Candice L.
Cheeseman) of the Rose Rock General Partner are also executive officers of SemGroup, and certain of the directors
(Carlin G. Conner and Ronald A. Ballschmiede) of the Rose Rock General Partner are also directors of SemGroup. The

Indemnification and Insurance
Subject to certain terms and conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, SemGroup has agreed to, for a period of six
years after the effective time of the Merger:
•
•
•
honor all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination of liability and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the Merger (including the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement) existing as of the date of the Merger Agreement in favor of certain past and present directors and officers of each
of the Rose Rock General Partner, Rose Rock and Rose Rock’s subsidiaries;
ensure that the governing documents of Rose Rock and the Rose Rock General Partner (or their successor entities) contain
provisions no less advantageous with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination of liability and
exculpation of such entities’ present and former directors, officers, employees and agents than are set forth in the governing
documents of such entities as of the date of the Merger Agreement; and
maintain officers’ and directors’ liability insurance covering certain past and present directors and officers of each of the
Rose Rock General Partner, Rose Rock and Rose Rock’s subsidiaries who are or were covered by the existing officers’ and
directors’ liability insurance applicable to each of the Rose Rock General Partner, Rose Rock and Rose Rock’s subsidiaries
on terms no less advantageous to such directors and officers than under such existing insurance.
These provisions are in addition to any other rights that certain of the directors and officers of each of the Rose Rock
General Partner, Rose Rock and Rose Rock’s subsidiaries may have under the organizational documents of each of the
Rose Rock General Partner, Rose Rock and Rose Rock’s subsidiaries or under applicable law.
Directors and Executive Officers of SemGroup after the Merger
The directors and executive officers of SemGroup prior to the completion of the Merger are expected to continue as
directors and executive officers of SemGroup after the completion of the Merger. The SemGroup Board has not yet made
a determination as to whether any of the independent directors on the Rose Rock Board will be appointed to the
SemGroup Board following the completion of the Merger.
86
Table of Contents
Unit and Share Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers
All of the executive officers and certain of the directors of SemGroup beneficially own Rose Rock Common Units, and
these executive officers and directors will receive the Merger Consideration upon completion of the Merger for each
Rose Rock Common Unit that he or she holds. Please see “— Security Ownership of Executive Officers and Directors of
SemGroup and the Rose Rock General Partner” below for further detail.
No Severance Payments
No executive officer or director of SemGroup or the Rose Rock General Partner is entitled to or will receive any
severance payments in connection with the Merger.
Treatment of Equity Awards
All of the executive officers and directors of the Rose Rock General Partner (and all of the executive officers and certain
of the directors of SemGroup in connection with services provided to Rose Rock) hold outstanding Rose Rock
Restricted Unit Awards that have not yet vested. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger,
each Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award that is not vested and does not vest in accordance with its terms (as set forth in
an applicable award agreement) as a result of the Merger and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective
time of the Merger, will cease to represent an award with respect to Rose Rock Common Units and will be converted into
a SemGroup Award. Each such SemGroup Award will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were
applicable to the corresponding Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger,
with the number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock subject to each such SemGroup Award to be equal to the
number of Rose Rock Common Units subject to each such Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), with any
corresponding accrued but unpaid UDRs with respect to any Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards to be assumed, remain
outstanding and continue to represent an obligation with respect to the applicable SemGroup Award.
Although there will be no acceleration of vesting of any of the outstanding and unvested Rose Rock Restricted Unit
Awards in connection with the Merger, as described further below, certain provisions applicable to the Rose Rock
Restricted Unit Awards that will carry over to the SemGroup Awards could, under certain circumstances, result in the
accelerated vesting of as-converted SemGroup Awards. In particular, each Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award agreement
pursuant to which the executive officers of the Rose Rock General Partner have been granted Rose Rock Restricted Unit
Awards provides that all unvested Rose Rock Restricted Units held by an executive officer will vest and become
nonforfeitable on certain termination events, including the executive officer’s termination of his or her employment for
“Good Reason” (as defined in the award agreement) within two years after a “Change of Control” (as defined in the Rose
Rock Equity Incentive Plan). These provisions will carry over and apply to the as-converted SemGroup Awards. In
particular, because the Merger will constitute a “Change of Control” for purposes of the Rose Rock Restricted Unit
Awards, the vesting acceleration described above would be triggered by an executive officer’s termination of his or her
employment for “Good Reason” within two years after the effective time of the Merger.

As of the date of this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus, the following executive officers and directors

(1) Because the outstanding and unvested Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards are being converted into SemGroup Awards and
there is no single trigger acceleration of vesting, no monetary value is being received by any of the directors and executive
officers of the Rose Rock General Partner pursuant to the conversion or in connection with the Merger at the effective time of
the Merger.
(2) Vesting dates for Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards have a 3-year cliff vesting period from the date of grant for all named
executive officers except for the Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards granted to Mr. Conner upon his hiring in 2014, which
have a 5-year pro-rata vesting on each of the anniversaries of the grant.
Quantification of Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger
The information set forth below is required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding compensation that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger that Rose Rock’s “named executive officers” could receive in connection with the Merger
(because Rose Rock does not have executive officers, and is instead managed by the executive officers of the Rose
Rock General Partner, the determination of the “named executive officers” of Rose Rock under applicable SEC
regulations is made by reference to the executive officers of the Rose Rock General Partner). Information being reported
with respect to such named executive officers describes the payments provided for under the outstanding Rose Rock
Restricted Unit Awards that will be converted into SemGroup Awards. The amounts in the table below were calculated
using the following assumptions: (i) the effective time of the Merger occurred on August 9, 2016, (ii) the price per share of
SemGroup Common Stock is $32.76, which was the average closing market price of shares of SemGroup Common
Stock over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the Merger (the “Average Closing
Price”), (iii) each named executive officer resigned for “Good Reason” (as defined in the applicable award agreement) as
of immediately following the effective time of the Merger, and (iv) certain other assumptions as specified in the notes to
the table below. Some of the assumptions used in the table below are based upon information not currently available
and, as a result, the actual amounts to be received by any of the named executive officers listed below will likely differ
from the amounts set forth below. Furthermore, because the as-converted SemGroup Awards will remain subject to the
same time-based vesting schedules and forfeiture provisions that applied under the Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, it is uncertain whether any of the named executive officers will
ultimately receive a payout from the as-converted SemGroup Awards. See “— Treatment of Equity Awards” above.

Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K also requires disclosure regarding compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to
the Merger that SemGroup’s named executive officers could receive in connection with the Merger. The same five
persons are the named executive officers of SemGroup and Rose Rock. However, the five persons listed in the table
below will not receive any compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as a result of their being
named executive officers of SemGroup.

(1) Each amount shown in this column was calculated as follows:
First, the number of Rose Rock Common Units subject to outstanding and unvested Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards
held by each named executive officer was multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, with the product (after being rounded down
to the nearest whole share) representing the number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock that will be subject to each
as-converted SemGroup Award held by each named executive officer immediately following the effective time of the
Merger;
Second, the product obtained above was multiplied by the Average Closing Price.
These amounts are double trigger in nature and will only become payable if and when the underlying as-converted
SemGroup Awards vest, which vesting would occur (if not already having occurred in accordance with any of the other
terms of the applicable award agreement) if and when the named executive officer’s employment is terminated for “Good
Reason” (as defined in the applicable award agreement) within two years following the effective time of the Merger.
(2) The amounts in this column reflect the amounts of cash credited prior to the effective time of the Merger for each named
executive officer under the respective outstanding and unvested Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards with respect to accrued
but unpaid UDRs provided under such Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards. These amounts are double trigger in nature and
will only become payable if and when the underlying as-converted SemGroup Awards vest, which vesting would occur (if not
already having occurred in accordance with any of the other terms of the applicable award agreement) if and when the
named executive officer’s employment is terminated for Good Reason (as defined in the applicable award agreement) within
two years following the effective time of the Merger.
(3) As disclosed in Rose Rock’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 5, 2016, Mr. Schwiering retired from his position as
Chief Operating Officer and director of the Rose Rock General Partner effective August 5, 2016 (also, as disclosed in
SemGroup’s Current on Form 8-K filed on August 5, 2016, Mr. Schwiering retired from his position as Vice President of
SemGroup effective August 5, 2016). In connection with Mr. Schwiering’s retirement from the Rose Rock General Partner, all
unvested Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards held by Mr. Schwiering and all associated UDRs fully vested on August 5,
2016, as approved by the Rose Rock Board. Because the determination of Rose Rock’s named executive officers is made
by reference to compensation for the prior fiscal year, Mr. Schwiering is still a named executive officer despite his having
retired from the Rose Rock General Partner.

In connection with the Merger, SemGroup and Rose Rock each intend to make all required filings under the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, as well as any required filings or applications with the NYSE. SemGroup and Rose Rock are
unaware of any other requirement for the filing of information with, or the obtaining of the approval of, governmental
authorities in any jurisdiction that is applicable to the Merger.
Because the Merger is not reportable under the HSR Act, no filings with respect to the Merger were required with the FTC
or the DOJ.

SemGroup expects to obtain approval to list its SemGroup Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
Agreement on the NYSE, which approval is a condition to the Closing.
Accounting Treatment
The Merger will be accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification 810, Consolidation — Overall — Changes in a Parent’s Ownership Interest in a Subsidiary. As SemGroup
controls Rose Rock and will continue to control Rose Rock after the Merger, the changes in SemGroup’s ownership
interest in Rose Rock will be accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss will be recognized in
SemGroup’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as a result of the Merger.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT
The following is a summary of the material terms of the Merger Agreement. This summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this joint consent statement/proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex A and is incorporated into this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus by
reference. You should read the Merger Agreement because it, and not this joint consent statement/proxy
statement/prospectus, is the legal document that governs the terms of the Merger.
Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement and the Summary of the Merger Agreement: Representations,
Warranties, and Covenants in the Merger Agreement Are Not Intended to Function or Be Relied on as Public
Disclosures.
The Merger Agreement and the summary of its terms in this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus have
been included to provide information about the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The representations,
warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made by the parties thereto only for the purposes of
the Merger Agreement and were qualified and subject to certain limitations and exceptions agreed to by the parties
thereto in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In particular, in your review of the
representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear
in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated for the purpose of allocating contractual risk among the
parties to the Merger Agreement rather than to establish matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also
be subject to a contractual standard of materiality or material adverse effect different from those generally applicable to
unitholders and stockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases may be qualified by
disclosures made by one party to the other, which are not necessarily reflected in the Merger Agreement. Moreover,
information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as
of the date of this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus, may have changed since the date of the Merger
Agreement, and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been
included in or incorporated by reference into this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus.
For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants, including any descriptions of those
provisions, should not be read alone. Instead, such provisions or descriptions should be read only in conjunction with
the other information provided elsewhere in this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated by
reference into this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus.
SemGroup and Rose Rock will provide additional disclosure in their public reports to the extent they become aware of
the existence of any material facts that are required to be disclosed under federal securities law and that might otherwise
contradict the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and will update such disclosure as
required by the federal securities laws.
Structure of the Merger
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Rose Rock, with Rose Rock being the surviving entity in the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
SemGroup.
When the Merger Becomes Effective
The parties to the Merger Agreement will cause a certificate of merger to be executed and filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State on the next business day after the day on which the last condition to completing the Merger is
satisfied or waived, as soon as practicable thereafter or at such other time as the parties may agree. The Merger will
become effective at the time and on the date on which the certificate of merger is filed or at such later time and date on
which the parties agree and specify in the certificate of merger. This time is referred to as the “effective time of the
Merger.”
Table of Contents
Effect of the Merger
At the effective time of the Merger:
92
•
•
•
•
•
Each Rose Rock Public Unit will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and, upon such conversion,
will be canceled and will cease to exist.
Each Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award will cease to represent an award with respect to Rose Rock Common Units and will
be converted into a SemGroup Award as described in “Treatment of Rose Rock Equity Awards” below.
Each Rose Rock Common Unit owned by Rose Rock will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist and no
consideration will be paid in connection with such cancellation.
Each Rose Rock Common Unit held by SemGroup or any of SemGroup’s direct or indirect subsidiaries (excluding Rose
Rock and the Rose Rock General Partner) will remain outstanding following the Merger.
The limited liability company interests in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger will be converted into an aggregate number of Rose Rock Common Units equal to the number of Rose Rock Public
Units that are converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger.
If, before the effective time of the Merger, the issued and outstanding Rose Rock Common Units or shares of SemGroup
Common Stock are changed into a different number of units or shares, as applicable, as a result of any unit or share
split, distribution, combination, reorganization or other similar transaction, an appropriate adjustment will be made to the
Exchange Ratio.
For a description of the Rose Rock Common Units and the SemGroup Common Stock and a description of the
comparative rights of Rose Rock Common Unitholders and SemGroup Stockholders, please read “Comparison of
Rights of SemGroup Stockholders and Rose Rock Common Unitholders” and “Description of SemGroup Common
Stock.”
Treatment of Rose Rock Equity Awards
At the effective time of the Merger, each Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award that is not vested and does not vest in
accordance with its terms (as set forth in an applicable award agreement) as a result of the Merger and that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, will cease to represent an award with respect to
Rose Rock Common Units and will be converted into a SemGroup Award. Each such SemGroup Award will be subject to
the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to the corresponding Rose Rock Restricted Unit Award
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, with the number of shares of SemGroup Common Stock subject to
each such SemGroup Award to be equal to the number of Rose Rock Common Units subject to each such Rose Rock
Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded
down to the nearest whole share), with any corresponding accrued but unpaid UDRs with respect to any Rose Rock
Restricted Unit Awards to be assumed, remain outstanding and continue to represent an obligation with respect to the
applicable SemGroup Award.
Exchange of Units; Fractional Units
Exchange Agent
SemGroup has appointed Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (“Computershare”) to act as exchange agent for the
payment of the Merger Consideration, cash payments in lieu of fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock, and, with
respect to Rose Rock Public Units not yet exchanged for SemGroup Common Stock, certain applicable dividends or
distributions. Promptly after the effective time of the Merger, SemGroup will (i) reserve with the exchange agent the
shares of SemGroup Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and (ii) authorize the
Table of Contents
93
exchange agent to exchange SemGroup Common Stock as described above under “— Effect of the Merger.” After
Closing, SemGroup will deposit with the exchange agent any additional funds as and when necessary to pay (i) with
respect to Rose Rock Public Units not yet exchanged for SemGroup Common Stock, certain applicable dividends or
distributions and (ii) any other amounts required to be paid under the Merger Agreement. SemGroup will pay all costs
and fees of the exchange agent and all expenses associated with the exchange process.
After the effective time of the Merger, there will be no further transfers on the records of Rose Rock or its transfer agent
of Rose Rock Public Units. If Rose Rock Public Units are presented to Rose Rock or its transfer agent for transfer after
the effective time of the Merger, they will be canceled against delivery of the SemGroup Common Stock and any
proceeds resulting from the sale of fractional Rose Rock Public Units and unpaid distributions.
Exchange of Units; Fractional Units
If you are a Rose Rock Public Unitholder as of the effective time of the Merger, the exchange agent will mail to you a
transmittal letter and instructions explaining how to surrender your Rose Rock Common Units to the exchange agent
after the effective time of the Merger.
Rose Rock Public Unitholders who deliver a properly completed and signed transmittal letter and any other documents
required by the instructions to the transmittal letter of the exchange agent, together with their Rose Rock Common Unit
certificates (if any), will be entitled to receive the number of whole shares of SemGroup Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled in accordance with the Merger Agreement and as described above under “— Effect of the Merger.” In
addition, each registered holder of Rose Rock Public Units converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fractional share of SemGroup Common Stock (after taking into account all Rose Rock Public
Units held by a holder immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger) shall be entitled to receive, from
Computershare, a cash payment, without interest, in lieu of any fractional shares representing a holder’s proportionate
interest, in the proceeds from the sale by Computershare in one or more transactions of a number of shares of
SemGroup Common Stock, where such number of shares is equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of shares of
SemGroup Common Stock reserved with Computershare by SemGroup to be issued in the Merger minus (ii) the
aggregate number of whole shares of SemGroup Common Stock that Rose Rock Public Unitholders are entitled to
receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a material adverse
effect), provided that any change, effect, event or occurrence referred to in clauses (a), (b), (c), and (e) shall be taken into
account for purposes of determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred to the extent, and only to the extent, that

be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a material adverse
effect); provided that any change, effect, event or occurrence referred to in clauses (a), (b), (c), and (e) shall be taken into

on terms no less advantageous to such directors and officers than under such existing insurance.
These provisions are in addition to any other rights that certain of the directors and officers of each of the Rose Rock
General Partner, Rose Rock and Rose Rock’s subsidiaries may have under the organizational documents of each of the
Rose Rock General Partner, Rose Rock and Rose Rock’s subsidiaries or under applicable law.
SemGroup Board Recommendation and SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change
On May 30, 2016, the SemGroup Board unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger and the Stock Issuance, are advisable and fair to, and in
the best interests of, SemGroup and the SemGroup Stockholders, authorized and approved the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger and the Stock Issuance, and directed
that the approval of the Stock Issuance be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the SemGroup Stockholders and
recommended that the SemGroup Stockholders vote in favor of the Stock Issuance.

Subject to the exceptions described below, the Merger Agreement provides that SemGroup will not, through the
SemGroup Board:
•
•
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Rose Rock, the
SemGroup Board Recommendation; or
fail to include the SemGroup Board Recommendation in this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus.
SemGroup taking any of the actions described above is referred to as a “SemGroup Adverse Recommendation
Change.”
Subject to the conditions described below, the SemGroup Board may, at any time prior to the SemGroup Stockholders
approving the Stock Issuance Proposal, effect a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change if the SemGroup Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the SemGroup’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the SemGroup
Stockholders under applicable law.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the SemGroup Board (i) is not permitted to make a SemGroup Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a SemGroup Acquisition Proposal that does not constitute a SemGroup
Designated Proposal (each as defined below) and (ii) may not effect a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change
unless:
•
•
SemGroup has provided prior written notice to Rose Rock of its intention to make a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation
Change, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for effecting the SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change
(including, in the case of a SemGroup Designated Proposal, a description of the material terms of such SemGroup
Designated Proposal and a copy of any definitive agreement reflecting such SemGroup Designated Proposal) at least five
days in advance of its making a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change, unless at the time such notice is required to
be given there are fewer than five days remaining prior to the SemGroup Stockholder Meeting, in which case SemGroup is
required to provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the “SemGroup Notice
Period”); and
during the SemGroup Notice Period the SemGroup Board has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate,
with Rose Rock (to the extent Rose Rock desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement so that the failure to effect such SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change would not be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the SemGroup Board’s fiduciary duties to SemGroup Stockholders under applicable law
(provided that in the event of any material amendment to the terms of a SemGroup Designated Proposal, SemGroup is
required to provide a new notice as described above and a new SemGroup Notice Period will begin upon Rose Rock’s
receipt of such notice, except that such new SemGroup Notice Period in connection with any material amendment will be for
three days from the time Rose Rock receives such notice (as opposed to five days)).
For purposes of the Merger Agreement:
•
the term “SemGroup Acquisition Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or “group” (as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), other than the Rose Rock Parties
or any subsidiaries of Rose Rock, relating to any direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions and whether by merger, consolidation, share exchange, share issuance, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation or otherwise):
•
of assets of SemGroup and its partially or wholly owned subsidiaries, other than NGL Energy Holdings (including
securities of subsidiaries), equal to 25% or more of the assets of SemGroup and its partially or wholly owned
subsidiaries, other than NGL Energy Holdings, taken as a whole;
Table of Contents

•
of assets of SemGroup and its partially or wholly owned subsidiaries, other than NGL Energy Holdings (including
securities of subsidiaries), to which 25% or more of the revenues or earnings of SemGroup and its partially or wholly
owned subsidiaries, excluding NGL Energy Holdings (for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of
SemGroup’s most recently completed fiscal quarter), taken as a whole, are attributable; or
•
of “beneficial ownership” (within the meaning of Section 13 under the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of any outstanding
class of equity securities of SemGroup; and
•
the term “SemGroup Designated Proposal” means a bona fide written SemGroup Acquisition Proposal obtained after the
date of the Merger Agreement, which the SemGroup Board determines in good faith to be more favorable to the SemGroup
Stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, taking into account
all financial, legal, financing, regulatory and other aspects of such offer and any changes to the terms of the Merger
Agreement that as of the time of determination had been committed to by Rose Rock and the Rose Rock General Partner in
writing (provided that for purposes of the definition of “SemGroup Designated Proposal,” references in the term “SemGroup
Acquisition Proposal” to “25%” are deemed to be references to “50%”).
Termination
The parties to the Merger Agreement can mutually agree to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time without
completing the Merger. In addition, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement on its own without completing the
Merger in a number of situations, including if:
•
•
•
•
the Merger has not been consummated on or before December 31, 2016, provided that right to terminate the Merger
Agreement shall not be available to the party seeking to terminate if such party failed to perform or observe in any material
respect its obligations under the Merger Agreement in any manner that shall have been the principal cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date;
a governmental entity has issued a final and non-appealable order, decree, or ruling, or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, so long as the party seeking termination (i) has complied with its
obligations under the Merger Agreement regarding certain filings, the SemGroup Stockholder Meeting, the SemGroup Board
Recommendation, (ii) has taken commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to occur, and other further assurances
and (iii) has cooperated with government entities;
the other party breaches any of its representations, warranties, or agreements in the Merger Agreement, or if any of the other
party’s representations or warranties becomes untrue and such breach (i) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, prior to
the Termination Date, and (ii) results in a condition to the Merger not being satisfied, provided that the party seeking
termination is not in breach of its representations and warranties under the Merger Agreement so as to give rise to a failure of
the condition to the other party’s obligation to close under the Merger Agreement;
the SemGroup Stockholder Approval has not been obtained upon the conclusion of the SemGroup Special Meeting and any
adjournment or postponement thereof, provided that SemGroup is not permitted to terminate in such circumstance if the
failure to obtain SemGroup Stockholder Approval is proximately caused by a withdrawal, modification, or qualification of the
SemGroup Board Recommendation in a manner that is not permitted under the Merger Agreement; or
•
a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred in connection with a SemGroup Designated Proposal;
provided, that a termination by SemGroup is subject to certain conditions being met.
Rose Rock may terminate the Merger Agreement, on its own without completing the Merger, if a SemGroup Adverse
Recommendation Change has occurred other than in connection with a SemGroup Designated Proposal within five
Business days after Rose Rock and the Rose Rock Conflicts Committee have been notified, or otherwise became aware,
of the SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change.

Expense Reimbursement and Termination Fee
The Merger Agreement provides that SemGroup is required to reimburse the expenses of Rose Rock in an aggregate
amount not to exceed $3.8 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Rose Rock or SemGroup, pursuant to a
failure to obtain SemGroup Stockholder Approval at the SemGroup Special Meeting, and not following the occurrence of
a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change made for any reason.
The Merger Agreement provides that SemGroup is required to pay a termination fee of $15.5 million to Rose Rock if the
Merger Agreement is terminated by:
•
•
•
•
Rose Rock following a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change made in connection with a SemGroup Designated
Proposal;
Rose Rock following a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change for any reason;
Rose Rock or SemGroup, pursuant to a failure to obtain SemGroup Stockholder Approval at the SemGroup Special Meeting
following the occurrence of a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change made in connection with a SemGroup
Designated Proposal, or any adjournment or postponement thereof where prior to such termination a SemGroup Adverse
Recommendation Change has occurred in connection with a SemGroup Designated Proposal; or
SemGroup following a SemGroup Adverse Recommendation Change made in connection with a SemGroup Designated
Proposal.
Under no circumstance will SemGroup be required to both reimburse Rose Rock’s expenses and pay Rose Rock the
termination fee.
Amendment and Waiver
Subject to compliance with applicable law, prior to the Closing, any provision of the Merger Agreement may be (a) waived
in writing by the party benefited by the provision or (b) amended or modified at any time by an agreement in writing by
the parties to the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that, in addition to any other approvals required by the
constituent documents of Rose Rock or the Rose Rock General Partner or under the Merger Agreement, the foregoing
waivers, amendments, or modifications in clauses (a) and (b), or elections under certain circumstances under which a
party elects to terminate or enforce the Merger Agreement, as the case may be, are approved by, in the case of waivers,
amendments, or modifications by Rose Rock, the Rose Rock General Partner, the Rose Rock Board, or the Rose Rock
Conflicts Committee.

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF SEMGROUP STOCKHOLDERS AND ROSE ROCK COMMON UNITHOLDERS
SemGroup is a Delaware corporation, while Rose Rock is a Delaware limited partnership. Ownership interests in a limited
partnership are fundamentally different from ownership interests in a corporation. The rights of SemGroup Stockholders
are governed by the SemGroup Organizational Documents and the DGCL. The rights of Rose Rock Common
Unitholders are governed by the Rose Rock LP Agreement and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act
(the “Delaware Partnership Act”). If the Merger is completed, the rights of Rose Rock Common Unitholders as SemGroup
Stockholders following the conversion of the Rose Rock Unaffiliated Unitholders’ Rose Rock Common Units to
SemGroup Common Stock will be governed by the SemGroup Organizational Documents and the DGCL.
There are many differences between the rights of Rose Rock Common Unitholders and SemGroup Stockholders. Some
of these, such as distribution/dividend rights and voting rights, are significant. The following description summarizes the
material differences that may affect the rights of SemGroup Stockholders and Rose Rock Common Unitholders but does
not purport to be a complete statement of all of those differences, or a complete description of the specific provisions
referred to in this summary. The identification of specific differences is not intended to indicate that other equally
significant or more significant differences do not exist. Rose Rock Common Unitholders should carefully read the
SemGroup Organizational Documents and the Rose Rock LP Agreement in their entirety. Copies of the documents
referred to in this summary may be obtained as described under “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 140 of
this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
DGCL, the Delaware Partnership Act, the SemGroup Organizational Documents, and the Rose Rock LP Agreement.
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the SemGroup
Organizational Documents and the Rose Rock LP Agreement, as applicable.
Purpose and Term of Existence
SemGroup
SemGroup’s stated purpose is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the DGCL.
SemGroup is to have perpetual existence.
Rose Rock
Rose Rock’s stated purposes under the Rose Rock LP
Agreement are to engage directly or indirectly in any lawful
business activity that is approved by the Rose Rock General
Partner and to exercise all rights and powers conferred upon
Rose Rock pursuant to any agreements relating to such
business activity and to do anything necessary or
appropriate to the foregoing, including the making of capital
contributions or loans to Rose Rock’s subsidiaries.
However, the Rose Rock General Partner may not cause
Rose Rock to engage directly or indirectly in any business
activity that would cause Rose Rock to be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation or otherwise taxable as
an entity for federal income tax purposes. The Rose Rock
General Partner has no duty or obligation to propose or
approve, and may, in its sole discretion, decline to propose
or approve, the conduct by Rose Rock of any business.
Rose Rock’s partnership term will continue until Rose Rock
is dissolved pursuant to the terms of the Rose Rock LP
Agreement. Rose Rock’s existence as a separate legal
entity will continue until cancellation of its certificate of
limited partnership pursuant to the Delaware Partnership
Act.

As of August 9, the outstanding capitalization of Rose Rock
consisted of: 37,013,067 Rose Rock Common Units
(including 170,588 Rose Rock Common Units subject to
Rose Rock Restricted Unit Awards), 20,704,418 of which
were indirectly owned by SemGroup through SemGroup’s
ownership of 100% of the membership interests of Rose
Rock Holdings; the General Partner Interest, all of which was
indirectly owned by SemGroup through SemGroup’s indirect
ownership of 100% of the membership interests of the Rose
Rock General Partner; and the Incentive Distribution Rights,
all of which were indirectly owned by SemGroup through
SemGroup’s indirect ownership of 100% of the membership
interests of the Rose Rock General Partner. The Rose Rock
General Partner currently holds the Incentive Distribution
Rights, but may transfer these rights separately from the
General Partner Interest, subject to restrictions in the Rose
Rock LP Agreement.
Rose Rock may issue an unlimited number of additional
Partnership Interests and options, rights, tracking and
phantom interests, and other economic interests relating to
the Partnership Interests, including in additional classes or
series, with such designations, preferences, rights, powers,
and duties, which may be senior or in addition to those of the
Rose Rock Common Units or other existing classes of units,
as the Rose Rock General Partner may determine, all
without the approval of any Unitholders. The Rose Rock LP
Agreement defines “Partnership Interests” as meaning any
class or series of equity interest in Rose Rock, including any
General Partner Interest and Limited Partner Interests, but
excluding options, rights, warrants, appreciation rights,
tracking and phantom interests, and other economic interests
relating to the Partnership Interests. The Rose Rock LP
Agreement defines “Unitholders” as the holders of Units and
defines “Units” as Partnership Interests, which include Rose
Rock Common Units, Subordinated Units, and Class A Units
but do not include Notional General Partner Units (or the
General Partner Interest represented thereby) or Incentive
Distribution Rights. As of the date of this joint consent
statement/proxy statement/prospectus, the Rose Rock
Common Units represented all of the issued and outstanding
Units of Rose Rock and the Rose Rock Common
Unitholders represented all of the Unitholders of record of
Rose Rock.
were outstanding as of the date of this joint consent
statement/proxy statement/prospectus. The Class B Common
Stock is intended to be a security that is not a “margin security” as
defined in Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System of the United States, and as such, shall not be
listed on any national securities exchange or national market
system. Each share of Class B Common Stock is exchangeable
into one fully paid and nonassessable share of SemGroup
Common Stock at the option of the holder of such share of Class
B Common Stock.
On each matter on which the holders of capital stock are entitled
to vote, each holder of shares of SemGroup Common Stock is
entitled to one vote per share of SemGroup Common Stock held
and each holder of shares of Class B Common Stock is entitled to
one vote per share of Class B Common Stock held. Except as
otherwise required by law or by the SemGroup Amended and
Restated Certificate, holders of each class of capital stock vote
together as a single class.

SemGroup Stockholders are entitled to receive, to the extent
permitted by law, and to share equally and ratably, share for share

be declared by the SemGroup Board, out of funds legally
available for their payment.
Distributions of Available Cash. Except in the event of the
dissolution and liquidation of Rose Rock, within 45 days
after the end of each quarter, Rose Rock will distribute all of
its Available Cash to the Unitholders of record as of the
applicable record date. “Available Cash” is defined in the
Rose Rock LP Agreement and generally means, for any
quarter ending prior to liquidation:
•       the sum of (i) all cash and cash equivalents
(collectively, for purposes of this is paragraph, “Cash”) on
hand at the end of such quarter and (ii) if the Rose Rock
General Partner so determines, all or any portion of Cash on
hand on the date of determination of Available Cash for such
quarter resulting from Working Capital Borrowings made
after the end of the quarter for which the determination is
being made (“Working Capital Borrowings” is defined in the
Rose Rock LP Agreement as borrowings used solely for
working capital purposes or to pay distributions made
pursuant to a credit facility, commercial paper facility, or
other arrangement; provided that when incurred the borrower
intends to repay such borrowings within 12 months from
sources other than additional Working Capital Borrowings);
less
•       the amount of any cash reserves established by the
Rose Rock General Partner for any of the following
purposes: (i) to provide for the proper conduct of the
business (including reserves for future capital expenditures
and for anticipated future credit needs), (ii) to comply with
applicable law or any debt instrument or other agreement or
obligation, or (iii) subject to certain minimum distribution
limitations, to provide funds for distributions to the
Unitholders and the Rose Rock General Partner in respect of
any one or more of the next four quarters.
In determining Available Cash for a particular quarter, the
Rose Rock General Partner has discretion to take into
account certain events and occurrences that take place after
the end of such quarter.
Operating Surplus and Capital Surplus. Cash distributions
are characterized as distributions from either Operating
Surplus or Capital Surplus. The
Table of Contents
106
SemGroup
Rose Rock
Rose Rock LP Agreement establishes different “waterfalls”
for distributions of Available Cash from Operating Surplus
and for distributions of Available Cash from Capital Surplus.
“Operating Surplus” distributions are made prior to any
“Capital Surplus” distributions (i.e., Capital Surplus
distributions are generally comprised of any residual
Available Cash remaining after making all required
distributions of Operating Surplus).
“Operating Surplus” is defined in the Rose Rock LP
Agreement and generally means, with respect to any period
ending prior to liquidation, on a cumulative basis and without
duplication:
•       $25 million; plus
•       cash receipts for the period beginning on the closing
date of Rose Rock’s initial public offering and ending on the
last day of such period, but excluding certain cash receipts
from (i) borrowings that are not Working Capital Borrowings,
(ii) sales of Partnership Interests of Rose Rock or its
subsidiaries, (iii) sales or other dispositions of assets outside
the ordinary course of business and not as part of normal
retirements or replacements, and (iv) capital contributions
received, provided that cash receipts from the termination of
any hedging contract prior to its specified settlement or
termination date shall be included in Operating Surplus in
equal quarterly installments over the remaining scheduled
life of such hedging contract; plus
•       cash receipts from Working Capital Borrowings made
after the end of such period but on or before the date of
determination of Operating Surplus for such period; plus
•       cash distributions paid on certain equity issued to
finance all or a portion of the construction, acquisition or
development of a Capital Improvement or of a Maintenance
Capital Project (including equity issued to fund construction
period interest payments on debt incurred to finance the
construction, acquisition or improvement of a Capital
Improvement or of a Maintenance Capital Project); less
•       Operating Expenditures for the period beginning on the
closing date of Rose Rock’s initial public offering and ending
on the last day of such period; less

•       the amount of cash reserves established by the Rose
Rock General Partner to provide funds for future Operating
Expenditures; less
•       all Working Capital Borrowings not repaid within 12
months of being incurred; less
•       any cash loss realized on the disposition of an
Investment Capital Expenditure.
The Rose Rock General Partner has discretion to take into
account certain events and occurrences that take place after
the period for which Operating Surplus is being determined
in determining Operating Surplus.
Distributions of Available Cash From Operating Surplus.
•       Rose Rock distributes Available Cash from Operating
Surplus with respect to any fiscal quarter in the following
manner (subject to the proration and reduction described
further below):
Table of Contents
SemGroup
108
•       First, 98% to all Unitholders, pro rata, and 2% to the
Rose Rock General Partner, until each such Unitholder has
received an aggregate amount equal to $0.3625 per Unit
(unless adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Rose Rock LP
Agreement) for such quarter (such aggregate amount, the
“Minimum Quarterly Distribution”, which term is defined more
specifically in the Rose Rock LP Agreement);
•       Second, 98% to all Unitholders, pro rata, and 2% to the
Rose Rock General Partner, until each such Unitholder has
received an aggregate amount (taking into account the
Minimum Quarterly Distribution amount) equal to $0.416875
per Unit (unless adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Rose
Rock LP Agreement) for such quarter (such aggregate
amount, the “First Target Distribution”, which term is defined
more specifically in the Rose Rock LP Agreement);
•       Third, 85% to all Unitholders, pro rata, and 15% to the
Rose Rock General Partner, until each such Unitholder has
received an aggregate amount (taking into account the
Minimum Quarterly Distribution amount and the First Target
Distribution amount) equal to $0.453125 per Unit (unless
adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Rose Rock LP
Agreement) for such
Rose Rock
quarter (such aggregate amount, the “Second Target
Distribution”, which term is defined more specifically in the
Rose Rock LP Agreement);
•       Fourth, 75% to all Unitholders, pro rata, and 25% to the
Rose Rock General Partner, until each such Unitholder has
received an aggregate amount (taking into account the
Minimum Quarterly Distribution Amount, the First Target
Distribution Amount, and the Second Target Distribution
amount) equal to $0.54375 per Unit (unless adjusted
pursuant to the terms of the Rose Rock LP Agreement) for
such quarter (such aggregate amount, the “Third Target
Distribution”, which term is defined more specifically in the
Rose Rock LP Agreement);
•       Thereafter, 50% to all Unitholders, pro rata, and 50% to
the Rose Rock General Partner.
The percentage interests set forth above for the Rose Rock
General Partner assume that the Rose Rock General Partner
maintains its 2% General Partner Interest and holds all of the
Incentive Distribution Rights and that Rose Rock does not
issue additional classes of Partnership Interests, subject to
the proration of distributions described below. “Incentive
Distribution Rights” are defined in the Rose Rock LP
Agreement and represent the right to receive an increasing
percentage of quarterly distributions of Available Cash from
Operating Surplus after certain minimum quarterly
distribution targets have been attained. The Rose Rock
General Partner may transfer the Incentive Distribution
Rights separately from the General Partner Interest, subject
to restrictions in the Rose Rock LP Agreement.
The Minimum Quarterly Distribution, the First Target
Distribution, the Second Target Distribution and the Third
Target Distribution (collectively, the “Target Distributions”)
are subject to certain adjustments as generally described
below in “— Adjustments to the Target Distributions.”
Distributions of Available Cash From Capital Surplus. Rose
Rock distributes Available Cash from Capital Surplus, if any,
with respect to any fiscal quarter in the following manner:
•       First, 98% to all Unitholders, pro rata, and 2% to the
Rose Rock General Partner, until a hypothetical holder of a
Rose Rock Common
Table of Contents
109
SemGroup
Rose Rock
Unit acquired on the closing date of Rose Rock’s initial
public offering has received, with respect to such Rose Rock
Common Unit, distributions of Available Cash that are
deemed to be Capital Surplus in an aggregate amount equal
to the price at which such Rose Rock Common Unit was
acquired on the closing date of Rose Rock’s initial public
offering (such price, the “Initial Unit Price”, which term is
defined more specifically in the Rose Rock LP Agreement);
•       Second, 98% to the Rose Rock Common Unitholders,
pro rata, and 2% to the Rose Rock General Partner, until
each Rose Rock Common Unitholder has received a total
amount equal to the Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage
(generally, certain unpaid arrearages in respect of Minimum
Quarterly Distributions, as described more particularly in the
Rose Rock LP Agreement);
•       Thereafter, in such a manner as if such distributions of
Available Cash were being made from Operating Surplus.
The preceding discussion is based on the assumption that
the Rose Rock General Partner maintains its 2% General
Partner Interest and holds all of the Incentive Distribution
Table of Contents
SemGroup
110
Rights and that Rose Rock does not issue additional classes
of Partnership Interests.
Adjustments to the Target Distributions. The Rose Rock LP
Agreement treats a distribution of Available Cash from
Capital Surplus as the repayment of the Initial Unit Price (i.e.,
as a return of capital). The Initial Unit Price less any
distributions of Capital Surplus per Rose Rock Common Unit
is referred to in the Rose Rock LP Agreement as the
“Unrecovered Initial Unit Price” (which term is defined more
specifically in the Rose Rock LP Agreement). Each time a
distribution of Available Cash from Capital Surplus is made,
the Target Distributions will be adjusted proportionately
downward to equal the product obtained by multiplying the
otherwise applicable Target Distribution by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Unrecovered Initial Unit Price of
the Rose Rock Common Units immediately after giving effect
to such distribution, and the denominator of which is the
Unrecovered Initial Unit Price of the Rose Rock Common
Units immediately prior to giving effect to such distribution.
Because
Rose Rock
distributions of Capital Surplus will reduce the Target
Distributions, after any of these distributions are made it may
be easier for the Rose Rock General Partner to receive
distributions with respect to its Incentive Distribution Rights.
However, any distribution of Capital Surplus before the
Unrecovered Initial Unit Price is reduced to zero does not
constitute payment of the Target Distributions (and does not
reduce any arrearages). If and when the Target Distributions
are reduced to zero, the distribution of Available Cash that is
deemed to be Operating Surplus with respect to any quarter
will be paid 50% to all Unitholders, pro rata, and 50% to the
Rose Rock General Partner. The preceding discussion
assumes that the Rose Rock General Partner maintains its
2% General Partner Interest and holds all of the Incentive
Distribution Rights and that Rose Rock does not issue
additional classes of Partnership Interests.
The Target Distributions will be adjusted upon the election of
the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights (or a majority
of such holders if there is more than one holder) in the event
that Rose Rock has made distributions of Available Cash
from Operating Surplus in excess of the amount of the Third
Target Distribution for four quarters in a row and the amount
of each such distribution did not exceed the Adjusted
Operating Surplus for the applicable quarter. Upon such
election, (i) the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights will
be entitled to receive shares of Rose Rock Common Units
and (ii) the Minimum Quarterly Distribution will be reset to an
amount equal to the average cash distribution amount per
Rose Rock Common Unit for each of the two quarters
immediately prior to such election, with each of the First
Target Distribution, Second Target Distribution, and Third
Target Distribution being reset in relation to the reset of the
Minimum Quarterly Distribution (i.e., each will reset to a
specified percentage of the reset Minimum Quarterly
Distribution amount).
In addition to adjusting the Target Distributions to reflect a
distribution of Capital Surplus, if Rose Rock combines the
Units into fewer such units or subdivides the Units into a
greater number of such units, Rose Rock will proportionately
adjust:
•       the Target Distributions;
Table of Contents
111
SemGroup
•       the Unrecovered Initial Unit Price; and
Rose Rock
•       other amounts calculated on a per unit basis.
For example, if a two-for-one split of the Rose Rock
Common Units should occur, the Target Distributions and
the Unrecovered Initial Unit Price would each be reduced to
50% of its level immediately prior to the two-for-one split. In
addition, if legislation is enacted or if the official
interpretation of existing legislation is modified by a
governmental authority so that Rose Rock becomes subject
to federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or withholding
taxes, the Rose Rock General Partner may, in its sole
discretion, reduce the Target Distributions for each quarter to
take account of the income or withholding taxes that are
payable by reason of any such new legislation or
interpretation by multiplying the amount of Target
Distributions by a fraction, the numerator of which is
Available Cash for that quarter and the denominator of which
is the sum of Available Cash for that quarter plus the Rose
Rock General Partner’s estimate of Rose Rock’s aggregate
liability for that quarter for such income or withholding taxes
payable by reason of such legislation or modified
interpretation. To the extent that the actual tax liability differs
from the estimated tax liability for any quarter, the difference
will be accounted for in subsequent quarters.
Distributions of Cash Upon Liquidation. If Rose Rock
dissolves in accordance with the Rose Rock LP Agreement,
Rose Rock will sell or otherwise dispose of its assets in a
process called liquidation. Rose Rock will first apply the
proceeds of liquidation to the satisfaction (whether by
payment or the making of reasonable provision for the
payment) of liabilities to its creditors. Rose Rock will
distribute any remaining proceeds to the Unitholders and the
Rose Rock General Partner in accordance with their positive
capital account balances, as adjusted to reflect certain items,
including any gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition
of Rose Rock’s assets in liquidation.
The manner of the adjustment is set forth in the Rose Rock
LP Agreement. Rose Rock will generally (subject to certain
potential adjustments required to comply with U.S. federal
income tax law) allocate certain items of gain with respect to
the liquidation (which are described as “Net Termination
Gain” in
Table of Contents

the Rose Rock LP Agreement) in the following manner (as
more specifically described in the Rose Rock LP
Agreement):
•       First, to the Rose Rock General Partner until the
allocated net gain and income equals the net loss allocated
to the Rose Rock General Partner;
•       Second, 98% to the Rose Rock Common Unitholders,
pro rata, and 2% to the Rose Rock General Partner, until the
capital account in respect of each Rose Rock Common Unit
is equal to the sum of:
•       the Unrecovered Initial Unit Price for that Rose Rock
Common Unit; plus
•       the amount of the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for the
quarter during which liquidation occurs, reduced by any
distribution from Operating Surplus with respect to such
Rose Rock Common Unit for such quarter counted in
determining whether an amount equal to the Minimum
Quarterly Distribution has been distributed during such
quarter; plus
•       any unpaid arrearages in payment of the Minimum
Quarterly Distribution (the cumulative amount set forth in this
bullet point and the two preceding bullet points, the “Second
Tier Allocation Amount”);
•       Third, pro rata to the Unitholders and the General
Partner until the capital account in respect of each Rose

•       the Second Tier Allocation Amount plus the sum of the

Minimum Quarterly Distribution per Unit for each quarter of
Rose Rock’s existence; less
•       the cumulative amount per Unit of any distributions of
Available Cash from Operating Surplus in excess of the
Minimum Quarterly Distribution per Unit that Rose Rock
distributed 98% to the Unitholders, pro rata, and 2% to the
Rose Rock General Partner, for each quarter of Rose Rock’s
existence (the cumulative amount, determined in accordance
with this bullet point and the former bullet point, the “First
Liquidation Target Amount”);
Rose Rock
•       Fourth, 85% to all Unitholders, pro rata, and 15% to the
Rose Rock General Partner until the capital account in

sum of the excess of the Second Target Distribution per Unit
over the First Target Distribution per Unit for each quarter of
Rose Rock’s existence; less
•       the cumulative amount per Unit of any distributions of
Available Cash from Operating Surplus in excess of the First
Target Distribution per Unit that Rose Rock distributed 85%
to the Unitholders, pro rata, and 15% to the Rose Rock
General Partner for each quarter of Rose Rock’s existence
(the cumulative amount, determined in accordance with this
bullet point and the former bullet point, the “Second
Liquidation Target Amount”);
•       Fifth, 75% to all Unitholders, pro rata, and 25% to the
Rose Rock General Partner, until the capital account in
respect of each Rose Rock Common Unit is equal to:
•       the sum of the Second Liquidation Target Amount plus
the sum of the excess of the Third Target Distribution per
Unit over the Second Target Distribution per Unit for each
quarter of Rose Rock’s existence; less
•       the cumulative amount per Unit of any distributions of
Available Cash from Operating Surplus in excess of the
Second Target Distribution per Unit that Rose Rock
distributed 75% to the Unitholders, pro rata, and 25% to the
Rose Rock General Partner for each quarter of Rose Rock’s

Rose Rock
Upon Rose Rock’s liquidation, Rose Rock will generally
(subject to certain potential adjustments required to comply
with U.S. federal income tax law) allocate certain items of
loss with respect to the liquidation (which are described as
“Net Termination Loss” in the Rose Rock LP Agreement) to
the Rose Rock General Partner and the Rose Rock
Common Unitholders in the following general manner (as
more specifically described in the Rose Rock LP
Agreement):
•       First, 98% to the Rose Rock Common Unitholders in
proportion to the positive balances in their capital accounts
and 2% to the Rose Rock General Partner, until the capital
account in respect of each Common Unit then outstanding
has been reduced to zero; and
•       Second, to the Rose Rock General Partner and the
Unitholders pro rata, provided that such allocation does not
cause any Unitholder to have a deficit in its Adjusted Capital
Account (as defined in the Rose Rock LP Agreement); and
•       Thereafter, 100% to the Rose Rock General Partner.
The percentage interests set forth above for the Rose Rock
General Partner assume that the Rose Rock General Partner
maintains its 2% General Partner interest, that the Rose

additional classes of Partnership Interests and currently has
no Subordinated Units outstanding.

Merger or Consolidation
SemGroup
Rose Rock
Subject to limited exceptions, under the DGCL, the consummation
of a merger or consolidation requires the board of directors of a
corporation that is a constituent corporation in the merger or
consolidation to approve and declare advisable the agreement of
merger or consolidation and requires that the agreement of
merger or consolidation be adopted by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding stock of that corporation entitled to vote
thereon at an annual or special meeting for the purpose of acting
on the agreement.
SemGroup is subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the
DGCL. With respect to SemGroup, Section 203 prohibits
SemGroup from engaging in a business combination with any
interested stockholder for a three-year period following the time
that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless
(i) the SemGroup Board approves the transaction by which the
stockholder becomes an interested stockholder or approves the
business combination, in each case before the stockholder
becomes an interested stockholder, (ii) the interested stockholder
acquires 85% of SemGroup’s outstanding voting stock (excluding
certain stock) in the transaction by which such stockholder
becomes an interested stockholder, or (iii) the business
combination is subsequently approved by the SemGroup Board
and approved at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of SemGroup’s outstanding
voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder. See the

merger, conveyance or conversion without the prior approval
of the Unitholders if (i) the Rose Rock General Partner has
received an opinion of counsel that the merger, conveyance
or consolidation, as the case may be, would not result in the
loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner or cause Rose
Rock to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal
income tax purposes, (ii) the sole purpose of such merger,
conveyance or consolidation is to effect a mere change in
the legal form of Rose Rock into another limited liability
entity and (iii) the Rose Rock General Partner determines
that the governing instruments of the new entity provide the
Limited Partners and the Rose Rock General Partner with
substantially the same rights and obligations as are
contained in the Rose Rock LP Agreement.

consummate any merger or consolidation of Rose Rock with
or into another entity, without the prior approval of the

Rose Rock LP Agreement that could not otherwise be
adopted solely by the Rose Rock General Partner, (iii) Rose
Rock is the surviving entity in such merger or consolidation,
(iv) each Partnership Interest in Rose Rock outstanding
immediately prior to the effective date of the merger or
consolidation is to be an identical Partnership Interest of
Rose Rock after the effective date of the merger or

approved and declared advisable by the SemGroup Board,
submitted to the SemGroup stockholders, and the adoption of
such amendment is approved by the affirmative vote of the
holders a majority of the outstanding shares of SemGroup

class of SemGroup capital stock outstanding).
SemGroup Amended and Restated Bylaws. The SemGroup
Amended and Restated Certificate provides that the SemGroup
Amended and Restated Bylaws may be adopted, amended or
repealed by the vote of a majority of the SemGroup Board, but any

discretion and in declining to propose or approve an
amendment, has no duty to act in good faith or pursuant to
any standard imposed by the Rose Rock LP Agreement or

relation to other types or classes of Partnership Interests will
require the approval of at least a majority of the type or class
of Partnership Interest so affected. However, in some
circumstances, more particularly described in the Rose Rock

principal place of business, its registered agent, or its
registered office;
•       the admission, substitution, withdrawal, or removal of
Partners;
•       a change that the Rose Rock General Partner
determines to be necessary or appropriate to qualify or
continue Rose Rock’s qualification as a limited partnership

liability under the laws of any state or to ensure that neither
Rose Rock nor its operating company or subsidiaries will be
treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes;
•       a change that the Rose Rock General Partner
determines does not adversely affect the Limited Partners (or
any particular class of Limited Partners) in any material
respect;

Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or “plan
asset” regulations adopted under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, whether or not
substantially similar to plan asset regulations currently
applied or proposed;

foregoing.
Proposed amendments (other than those described above)
must be approved by the Rose Rock General Partner and
the holders of at least a Unit Majority, unless a greater or
different percentage is required under the Rose Rock LP

Rock LP Agreement that establishes a percentage of
outstanding Rose Rock Common Units (including Rose
Rock Common Units deemed owned by the Rose Rock

amended, altered, changed, repealed, or rescinded to
reduce such voting percentage unless such amendment is
approved by the written consent or the affirmative vote of
holders of outstanding Rose Rock Common Units whose
aggregate outstanding Rose Rock Common Units constitute
not less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced or
increased, as applicable.
No amendment to the Rose Rock LP Agreement (other than
those that may be made by the Rose Rock General Partner
without the approval of the Limited Partners) may enlarge the
obligations of any Limited Partner without its consent unless
approved by at least a majority of the type or class of Limited

effect that such amendment will not affect the limited liability
of any Limited Partner under applicable law.

Each Unitholder of record has a vote according to its
percentage interest in Rose Rock, although additional
Limited Partner interests having special voting rights could
be issued. However, if at any time any person or group, other
than the Rose Rock General Partner or its affiliates,
beneficially owns 20% or more of the Partnership Interests of
any class then outstanding, none of the Partnership Interests
of any class owned by such person or group will be entitled
to vote on any matter and will not be considered to be
outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of Limited
Partners to vote on any matter, calculating required votes,
determining the presence of a quorum, or for other similar
purposes. The foregoing limitations do not apply to (i) any
person or group that acquired 20% or more of any such
Partnership Interests directly from the Rose Rock General
Partner or its affiliates (other than Rose Rock), (ii) any
person or group that acquired 20% or more of any such
Partnership Interests directly or indirectly from an initial
transferee of the Rose Rock General Partner or its affiliates
(provided that the Rose Rock General Partner has notified
such ultimate transferee that the foregoing limitations do not
apply), or (iii) any person or group that acquired 20% or more
of any such Partnership Interests with the prior approval of
the Board of Directors of the Rose Rock General Partner.
Rose Rock Common Units held in nominee or street name
accounts will be voted by the broker or other nominee in
accordance with the instruction of the beneficial owner
unless the arrangement between the beneficial owner and
its nominee provides otherwise. In the case of Rose Rock
Common Units held by the Rose Rock General Partner on
behalf of ineligible holders, the Rose Rock General Partner
will distribute the votes on those Rose Rock Common Units
in the same ratios as the votes of Limited Partners (including
the Rose Rock General Partner) in respect of Limited Partner
Interests other than those of ineligible holders are cast.

Special meetings of Limited Partners may be called by the
Rose Rock General Partner or by Limited Partners owning
20% or more of the outstanding units of the class or classes
for which a meeting is proposed, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Rose Rock LP Agreement. The
Rose Rock General Partner must send notice of any
meetings to all Limited Partners of record as of a record date
which may not be less than 10 or more than 60 days prior to
the date of the meeting (or, where approvals are sought
without a meeting, the date by which Limited Partners must
submit approvals) and any such meeting may be held not
less than 10 days or more than 60 days after the mailing of
notice of the meeting. Limited Partners may vote either in
person or by proxy at meetings. The holders of a majority of
the Partnership Interests of the class or classes for which a
meeting has been called, represented in person or by proxy,
will constitute a quorum unless any such action requires
approval by holders of a greater percentage interest, in
which case the quorum will be the greater percentage.
Any action that is required or permitted to be taken by the
Limited Partners may be taken either at a meeting of the
Limited Partners or without a meeting if consented to in
writing by Limited Partners owning not less than the
minimum percentage of the Partnership Interests of the class
or classes for which a meeting has been or would have been
called necessary to authorize or take that action at such

Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations
SemGroup
The SemGroup Amended and Restated Bylaws establish
advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals

election as directors at annual or special meetings. To be timely, a
stockholders’ notice for an annual meeting must be given to the
SemGroup secretary no later than the 90th day and no earlier than
the 120th day prior to the anniversary of the previous year’s
annual meeting (unless the annual meeting is called for a date not
within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, in which

Limitation on Liability; Indemnification; Advancement of Expenses
SemGroup
Rose Rock
The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the
personal liability of directors to corporations and their
stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors’
fiduciary duties. However, the DGCL does not permit exculpation
for liability:
•       for breach of the duty of loyalty;
•       for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
The Rose Rock LP Agreement provides that certain persons,
including the Rose Rock General Partner, managers,
managing members, officers, employees, and agents, shall
not be liable for monetary damages to Rose Rock, any
Limited Partners, or any other persons who have acquired
interests in the Partnership Interests of Rose Rock, for losses
sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of any act or
omission of any such person unless there has been a final
and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the
matter in question, such person acted in bad faith or
engaged in fraud or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted
with knowledge that such person’s conduct was criminal.
•       under Section 174 of the DGCL (which relates to unlawful
dividends and stock repurchases); or
•       for transactions from which the director derived an improper
personal benefit.
The SemGroup Amended and Restated Certificate eliminates the
personal liability of directors to SemGroup and its stockholders for
monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty to the fullest
extent permitted by the DGCL.
The SemGroup Amended and Restated Certificate requires
SemGroup to indemnify and advance expenses to its directors to
the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as further delineated in
the SemGroup Amended and Restated Bylaws.
The SemGroup Amended and Restated Bylaws further provide
that the SemGroup Board may grant rights to indemnification and
the advancement of expenses to any officer, employee or agent of
SemGroup. In addition, under the SemGroup Amended and
Restated Bylaws, SemGroup may maintain insurance, at its own
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or
agent of SemGroup or of another entity against any expense,
liability or loss, whether or not SemGroup would have the power
to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss
under the DGCL.

For further information, see the section titled
“Item 20 — Indemnification of Officers and Directors of SemGroup”
The Rose Rock LP Agreement indemnifies certain persons,
including the Rose Rock General Partner, managers,
managing members, officers, employees, and agents, to the
fullest extent permitted by law for any proceedings as a
result of such persons acting on behalf of Rose Rock,
subject to certain limitations in the Rose Rock LP
Agreement. The Rose Rock LP Agreement also provides for
advancement of expenses for proceedings against any such
person (provided, however, that such right of advancement
only exists in connection with any action, suit or proceeding
brought by an indemnified party if such action, suit or
proceeding was authorized by the Rose Rock General
Partner in its sole discretion). Further, the Rose Rock LP
Agreement allows Rose Rock to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of the Rose Rock General Partner and
any person designated by the Rose Rock General Partner to
protect against any liability incurred by such person on
behalf of Rose Rock.

Fiduciary Duties; Conflicts of Interest
SemGroup’s directors owe fiduciary duties to SemGroup and its
stockholders.
SemGroup
Under the DGCL, no contract or transaction between SemGroup
and any of its officers or directors, or between SemGroup and
another entity with which any officer or director of SemGroup is an
officer or director or in which any officer or director of SemGroup
has a financial interest, will be void or voidable solely because
the officer or director is present at or participates in the board or
committee meeting at which the contract or transaction is
authorized, or solely because such officer’s or director’s votes are
counted for such purpose, if:
•       the material facts as to the officer’s or director’s relationship
or interest as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or known
to the SemGroup Board (or duly authorized committee thereof)
and a majority of the disinterested directors vote to authorize the
transaction in good faith, even though such disinterested directors
may be less than a quorum;
•       the material facts as to the officer’s or director’s relationship
or interest as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or known
to SemGroup’s stockholders entitled to vote thereon and the
contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by a
vote of the stockholders; or
•       the contract or transaction is fair as to SemGroup as of the
time it is authorized, approved, or ratified by the SemGroup Board
(or duly authorized committee thereof) or the SemGroup
stockholders.
Rose Rock
The Rose Rock LP Agreement contains provisions that
eliminate the Rose Rock General Partner’s fiduciary duties
to Rose Rock and the Unitholders. The Rose Rock LP
Agreement also restricts the remedies available to the
Unitholders for actions taken that might, without those
limitations, constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.
The Rose Rock General Partner may take into account the
interests of other parties in addition to Rose Rock’s interests
when resolving conflicts of interest. In effect, these
provisions limit the Rose Rock General Partner’s fiduciary
duties to the Unitholders. The Rose Rock LP Agreement
also restricts the remedies available to the Unitholders for
actions taken by the Rose Rock General Partner that might,
without those limitations, constitute breaches of fiduciary
duty. Whenever a potential conflict of interest arises between
the Rose Rock General Partner or any of its affiliates, on the
one hand, and Rose Rock, its subsidiaries or any Partner, on
the other, any resolution or course of action by the Rose
Rock General Partner (in its individual capacity or in its
capacity as the General Partner, a Limited Partner or the
holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights) or its affiliates in
respect of such conflict of interest will be permitted and
deemed approved by all Partners and will not breach the
Rose Rock LP Agreement or any duty in law or equity, if
such resolution or course of action is:
•       approved by a majority of the members of the Rose
Rock Conflicts Committee acting in good faith (as referred to
elsewhere in this joint consent statement/proxy
statement/prospectus, such approval constituting “Special
Approval” under the Rose Rock LP Agreement);
•       approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding
Rose Rock Common Units (excluding Rose Rock Common
Units owned by the Rose Rock General Partner and its
affiliates);

•       on terms no less favorable to Rose Rock than those
generally being provided to or available from unrelated third
parties; or
•       fair and reasonable to Rose Rock, taking into account
the totality of the relationships between the parties involved
(including other transactions that may be particularly
favorable or advantageous to Rose Rock).
Accordingly, because of the existence of the latter two bullet
points immediately above, the Rose Rock General Partner
will not be required in connection with its resolution of a
conflict of interest to (i) obtain Special Approval or (ii) obtain
Unitholder approval, and may adopt a resolution or course of
action if such resolution or course of action satisfies either of
the latter two bullet points immediately above. In such a
circumstance, it will be presumed that the Board of Directors
of the Rose Rock General Partner acted in good faith. If
Special Approval is sought, then it will be presumed that the
Rose Rock Conflicts Committee, in making its decision to
approve or reject the resolution or course of action, acted in
good faith.
Whenever the Rose Rock General Partner (including the
Board of Directors of the Rose Rock General Partner or any
committee thereof) makes a determination or takes or
declines to take any other action, or any affiliate of the Rose
Rock General Partner causes it to do or not do any of the
foregoing, (i) under any provision of the Rose Rock LP
Agreement that permits or requires a determination to be
made in the Rose Rock General Partner’s “discretion” or
“sole discretion,” regardless of whether it is acting in its
capacity as the General Partner or in its individual capacity
or (ii) in the Rose Rock General Partner’s individual capacity
as opposed to in its capacity as the General Partner, then the
Rose Rock General Partner (including the Board of Directors
of the Rose Rock General Partner or any committee thereof)
or its affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will not
be subject to any duty or obligation (fiduciary or otherwise) to
Rose Rock, any Partner or any other person and will be
entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it
desires, including its own interests and the interests of its
affiliates, and will have no duty or obligation (fiduciary or
otherwise) to give any consideration to any interest of or
factors affecting Rose Rock, the
Rose Rock
partners, or any other person, and will not be subject to any
other or different standards (including fiduciary standards)
imposed by the Rose Rock LP Agreement or otherwise
existing at law, in equity or otherwise.
For example, whenever the phrase, “at the option of the
General Partner” or “at its option,” or some variation of those
phrases, is used in the Rose Rock LP Agreement, it
indicates that the Rose Rock General Partner is acting in its
individual capacity. Also, whenever the Rose Rock General
Partner votes or transfers its Partnership Interests, refrains

Taxation
SemGroup is subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its taxable
income.
SemGroup
Cash distributions to SemGroup Stockholders are taxable to each
stockholder as ordinary dividend income to the extent distributed
out of SemGroup’s current and accumulated “earnings and profits”
(as determined under U.S. federal income tax law). Cash
distributions in excess of SemGroup’s current and accumulated
earnings and profits are treated as a non-taxable return of capital,
which distributions reduce a stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in
such stockholder’s SemGroup Common Stock. To the extent the
cash distribution exceeds such stockholder’s adjusted tax basis, it
is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such shares.
Appraisal Rights
SemGroup
Under the DGCL, stockholders who properly demand and perfect
appraisal rights in connection with a merger or consolidation of
the corporation may have the right to receive payment of the fair
value of their stock in cash as appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery. Subject to certain exceptions, the DGCL provides that
appraisal rights are not available to any class of stock listed on a
national securities exchange or held of record

stockholders are required in the merger to accept in exchange for
their shares anything other than (1) shares of the surviving
corporation, (2) shares of stock of another corporation which is
listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more
than 2,000 holders, (3) cash in lieu of fractional shares of such
corporations, or (4) any combination of the above.
As described elsewhere in this joint consent statement/proxy

SemGroup is a Delaware corporation and is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 prevents an
interested stockholder, which is defined generally as a person owning 15% or more of SemGroup’s outstanding voting
stock, from engaging in a business combination with SemGroup for three years following the date that person became
an interested stockholder unless:
•
•
•
before that person became an interested stockholder, the SemGroup Board approved the transaction by which the interested
stockholder became an interested stockholder or approved the business combination, in each case before the stockholder
becomes an interested stockholder;
upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the interested stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the
interested stockholder owned at least 85% of SemGroup’s voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced
(excluding stock held by persons who are both directors and officers of SemGroup or by certain employee stock plans); or
on or following the date on which that person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by
the SemGroup Board and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2⁄3% of
SemGroup’s outstanding voting stock (excluding shares held by the interested stockholder).
A business combination includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the
interested stockholder.
Exclusive Forum
The SemGroup Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that unless SemGroup consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, the sole
and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) of SemGroup to bring internal corporate claims
(as defined below) will be a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of
Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware). “Internal corporate claims” means claims,
including claims in the right of SemGroup, (i) that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director,
officer, employee or stockholder in such capacity, or (ii) as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction upon the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware. This bylaw is referred to herein as the “exclusive forum bylaw.”
The SemGroup Amended and Restated Bylaws further provide that if any action the subject matter of which is within the
exclusive forum bylaw is brought outside the State of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the action will be deemed to
have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in
connection with any action brought by SemGroup in any such court to enforce the exclusive forum bylaw and (ii) having
service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder’s counsel in the
action brought outside the State of Delaware as agent for such stockholder.
Limitation of Liability and Indemnification
The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their
stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors’ fiduciary duties. However, the DGCL does not permit
exculpation for liability:
•
•
for breach of the duty of loyalty;
for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
under Section 174 of the DGCL (which relates to unlawful dividends and stock repurchases); or

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
The following is a discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders (as defined below)
of the Merger and of owning and disposing of SemGroup Common Stock received in the Merger. This discussion is
based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), existing and proposed
Treasury regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”) promulgated under the Code and current administrative rulings and
court decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in these authorities may
cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below. No ruling has been or is
expected to be sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of the tax consequences
discussed below. As a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a
position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth below.
This discussion is limited to U.S. holders of Rose Rock Public Units that hold their Rose Rock Public Units, and will hold
their shares of SemGroup Common Stock, if any, received in the Merger, as “capital assets” within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address any tax
consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax or the alternative minimum tax, nor does it
address any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, or foreign jurisdiction, or under any U.S. federal
laws other than those pertaining to income taxes. Furthermore, this discussion does not address all aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation that may be applicable to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances or to U.S. holders
subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:
•
•
•
a bank, insurance company or other financial institution;
a tax-exempt organization;
a real estate investment trust;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
an S corporation or other pass-through entity (or an investor in an S corporation or other pass-through entity);
a regulated investment company or a mutual fund;
a “controlled foreign corporation” or a “passive foreign investment company”;
a dealer or broker in stocks and securities, or currencies;
a trader in securities that elects mark-to-market treatment;
a holder of Rose Rock Public Units that received such common units through the exercise of an employee option, pursuant
to a retirement plan or otherwise as compensation;
holders of options, or holders of restricted units or bonus units, granted under any Rose Rock benefit plan;
a person whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
a holder of Rose Rock Public Units that holds such Rose Rock Public Units as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion or other
“synthetic security” or integrated transaction; or
a U.S. expatriate.
If a partnership, or any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds Rose Rock Public
Units, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding Rose Rock Public Units should consult its own tax
advisor.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Rose Rock Public Units or
SemGroup Common Stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
•
an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
135
Table of Contents
•
a trust if (i) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more United States
persons (as defined in the Code) are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; or
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR
DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER OR THE
RECEIPT, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF SEMGROUP COMMON STOCK, IF ANY, RECEIVED IN THE MERGER.
EACH HOLDER OF ROSE ROCK PUBLIC UNITS IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT WITH AND RELY UPON ITS OWN
TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE SPECIFIC FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH
HOLDER OF THE MERGER AND THE RECEIPT, OWNERSHIP, AND DISPOSITION OF SEMGROUP COMMON STOCK, IF
ANY, RECEIVED IN THE MERGER, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
Tax Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Rose Rock Public Units
Tax Characterization of the Merger. The receipt of SemGroup Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
SemGroup Common Stock in exchange for Rose Rock Public Units pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction
to U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, the Merger will be treated as a taxable sale of a U.S.
holder’s Rose Rock Public Units in exchange for SemGroup Common Stock and any cash received in lieu of fractional
shares of SemGroup Common Stock in the Merger.
Amount and Character of Gain or Loss Recognized. A U.S. holder who receives SemGroup Common Stock and cash in
lieu of fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock in exchange for Rose Rock Public Units pursuant to the Merger
will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the sum of (A) the amount of any cash
received, (B) the fair market value of any SemGroup Common Stock received, and (C) such U.S. holder’s share of Rose
Rock’s nonrecourse liabilities immediately prior to the merger and (ii) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Rose
Rock Public Units exchanged therefor (which includes such U.S. holder’s share of Rose Rock’s nonrecourse liabilities
immediately prior to the Merger).
A U.S. holder’s initial tax basis in its Rose Rock Public Units would have been equal to the amount such holder paid for
the Rose Rock Public Units plus the U.S. holder’s share of Rose Rock’s nonrecourse liabilities. Over time that basis
would have (i) increased by the U.S. holder’s share of Rose Rock’s income and by any increases in the U.S. holder’s
share of Rose Rock’s nonrecourse liabilities and (ii) decreased, but not below zero, by distributions from Rose Rock, by
the U.S. holder’s share of Rose Rock’s losses, by any decreases in the U.S. holder’s share of Rose Rock’s nonrecourse
liabilities and by the U.S. holder’s share of Rose Rock’s expenditures that are not deductible in computing taxable
income and are not required to be capitalized.
Except as noted below, gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder on the exchange of Rose Rock Public Units in the
Merger will generally be taxable as capital gain or loss. However, a portion of this gain or loss, which portion will likely be
substantial, will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss under Section 751 of the Code to the
extent attributable to assets giving rise to depreciation recapture or other “unrealized receivables” or to “inventory
items” owned by Rose Rock and its subsidiaries. The term “unrealized receivables” includes potential recapture items,
including depreciation recapture. Ordinary income attributable to unrealized receivables, inventory items and
depreciation recapture may exceed net taxable gain realized upon the exchange of a Rose Rock Public Unit pursuant to
the merger and may be recognized even if there is a net taxable loss realized on the exchange of such U.S. holder’s Rose
Rock Public Units pursuant to the Merger. Consequently, a U.S. holder may recognize both ordinary income and capital
loss upon the exchange of Rose Rock Public Units in the Merger.
Table of Contents
136
Capital gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding
period for its Rose Rock Public Units is more than twelve months as of the effective time of the Merger. If the U.S. holder
is an individual, such long-term capital gain will generally be eligible for reduced rates of taxation. Capital losses
recognized by a U.S. holder may offset capital gains and, in the case of individuals, no more than $3,000 of ordinary
income. Capital losses recognized by U.S. holders that are corporations may be used to offset only capital gains.
The amount of gain or loss recognized by each U.S. holder in the Merger will vary depending on each U.S. holder’s
particular situation, including the value of the SemGroup Common Stock and the amount of any cash received in lieu of
fractional shares of SemGroup Common Stock by each U.S. holder in the Merger, the adjusted tax basis of the Rose
Rock Public Units exchanged by each U.S. holder in the Merger, and the amount of any suspended passive losses that
may be available to a particular unitholder to offset a portion of the gain recognized by each U.S. holder. Passive losses
that were not deductible by a U.S. holder in prior taxable periods because they exceeded a U.S. holder’s share of Rose
Rock’s income may be deducted in full upon the U.S. holder’s taxable disposition of its entire investment in Rose Rock
pursuant to the Merger. Each U.S. holder is strongly urged to consult its own tax advisor with respect to the specific tax
consequences to them of the Merger, taking into account its own particular circumstances.
Rose Rock Items of Income, Gain, Loss, and Deduction for the Taxable Period Ending on the Date of the Merger. U.S.
holders of Rose Rock Public Units will be allocated their share of Rose Rock’s items of income, gain, loss, and deduction
for the taxable period of Rose Rock ending on the date of the Merger. These allocations will be made in accordance with
the terms of the Rose Rock LP Agreement. A U.S. holder will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on any such
allocated income and gain even if such U.S. holder does not receive a cash distribution from Rose Rock attributable to
such allocated income and gain. Any such income and gain allocated to a U.S. holder will increase the U.S. holder’s tax
basis in the Rose Rock Public Units held and, therefore, will reduce the gain, or increase the loss, recognized by such
U.S. holder resulting from the Merger. Any losses or deductions allocated to a U.S. holder will decrease the U.S. holder’s
tax basis in the Rose Rock Public Units held and, therefore, will increase the gain, or reduce the loss, recognized by
such U.S. holder resulting from the Merger.
Tax Basis and Holding Period in SemGroup Common Stock Received in the Merger. A U.S. holder’s tax basis in the
SemGroup Common Stock received in the Merger will equal the fair market value of such SemGroup Common Stock. A
U.S. holder’s holding period in SemGroup Common Stock received in the merger will begin on the day after the date of
the Merger.
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Owning and Disposing of SemGroup Common Stock Received in the Merger
Distributions on SemGroup Common Stock. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, distributions of cash by SemGroup to
a U.S. holder with respect to SemGroup Common Stock received in the Merger will generally be included in a U.S.
holder’s income as ordinary dividend income to the extent of SemGroup’s current and accumulated “earnings and
profits” as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. A portion of the cash distributed to SemGroup
Stockholders by SemGroup after the Merger may exceed SemGroup’s current and accumulated earnings and profits.
Distributions of cash in excess of SemGroup’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-
taxable return of capital reducing a U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such U.S. holder’s SemGroup Common Stock and,
to the extent the distribution exceeds such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis, as capital gain from the sale or exchange of
such SemGroup Common Stock. Dividends received by a corporate U.S. holder may be eligible for a dividends received
deduction, subject to applicable limitations. Dividends received by an individual U.S. holder may be taxed at the lower
applicable long-term capital gains rate if such dividends are treated as “qualified dividend income” for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
Sale, Exchange, Certain Redemptions, or Other Taxable Dispositions of SemGroup Common Stock. Upon the sale,
exchange, certain redemptions or other taxable dispositions of SemGroup Common Stock received in the Merger, a U.S.
holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between
Table of Contents
137
(i) the amount of cash and the fair market value of any other property received upon such taxable disposition of
SemGroup Common Stock and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such SemGroup Common Stock. Such capital
gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period in the SemGroup Common Stock
disposed of is more than twelve months at the time of such taxable disposition. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate
taxpayers are generally taxed at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information returns may be required to be filed with the IRS in connection with the Merger and in connection with
distributions made with respect to, or dispositions of, SemGroup Common Stock received in the Merger. A U.S. holder
may be subject to U.S. backup withholding on payments made pursuant to the merger or on distributions made with
respect to, or on payments made pursuant to dispositions of, SemGroup Common Stock received in the Merger unless
such holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer identification number and otherwise
complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amount withheld under the U.S. backup
withholding rules is not an additional tax and will generally be allowed as a refund or credit against the U.S. holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain matters discussed in this joint consent statement/proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated
herein by reference include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and
Section 21E of the Exchange Act. SemGroup makes these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor
protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included or incorporated by reference in this joint consent
statement/proxy statement/prospectus regarding the benefits of the Merger, including the combined company’s future
financial and operating results, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not
historical facts, may constitute forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements generally can be
identified by the use of forward-looking words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “foresee,” “project,”
“anticipate,” “believe,” “plans,” “forecasts,” “continue” or “could” or the negative of these terms or variations of them or
similar terms. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable,
we cannot assure you that these expectations will prove to be correct. These forward-looking statements are subject to
certain known and unknown risks, and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those reflected in these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause actual results to differ
include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A of each of SemGroup’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 26, 2016 (including Amendment No. 1, filed May 31, 2016), and Rose
Rock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 26, 2016, entitled “Risk
Factors,” risk factors discussed in other reports that each of SemGroup and Rose Rock file with the SEC and the
following risks arising in connection with or impacted as a result of the Merger:
•
The Closing, expected timing, and benefits of the Merger;
•
SemGroup’s ability, following the Merger, to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable it to pay its
obligations and its current and expected dividends or to fund its liquidity needs;
•
The levels of expected future dividends payable by SemGroup to SemGroup Stockholders;
•
•
•
Expected levels of future cash distributions by Rose Rock with respect to general partner interests, incentive
distribution rights and limited partner interests;
The effect of SemGroup’s debt level on its future financial and operating flexibility, including its ability to obtain
additional capital on terms that are favorable to it;
SemGroup’s ability to access the debt and equity markets, which will depend on general markets conditions and the
credit ratings for SemGroup’s debt obligations and equity; and
•
Amounts and nature of future capital requirements.
New factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements
emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for SemGroup or Rose Rock to predict all such factors, or the extent to
which any such factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-
looking statement.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements contained in joint consent
statement/proxy statement/prospectus, which forward-looking statements reflect SemGroup’s and Rose Rock’s
management’s opinions only as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, SemGroup and Rose Rock undertake no
obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to any forward-looking statements.
Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, SemGroup and Rose Rock caution that there are
important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in the forward-looking statements. These factors include the risks set forth under the

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Introduction to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Financial Statements
On May 31, 2016, SemGroup announced an agreement under which SemGroup will acquire all of the outstanding Rose
Rock Public Units in an all stock-for-unit transaction at a ratio of 0.8136 shares of SemGroup Common Stock for each
Rose Rock Public Unit.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements of SemGroup have been
prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated balance sheet reflects the Merger as if it had occurred on June 30, 2016. The accompanying unaudited pro
forma condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect the Merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015. The
terms “we”, “our”, “us”, and similar language used in these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statements refer to SemGroup and its subsidiaries.
These unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from our historical financial
statements, which are included in SemGroup’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015
and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. These unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and related
notes thereto.
These unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and
do not purport to represent what our actual results of operations or financial position would have been if the Merger had
occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of our future operating results or financial position.
However, the pro forma adjustments shown in these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.

The Merger will be accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation — Overall — Changes in a Parent’s Ownership Interest in a Subsidiary.
SemGroup controls and consolidates Rose Rock prior to the Merger and will retain control of Rose Rock subsequent to
the Merger. Therefore, the change in SemGroup’s ownership interest in Rose Rock will be accounted for as an equity
transaction and no gain or loss will be recognized in SemGroup’s consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss) as a result of the Merger.
2.
Pro forma adjustments
(a) Reflects the estimated impact of deferred income taxes resulting from the Merger using SemGroup’s statutory federal
and state tax rate of 37.9%. The amount reflects a net adjustment of $119.7 million related to the effects of the change in
ownership and the step-up in tax basis as a result of SemGroup’s acquisition of the Rose Rock Public Units. The
deferred income tax adjustment is based on a SemGroup illustrative share price of $29.50. Actual amounts will be
determined based on the SemGroup share price as of the effective time of the Merger.
(b) Reflects the expected $8 million cost of the Merger for legal, advisory and other costs. As the Merger is accounted for
as an equity transaction, these costs will be recognized as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital, net of income tax
benefit of approximately $3 million.
(c) Reflects the issuance of approximately 13.1 million shares of SemGroup Common Stock for purchase of the
noncontrolling interest in Rose Rock. The number of shares to be issued is estimated based on the agreed upon ratio of
0.8136 shares of SemGroup Common Stock per Rose Rock Public Unit and the 16.1 million Rose Rock Public Units
issued and outstanding at June 30, 2016.
(d) Reflects the additional income tax expense on the incremental income attributable to SemGroup as a result of the
Merger and the resultant impact of the change in the effective tax rate.
(e) Reflects the additional net income attributable to shares of SemGroup Common Stock had the Merger occurred at
January 1, 2015.
(f) Reflects the additional outstanding shares of SemGroup Common Stock for the year ended December 31, 2015 and
the six months ended June 30, 2016 had the Merger occurred at January 1, 2015. Incremental shares were calculated as
described at note (c), above. No additional dilutive shares were assumed related to unvested Rose Rock Restricted Unit
Awards, which will be converted into unvested SemGroup restricted share compensation awards based on the agreed
upon ratio of 0.8136, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Unvested equity compensation awards were antidilutive for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to the net loss for that period.

Delaware, duly executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA, as applicable (the date and
time of such filing (or, if agreed by the parties hereto, such later time and date as may be expressed therein as the

Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into RRMS, the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and RRMS shall continue as the surviving limited partnership in the Merger (the “Surviving Entity”).
(c) Effect of the Merger on Equity Securities. Subject in each case to Sections 2.1(e) and 2.1(f), at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, RRMS, RRMS General Partner, any Holder
of RRMS Common Units, any Holder of Parent Common Stock, or any other Person:
(i) Conversion of RRMS Public Units. Each of the RRMS Public Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive 0.8136 shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common
Stock (such number of shares of Parent Common Stock, the “Merger Consideration”).
(ii) Each RRMS Public Unit, upon being converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Section 2.1(c), shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Holder
of such RRMS Public Units immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter cease to be a limited partner of RRMS
or have any rights with respect to such RRMS Public Units, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and any
distributions and Fractional Share Proceeds to which former Holders of RRMS Public Units become entitled all in
accordance with this Article II upon the Surrender of (A) a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented RRMS Public Units (a “RRMS Certificate”) (or lost certificate affidavit as contemplated by Section 2.2(b)) or
(B) uncertificated RRMS Public Units represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry RRMS Common Units”), together with

consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such canceled RRMS Common Units. All (a) RRMS General Partner
Interest, (b) RRMS Incentive Distribution Rights and (c) RRMS Common Units that are not RRMS Public Units or subject

Restricted Unit Awards, be treated as described in Section 2.3.

(iv) Equity of Merger Sub. The outstanding limited liability company interest in Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an aggregate number of common units of the Surviving
Entity equal to the number of RRMS Public Units that are converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i). At the Effective Time, the books and records of RRMS shall be revised to reflect the
cancellation and retirement of all RRMS Public Units and the conversion of the limited liability company interest in
Merger Sub to common units of the Surviving Entity, and the existence of RRMS (as the Surviving Entity) shall continue
without dissolution.
(d) Other Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall be conducted in accordance with and shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA. At the Effective Time, (i) the certificate of limited
partnership of RRMS shall continue as the certificate of limited partnership of the Surviving Entity, and (ii) the RRMS
Partnership Agreement shall remain unchanged and shall continue as the agreement of limited partnership of the
Surviving Entity, until duly amended in accordance with applicable Law and the terms of the RRMS Partnership
Agreement (subject to Section 5.9 hereof).
(e) No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) no certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger and (ii) each registered Holder of RRMS Public
Units converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all RRMS Public Units held by such Holder immediately prior to the Effective
Time) shall be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(e), a
cash payment, without interest, in lieu of such fractional shares representing such Holder’s proportionate interest, in the
proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (the “Share Proceeds”) in one or more transactions of a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, such number equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock reserved with the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(a) minus (ii) the aggregate number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that Holders of RRMS Public Units are entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(c)(i) and Section 2.1(c)(ii) (such excess, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be equal to the aggregate
number of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that the registered Holders of RRMS Public Units converted
pursuant to the Merger would have otherwise been entitled to receive, the “Excess Shares”). The parties acknowledge
that payment of the cash Share Proceeds in lieu of issuing certificates or scrip for fractional shares was not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of RRMS Public Units that would otherwise receive
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing price on the NYSE in the
manner provided in this Section 2.1(e) and such sales shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the
Share Proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the Holders of such RRMS Public Units, the Exchange
Agent shall hold such Share Proceeds in trust for the benefit of the Holders of such RRMS Public Units (the “Fractional
Share Proceeds”). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Fractional Share Proceeds to which each
Holder of such RRMS Public Units shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate Share Proceeds
comprising the Fractional Share Proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such Holder of such RRMS Public Units would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is
the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of such RRMS Public Units would otherwise be
entitled.
(f) Certain Adjustments. If between the Execution Date and the Effective Time, whether or not permitted pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the number of outstanding RRMS Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
changed into a different number of units, shares or other securities (including any different class or series of securities)
by reason of any dividend or distribution payable in partnership interests, voting securities, equity interests or Rights,
subdivision, reclassification, split, split-up, combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization, exchange or other similar
transaction, or any such transaction shall be authorized, declared or agreed upon with a record date at or prior to the
Effective Time, then the Merger Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted
to reflect fully the effect of such transaction

11
and to provide to RRMS, Merger Sub and the Holders of RRMS Restricted Unit Awards and RRMS Public Units the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, and thereafter, all references in this Agreement
to the Merger Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items shall be references to the Merger Consideration,
and any other similarly dependent items, as so adjusted; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.1(f) shall be
deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such dividend or distribution payable in partnership
interests, shares, voting securities, equity interests or Rights, subdivision, reclassification, split, split-up, combination,
merger, consolidation, reorganization, exchange or other similar transaction, or the authorization, declaration or
agreement to do such transaction that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to be undertaken pursuant to this
Agreement.
SECTION 2.2 Exchange of RRMS Public Units.
(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the mailing of the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement, Parent shall
appoint Computershare (or a different exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Parent and RRMS) to act as exchange
agent (the “Exchange Agent”) for the payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends and other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any Fractional Share Proceeds. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) reserve
with the Exchange Agent the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i) and (ii) authorize
the Exchange Agent to exchange shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2.2. Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent any additional cash or other consideration as and when necessary to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and other amounts required to be paid under this
Agreement. Parent shall pay all costs and fees of the Exchange Agent and all expenses associated with the exchange
process. Any shares of Parent Common Stock, or fraction thereof, any remaining Fractional Share Proceeds, and any
remaining amount of funds deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be returned to Parent after the earlier to occur of
(x) payment in full of all amounts due to the Holders of RRMS Public Units and (y) twelve months after the Closing Date,
and any Holders of the RRMS Certificates or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units who have not theretofore complied with
this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration, any Share Proceeds and any distributions or other distributions to which such Holders may be
entitled.
(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail to
each Holder, as of the Effective Time, of RRMS Public Units whose RRMS Public Units were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration a form of letter of transmittal (the “Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the RRMS Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
RRMS Certificates (or lost certificate affidavit as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b)) to the Exchange Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry RRMS Common Units, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and
which shall be in such customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and RRMS may reasonably agree prior
to the Effective Time and instructions for effecting the Surrender of such RRMS Certificates (or lost certificate affidavit as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b)) or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units in exchange for, as applicable, whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any Fractional Share
Proceeds. Subject to Section 2.2(c), upon Surrender to the Exchange Agent of such RRMS Certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b)) or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units, together with such properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the Holder of a RRMS Certificate (or lost certificate affidavit as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b)) or
Book-Entry RRMS Common Units shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested) to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i), (ii) the Fractional Share Proceeds, if any,
payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable and (iii) any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) to which such Holder is entitled. The instructions for effecting the
Surrender of RRMS Certificates shall set forth procedures that must be taken by the Holder of any RRMS Certificate that
has been lost, destroyed or stolen; it shall be a condition to the right of such Holder to receive the Merger Consideration,
the Fractional

Share Proceeds, if any, and any distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) that the Exchange Agent shall have
received, along with the Letter of Transmittal, a duly executed lost certificate affidavit, including an agreement to
indemnify Parent, signed exactly as the name or names of the registered Holder or Holders of RRMS Public Units
appeared on the books of RRMS immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with a customary bond and such other
documents, in each case, as Parent may reasonably require in connection therewith. After the Effective Time, there shall
be no further transfer on the records of RRMS or its transfer agent of RRMS Certificates or Book-Entry RRMS Common
Units (provided, however, that the foregoing shall not restrict the transfer of any RRMS Partnership Interest other than
the RRMS Public Units after the Effective Time); and if such RRMS Certificates or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units are
presented to RRMS or its transfer agent for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of the appropriate Merger
Consideration, any Fractional Share Proceeds and any distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) as hereinabove
provided. Until Surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each RRMS Certificate or Book-Entry RRMS
Common Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
Surrender the appropriate Merger Consideration, together with any distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and
Fractional Share Proceeds as contemplated by this Section 2.2. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any Fractional
Share Proceeds or any distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c).
(c) Dividends and Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged RRMS Public Units. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Holder of any RRMS Certificate or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units not Surrendered with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect thereof until the Surrender of such RRMS Certificate or Book-Entry
RRMS Common Units in accordance with this Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, Parent shall pay, or
cause the Exchange Agent to pay, to the Holder of each RRMS Certificate or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units, without
interest, (i) at the time of Surrender of such RRMS Certificate or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units, the amount of
dividends or other distributions previously paid with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with
respect to such RRMS Certificate or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units that have a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date on or prior to the time of Surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
and distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time and prior to such Surrender and a payment date subsequent to such Surrender.
(d) No Further Ownership Rights in RRMS Public Units. All Merger Consideration issued upon the Surrender for
exchange of RRMS Certificates or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units in accordance with the terms of this Article II
(including any Fractional Share Proceeds and dividends and distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) shall be
deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the RRMS Public Units heretofore
represented by such RRMS Certificates or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units (including all rights to common units
arrearages), subject, however, to Parent’s obligation, with respect to RRMS Public Units outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, to pay any distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or
made by RRMS on such RRMS Common Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the
Effective Time and that remain unpaid at the Closing Date.
(e) No Liability. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Parent, Merger Sub, RRMS, RRMS General Partner or
their respective Affiliates or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration,
distribution or Fractional Share Proceeds properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any RRMS Certificates or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units shall not have been
Surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration, any Fractional Share Proceeds or any
distributions with respect to RRMS Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of such RRMS
Certificate or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such units, cash or distributions in respect of such RRMS Certificates or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Withholding Rights. Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, without duplication, such amounts, which may include
shares of Parent Common Stock, as Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent reasonably deems to be required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.
(g) No Dissenters’ Rights. No dissenters’ or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
SECTION 2.3 Treatment of RRMS Restricted Unit Awards and RRMS UDRs.
(a) At the Effective Time, each RRMS Restricted Unit Award that is not vested and does not vest in accordance with its
terms (as set forth in an applicable award agreement) as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to represent an award with respect to RRMS
Common Units and shall be converted into an award with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock (a “Parent Award”),
subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to such RRMS Restricted Unit Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent
Award to be equal to the number of RRMS Common Units subject to each such RRMS Restricted Unit Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration (rounded down to the nearest whole
share), with any corresponding accrued but unpaid UDRs (as defined in the RRMS Equity Incentive Plan) with respect to
any RRMS Restricted Unit Awards to be assumed by Parent, remain outstanding and continue to represent an obligation
with respect to the applicable Parent Award.
(b) Prior to the Effective Time, RRMS and RRMS General Partner shall take all action necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.3. RRMS and RRMS General Partner shall ensure that, as of immediately following the
Effective Time, no holder of a RRMS Restricted Unit Award or participant in the RRMS Equity Incentive Plan shall have
any rights thereunder to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the equity of RRMS, the Surviving Entity or any of the
RRMS Subsidiaries.
(c) Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock that will be subject to the Parent Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by this
Section 2.3. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the extent legally required, file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available, other appropriate forms,
including Form S-3) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Awards and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of any such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent Awards
remain outstanding and the offering with respect thereto is required to be registered.

after January 1, 2015 and prior to the Execution Date (without giving effect to any SEC Report or any amendment to any
SEC Report in each case filed on or after the Execution Date), RRMS and, with respect to itself where provided for in this
Article III, the RRMS General Partner each hereby represent and warrant to the Parent Parties that:
SECTION 3.1 Organization and Existence.
(a) Each of the RRMS Parties is a limited partnership or limited liability company duly formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite limited partnership or limited liability company
power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.
(b) Each of the RRMS Subsidiaries (other than any of the RRMS Parties) is an entity duly organized or formed, as
applicable, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the
Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization or formation and has all requisite power and authority to own, operate
and lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.
(c) Each of the RRMS Group Entities is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in the states in
which the character of the properties and assets owned or held by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
requires it to be so licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a RRMS Material Adverse Effect.
(d) RRMS has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the Governing Documents of each RRMS Party in
effect as of the Execution Date. All such Governing Documents are in full force and effect and no RRMS Party is in
violation of any provisions thereof.
SECTION 3.2 Authority and Approval. Each of the RRMS Parties has all requisite limited liability company or limited
partnership power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and to perform all of the terms and conditions hereof to be performed by it, subject to receipt of the RRMS Vote,
in the case of RRMS. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the RRMS Parties, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and the performance of all of the terms and conditions hereof to be performed by
the RRMS Parties have been duly authorized and approved by all requisite limited partnership or limited liability
company action on the part of each of the RRMS Parties, subject to receipt of the RRMS Vote, in the case of RRMS. At a

RRMS Unaffiliated Holders, (b) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger (the foregoing constituting RRMS Special Approval), and (c) resolved to approve, and to recommend to the

Holdings approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The adoption of
this Agreement by the affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of at least a Unit Majority (as defined in the RRMS
Partnership Agreement) (the “RRMS Vote”) is the only vote or approval of the holders of any partnership interests in
RRMS necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and approve and consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the RRMS
Parties and constitutes the valid and

legally binding obligation of each of the RRMS Parties, enforceable against each of the RRMS Parties in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights and remedies generally and
by general principles of equity (whether applied in a Proceeding at law or in equity).
SECTION 3.3 No Conflict; Consents.
(a) Except as set forth on Section 3.3(a) of the RRMS Disclosure Letter, and subject to the consent, approval, license,
permit, order, authorization, filings and notices referred to in Section 3.3(b) and receipt of the RRMS Vote, the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of the RRMS Parties does not, and the fulfillment and compliance
with the terms and conditions hereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,

conditions or provisions of the Governing Documents of any of the RRMS Parties; (ii) contravene, conflict with or violate

Group Entities is a party or by which any of the RRMS Group Entities or any of their assets are bound; or (iv) result in the
creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of the assets or businesses of any of the RRMS Group Entities
under any such indenture, deed of trust, mortgage, debenture, note, agreement, contract, commitment, license,
concession, permit lease, joint venture, obligation or other instrument, except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for
those items that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a RRMS Material Adverse Effect.
(b) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization of, or any filing with or notice to, any Governmental
Entity is required to be obtained or made by any of the RRMS Group Entities in connection with the execution, delivery,
and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except

SECTION 3.4 Capitalization; Limited Partner Interests.

(including 176,704 RRMS Common Units subject to RRMS Restricted Unit Awards), the RRMS General Partner Interest
and the RRMS Incentive Distribution Rights. All of such RRMS Common Units and RRMS Incentive Distribution Rights

Partner is the sole owner of the RRMS General Partner Interest and the RRMS General Partner Interest has been duly
authorized and validly issued in accordance with the RRMS Partnership Agreement. As of the Execution Date, (i) 743,497
RRMS Common Units were reserved
Table of Contents
16
for issuance under the RRMS Equity Incentive Plan, of which (A) 176,704 RRMS Common Units were subject to
outstanding restricted unit awards (the “RRMS Restricted Unit Awards”) and (B) no RRMS Common Units were subject
to outstanding options, unit appreciation rights, phantom units, or other unit-based awards of any other kind. All RRMS
Common Units reserved for issuance under the RRMS Equity Incentive Plan, when issued in accordance with the
respective terms thereof, are or will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth
above in this Section 3.4(a), as of the Execution Date there are not any RRMS Common Units, partnership interests,
voting securities or other equity interests of RRMS issued and outstanding or any Rights issued or granted by, or
binding upon, RRMS, except as set forth in the RRMS SEC Reports (without giving effect to any SEC Report or any
amendment to any SEC Report in each case filed on or after the Execution Date) or the RRMS Partnership Agreement as
in effect on the Execution Date, except for awards granted under the RRMS Equity Incentive Plan, or except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in the RRMS Partnership Agreement as in effect on the Execution
Date, there are no outstanding obligations of RRMS or any RRMS Group Entity to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any RRMS Common Units or other partnership interests, voting securities or other equity interests or any Rights
of RRMS or any RRMS Group Entity. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness, the
holders of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for securities
having the right to vote) with the limited partners of RRMS on any matter.
(b) Section 3.4(b) of the RRMS Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list of the RRMS Subsidiaries as of the
Execution Date. As of the Execution Date, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests
of each RRMS Subsidiary owned directly or indirectly by the RRMS Parties (i) are owned, beneficially and of record free
and clear of all Liens in the percentages set out on Section 3.4(b) of the RRMS Disclosure Letter and (ii) have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid (with respect to RRMS Subsidiaries that are limited liability companies or
limited partnerships, to the extent required under the limited liability company agreement or limited partnership
agreement of the applicable RRMS Subsidiary) and nonassessable (with respect to RRMS Subsidiaries that are limited
liability companies or limited partnerships, except as such nonassessability may be affected by Sections 18-607 and 18-
804 of the DLLCA or by Sections 17-303, 17-403, 17-607 and 17-804 of the DRULPA and the Governing Documents of the
applicable entity).
(c) Other than ownership interests in the RRMS Subsidiaries set forth on Section 3.4(b) of the RRMS Disclosure Letter,
RRMS does not own beneficially, directly or indirectly, any equity securities or other ownership interests of any Person
as of the Execution Date. There are no outstanding Rights issued or granted by, or binding upon, any of the RRMS
Subsidiaries as of the Execution Date.
(d) Except as set forth in this Section 3.4 or as otherwise issued or committed to issue after the date of this Agreement,
neither RRMS nor any RRMS Subsidiary has issued any compensatory equity or equity-linked award that remains
outstanding, nor has any such entity committed to issue any such award.
SECTION 3.5 SEC Documents; Internal Controls.
(a) Since January 1, 2015, all reports, including but not limited to the Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports
on Form 10-Q and the Current Reports on Form 8-K (whether filed on a voluntary basis or otherwise), forms, schedules,
certifications, prospectuses, registration statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished by RRMS or
any RRMS Subsidiary with or to the SEC have been or will be timely filed or furnished (the “RRMS SEC Reports”). Each
of the RRMS SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects with the requirements of applicable Law (including the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”)), and (ii) as of its effective date (in the case of RRMS SEC Reports
that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of its filing date did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
except for any statements (x) in any RRMS SEC Report that may have been modified by an amendment to such report or
a subsequent report
Table of Contents
17
filed with the SEC prior to the Execution Date or (y) with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of
Parent, as to which RRMS makes no representation or warranty.
(b) No RRMS Subsidiary is required to file reports, forms or other documents with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act. There are no outstanding comments from, or unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with respect to the
RRMS SEC Reports. No enforcement action has been initiated against RRMS relating to disclosures contained or
omitted from any RRMS SEC Report.
(c) RRMS makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has devised and maintains a system of internal controls,
in each case, as required pursuant to Section 13(b)(2) under the Exchange Act. RRMS has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act and the applicable listing standards of the NYSE. Such disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by RRMS in the reports that it files
under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules
and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to its management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. RRMS General Partner’s principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to RRMS’s auditors and the audit
committee of the RRMS Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal controls which
could adversely affect RRMS’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for
RRMS’s auditors any material weakness in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in RRMS’s internal controls.
(d) Since January 1, 2015, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the RRMS General Partner have
made all certifications (without qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to Knowledge) required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such certifications are complete and correct, and none of
such entities or its officers have received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy,
completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such certification. As of the Execution Date, and except as
disclosed in a RRMS SEC Report filed with the SEC prior to the Execution Date, none of such entities has any
Knowledge of any material weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal controls over financial reporting.
SECTION 3.6 Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities.
(a) RRMS’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016 (the “RRMS 10-K”) sets forth a true and
complete copy of the consolidated audited statements of income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2015 and consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 for
RRMS, including the notes thereto, and RRMS’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 6, 2016 (the
“RRMS 10-Q”) sets forth a true and complete copy of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and
cash flows for each of the three month periods ending March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 and unaudited condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 for RRMS, including the notes thereto (the referenced financial
statements set forth in the RRMS 10-K and in the RRMS 10-Q are collectively referred to as the “RRMS Financial
Statements”). The RRMS Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods covered thereby (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and present fairly in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of RRMS as of such dates and the consolidated statements of
income and cash flows of RRMS for such periods, except as otherwise noted therein. Except as set forth in the RRMS
Financial Statements, there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
RRMS Material Adverse Effect. RRMS has not had any disagreement with its independent public accounting firm that
required disclosure in the RRMS SEC Reports.

(b) There are no liabilities or obligations of RRMS, RRMS General Partner or the RRMS Subsidiaries (whether known or
unknown and whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) and there are no facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in any such liabilities or obligations, whether arising in the context of federal, state or

Table of Contents

a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except for any statements (x) in
any Parent SEC Report that may have been modified by an amendment to such report or a subsequent report filed with

which Parent makes no representation or warranty.
(b) No Parent Subsidiary is required to file reports, forms or other documents with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act. There are no outstanding comments from, or unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with respect to the

omitted from any Parent SEC Report.
(c) Parent makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has devised and maintains a system of internal controls,
in each case, as required pursuant to Section 13(b)(2) under the Exchange Act. Parent has established and maintains

paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act and the applicable listing standards of the NYSE. Such disclosure controls and procedures are

under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules
and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to its management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Parent’s principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to Parent’s auditors and the audit committee of
the Parent Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal controls which could adversely
affect Parent’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parent’s auditors
any material weakness in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parent’s internal controls.

certifications (without qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to Knowledge) required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such certifications are complete and correct, and none of such
entities or its officers have received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy,
completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such certification. As of the Execution Date, and except as

Knowledge of any material weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal controls over financial reporting.

March 31, 2016 for Parent, including the notes thereto (the referenced financial statements set forth in the Parent 10-K
and in the Parent 10-Q are collectively referred to as the “Parent Financial Statements”). The Parent Financial Statements

jurisdiction solely as a result of such filing. Parent agrees to file the Registration Statement with the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Each of Parent and RRMS agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the

and keep the Registration Statement effective until the earlier of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of Parent

therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement

or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Parent Parties and the RRMS Parties further agrees that, if it shall

material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not false or misleading, it will promptly inform the other party thereof and take the

Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.
(e) Parent shall, as soon as practicable following the effective date of the Registration Statement, establish a record date
for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the “Parent Stockholder Meeting”)
for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stock Issuance Approval. Subject to Section 5.3(f), Parent shall, through the
Parent Board, recommend to its stockholders approval of the Parent Stock Issuance (the “Parent Board
Recommendation”) and shall not (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to RRMS, such recommendation or (ii) fail to include such Parent Board Recommendation in the Parent
Proxy Statement (any such action being referred to herein as a “Parent Adverse Recommendation Change”). Subject to
Section 5.3(f), Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the Parent Stock Issuance
Approval. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of Parent set forth in the first sentence of this
Section 5.3(e) shall not be affected by a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change (other than a Parent
Recommendation Change made in connection with a Parent Designated Proposal). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholder Meeting (i) to solicit additional
proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stock Issuance Approval, (ii) in the absence of a quorum, (iii) if Parent
has delivered any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(f) and the time periods contemplated by Section 5.3(f) have not
expired, or (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure that Parent has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law
and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the stockholders of Parent prior
to the Parent Stockholder Meeting.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stock Issuance
Approval, and subject to compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.3(f), the Parent Board may, if the Parent Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Parent’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure
to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under
applicable Law, make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, however, that no such Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change shall be made in response to a Parent Acquisition Proposal that does not constitute a Parent
Designated Proposal; provided further, however, that the Parent Board may not effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing unless:
(i) Parent has provided prior written notice to RRMS of its intention to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change,
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including, in the case of a Parent Designated Proposal, a
description of the material terms of such Parent Designated Proposal and a copy of any draft definitive agreement
reflecting such Parent Designated Proposal), at least five (5) days in advance of its making a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless at the time such notice is required to be given there are less than five (5) days prior to
the Parent Stockholder Meeting, in which case Parent shall provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable (the
period inclusive of all such days, the “Parent Notice Period”); and
(ii) during the Parent Notice Period the Parent Board has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate,
with RRMS (to the extent RRMS desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the failure to effect such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would not be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the Parent Board’s fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law; provided that any
material amendment
35

to the terms of a Parent Designated Proposal, if applicable, shall require a new notice pursuant to this Section 5.3(f) and a
new Parent Notice Period, except that such new Parent Notice Period in connection with any material amendment shall
be for three (3) days from the time RRMS receives such notice (as opposed to five (5) days).
SECTION 5.4 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances. From and after the Execution Date, upon the terms
and subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and (ii) defend any lawsuits or other Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the
parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing but
subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that, from time to time, whether before, at or after
the Closing Date, each of them will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such instruments of
assignment, transfer, conveyance, endorsement, direction or authorization as may be necessary to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement will require any party hereto to hold separate or make any divestiture not expressly contemplated herein of
any asset or otherwise agree to any restriction on its operations or other condition in order to obtain any consent or
approval or other clearance required by this Agreement.
SECTION 5.5 No Public Announcement. On the Execution Date, Parent and RRMS shall issue a joint press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement and the Merger, which press release shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, RRMS General Partner and the RRMS Conflicts Committee. From and after the Execution Date, neither RRMS nor
Parent shall issue any other press release or make any other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this
Agreement) (other than public announcements at industry road shows and conferences or as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with the NYSE, in which event the party making the
public announcement or press release shall, to the extent practicable, notify Parent and RRMS General Partner in
advance of such public announcement or press release) without the prior approval of Parent and RRMS General Partner,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
SECTION 5.6 Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, and except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, including legal fees, accounting fees,
financial advisory fees and other professional and non-professional fees and expenses, shall be paid by the party hereto
incurring such expenses, except that Parent and RRMS shall each pay for one-half of (a) any filing fees with respect to
the Registration Statement and the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement and (b) the costs of printing
and mailing of the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement.
SECTION 5.7 Regulatory Issues. RRMS and Parent shall cooperate fully with respect to any filing, submission or
communication with a Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Merger. Such cooperation shall include each of
the parties hereto: (i) providing, in the case of oral communications with a Governmental Entity, advance notice of any
such communication and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, an opportunity for the other party to participate;
(ii) providing, in the case of written communications, an opportunity for the other party to comment on any such
communication and provide the other with a final copy of all such communications; and (iii) complying promptly with any
request for information from a Governmental Entity (including an additional request for information and documentary
material), unless directed not to do so by the other party hereto. All cooperation shall be conducted in such a manner so
as to preserve all applicable privileges.

SECTION 5.8 Tax Matters. For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable state, local or
foreign Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the parties agree to treat the Merger (a) with respect to
holders of RRMS Public Units, as a taxable sale of such RRMS Common Units to Parent and (b) with respect to Parent,
as a purchase of RRMS Public Units from the Holders of such RRMS Common Units. The parties will prepare and file all
Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing and will not take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the
course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law
following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other administrative settlement with or final
administrative decision by the relevant Governmental Entity.
SECTION 5.9 D&O Insurance.
(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the RRMS Group Entities to, honor all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination of liability and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) now
existing in favor of the RRMS D&O Indemnified Parties as provided in the Governing Documents of any RRMS Group
Entity, under applicable Delaware Law or otherwise, and shall ensure that the Governing Documents of RRMS and RRMS
General Partner (or their successor entities) shall, for a period of six years following the Effective Time, contain
provisions no less advantageous with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination of liability and
exculpation of their present and former directors, officers, employees and agents than are set forth in the Governing
Documents of RRMS and RRMS General Partner as of the Execution Date.
(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain officers’ and directors’ liability insurance with a
nationally reputable carrier covering each RRMS D&O Indemnified Party who is or at any time prior to the Effective Time
was covered by the existing officers’ and directors’ liability insurance applicable to the RRMS Group Entities (“D&O
Insurance”), on terms no less advantageous to the RRMS D&O Indemnified Parties, as applicable, than such existing
insurance with respect to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether claims,
actions or other Proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time);
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance for the RRMS D&O
Indemnified Parties in excess of 300% of the current annual premium currently paid by the RRMS Group Entities for such
insurance, but shall purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such applicable amount. Parent shall have the
right to cause such coverage to be extended under the applicable D&O Insurance by obtaining a six-year “tail” policy on
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the RRMS D&O Indemnified Parties than the existing D&O Insurance, and
such “tail” policy shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 5.9.
(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for a period of six years and expressly are intended to benefit each of the RRMS D&O
Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification or advancement set
forth in this Section 5.9 are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification and advancement
in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of all such claims. The rights of any RRMS D&O
Indemnified Party under this Section 5.9 shall be in addition to any other rights such RRMS D&O Indemnified Party may
have under the Governing Documents of any RRMS Group Entity or applicable Law.
(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so
that its successors and assigns, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

SECTION 5.10 Dividends and Distributions. After the Execution Date until the Effective Time, each of Parent and RRMS
shall coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of any dividends or distributions in respect of Parent Common
Stock and RRMS Common Units and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties that Holders of RRMS Common Units shall not receive, for any quarter, distributions both in respect of RRMS
Common Units and also dividends in respect of the Parent Common Stock that they receive in exchange therefor in the
Merger, but that they shall receive for any such quarter (exclusive of any dividends received in respect of Parent
Common Stock not received by such Holders in the Merger) either: (a) only distributions in respect of RRMS Common
Units or (b) only dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock that they receive in exchange therefor in the Merger.
SECTION 5.11 Consent to Use of Financial Statements; Financing Cooperation. The RRMS Parties hereby consent to the
Parent Group Entities’ use of and reliance on any audited or unaudited financial statements, including the RRMS
Financial Statements, relating to the RRMS Group Entities reasonably requested by the Parent Parties to be used in any
financing or other activities of the Parent Parties permitted hereby, including any filings that the Parent Parties desire to
make with the SEC. In addition, the RRMS Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts, at the Parent Parties’ sole
cost and expense, to obtain the consents of BDO USA, LLP to the inclusion of the financial statements referenced above
in appropriate filings with the SEC. Prior to the Closing, the RRMS Parties will provide the Parent Parties such
information, and make available such personnel, as the Parent Parties may reasonably request in order to assist any of
the Parent Group Entities in connection with financing activities permitted hereby, including any public offerings to be
registered under the Securities Act or private offerings.
SECTION 5.12 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the RRMS Board and the Parent Board shall take all such
steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispositions of RRMS Common Units (including derivative securities with respect to such RRMS Common Units) or
acquisitions of shares of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such shares Parent
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to RRMS, or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
SECTION 5.13 Conflicts Committee. Prior to the Effective Time, neither any Parent Party nor any RRMS Group Entity
shall, without the consent of the RRMS Conflicts Committee, eliminate the RRMS Conflicts Committee, or revoke or
diminish the authority of the RRMS Conflicts Committee, or remove or cause the removal of any director of the RRMS
Board that is a member of the RRMS Conflicts Committee either as a member of such board or such committee without
the affirmative vote of the members of the RRMS Board, including the affirmative vote of the other member of the RRMS
Conflicts Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.13 shall not apply to the filling in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable Governing Documents of any vacancies caused by the death, incapacity or resignation of
any director.
SECTION 5.14 Performance by the RRMS General Partner. The RRMS General Partner shall cause RRMS and the RRMS
Subsidiaries to comply with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that
actions or inactions by RRMS and the RRMS General Partner and their respective Subsidiaries (other than actions or
inactions by the RRMS Conflicts Committee) shall not be, and not be deemed to be, breaches or violations or failures to
perform by RRMS, the RRMS General Partner or their respective Subsidiaries of any of the provisions of this Agreement
if such action or inaction was or was not taken, as applicable, at the direction of or on the recommendation of Parent or
any Parent Group Entity acting in its capacity as such.

SECTION 7.7 Survival. None of the representations, warranties, agreements, covenants or obligations in this Agreement

those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part
after the Effective Time.
SECTION 7.8 Enforcement of this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that an award of money
damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any party and any such breach would cause the
non-breaching parties irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that prior to the termination of this
Agreement, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the parties, the parties will also
be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and

remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to each of
the parties.
SECTION 7.9 No Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud/Willful Misconduct. The liability of any party under this Article VII
shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other liability that such party may have at law or in equity based on such
party’s (a) fraudulent acts or omissions or (b) willful misconduct. None of the provisions set forth in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be a waiver by or release of any party of any right or remedy that such party may have at law or equity
based on any other party’s fraudulent acts or omissions or willful misconduct nor shall any such provisions limit, or be
deemed to limit, (i) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud or willful misconduct, (ii) the
time period during which a claim for fraud or willful misconduct may be brought, or (iii) the recourse that any such party
may seek against another party with respect to a claim for fraud or willful misconduct. Without limiting the rights of the
Parent Group Entities under this Agreement, the RRMS Parties shall not have any liability for monetary damages for any
breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by the RRMS Parties, and the Parent Parties shall not
have any liability for monetary damages for any breach of Section 5.1(b)(vii).

documents or material made available to the Parent Group Parties or RRMS Group Parties, as applicable, in any “data

the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, prior to the Closing, any provision of
this Agreement may be (a) consented to or waived in writing by the party benefited by the provision or (b) amended or
modified at any time by an agreement in writing by the parties hereto; provided, however, that, in addition to any other
approvals required by the RRMS Parties’ constituent documents or under this Agreement, the foregoing consents,
waivers, amendments or modifications in clauses (a) and (b), and any decision or determination by RRMS to (x) terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, or elect not to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(b)
in the event this Agreement becomes terminable pursuant to Section 7.3(b), or (y) enforce this Agreement (including

decisions or determinations, by any RRMS Party or the RRMS Board, the RRMS Conflicts Committee. No amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto.
The failure of a party to exercise any right or remedy shall not be deemed or constitute a waiver of such right or remedy
in the future. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any
other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided.
SECTION 8.4 Binding Effect; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder, except (i) as provided in Section 5.9
and (ii) for the right of the Holders of RRMS Common Units (other than those subject to the RRMS Restricted Unit
Awards) to receive the Merger Consideration (including any Fractional Share Proceeds and other distributions) after the

Closing shall have occurred). No party hereto may assign, transfer, dispose of or otherwise alienate this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise). Any attempted
assignment, transfer, disposition or alienation in violation of this Agreement shall be null, void and ineffective.

any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Annex B
May 30, 2016
Members of the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Rose Rock Midstream, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Partnership”), proposes to enter
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of the date hereof, among the Partnership,
Rose Rock Midstream GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of the Partnership (“RRMS
GP”),  SemGroup  Corporation,  a  Delaware  corporation  (the  “Parent”),  and  PBMS,  LLC,  a  Delaware  limited  liability
company and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership
surviving the merger as a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Parent (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each
outstanding common unit representing limited partner interests of the Partnership (each, an “RRMS Common Unit”) held
by unitholders other than the Parent and its affiliates shall be converted into the right to receive 0.8136 shares of Class A
Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Parent Common Stock”), of the Parent (the “Exchange Ratio”). The terms
and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement and terms used herein and not defined
shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.
The Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of RRMS GP (the “Committee”) has asked us whether, in our opinion,
as  of  the  date  hereof,  the  Exchange  Ratio  is  fair,  from  a  financial  point  of  view,  to  the  Unaffiliated  Unitholders.  For
purposes of this opinion, the term “Unaffiliated Unitholders” means the holders of outstanding RRMS Common Units,
other than the Parent and its affiliates.
In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
reviewed  certain  publicly-available  historical  operating  and  financial  information  relating  to  the
Parent and the Partnership that we deemed relevant, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March
31, 2016 and certain Current Reports on Form 8-K, in each case as filed with or furnished to the
U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  by  the  Parent  and  the  Partnership  since  January  1,
2016;
reviewed certain non-public historical and projected financial and operating data and assumptions
relating  to  the  Parent  and  the  Partnership  prepared  and  furnished  to  us  by  management  of  the
Parent and the Partnership;
reviewed certain sensitivity cases (the “Sensitivity Cases”) with respect to the projected financial
and operating data and assumptions relating to the Parent which we deemed relevant, including a
sensitivity case with respect to the completion of certain growth projects of the Parent, including the
Maurepas Pipeline, and projected production volumes gathered and processed by the Parent’s Mid-
Con natural gas gathering and processing system;

(iv)
(v)
discussed  the  Sensitivity  Cases  and  assumptions  stated  therein  with  management  of  the  Parent
and the Committee;
discussed the current operations of the Parent and the Partnership and the historical and projected
financial and operating data and assumptions relating to the Parent, including those related to the
Maurepas Pipeline project, and the Partnership with management of the Parent and the Partnership
(including management’s views of the risks and uncertainties of achieving such projections);
(vi)
(vii)
(viii)
(ix)
(x)
reviewed publicly-available research analyst estimates for the Parent’s and the Partnership’s future
financial performance on a standalone basis;
reviewed  the  financial  metrics  of  certain  historical  transactions  that  we  deemed  relevant  and
compared such financial metrics to those implied by the Merger utilizing forecasts and other data
provided by management of the Parent and the Sensitivity Cases based thereon;
compared the trading performance of the Parent and the Partnership utilizing forecasts and other
data provided by management of the Parent and the Sensitivity Cases with the trading performance
(including equity market trading multiples) of public issuers that we deemed relevant;
reviewed  the  premiums  paid  in  certain  historical  transactions  that  we  deemed  relevant  and
compared such premiums to those implied by the Merger;
performed discounted cash flow analyses on the Parent and the Partnership based on forecasts and
other data provided by management of the Parent and the Sensitivity Cases based thereon;
(xi)
reviewed certain commercial agreements relating to certain growth projects of the Parent;
(xii)
reviewed the draft Merger Agreement, dated May 30, 2016; and
(xiii)
performed such other analyses and examinations, reviewed such other information and considered
such other factors that we deemed appropriate.
For  purposes  of  our  analysis  and  opinion,  we  have  assumed  and  relied  upon,  without  undertaking  any  independent
verification  of,  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  all  of  the  information  publicly  available  and  all  of  the  information
supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by us and upon the assurances of the management
of  the  Parent  and  the  Partnership  that  they  are  not  aware  of  any  relevant  information  that  has  been  omitted  or  that
remains undisclosed to us, and we assume no liability therefor. With respect to the projected financial and operating data
relating to the Partnership and the Parent, we have assumed that such data has been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of the Partnership and the
Parent as to the future financial performance of the Partnership and the Parent, as applicable, under the assumptions
stated therein. We took into consideration the financial impact to the Unaffiliated Unitholders of a projected reduction in
the distribution on the RRMS Common Units to $1.60 per unit per annum which was reflected in the projected financial
and operating data

relating to the Partnership prepared and furnished to us by management of the Parent and the Partnership. In addition, at
the  direction  of  the  Committee,  we  reviewed  the  Sensitivity  Cases  and  discussed  such  Sensitivity  Cases  and
assumptions stated therein with management of the Parent and the Committee. We express no view as to the projected
financial and operating data or any judgments, estimates or assumptions on which they are based. With respect to the
estimated  tax  liability  calculations  relating  to  the  Partnership,  we  have  assumed  they  have  been  reasonably  and
accurately prepared by the Partnership and the Parent and their outside advisors.
For  purposes  of  rendering  our  opinion,  we  have  assumed,  in  all  respects  material  to  our  analysis,  that  the  Merger
Agreement will be executed and delivered (in the draft form reviewed by us), that the representations and warranties of
each  party  contained  in  the  Merger  Agreement  (in  the  draft  form  reviewed  by  us)  are  true  and  correct  in  all  material
respects,  that  each  party  will  perform  all  of  the  covenants  and  agreements  required  to  be  performed  by  it  under  the
Merger Agreement and applicable law and governing documents of each of the Partnership and the Parent, including,
but not limited to, the cancellation and retirement of any RRMS Units owned by RRMS (collectively, the “Merger Related
Actions”),  and  that  all  conditions  to  the  consummation  of  the  Merger,  including  the  Merger  Related  Actions  and
transactions related to the Merger Agreement, will be satisfied without material waiver or modification thereof. We have
further  assumed,  with  your  consent,  that  the  Merger  and  transactions  related  to  the  Merger  Agreement  will  be
consummated in accordance with their terms, without waiver, modification or further amendment of any material term,
condition or agreement and that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the
consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would
have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  Partnership,  the  Parent  or  the  consummation  of  the  Merger,  or  materially  reduce  the
benefits of the Merger to the Partnership or the Parent.
We have not made nor assumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities of the Partnership or the Parent, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals, nor have we evaluated
the  solvency  or  fair  value  of  the  Partnership  or  the  Parent  under  any  state  or  federal  laws  relating  to  bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to us as of the date
hereof and financial, economic, monetary, market, regulatory and other conditions and circumstances as they exist and
as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that
we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We  have  not  been  asked  to  pass  upon,  and  express  no  opinion  with  respect  to,  any  matter  other  than  whether  the
Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Unaffiliated Unitholders. We do not express any view on, and
our opinion does not address, the fairness of the Merger to any other persons or the holders of any other securities,
creditors  or  other  constituencies  of  the  Partnership,  nor  any  view  as  to  the  fairness  of  the  amount  or  nature  of  any
compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Partnership or any of the other
parties  to  the  Merger  Agreement  or  any  affiliates  thereof,  or  any  classes  of  such  persons,  whether  relative  to  the
Exchange Ratio or otherwise. We have assumed that any modification to the structure of the Merger will not vary in any
respect material to our analysis. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other
business  or  financial  strategies  that  might  be  available  to  the  Partnership  or  the  Parent,  nor  does  it  address  the
underlying  business  decision  of  the  Partnership  to  engage  in  the  Merger.  This  letter,  and  our  opinion,  does  not
constitute a recommendation to the Committee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger. We express no opinion
herein as to the price at which the RRMS Common Units or Parent Common Stock will trade at any time. We ate not legal,
regulatory,  accounting  or  tax  experts  and  have  assumed  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  assessments  by  the
management of the Partnership and their advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.

We  received  an  initial  fee  for  our  services  and  will  receive  an  additional  fee  upon  the  rendering  of  this  opinion.  The
Partnership has also agreed to reimburse our expenses and to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our
engagement. In September 2015, we provided financial advisory services to the Committee with respect to a transaction
that  was  not  entered  into  for  which  we  received  a  fee  and  reimbursement  of  expenses.  In  June  2014,  we  provided
financial advisory services to the Committee with respect to a contribution of interests in SemCrude Pipeline, L.L.C. to
the Partnership by the Parent for which we received a fee and reimbursement of expenses. Except as described above,
during the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed between Evercore Group L.L.C. and
its affiliates and the Partnership, the Parent or any of their respective affiliates, pursuant to which compensation was
received by Evercore Group L.L.C. or its affiliates as a result of such a relationship. We may provide financial or other
services to the Partnership, the Parent or their respective affiliates in the future and in connection with any such services
we may receive compensation.
In the ordinary course of business, Evercore Group L.L.C. or its affiliates may actively trade the securities, or related
derivative securities, or financial instruments of the Partnership and the Patent and their respective affiliates for its own
account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such
securities or instruments.
This letter, and the opinion expressed herein is addressed to, and is for the information and benefit of, the Committee in
connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of this opinion has been approved by an opinion
committee of Evercore Group L.L.C.
This opinion may not be disclosed, quoted, referred to or communicated (in whole or in part) to, or relied upon by, any
third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval in each instance or in accordance with the
terms of the engagement letter, dated April 19, 2016, among the Partnership, the Committee and Evercore Group L.L.C.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the Unaffiliated Unitholders.
Very truly yours,
EVERCORE GROUP L.L.C.

Board of Directors
SemGroup Corporation
6120 South Yale Avenue, Suite 700
Tulsa, OK 74136
Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that SemGroup Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), intends to enter into a transaction
(the “Proposed Transaction”) with Rose Rock Midstream, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership that is majority owned by
the Company (“RRMS”) pursuant to which, among other things, PBMS, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of the Company
(“Merger Sub”), will merge with and into RRMS (the “Merger”). We further understand that, upon the effectiveness of the
Merger, (i) the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and RRMS will continue as the surviving limited partnership
in the Merger, and (ii) each Common Unit (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership of RRMS, dated December 14, 2011) of RRMS (“RRMS Common Unit”) (other than (1) the RRMS Restricted
Unit Awards (as defined in the Agreement (as defined below)) and (2) RRMS Common Units owned by the Company,
Merger Sub, any Parent Subsidiaries (as defined in the Agreement) or RRMS) outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.8136 (the “Exchange Ratio”) of a share of Class A
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”). The terms and conditions
of the Proposed Transaction are set forth in more detail in the Agreement and Plan of Merger to be entered into by and
among the Company, Merger Sub, RRMS, and Rose Rock Midstream GP, LLC (the “Agreement”). The summary of the
Proposed Transaction set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Agreement.
We have been requested by the Board of Directors of the Company to render our opinion with respect to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to the Company of the Exchange Ratio to be paid by the Company in the Proposed
Transaction. We have not been requested to opine as to, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the
Company’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the Proposed Transaction or the likelihood of
consummation of the Proposed Transaction. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Proposed
Transaction as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the Company might engage. In addition,
we express no opinion on, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or the nature of
any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Proposed Transaction, or any class of
such persons, relative to the Exchange Ratio to be paid in the Proposed Transaction or otherwise.
In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed and analyzed: (1) a draft of the Agreement, dated as of May 30, 2016, and the
specific terms of the Proposed Transaction; (2) publicly available information concerning the Company and RRMS that
we believe to be relevant to our analysis, including each of the Company’s and RRMS’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and each of the Company’s and RRMS’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016; (3) financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and
prospects of the Company and RRMS furnished to us by the Company, including financial projections of the Company
and RRMS (which projections included forecasted dividend policies of the Company, forecasted distribution policies of
RRMS, and financing assumptions for both the Company and RRMS) and an estimate of the Company’s tax position
beyond the period of the financial projections, prepared by management of the Company; (4) the pro forma impact of the
Proposed Transaction on the future financial performance of the combined company, including cost of capital and credit
Table of Contents
Page 2 of 3
rating implications and other financial impacts expected by the management of the Company to result from the
Proposed Transaction (collectively, the “Expected Impacts”), as well as the amount of time that management of the
Company anticipates will be needed for the combined company to realize such Expected Impacts; (5) a trading history of
the Company Common Stock and the RRMS Common Units from May 27, 2013 to May 27, 2016 and a comparison of that
trading history with those of other companies that we deemed relevant; (6) a comparison of the present financial
condition of the Company and RRMS with each other and with those of other companies that we deemed relevant; (7) a
comparison of the financial terms of the Proposed Transaction with the financial terms of certain other transactions that
we deemed relevant; and (8) published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future financial
performance and price targets of the Company and RRMS. In addition, we have had discussions with the management of
the Company concerning the respective business, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects of the
Company and RRMS, and have undertaken such other studies, analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other
information used by us without any independent verification of such information (and have not assumed responsibility
or liability for any independent verification of such information) and have further relied upon the assurances of the
management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information
inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the financial projections of the Company and RRMS, upon the advice of the
Company, we have assumed that such projections have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the future financial performance
of the Company and RRMS and that the Company and RRMS will perform substantially in accordance with such
projections. Furthermore, upon the advice of the Company, we have assumed that the amounts and timing of the
Expected Impacts are reasonable and that the Expected Impacts will be realized in accordance with such estimates. We
assume no responsibility for and we express no view as to any such projections or estimates (including the Expected
Impacts) or the assumptions on which they are based. In arriving at our opinion, we have not conducted a physical
inspection of the properties and facilities of the Company or RRMS and have not made or obtained any evaluations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company or RRMS. Our opinion necessarily is based upon market, economic
and other conditions as they exist on, and can be evaluated as of, the date of this letter. We assume no responsibility for
updating or revising our opinion based on events or circumstances that may occur after the date of this letter. We
express no opinion as to (i) the prices at which the shares of Company Common Stock or RRMS Common Units would
trade following the announcement of the Proposed Transaction or at which price the shares of Company Common Stock
would trade at any time following the consummation of the Proposed Transaction; (ii) the credit rating of the Company at
any time following the announcement or consummation of the Proposed Transaction; or (iii) any determination of the
dividend policy of the Company at any time following the consummation of the Proposed Transaction.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion as of the date hereof that, from a financial point of view,
the Exchange Ratio to be paid by the Company in the Proposed Transaction is fair to the Company.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Proposed Transaction and will receive a fee
for our services payable upon rendering this opinion. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses

INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS
Item 20.
Indemnification of Officers and Directors of SemGroup
Section 145 of the DGCL grants SemGroup the authority to indemnify each of its directors and officers against all
expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by a director or officer that is made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (whether
civil, criminal or otherwise), by reason of the fact that such director or officer is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of SemGroup or by reason of the fact that such director or officer, at SemGroup’s request, is or was serving at any
other corporation or other entity, in any capacity, if such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he or she
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, SemGroup’s best interests, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful; provided, that in the case of an
action, suit or proceeding against a director or officer that is brought by SemGroup or in its right, SemGroup may
indemnify such director or officer only in respect of expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably
incurred by such director or officer; provided further, that no such indemnity for expenses may be made with respect to
any claim, issue or matter as to which such director or officer shall have been adjudged to be liable to SemGroup unless,
and only to the extent that, either the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which the action, suit or
proceeding against such director or officer was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication
of liability to SemGroup but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such director or officer is nevertheless fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity from SemGroup for such expenses in an amount deemed proper by such court.
Unless ordered by a court, the determination of whether a then-sitting director or officer has met the applicable standard
for indemnity, i.e., that the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in,
or not opposed to, SemGroup’s best interests, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful, shall be made (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not
parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, (ii) by a committee of such directors
designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, (iii) if there are no such directors, or if
such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by SemGroup’s stockholders.
Section 145 of the DGCL also authorizes SemGroup to advance expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by a
director or officer in defending any action, suit or proceeding against the director or officer prior to a determination of
whether the director or officer is actually entitled to indemnity and to purchase insurance for the benefit of a director or
officer against any liability that may be incurred by reason of the fact that the insured was or is a director or officer,
regardless of whether the liability insured could have legally been indemnified by SemGroup.
Pursuant to the authority granted to SemGroup by Section 145 of the DGCL, SemGroup has provided in the SemGroup
Amended and Restated Certificate and the SemGroup Amended and Restated Bylaws for the indemnification of and
advancement of expenses to its directors to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law as from time to time in
effect; provided, however, SemGroup is required to indemnify, or advance expenses to, any such director in connection
with an action, suit, claim or proceeding initiated by such director only if the initiation of such action, suit, claim or
proceeding has been authorized or ratified by the SemGroup Board. The SemGroup Amended and Restated Bylaws
provide that it may, to the extent authorized by the SemGroup Board, grant rights of indemnification and the
advancement of expenses (including attorney’s fees) to SemGroup’s officers. The SemGroup Board has authorized
indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, SemGroup’s officers serving as such on or after December 1, 2009.
The rights authorized by the SemGroup Board for the indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, SemGroup’s
officers serving as such on or after December 1, 2009 are the same rights that have been afforded SemGroup’s directors
pursuant to the SemGroup Amended and Restated Certificate and the SemGroup Amended and Restated Bylaws.

The employment agreement among SemGroup, SemManagement, L.L.C., SemGroup’s wholly owned subsidiary, Rose
Rock General Partner, and Carlin G. Conner, SemGroup’s President and Chief Executive Officer, provides Mr. Conner
with indemnification and advancement of expenses (including attorney’s fees) to the maximum extent permitted by the
SemGroup Amended and Restated Certificate and the SemGroup Amended and Restated Bylaws, including, if
applicable, any directors and officers insurance policies, provided such indemnification shall be on terms no less
favorable than provided to any of SemGroup’s other executive officers or directors. Pursuant to the employment
agreement, SemGroup has also agreed to maintain commercially reasonable directors’ and officers’ insurance covering
Mr. Conner in such amount and pursuant to such terms as is typical and customary for companies of similar size and
nature to SemGroup.
SemGroup has also purchased a policy of insurance for the benefit of its directors and officers that provides standard
liability coverage.
As permitted by Section 102 of the DGCL, the SemGroup Amended and Restated Certificate provides that each of its
directors shall not be personally liable to SemGroup or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director; provided, however, that a director shall be liable for any breach of such director’s duty of loyalty to
SemGroup or its stockholders, for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, for liability under Section 174 of the DGCL (involving certain unlawful dividends or stock
repurchases), or for any transaction from which such director derived an improper personal benefit.

Exhibits
A list of exhibits filed as part of this registration statement is set forth in the Exhibit Index, which is incorporated herein

Item 22.
Undertakings.
(a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes
(i) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration
statement:
a)
To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;
b)
To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most
recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the
information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of
securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any
deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus
filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price
represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of
Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement;
c)
To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration
statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.
(ii) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall
be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities
at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
(iii) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which
remain unsold at the termination of the offering.
Table of Contents
II-2
(iv) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser, each prospectus filed
pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements
relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and
included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no
statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document
incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the
registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify
any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or
made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.
(v) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial
distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the
undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the
securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following
communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such
securities to such purchaser:
a)
b)
c)
Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed
pursuant to Rule 424;
Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or
referred to by the undersigned registrant;
The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the
undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and
d)
Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.
(vi) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the registrant’s annual report
pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit
plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in the registration
statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of
such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
(vii) That prior to any public reoffering of the securities registered hereunder through use of a prospectus which is a part
of this registration statement, by any person or party who is deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Rule
145(c) of the Securities Act, the issuer undertakes that such reoffering prospectus will contain the information called for
by the applicable registration form with respect to reofferings by persons who may be deemed underwriters, in addition
to the information called for by the other Items of the applicable form.
(viii) That every prospectus (i) that is filed pursuant to the paragraph immediately preceding, or (ii) that purports to meet
the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act and is used in connection with an offering of securities subject
to Rule 415 of the Securities Act, will be filed as a part of an amendment to the registration statement and will not be used
until such amendment is effective, and that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such
post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein,
and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
(b)
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling
persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the
opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification

II-3
against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,
officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its
counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question
whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the
final adjudication of such issue.
(c) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond to requests for information that is incorporated by reference into
the prospectus pursuant to Item 4, 10(b), 11, or 13 of this Form, within one business day of receipt of such request, and to
send the incorporated documents by first class mail or other equally prompt means. This includes information contained in
documents filed subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement through the date of responding to the request.
(d) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply by means of a post-effective amendment all information concerning
a transaction, and the company being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of and included in the registration
statement when it became effective.
