<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of the Gambia, the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns, conducted a joint official 
</p>
<p>visit to the country with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment, Juan E. Mendez.1. The visit took place from 3 to 7 
</p>
<p>November 2014. It was originally scheduled for August 2014, but was postponed by the 
</p>
<p>Government at the last minute for reasons still unknown. The Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions thanks the Government of the Gambia for 
</p>
<p>extending the invitation to visit the country, as well as all officials with whom he met. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, he wishes to thank the United Nations country team and, in particular, the 
</p>
<p>Resident Coordinator, for their logistical support. The Special Rapporteur is also especially 
</p>
<p>grateful to the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (OHCHR) West Africa Regional Office for their invaluable support in preparing for 
</p>
<p>and carrying out the visit. 
</p>
<p>2. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the Vice-President of the Gambia, 
</p>
<p>the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Interior, the Minister of Justice, officials of 
</p>
<p>the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Solicitor General and the Office of the 
</p>
<p>Director of Public Prosecutions, the Director General of the National Intelligence Agency, 
</p>
<p>the Director General of the National Drug Enforcement Agency, the Director General of 
</p>
<p>Prisons, the Inspector General of Police, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and High 
</p>
<p>Court Justices, the Prison Visiting Committee and the Office of the Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>Additional meetings were held with the United Nations country team, the diplomatic 
</p>
<p>community and civil society. In preparation for the visit, the Special Rapporteur met in 
</p>
<p>Senegal with staff of the OHCHR West Africa Regional Office, and with representatives of 
</p>
<p>the international community and of the Gambian community in exile. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions expresses regret that the 
</p>
<p>President of the Gambia was not available for a meeting with the two Special Rapporteurs 
</p>
<p>during their stay in Banjul. 
</p>
<p>3. As is the case for all country missions, the Special Rapporteurs had requested 
</p>
<p>authorization, in advance, in accordance with the terms of reference for fact-finding 
</p>
<p>missions by Special Rapporteurs, which apply to all country visits in all parts of the world 
</p>
<p>and which, among other things, include guarantees concerning &#8220;access to all prisons, 
</p>
<p>detention centres and places of interrogation&#8221;, &#8220;confidential and unsupervised contact with 
</p>
<p>witnesses and other private persons, including persons deprived of their liberty&#8221;, and 
</p>
<p>protection from reprisals.2 Such authorization was granted by the Government in a letter 
</p>
<p>dated 27 October 2014 and was reiterated in a meeting with the Government at the outset of 
</p>
<p>the visit. 
</p>
<p>4. Notwithstanding, when they commenced their visits to prisons, the Government 
</p>
<p>denied the Special Rapporteurs in-situ access to the security wing in Mile 2 Prison and 
</p>
<p>insisted on having prison personnel accompany them during the inspection. The Vice-
</p>
<p>President and other Government representatives, in a meeting held with the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteurs where the latter protested against this exclusion, made it clear that they did not 
</p>
<p>have the power to rule otherwise, and that the Special Rapporteurs would not be allowed 
</p>
<p>into the security sections of the prisons in the country. This breach of the terms of reference 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The Special Rapporteur on the question of torture presented his report (A/HRC/28/68/Add.4) to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council at its twenty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p> 2 E/CN.4/1998/45, appendix V.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 </b> 
</p>
<p>forced the Special Rapporteurs to suspend visits to prisons altogether. The notion of 
</p>
<p>departing from the principle of unrestricted access in one country but not in others would 
</p>
<p>have displayed double standards, created a dangerous precedent for the future and 
</p>
<p>undermined the mandate entrusted to the Special Rapporteurs by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council. At the same time, it was too late to abandon the visit altogether. Although it was 
</p>
<p>concluded, the visit cannot be viewed as full-fledged. The Special Rapporteur notes that, 
</p>
<p>owing to the Government&#8217;s refusal to allow unrestricted access to detention centres, an 
</p>
<p>inference must be drawn that there is something there to hide.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>5. The present report focuses on the situation as it was during the visit, although some 
</p>
<p>references are made to subsequent developments, including the attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of 
</p>
<p>30 December 2014 and its reverberations. The report was sent to the Government for 
</p>
<p>comments on 19 March 2015 and was completed on 5 May 2015. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background 
</b></p>
<p>6. In 1994, a military coup installed Yahya Jammeh as President. A nominal return to 
</p>
<p>civilian rule took place two years later, when a new constitution was established and 
</p>
<p>presidential elections were held. Mr. Jammeh has been re-elected in all subsequent 
</p>
<p>elections3 and has since kept a strong grip on public and private affairs in the country. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur perceived a high degree of personalization of State practice and of 
</p>
<p>decision-making power in the figure of the President.  
</p>
<p>7. The Cabinet is appointed by the Head of State and appears to undergo continuous 
</p>
<p>shuffling. Legislative power is vested in the unicameral National Assembly; opposition 
</p>
<p>groups are insufficiently represented to be able to exert influence on the Assembly&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>decisions. The judicial system includes the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High 
</p>
<p>Court, the Special Criminal Court and several lower courts. Judges are appointed by the 
</p>
<p>President after consultation with the Judicial Service Commission and are granted life 
</p>
<p>tenure. In practice, however, judges have frequently been removed without explanation, and 
</p>
<p>their appointments have been heavily criticized for lack of independence and transparency.4  
</p>
<p>8. Economic development remains a challenge in the Gambia, with high poverty and 
</p>
<p>unemployment rates and heavy reliance on foreign aid. The European Union is the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s biggest development assistance partner. However in December 2014, it cut off 
</p>
<p>&#8364;13 million of funding, and threatened to block another &#8364;150 million in response to the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s poor human rights record.5 In turn, the Gambia has recently turned to donor 
</p>
<p>countries in the Gulf. 
</p>
<p>9. On 30 December 2014, military and ex-military officers in the Gambia attempted to 
</p>
<p>stage a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, but were repelled by forces loyal to the President. Three alleged plotters 
</p>
<p>were killed during the attacks and one was injured and captured. Up to 30 persons, 
</p>
<p>including family members of insurgents, have been arrested and been held in 
</p>
<p>incommunicado detention, with some being subjected to torture. Only 10 were reportedly 
</p>
<p>released. The President proceeded to replace key members of the Cabinet following these 
</p>
<p>events, including the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. At a court 
</p>
<p>martial held on 30 March 2015, three persons were sentenced to death and three to life 
</p>
<p>imprisonment for their alleged involvement in the failed coup. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 In 2011, ECOWAS stated that the environment was unconducive to the conduct of free and fair 
</p>
<p>elections. See http://news.ecowas.int/presseshow.php?nb=234&amp;lang=en&amp;annee=2011. 
</p>
<p> 4 International Bar Association, &#8220;Under pressure: a report on the rule of law in Gambia&#8221; (August 2006). 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Human rights overview 
</b></p>
<p>10. The country is characterized by disregard for the rule of law, infringements of civil 
</p>
<p>liberties and the existence of a repressive State apparatus. State institutions are weak and 
</p>
<p>under the influence and control of the executive power, namely the President. Transparency 
</p>
<p>and accountability in public affairs are scarce and there are no independent institutions or 
</p>
<p>processes to channel alternative voices or social demands. The activities of civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations are closely monitored by the executive. The Special Rapporteur encountered 
</p>
<p>many manifestations of fear and frustration in civil society, with reports of rampant State-
</p>
<p>led violence, persecution of the media and critical voices, and impunity for human rights 
</p>
<p>violations. Human rights concerns also include interference with the independence of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary, denial of due process, prolonged pretrial and incommunicado detention, poor 
</p>
<p>prison conditions, persecution of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons, 
</p>
<p>and tolerance of the practice of female genital mutilation. It appears that, at best, the State, 
</p>
<p>for strategic reasons, occasionally pays lip service to human rights, but otherwise pursues 
</p>
<p>the narrow interests of power and political survival. Human rights protection is largely an 
</p>
<p>illusion. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Constitution of the Gambia, approved by referendum, entered into force on 
</p>
<p>16 January 1997. Chapter IV of the Constitution provides for the protection of fundamental 
</p>
<p>rights and freedoms. The right to life is established therein as a fundamental human right 
</p>
<p>from which no derogation is permitted, even at a time of public emergency that threatens 
</p>
<p>the life of the nation.6 Despite these constitutional guarantees, compliance is deficient and 
</p>
<p>many fundamental rights are routinely violated.  
</p>
<p>12. Moreover, in recent years, the Government has adopted legislation that infringes 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards, such as (a) the Indemnity Act of 2001, which gives 
</p>
<p>the President the power to indemnify law enforcement officials for abuse of force during 
</p>
<p>situations of public emergency, unlawful assembly, public disturbance or rioting; (b) the 
</p>
<p>Information and Communication Act of 2013, which creates several new offences and 
</p>
<p>imposes harsher penalties for online activity deemed critical of the Government; (c) a series 
</p>
<p>of amendments to the Criminal Code, which broaden definitions and impose harsher 
</p>
<p>penalties for various offences, such as sedition, libel, public disorder, or giving false 
</p>
<p>information; and (d) the Criminal Code (Amendment) Acts of 2005 and of 2014, sections 
</p>
<p>144 and 147, on &#8220;carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature&#8230; and any 
</p>
<p>other homosexual act&#8221; and on &#8220;aggravated homosexuality&#8221;, which criminalize sexual 
</p>
<p>activities between consenting adults. 
</p>
<p>13. The legal system of the Gambia requires the domestication of international treaties 
</p>
<p>before they can be enforced by national courts. At the international and regional level, the 
</p>
<p>Gambia has ratified several human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights and its First Optional Protocol, and the African Charter on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. However, the country is yet to ratify a number of international 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments, including the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, the  
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention for the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 A/HRC/WG.6/7/GMB/1, p. 3. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 </b> 
</p>
<p>Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities, and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
</p>
<p>of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. According to information 
</p>
<p>provided by the United Nations country team, the Government has indicated that some of 
</p>
<p>those treaties, including the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities have been ratified by the National 
</p>
<p>Assembly but the instruments have not been deposited with the Secretary-General of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations.7 When asked about such ratifications, the Special Rapporteur encountered 
</p>
<p>confusing answers from State authorities, who seemed to be unaware of or insufficiently 
</p>
<p>informed about the process and the current status of ratifications. Along with inadequate 
</p>
<p>information management processes, Cabinet shuffles are arguably responsible for this, as 
</p>
<p>the heads of key ministries such as justice and foreign affairs have changed continuously in 
</p>
<p>recent years, resulting in a lack of institutional memory. The Special Rapporteur would like 
</p>
<p>to take this opportunity to repeat the question to the Government: have these treaties been 
</p>
<p>ratified?  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Cooperation with international and regional organizations 
</b></p>
<p>14. The country&#8217;s cooperation with the United Nations human rights machinery has 
</p>
<p>been limited. This was the first-ever visit to the country by a special procedures mandate 
</p>
<p>holder of the Human Rights Council. Of the 14 communications sent by special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders since 2007, none has received a substantive response from the 
</p>
<p>Government. The Gambia has submitted overdue reports to some treaty bodies and has 
</p>
<p>failed to submit reports to others. The country has been reviewed twice under the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review, in 2010 and 2014. The Government has failed to implement many of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the first review, and rejected 78 of the 171 recommendations of the 
</p>
<p>second review, including on the maintenance of the moratorium on executions and the 
</p>
<p>abolition of the death penalty, and on cooperation with special procedures.8 
</p>
<p>15. At the regional level, the Gambia has accepted the jurisdiction of the Economic 
</p>
<p>Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Community Court of Justice but has not 
</p>
<p>accepted the competence of the African Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. The 
</p>
<p>ECOWAS Community Court of Justice has ruled three times against the Government of the 
</p>
<p>Gambia. The Government has failed to implement those decisions, as well as a series of 
</p>
<p>resolutions issued by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
</p>
<p>16. The headquarters of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights are, for 
</p>
<p>historical reasons, based in the Gambia. The Commission has an important role to play in 
</p>
<p>the protection of human rights in general, and the right to life in particular. To what extent 
</p>
<p>the location of the Commission in the Gambia is conducive to that goal is uncertain. In 
</p>
<p>2009, the Commission understandably called on the African Union to consider relocating 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 See A/HRC/WG.6/20/GMB/2, p. 3. At the 2014 universal periodic review, the Gambian delegation 
</p>
<p>stated that the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment and its Optional Protocol had been accepted by the National Assembly and were in the 
</p>
<p>process of ratification; see A/HRC/28/6, para. 92.  
</p>
<p> 8 The Gambia also rejected recommendations concerning the ratification of the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the non-criminalization of 
</p>
<p>sexual orientation or gender identity, and the removal of restrictions on freedom of expression. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>its secretariat, following a highly inappropriate public statement by Mr. Jammeh 
</p>
<p>threatening to kill human rights defenders and their supporters.9 
</p>
<p>17. In general, it can be said that the Gambia shows little regard for the international 
</p>
<p>bodies to which it belongs &#8212; whether those are United Nations or African structures. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Main challenges encountered 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>18. The death penalty was abolished in the Gambia in 1993 but was reinstated by the 
</p>
<p>administration of Mr. Jammeh in 1995, which argued that since its abolition there had been 
</p>
<p>a steady increase in homicides and treasonable offences.10 The 1997 Constitution mandates 
</p>
<p>the National Assembly to review the desirability of the death penalty 10 years after its entry 
</p>
<p>into force, with a view to its possible total abolition.11 The review should have taken place 
</p>
<p>in 2007 and is now eight years overdue; this appears to have been a hollow promise. 
</p>
<p>19. According to article 18 (2) of the 1997 Constitution, &#8220;no court in the Gambia shall 
</p>
<p>be competent to impose a sentence of death for any offence unless the sentence is 
</p>
<p>prescribed by law and the offence involves violence, or the administration of any toxic 
</p>
<p>substance, resulting in the death of another person&#8221;. On face value, this appears to be in line 
</p>
<p>with the international standard relating to the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, according to which the 
</p>
<p>scope of the crimes punishable by death should not go beyond intentional crimes with lethal 
</p>
<p>or other extremely grave consequences.12 The reality, however, is different. 
</p>
<p>20. A review of Gambian law shows that the Criminal Code,13 the Gambia Armed 
</p>
<p>Forces Act14 and the Anti-Terrorism Act15 set out a number of offences that are punishable 
</p>
<p>by death, including treason, murder, aiding the enemy, offences by persons in command 
</p>
<p>when in action, offences relating to security, offences relating to prisoners of war, offences 
</p>
<p>relating to convoys, mutiny with violence, and acts of terrorism. These offences do not 
</p>
<p>intrinsically entail the killing of another person, much less an intentional killing.  
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur expressed publicly his concern16 that in October 2012 the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court had upheld the death penalty for treason in the constitutional challenge 
</p>
<p>brought by Lieutenant General Lang Tombong Tamba and his co-defendants; it had argued 
</p>
<p>that article 18 (2) envisaged the death penalty for all crimes involving &#8220;violence&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>understood to include attempted violence or violence that did not result in death.17 The 
</p>
<p>problems of this interpretation under international human rights norms are clear (see 
</p>
<p>para. 19 above), but a plain reading of article 18 (2) also shows that it requires violence or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 See http://www.achpr.org/press/2009/10/d71/. On 29 September 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a 
</p>
<p>joint urgent appeal concerning the speech, but did not receive a response from the Government.

</p>
<p>the administration of a substance &#8220;resulting in the death of another person&#8221;, not merely with 
</p>
<p>the potential of resulting in the death of another person. The Special Rapporteur is pleased 
</p>
<p>to learn that, on 12 November 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed and commuted 
</p>
<p>the death sentences of Lang Tombong Tamba and his co-defendants to life imprisonment.18 
</p>
<p>22. Following the attempted coup of December 2014, seven people stood trial at a court 
</p>
<p>martial on charges of treason, conspiracy, mutiny and assisting the enemy.19 Three persons 
</p>
<p>were sentenced to death (Lieutenant Colonel Sarjo Jarju, Private Modou Njie and 
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Buba Sanneh) and three were sentenced to life imprisonment (Captain Buba 
</p>
<p>Bojang, Lieutenant Amadou Sowe and Captain Amadou Jobe). Notwithstanding legal 
</p>
<p>requirements for court martial hearings to be public, control was reportedly tight and access 
</p>
<p>to the media was banned, giving rise to concerns about the fairness of the trial.20 The 
</p>
<p>Government did not ensure the presence of independent observers, despite a United Nations 
</p>
<p>request in that regard. The accused were reportedly represented at the trial by lawyers sent 
</p>
<p>by the National Agency for Legal Aid. Fear has been expressed that the persons sentenced 
</p>
<p>to death could be executed at short notice, even if they have the right to appeal. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur recalls that the imposition of the death penalty for crimes that are not 
</p>
<p>intentional and do not result in death, or following trials that do not meet the most stringent 
</p>
<p>guarantees of due process, are incompatible with international standards and may constitute 
</p>
<p>an arbitrary execution. Reports also indicate that the accused were detained  
</p>
<p>incommunicado and were subjected to torture while in custody. 
</p>
<p>23. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that, under the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Procedure Code of the Gambia, the death penalty is mandatory for murder (the Government 
</p>
<p>requested that it be noted that it is discretionary under the Gambian Armed Forces Act). 
</p>
<p>A mandatory death penalty, for any offence, is a violation of international human rights law 
</p>
<p>standards, as it prevents judges from considering extenuating circumstances or choosing the 
</p>
<p>imposition of more lenient punishments in individual cases.21 The mandatory death penalty 
</p>
<p>for drug trafficking was abolished in 2011. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur received reports about the inadequate conditions of 
</p>
<p>detention of death row prisoners, who are held in the security wing of Mile 2 Prison in 
</p>
<p>solitary confinement, and in small, dark and poorly ventilated cells. In addition, numerous 
</p>
<p>reports, including from former inmates interviewed by the Special Rapporteur, indicate that 
</p>
<p>they are denied visits from their legal representatives and relatives (an allegation that the 
</p>
<p>Government denies), are not allowed to receive food from them and are only allowed 
</p>
<p>10 minutes of exercise per day.22 
</p>
<p><b> B. Resumption of executions and conditional moratorium  
</b></p>
<p>25. After 27 years of no executions, Mr. Jammeh announced in August 2012 that all 
</p>
<p>existing death sentences would be carried out. On 23 August 2012, nine death row 
</p>
<p>prisoners held at Mile 2 Prison were executed, allegedly by a firing squad. At the time of 
</p>
<p>the executions, there were 47 inmates on death row. According to the available evidence, 
</p>
<p>the death sentences were imposed in violation of major international fair trial standards, 
</p>
<p>including the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; provisions. The following week the executions were

<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>halted, and the remaining prisoners on death row were spared. The only difference between 
</p>
<p>those who lived and those who died seems to be pure luck. The killings were, in other 
</p>
<p>words, arbitrary and thus unlawful. 
</p>
<p>26. This callous treatment of human life shocked the international community and was 
</p>
<p>met with global condemnation, including by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights,23 the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights24 and the 
</p>
<p>European Union.25 The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government and 
</p>
<p>expressed publicly his outrage over the resumption of executions, but did not receive a 
</p>
<p>substantive response from the Government.26  
</p>
<p>27. Reports that were brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur indicate that 
</p>
<p>Malang Sonko, Tabara Samba, Buba Yarboe, Gebe Bah, Lamin Jarju, Alieu Bah and 
</p>
<p>Lamin Jammeh were executed without exhaustion of their legal appeals. Another person 
</p>
<p>who was executed, Dawda Bojang, had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007 but 
</p>
<p>had had his sentence altered to capital punishment in 2010 after he appealed to the High 
</p>
<p>Court. At the time of the execution, he had not exhausted his appeal to the Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>The death sentence of another prisoner, Lamin Darboe, had been commuted to life 
</p>
<p>imprisonment in 1991 and was then reinstated by the Armed Forces Provisional Council in 
</p>
<p>1995 when Gambia restored the death penalty, in violation of the principles of non-
</p>
<p>retroactivity of the law and the right to benefit from a lighter penalty.27 He had not 
</p>
<p>exhausted his legal appeals.  
</p>
<p>28. The Government denies that the nine prisoners were executed pending exhaustion of 
</p>
<p>their appeals, According to information from other sources, none of the cases were brought 
</p>
<p>to the Supreme Court before the executions were carried out, and some did not reach the 
</p>
<p>Court of Appeal. As the Constitution provides that appeals in death penalty cases are 
</p>
<p>automatic,28 the onus was on the authorities to ensure that appeals reached a higher tribunal. 
</p>
<p>If the information obtained is correct, these incidents are in violation of national29 and 
</p>
<p>international norms prescribing that procedural guarantees must be observed before the 
</p>
<p>death penalty can be imposed, including the right to review by a higher tribunal. The 
</p>
<p>Government  could easily prove their version by making records of the court proceedings 
</p>
<p>available. So far they have elected not to do so. The Government is again requested to 
</p>
<p>provide the records. 
</p>
<p>29. Reports further indicate that the trials did not meet other due process safeguards, 
</p>
<p>such as the right to consular assistance. Two Senegalese prisoners &#8212; Tabara Samba and 
</p>
<p>Gebe Bah &#8212; were among those executed, however the Senegalese authorities were not 
</p>
<p>informed prior to the executions.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that one of those executed, Mr. Yarboe, 
</p>
<p>may have had a mental disability, an allegation denied by the Government. International 
</p>
<p>law provisions prohibit the imposition or execution of the death penalty on a person who 
</p>
<p>has any form of intellectual or psychosocial disability.30

<p>31. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern that the executions were 
</p>
<p>carried out in secrecy and without prior notification being provided to the prisoners, their 
</p>
<p>families or their lawyers. According to reports, the Gambian authorities only confirmed the 
</p>
<p>executions several days after they had taken place. This practice runs counter to the general 
</p>
<p>obligation of States not to practise the death penalty in secrecy.31  
</p>
<p>32. In addition, the bodies of those executed were not returned to their families and they 
</p>
<p>were not informed of the place of burial.  
</p>
<p>33. The Prison Visiting Committee, comprised mainly of serving or former government 
</p>
<p>officials, reportedly visited Mile 2 Prison only three months after the executions.  
</p>
<p>34.  In September 2012, a renewed conditional moratorium was put in place, dependent 
</p>
<p>on the rise or fall of the crime rate in the country. The moratorium is obviously to be 
</p>
<p>welcomed, but the precondition is problematic &#8212; the question of whether those on death 
</p>
<p>row will live or die is made contingent upon external developments that are far outside their 
</p>
<p>control.32  
</p>
<p><b> C. Use of force by law enforcement agencies and activities of paramilitary 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups 
</b></p>
<p>35. A repressive State apparatus in the hands of the security forces appears to reign in 
</p>
<p>the Gambia. There is widespread fear in civil society about the unchecked use of force by 
</p>
<p>law enforcement agencies. The security forces, over which the President retains a strong 
</p>
<p>grip, actively repress any sign of discontent, terrorizing civil society and instilling a climate 
</p>
<p>of fear and mistrust via routine arrests, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>executions carried out against anyone considered to be critical of or threatening to the 
</p>
<p>regime. The security forces are also widely perceived to be corrupt and inefficient.33 
</p>
<p>36. The Constitution of the Gambia does not require the existence of an imminent threat 
</p>
<p>of death or serious injury for the use of lethal force, nor does it require that it only be used 
</p>
<p>when it is strictly unavoidable in order to protect life, as prescribed by international law. 
</p>
<p>Conversely, under article 18 (4) of the Constitution, the use of such force is allowed when 
</p>
<p>&#8220;reasonably justifiable&#8221; for the defence of property, &#8220;to effect lawful arrest or prevent the 
</p>
<p>escape of a lawfully detained person&#8221;, &#8220;to prevent criminal offences&#8221;, or in cases of &#8220;riots, 
</p>
<p>insurrection or mutiny&#8221;. Under this provision, deprivation of life for such offences may not 
</p>
<p>be regarded as arbitrary, if reasonably justifiable in the circumstances of the case. This 
</p>
<p>gives law enforcement officials unrestricted power to use lethal force at will, including for 
</p>
<p>minor offences against property, without fearing administrative or legal sanctions. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur notes with concern that this provision sets the threshold for the use of 
</p>
<p>force excessively low and is incompatible with international law norms. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Gambian Police Force 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Gambian Police Force, mandated to maintain law and order in the country, is 
</p>
<p>headed by the Inspector General of the Police and is placed under the authority of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Interior. Police conduct is governed by the Constitution, the 1949 Police Act,34 
</p>
<p>the Criminal Procedure Code and the Public Order Act, among other laws. Additionally, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Interior is currently revising a draft &#8220;Code of Conduct for the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 31 See, for example, A/65/280, para. 72, quoted in A/67/275, para. 99.

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>Interior and Security Services under the purview of the Ministry&#8221;, which will replace the 
</p>
<p>current code. The Special Rapporteur was also provided with a copy of a &#8220;Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Interior Policy Manual on the Use of Force&#8221;, although it is not clear if the document has 
</p>
<p>been adopted or it is still a draft.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the Gambian legislation setting out the 
</p>
<p>constraints and requirements for the use of force by the police is insufficient. The only 
</p>
<p>instrument setting certain conditions for the use of force is the aforementioned manual, 
</p>
<p>which provides a set of guidelines on &#8220;the reasonable&#8221; use of force, reporting structures and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities for cases involving force, and directives for situations requiring medical 
</p>
<p>attention. Although reference is made to an immediate threat to life or serious injuries as 
</p>
<p>one of the factors determining such reasonableness, concern is raised that much emphasis is 
</p>
<p>placed on the officer&#8217;s discretion at the time of the events. While the manual provides for 
</p>
<p>the use of restraining techniques and deadly force in such situations of threat, it does not 
</p>
<p>include directives defining the circumstances, conditions, degree and manner in which such 
</p>
<p>force may be used.  
</p>
<p>39. On the other hand, the new draft code of conduct is addressed to all officials under 
</p>
<p>the authority of the Ministry, not only law enforcement officials. As a result, the code is 
</p>
<p>vague and focuses on internal management and performance issues, rather than on 
</p>
<p>standards for the use of force, except for reference to the obligation to prevent death in 
</p>
<p>custody and to use force that is lawful and proportionate to the threat. More specific 
</p>
<p>guidelines on the conditions for the use of force, training requirements, and internal 
</p>
<p>accountability mechanisms remain to be integrated into the code.  
</p>
<p>40. The existing police training manual does not include human rights issues. The 
</p>
<p>Inspector General of the Police has noted the force&#8217;s aspiration to integrate such training 
</p>
<p>into its curricula. The Special Rapporteur has been informed of discussions with 
</p>
<p>international organizations on the provision of technical assistance in this matter and 
</p>
<p>encourages such an initiative.  
</p>
<p>41. According to Gambian law, the police are required to obtain a warrant before 
</p>
<p>arresting a person,35 and the suspect must be informed of the reason for the arrest within 
</p>
<p>three hours, and be either charged or released within 72 hours.36 However, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has received reports that the police sometimes extend the 72-hour limit on 
</p>
<p>detention without charge and seldom conduct arrests pursuant to a warrant. Other deficient 
</p>
<p>arrest procedures include delays in informing detainees of the charges being laid against 
</p>
<p>them, and delays in facilitating access to lawyers and to family members. Several 
</p>
<p>allegations were made about the police using excessive force against suspects during arrest, 
</p>
<p>interrogation and pretrial detention. With regard to the practice of torture or ill-treatment, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment has indicated that, while in some individual cases ill-treatment does occur in 
</p>
<p>police stations and during arrest or transfer to police stations, he has not found evidence 
</p>
<p>that such abuses are part of a widespread pattern or systemic practice.37 The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions recalls that States are held to 
</p>
<p>a heightened level of diligence in protecting the lives of detainees and must take adequate 
</p>
<p>measures to protect their lives.38 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 35 However, section 15 of the Criminal Procedure Code and other laws allow arrests without a warrant 
</p>
<p>in certain instances.

</p>
<p>42. The Inspector General of the Police confirmed the existence of paramilitary units, 
</p>
<p>which are established as armed wings of the police and are mandated to conduct crowd 
</p>
<p>control during public events, riots or other civil disruptions, as well as to perform other 
</p>
<p>general policing duties for which they are only armed with a truncheon and handcuffs. 
</p>
<p>Likewise, he noted the existence of an anti-terror unit, consisting generally of police 
</p>
<p>officers who perform their duties unarmed. 
</p>
<p>43. The Inspector General also confirmed the existence of a unit within the security 
</p>
<p>forces called the &#8220;Bulldozers&#8221;, which reports to the Inspector General and is headed by the 
</p>
<p>Deputy of the Gambian Police Force. It is an operational task force consisting of agents 
</p>
<p>from different security forces who come together, when required by a particular situation, 
</p>
<p>to perform special tasks, which often entail patrolling and arresting suspects who are later 
</p>
<p>rendered to the relevant departments. It has been criticized for abuses in the conduct of its 
</p>
<p>operations. When launching &#8220;Operation Bulldozer&#8221; in 2012, Mr. Jammeh instructed 
</p>
<p>security forces to &#8220;shoot first and ask questions later&#8221; to rid the country of all criminals.39 
</p>
<p>This message gives security officers the idea that it is permissible to use lethal force as a 
</p>
<p>first resort, which is in stark violation of international standards on the use of force. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. National Intelligence Agency and National Drug Enforcement Agency 
</b></p>
<p>44. The legal constraints on the use of force by the National Intelligence Agency and the 
</p>
<p>National Drug Enforcement Agency are even less clear than those on the police. These 
</p>
<p>agencies fall under the responsibility of the President&#8217;s Office and report directly to him. 
</p>
<p>The National Intelligence Agency is mandated to guard State security, conduct intelligence 
</p>
<p>work and collect intelligence data. Although the Constitution does not provide for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of this agency, the Special Rapporteur was informed that military decrees 
</p>
<p>enacted prior to the adoption of the 1997 Constitution give the National Intelligence 
</p>
<p>Agency broad powers to carry out arrests without charges and to detain individuals 
</p>
<p>indefinitely in the interest of national security. The Special Rapporteur was not able to get 
</p>
<p>hold of a copy of the decrees, and their enforcement was not confirmed or denied by State 
</p>
<p>authorities. Officials interviewed by the Special Rapporteur denied that the National 
</p>
<p>Intelligence Agency assumed police functions of arrest, detention and interrogation, and 
</p>
<p>indicated that such incidents occurred in exceptional cases and until the police could take 
</p>
<p>custody of the suspects. However, the Special Rapporteur received numerous reports to the 
</p>
<p>contrary.  
</p>
<p>45. The aforementioned code of conduct will not govern the conduct of agents of the 
</p>
<p>National Intelligence Agency or the National Drug Enforcement Agency, as these agencies 
</p>
<p>are not under the authority of the Ministry of Interior. Although officials informed of the 
</p>
<p>existence of a code of conduct for the National Intelligence Agency, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>was unable to obtain a copy. The Drug Control Act mandates the National Drug 
</p>
<p>Enforcement Agency to investigate drug trafficking and related crimes, and provides some 
</p>
<p>guidelines on their activities. It seems, however, that the National Drug Enforcement 
</p>
<p>Agency is also de facto invested with broad powers to protect State security, and it is not 
</p>
<p>clear what the constraints are on their powers to use force. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur received alarming reports of persons being detained, 
</p>
<p>tortured, and even disappeared or executed at the hands of the National Intelligence 
</p>
<p>Agency. The reports also indicate that the National Intelligence Agency places arrested 
</p>
<p>suspects in detention facilities within its premises, where persons are held incommunicado 
</p>
<p>without charge for weeks or months before being brought before a judge or the police, are 
</p>
<p>subjected to intense interrogations which routinely include ill-treatment and sometimes 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</b></p>
<p>torture,40 and are denied access to a lawyer or to their families. In most cases, family 
</p>
<p>members are not informed of the detention or the whereabouts of the person concerned. 
</p>
<p>Many of those interviewed told the Special Rapporteur of a place called &#8220;Bambadinka&#8221; in 
</p>
<p>the National Intelligence Agency headquarters, which they say is used for these purposes. 
</p>
<p>In interviews with high-ranking officials of the Agency, the existence of places of detention 
</p>
<p>under Agency jurisdiction was profusely denied.41 Cases of abuse of power, including death 
</p>
<p>in custody, by agents of the National Drug Enforcement Agency have also been reported to 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern about the unchecked and broad 
</p>
<p>powers afforded to the National Intelligence Agency, the National Drug Enforcement 
</p>
<p>Agency and the special units that operate under the umbrella of the Gambian Police Force. 
</p>
<p>The lack of clarity on the rules governing the use of force by law enforcement agencies 
</p>
<p>performing arrest and detention duties provides fertile ground for abuses to take place and 
</p>
<p>is in stark violation of the requirements of international law. In order for abuses not to take 
</p>
<p>place, it is the responsibility of the authorities to establish clear rules, rights and duties for 
</p>
<p>the conduct of all State agents that have law enforcement powers.42 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Prison services 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur received reports of cases of excessive use of force and cases 
</p>
<p>of denial of medical care by prison officials that had occasionally led to deaths in custody, 
</p>
<p>which were not adequately examined by forensic experts due to negligence and a lack of in-
</p>
<p>house forensic expertise.43 The Government did not provide statistics but advised that all 
</p>
<p>deaths in custody were from natural causes. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Paramilitary groups 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur received diverse reports and testimonies about the existence 
</p>
<p>of paramilitary groups in the country associated with the security forces and operating 
</p>
<p>under direct orders of the President. A group reportedly called the &#8220;Jungullars&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Junglers&#8221; was associated in those reports with arbitrary arrests, detention, torture, enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances and extrajudicial killings, of persons opposed to the regime, journalists and 
</p>
<p>ordinary civilians. Such a unit, if it exists, will clearly be unlawful under international law 
</p>
<p>and expose anyone involved in it to criminal prosecution. A judicial commission should 
</p>
<p>investigate the very serious allegations in this regard.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur has also received reports about another group called the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Green Boys&#8221;, made up of young activists supporting the ruling party and accused, among 
</p>
<p>other things, of taking part in a witch-hunting campaign against hundreds of villagers in 
</p>
<p>2009. In its discussions with the Special Rapporteur, State officials denied the armed 
</p>
<p>character of the Green Boys, indicating that they were a political group. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur recalls that there is a positive obligation on the State of the 
</p>
<p>Gambia to ensure the protection of persons under its jurisdiction against violations by 
</p>
<p>private persons or entities. The authorities must exercise due diligence to prevent, 
</p>
<p>investigate, punish and redress the harm caused by non-State actors, and to bring the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators to justice (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, paras. 8 and 18).

<p><b> D. Impunity for extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur received reports of rampant impunity for extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>executions and unlawful killings against those who are deemed to be opponents or a threat 
</p>
<p>to the regime. 
</p>
<p>53. Emblematic cases, such as the killing of Deyda Hydara, editor of <i>The Point 
</i></p>
<p><i>Newspaper</i> and president of the Gambia Press Union, remain unresolved. Mr. Hydara was 
</p>
<p>shot dead in his car in 2004 following the adoption of controversial legislation that he had 
</p>
<p>opposed. The ECOWAS Court of Justice found that the Government had failed to conduct 
</p>
<p>a diligent investigation into the case and ordered the payment of compensation to 
</p>
<p>Mr. Hydara&#8217;s family.44 The ruling has not yet been complied with. 
</p>
<p>54. The Government has also failed to investigate the death of 50 foreign nationals, 
</p>
<p>including 44 Ghanaians, intercepted by security forces in the Gambia on suspicion of 
</p>
<p>planning to overthrow the Government. Reports indicate that the victims were migrants 
</p>
<p>attempting to take a vessel to Europe. A 2009 fact-finding mission by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>and ECOWAS, established to investigate the case, determined the responsibility of rogue 
</p>
<p>security officers for these deaths,45 however the Government failed to prosecute them.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur received distressing reports about the secret detention in 
</p>
<p>2009 of over 1,000 residents of the Foni Kansala district as part of a witch-hunting 
</p>
<p>campaign supported by members of the President&#8217;s personal guard, the Green Boys, the 
</p>
<p>Gambian Police Force, the National Intelligence Agency, and soldiers. The &#8220;witch hunters&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>reportedly brought in by the President, forced the villagers to drink a herbal concoction and 
</p>
<p>confess to &#8220;witchcraft&#8221;, leading to six deaths from kidney failure. No one was brought to 
</p>
<p>justice for the incident, and one opposition leader who exposed the case was charged with 
</p>
<p>treason and was held in Mile 2 Prison until 2012.46 
</p>
<p>56. In 2011, National Drug Enforcement Agency agents were accused of killing Cherno 
</p>
<p>Alieu Suwareh during a violent arrest. Although two officers were prosecuted, the courts 
</p>
<p>discharged them for lack of evidence.47 
</p>
<p>57. Three alleged plotters were killed during the Government&#8217;s response to the 2014 
</p>
<p>attempted coup, as confirmed by the Government. Photographs presented to the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur as being of the dead bodies, if authentic, raise questions about the 
</p>
<p>circumstances that led to their deaths. The apparent pattern of injuries in the photographs 
</p>
<p>does not appear to be consistent with the official version of events. There is no available 
</p>
<p>information on whether official autopsies have been carried out on the bodies of the 
</p>
<p>deceased or on whether appropriate investigations have been launched into the 
</p>
<p>circumstances of their deaths. An in-depth forensic analysis should shed light on the causes 
</p>
<p>of death. The Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Government requesting 
</p>
<p>clarifications and has received no reply yet. 
</p>
<p>58. Reports of enforced disappearances were also brought to the attention of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, inasmuch as it is feared that they may in fact constitute cases of extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>killing. One such case is the abduction and later disappearance of &#8220;Chief&#8221; Ebrima Manneh, 
</p>
<p>a journalist at the <i>Daily Observer</i>, who was reportedly arrested in July 2006 by government 
</p>
<p>agents, although charges were never brought against him. His whereabouts remain

<p>unknown and there are fears that he may have been executed. The Government denies ever 
</p>
<p>having had him in its custody. The ECOWAS Court of Justice ordered the Government to 
</p>
<p>release him immediately and to pay compensation to his family.48 The judgement has not 
</p>
<p>been implemented. 
</p>
<p>59. Much has been made by the Government about the need for international assistance 
</p>
<p>to investigate the cases of Mr. Manneh and Mr. Hydara. In view of the way in which the 
</p>
<p>Government failed to honour its commitment to grant the Special Rapporteurs full access to 
</p>
<p>detainees and to places of detention, there is reason to be concerned that international 
</p>
<p>investigators will likewise not, in the end, receive the support they need in order to do their 
</p>
<p>work properly. Unless the highest authority in the country gives a firm commitment that 
</p>
<p>such investigators will have the access they need, talks about such assistance are likely to 
</p>
<p>be just another attempt to avoid accountability.  
</p>
<p>60. Also in 2006, five security officers disappeared after having been arrested on 
</p>
<p>suspicion of treason and planning a coup. The Government indicated that, following their 
</p>
<p>arrest, Daba Marenah (former Director General of the National Intelligence Agency), 
</p>
<p>Ebou Lowe, Alieu Ceesay, Alpha Bah and Manlafi Corr managed to escape from the car in 
</p>
<p>which they were being transferred, after the car was involved in a road accident. However, 
</p>
<p>the officers were never seen again and their disappearance was never investigated. 
</p>
<p>61. Given the time that has elapsed since these abductions and the lack of information 
</p>
<p>regarding the fate and whereabouts of the persons concerned, it is feared that they may have 
</p>
<p>been subjected to unlawful or extrajudicial killings. 
</p>
<p>62. More recently, reports have emerged regarding the abduction and disappearance of 
</p>
<p>United States-Gambian citizens Alhaji Mamut Ceesay and Ebrima Jobe. They were 
</p>
<p>abducted in June 2013 and their fate and whereabouts remain unknown. Although some 
</p>
<p>unconfirmed reports indicate that they may have been held in detention in some 
</p>
<p>undisclosed location, there are also fears that they may have been extrajudicially killed. 
</p>
<p>63. In August 2013, Colonel Ndure Cham, a former Chief of Defence of the Gambia 
</p>
<p>who was accused by the Government of plotting a coup in 2006 was reportedly 
</p>
<p>apprehended by the authorities and has never been seen again. Although the circumstances 
</p>
<p>of his arrest and his whereabouts remain unclear, some sources allege that he may have 
</p>
<p>been captured at the border with Senegal and that he may have been summarily executed. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur recalls the duty of the Government to take measures to 
</p>
<p>prevent and punish deprivation of life by criminal acts, to prevent arbitrary killing by its 
</p>
<p>own security forces, and to conduct thorough, prompt and impartial investigations into all 
</p>
<p>suspected cases of extralegal, arbitrary and summary execution.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Public demonstrations and the use of force 
</b></p>
<p>65. In April 2000, 13 students and a journalist were killed and 28 persons were wounded 
</p>
<p>when security forces opened fire during a peaceful demonstration organized by students. 
</p>
<p>An inquiry set up to investigate the events concluded that the security forces deployed to 
</p>
<p>control the demonstration were responsible for the deaths, however the Government 
</p>
<p>subsequently rejected the findings and no one was brought to justice.  
</p>
<p>66. According to testimonies received, the climate of fear engendered by this event and 
</p>
<p>the impunity that followed have reduced to a minimum the numbers of demonstrations that 
</p>
<p>have taken place in the country since then. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 48 See ECW/CCJ/JUD/03/08. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 </b> 
</p>
<p>67. Gambia&#8217;s legal regime also deters activists from organizing or participating in 
</p>
<p>assemblies. The Gambian Constitution allows the use of force in cases of &#8220;riot, insurrection 
</p>
<p>or mutiny&#8221; and affords immunity to law enforcement officials for deprivation of life in such 
</p>
<p>circumstances, giving them carte blanche to use force at will. Moreover, the Indemnity Act, 
</p>
<p>adopted a year after the incident, has allowed security officers accused of abuse of force 
</p>
<p>during the demonstration to be indemnified. Additionally, the Public Order Act establishes 
</p>
<p>the requirement of authorization for the organization of rallies or demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern about the excessive powers &#8212; 
</p>
<p>and the concomitant impunity &#8212; awarded by Gambian law to security officers to thwart 
</p>
<p>public demonstrations, and about the restrictions imposed for the organization of such acts; 
</p>
<p>and recalls that everyone is allowed to participate in lawful and peaceful assemblies, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the principles embodied in international law, and that intentional lethal use 
</p>
<p>of firearms in such circumstances may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to 
</p>
<p>protect life, and otherwise must be investigated and sanctioned by a court of law.49 
</p>
<p>Regarding the aforementioned case, he regrets that the use of unwarranted and excessive 
</p>
<p>force by security officers assigned to guarantee public safety led to the death of students 
</p>
<p>and a journalist, and that, 14 years on, the authorities have failed to bring about 
</p>
<p>accountability for those crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Accountability for human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>69. A general culture of accountability and the existence of effective institutional 
</p>
<p>channels for redress are essential for protection of the right to life. On several occasions, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur heard that police or judicial authorities either do not carry out 
</p>
<p>investigations, or, if they do, they are not carried out properly. Other institutions mandated 
</p>
<p>to address misconduct by law enforcement officials appear to be underutilized or 
</p>
<p>ineffective. 
</p>
<p>70. It is generally perceived that citizens avoid reporting abuse by the police due to fear 
</p>
<p>of reprisal, lack of substantive redress and a general mistrust of the police. Complaints 
</p>
<p>against the police are generally dealt with by the Complaints and Discipline Unit, based in 
</p>
<p>the Gambian Police Force since 1994, which handles most complaints relating to police 
</p>
<p>misconduct. The Inspector General of the Police informed the Special Rapporteur about the 
</p>
<p>creation in 2012 of a Human Rights Unit within the police force, which deals with 
</p>
<p>complaints of torture and inhuman treatment at the hands of the police. While the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur welcomes the establishment of the unit, he is concerned that, being staffed by 
</p>
<p>police officers and positioned within the police, this complaint mechanism may be 
</p>
<p>perceived as ineffective, vulnerable to internal pressure and lacking impartiality, dissuading 
</p>
<p>victims of abuse from submitting complaints. Moreover, certain victims, for example those 
</p>
<p>held in prisons under police control, may refrain from submitting complaints due to fear of 
</p>
<p>reprisals. The Special Rapporteur was informed that only one complaint has so far been 
</p>
<p>brought before the unit, but it was subsequently withdrawn. The Office of the Ombudsman 
</p>
<p>is also tasked with handling complaints about police misconduct, but has no mandate to 
</p>
<p>investigate human rights violations.50 Official data about the number of law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officials reprimanded or prosecuted for violations of the right to life under these 
</p>
<p>mechanisms was not forthcoming. 
</p>

<p>and 9; and Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, article 3.

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>71. Mistrust and fear appear to be amplified in matters that concern accountability for 
</p>
<p>abuses by members of the National Intelligence Agency. The legal gap governing their 
</p>
<p>conduct and, equally, sanctioning their abuses, and the public perception that the institution 
</p>
<p>operates behind a veil of impunity and that, ultimately, it has the power to exercise 
</p>
<p>unrestrained control over the lives of Gambian citizens, makes the lodging of complaints of 
</p>
<p>misconduct by its agents all the more implausible. Citizens are reluctant to denounce 
</p>
<p>abuses, engage legal services or seek redress, even for the most serious violations, 
</p>
<p>including disappearances, torture or probable executions. Moreover, the secrecy in which 
</p>
<p>most of its operations are conducted makes any potential investigation inoperable. 
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur received countless confidential complaints of 
</p>
<p>excessive use of force and possible summary executions by members of the National 
</p>
<p>Intelligence Agency which remain unaccounted for by Gambian judicial, administrative and 
</p>
<p>police institutions. 
</p>
<p>72. Although the Special Rapporteur received information about a small number of 
</p>
<p>prosecutions of security officers for the death of a suspect in their custody, it seems that not 
</p>
<p>in a single case were the prosecutions successful. 
</p>
<p>73. The climate of impunity is compounded by a judiciary that lost its independence, 
</p>
<p>being faced with the threat of dismissals, and by the reluctance of lawyers to take on human 
</p>
<p>rights cases out of fear of reprisals against themselves or their families, thereby reducing 
</p>
<p>the options for victims who wish to seek redress and exercise their rights. Although the 
</p>
<p>National Agency for Legal Aid was established to assist persons charged with offences that 
</p>
<p>carry the death sentence or a life sentence, the office is underresourced and overstretched.51  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur gets the distinct impression from a number of contacts with 
</p>
<p>officials of the State of the Gambia that they are, at best, unaware of the serious human 
</p>
<p>rights issues facing their country, or are pretending not to know about them, in some cases 
</p>
<p>because they fear for their jobs. This &#8220;disinformation&#8221; may to some extent be 
</p>
<p>understandable if it were confined to the lower ranks, but it is also prevalent at the highest 
</p>
<p>level. The Minister of Justice, for example, told the Special Rapporteur that the Gambia had 
</p>
<p>appealed the decision of the ECOWAS Court in the case of Ebrima Manneh, which 
</p>
<p>explained the lack of implementation of the judgement &#8212; which is not correct. 
</p>
<p>Astonishingly, the Chief Justice emphatically denied any knowledge of the execution of the 
</p>
<p>nine death row prisoners in August 2012, described above, in spite of the fact that these 
</p>
<p>were the only judicial executions to have taken place in the Gambia in the last 27 years, and 
</p>
<p>they were a cause of widespread international reaction. A number of the judges present at 
</p>
<p>the same meeting who admitted to knowing about the executions insisted that all nine had 
</p>
<p>been legitimately convicted for murder and had exhausted their appeal rights, which, as 
</p>
<p>indicated earlier, is not true.  
</p>
<p>75. Almost all of those in charge of the various security branches of the State, when 
</p>
<p>asked whether they had heard the widespread allegations that there was a hit squad called 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;Jungullars&#8221; or &#8220;Junglers&#8221; operating in the country, strongly denied ever having heard 
</p>
<p>such a name. Denying ever having heard the name is obviously a very different thing from  
</p>
<p>denying that such an grouping exists. It is difficult to understand how those who are in 
</p>
<p>charge of the safety of a State that places such a premium on safety cannot be aware of such 
</p>
<p>allegations, given the frequency with which the matter is spoken about in the country and 
</p>
<p>the detailed accounts that the Special Rapporteur heard from people who identify 
</p>
<p>themselves as former members. The impression created is of an attempt to cover the matter 
</p>
<p>up.

</b></p>
<p><b>18 </b> 
</p>
<p><b>  National human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>76. The national institutions dealing with human rights issues that are currently 
</p>
<p>operating in the country are ineffective. The mandate of the Office of the Ombudsman is 
</p>
<p>limited and does not include the power of investigation into human rights violations. The 
</p>
<p>Office of the Ombudsman mostly handles administrative claims and does not address cases 
</p>
<p>of excessive use of force. Although empowered to visit places of detention, it reportedly 
</p>
<p>only inspects police cells. Moreover, it is criticized for its lack of independence, incapacity 
</p>
<p>to enforce its recommendations, and lack of human and financial resources, and for the lack 
</p>
<p>of public trust in the institution and its overall ineffectiveness. Following a pledge at the 
</p>
<p>2010 universal periodic review to establish a national human rights institution, the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Gambia presented a draft bill in 2013, which was perceived as being not 
</p>
<p>fully compliant with international standards, in terms of its independence, its procedures for 
</p>
<p>the appointment and dismissal of members, and its funding. A new draft to be submitted to 
</p>
<p>the National Assembly is pending. It should be emphasized that the creation of a national 
</p>
<p>human rights institution in itself does not mean that human rights issues are addressed &#8212; 
</p>
<p>in fact, if it is simply a public relations exercise it can worsen the situation by shielding 
</p>
<p>abuses from further scrutiny. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Groups at risk 
</b></p>
<p>77. Human rights defenders, journalists and political opponents are systematically 
</p>
<p>targeted by security agencies and are subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, torture, 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearance and extrajudicial execution, particularly at the hands of the 
</p>
<p>National Intelligence Agency. Death threats and intimidation against them are also rampant, 
</p>
<p>including from the President himself, who in 2009 threatened to kill anyone who sought to 
</p>
<p>sabotage his Government &#8212; in particular human rights defenders and those who support 
</p>
<p>them. These groups of people are also subject to prosecution on charges of sedition, libel 
</p>
<p>and disturbance of public order, under sections 51, 178 and 167 of the Criminal Code, as 
</p>
<p>well as on charges of &#8220;false information&#8221; and other online offences under the 2013 
</p>
<p>Information and Communication Act. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur received concerning reports about hate speech, persecution 
</p>
<p>and violence against LGBT persons in the Gambia. Numerous reports have emerged of 
</p>
<p>threatening and inflammatory public speeches by Mr. Jammeh against homosexuals. Such 
</p>
<p>messages include threats to decapitate any homosexuals found in the country, depictions of 
</p>
<p>gay people as &#8220;vermin&#8221; who should be treated worse than mosquitoes, threats to kill anyone 
</p>
<p>who seeks asylum who claims to be persecuted for his or her sexual orientation, and 
</p>
<p>assessments of homosexuals as more deadly than all natural disasters put together.  
</p>
<p>79. He is also concerned about the 2014 amendment to the Criminal Code on 
</p>
<p>&#8220;aggravated homosexuality&#8221;, which carries punishments of up to life in prison and 
</p>
<p>contributes to the existing climate of hostility against LGBT persons. The approval of the 
</p>
<p>amendment was followed by rounds of arrests, prosecutions and attacks, and humiliation 
</p>
<p>and even torture of persons, because of their presumed sexual orientation. In addition, some 
</p>
<p>were detained in the security wing of Mile 2 Prison. The Special Rapporteur warns that hate 
</p>
<p>speech and discriminatory legislation risks inciting societal misconceptions and violence 
</p>
<p>against LGBT persons, putting them at great risk of attacks, humiliation and even murder, 
</p>
<p>and recalls the responsibility of States to respect the human rights of LGBT persons and to 
</p>
<p>avoid discrimination, as well as to prevent and punish violence and abuses against them by 
</p>
<p>third parties. </p>

<p><b> H. Fear of reprisals 
</b></p>
<p>80. The visit of the Special Rapporteur took place in an atmosphere of fear on the part of 
</p>
<p>civil society, victims, witnesses and other interlocutors. There was a climate of intimidation 
</p>
<p>being experienced by almost every person that the Special Rapporteur interviewed. Some 
</p>
<p>interlocutors conveyed particular concern about possible reprisals following the meeting. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, in the course of an interview, interlocutors indicated their fear that the meeting 
</p>
<p>was being monitored by individuals stationed near the meeting place. 
</p>
<p>81. From the outset, and in compliance with the terms of reference for fact-finding 
</p>
<p>missions, the Special Rapporteur sought assurances from the authorities that none of the 
</p>
<p>persons he was in contact with or worked with during the visit would be threatened, 
</p>
<p>harassed or punished or be subject to judicial proceedings after the country visit. He 
</p>
<p>received a commitment to that effect at the highest level. The Special Rapporteur trusts that 
</p>
<p>the Government will honour its guarantee. He remains in contact with sources on the 
</p>
<p>ground to monitor the safety of the persons with whom he met. Any incidents of reprisal 
</p>
<p>will be duly reported to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Concluding remarks  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The invitation to the Special Rapporteurs at a time when the country was also 
</b></p>
<p><b>being reviewed at the universal periodic review raised hopes that the Gambia was 
</b></p>
<p><b>opening the door to renewed and strengthened engagement with the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community and the United Nations human rights mechanisms, which could help bring 
</b></p>
<p><b>about the changes needed for the realization of human rights and the rule of law in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Gambia. That was th</b>e Special Rapporteur&#8217;s expectation<b>, in committing in good faith 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the visit. However, the visit entailed serious challenges regarding access and was 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducted in an overriding atmosphere of apprehension and fear from many who 
</b></p>
<p><b>engaged with him.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Despite the challenges encountered during the visit, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>hopes to remain engaged and to work in consultation with the Government and all 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant stakeholders to support the implementation of the recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>contained in the present report. They are presented in a spirit of cooperation to assist 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government to find solutions to some of the challenges identified herein, that 
</b></p>
<p><b>uphold the rule of law and promote accountability for human rights violations.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur believes that there could be a willingness in some 
</b></p>
<p><b>sectors of government to exhibit an approach that is more conducive to the realization 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights. There is, however, a general fear that inhibits such actions. The main 
</b></p>
<p><b>cause of this fear resides in the approach followed at the highest levels of government, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that is where there is the greatest need for change. 
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. To the Government of the Gambia  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legislation
