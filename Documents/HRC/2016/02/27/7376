<p><b>  Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>In its resolution 25/1, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (a) to monitor the human rights situation in 
</p>
<p>Sri Lanka and to continue to assess progress on relevant national processes; (b) to 
</p>
<p>undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations of human rights 
</p>
<p>during the period covered by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and to 
</p>
<p>establish the facts and circumstances of such alleged violations and of the crimes 
</p>
<p>perpetrated with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring accountability, with assistance 
</p>
<p>from relevant experts and special procedures mandate holders; and (c) to present an oral 
</p>
<p>update to the Council at its twenty-seventh session, and a comprehensive report followed 
</p>
<p>by a discussion on the implementation of that resolution at its twenty-eighth session.  
</p>
<p>At its organizational meeting, held on 16 February 2015, the Council, pursuant to 
</p>
<p>the recommendation of the High Commissioner, requested the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner to continue its follow-up to resolution 25/1 but decided to defer, for one time 
</p>
<p>only, its consideration of the comprehensive report of the Office on the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the said resolution until its thirtieth session. The recommendation of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner was made in the light of the changing context in Sri Lanka and the signals of 
</p>
<p>broad cooperation received from the Government, as well as the possibility that new 
</p>
<p>information would become available for the report. 
</p>
