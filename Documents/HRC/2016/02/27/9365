<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Established by resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 1980 of the Commission on 
Human Rights, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was the first 
United Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a global mandate. 
</p>
<p> This report, submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, reflects 
communications and cases examined by the Working Group during its sessions in 2007. The 
total number of cases transmitted by the Working Group to Governments since the Working 
Group&#8217;s inception is 51,763. The number of cases under active consideration that have not yet 
been clarified or discontinued stands at 41,257 and concerns 78 States. The Working Group has 
been able to clarify 2,702 cases over the past five years. 
</p>
<p> During the period under review, the Working Group transmitted 629 new cases of enforced 
disappearances to the Governments of Algeria, Bahrain, Chad, China, Colombia, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Honduras, India, Indonesia, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, Lebanon, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mexico, Myanmar, 
Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, the Syrian 
Arab Republic, Thailand and United Arab Emirates. Of the newly reported cases, 84 allegedly 
occurred in 2007. 
</p>
<p> A summary of activities during the last year is presented in a table for each country, with a 
detailed text description of the areas of activity. 
</p>
<p> During the reporting period from November 2006 to November 2007 the Working Group 
conducted country visits to Honduras and El Salvador. The reports of the country visits are 
contained in addenda to this report. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The mandate 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was the first 
United Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a universal mandate. 
The original mandate is derived from Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) 
of 29 February 1980. This resolution followed General Assembly resolution 33/173 of 
20 December 1978, in which the Assembly expressed concern over reports from various parts of 
the world relating to enforced disappearances and requested the Commission on Human Rights 
to consider the question of missing or disappeared persons. 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group&#8217;s mandate was elaborated in General Assembly resolution 47/133 
of 18 December 1992, entitled &#8220;Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance&#8221;. The mandate was most recently extended by Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2004/40 of 19 April 2004 and Human Rights Council decision 5/101 of 18 June 2007. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group&#8217;s basic mandate is humanitarian. It serves as a channel of 
communication between family members of victims of disappearance and Governments. The 
primary task of the Working Group is to assist families in determining the fate or whereabouts of 
their family members who are reportedly disappeared. 
</p>
<p>4. In addition to its basic mandate, the Working Group has also been entrusted, according to 
Commission resolution 2004/40, with the task of monitoring the progress of States in fulfilling 
obligations derived from the Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the course of the year, the Working Group completed a process of reviewing its 
methods of work. The methods of work, as revised on 30 November 2007, are contained in 
annex I to the present report, and will come into effect as from the eighty-fourth session of the 
Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The present report 
</b></p>
<p>6. The report reflects communications and cases examined by the Working Group during its 
three sessions in 2007, and covers the period from November 2006 to November 2007. 
</p>
<p>7. A summary of activities during the reporting period is presented in a table for each 
country, with a detailed text description of the areas of activity. Where there has been no 
correspondence or other activity during the period, only the table is provided and a reference is 
made to a description of cases. Due to space limitations, the section &#8220;Summary of the situation 
prior to the period under review&#8221; of every country was not included in this report. The 
summaries can be found in the 2006 annual report (A/HRC/4/41). 
</p>
<p>8. In countries where the number of newly reported cases is less than 10, the names of the 
persons appear in the country section. If the number of newly reported cases is greater than 10, 
the list of names appears in annex V. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. The total number of cases transmitted by the Working Group to Governments since the 
Working Group&#8217;s inception is 51,763. The number of cases under active consideration that have 
not yet been clarified or discontinued stands at 41,257 and concerns 78 States. The Working 
Group has been able to clarify 2,702 cases over the past five years. 
</p>
<p>10. It is recalled that recent cases of disappearance are the priority of the Working Group. 
Large volumes of cases submitted to the Working Group many years after the persons 
disappeared are reviewed by the Working Group and processed by the Secretariat as an ongoing 
process. With the improved staffing beginning in 2005, the Working Group was able to address 
the backlog of cases. However, during 2007, the Working Group received more than 1,000 cases, 
and expects to be able to process them in 2008. The Working Group wishes to thank the Office 
of the High Commissioner for the continuous support given to the Working Group, and hopes to 
maintain the adequate level of staffing which it now enjoys. 
</p>
<p><b>II. ACTIVITIES OF THE WORKING GROUP ON ENFORCED 
OR INVOLUNTARY DISAPPEARANCES: NOVEMBER 2006 
TO NOVEMBER 2007 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>11. During the period under review, the Working Group held three sessions in Geneva. 
The eighty-first session was held from 15 to 21 March 2007, the eighty-second session 
from 25 to 29 June 2007 and the eighty-third session from 21 to 30 November 2007. 
</p>
<p>12. The Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group is Mr. Santiago Corcuera. The other 
members are Mr. J. &#8216;Bayo Adekanye, Mr. Saied Rajaie Khorasani, Mr. Darko G&#246;ttlicher, and 
Mr. Stephen J. Toope. 
</p>
<p>13. In June 2007, Mr. Corcuera attended the fourteenth annual meeting of special rapporteurs, 
representatives, independent experts and chairpersons of working groups of the Human Rights 
Council. In April 2007, he participated in a workshop on the follow-up to the Ombudsman 
Offices&#8217; implementation of the recommendations formulated by international human rights 
mechanisms. The workshop took place in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. In May 2007, 
Mr. Corcuera participated in a Workshop on the International Convention for the Protection of 
all Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which took place in Paris. In October 2007, he 
participated in a regional workshop on the problem of enforced disappearances held in Lima, and 
organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
</p>
<p>14. During the period under review, the Working Group met formally with representatives of 
the Governments of France, Iraq, Japan, Mexico and Thailand. The Working Group also met 
with representatives of human rights non-governmental organizations, associations of relatives of 
disappeared persons and families or witnesses directly concerned with reports of enforced 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p>15. During the fourth session of the Human Rights Council, the Working Group met with 
representatives of the Government of Sri Lanka. The Chairman-Rapporteur, Mr. Corcuera, also 
met with representatives of the Governments of Colombia and Argentina. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communications 
</b></p>
<p>16. During the period under review, the Working Group transmitted 629<b> </b>new cases of enforced 
disappearances to the Governments of Algeria, Bahrain, Chad, China, Colombia, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Honduras, India, Indonesia, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, Lebanon, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mexico, Myanmar, 
Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, the Syrian 
Arab Republic, Thailand and United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group sent 65 of these cases under the urgent action procedure to the 
Governments of Algeria, Bahrain, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, 
Honduras, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mexico, Myanmar, 
Pakistan, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Rwanda and Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p>18. Of the newly reported cases, 84 allegedly occurred during the reporting period and relate to 
Algeria, Bahrain, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, Mexico, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, the Russian Federation and 
Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p>19. During the same period, the Working Group clarified 224 cases in the following countries: 
Algeria, Argentina, Bahrain, Honduras, India, Morocco, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, 
the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Turkey and Yemen. Of 
those, 213 cases were clarified based on information provided by the Government and 12 cases 
were clarified based on information provided by sources. 
</p>
<p>20. During the reporting period, the Working Group sent two prompt intervention 
communications addressing harassment of and threats to human rights defenders and relatives of 
disappeared persons in Algeria and India. 
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group also sent 10 general allegations to the Governments of Colombia, 
Indonesia, Mexico, Montenegro, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka 
and the United States of America. During its eighty-third session, the Working Group reviewed a 
number of general allegations from different regions of the world. The Working Group decided 
to transmit them to the respective Governments, and invites them to comment thereon if they so 
wish. Summaries of the general allegations considered during the eighty-third session, including 
government responses, if any, will be included in the 2008 annual report. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>22. At the invitation of the Government, Working Group members Santiago Corcuera 
and Darko G&#246;ttlicher, with staff from the Secretariat, visited Honduras from 31 January 
to 2 February and El Salvador from 5 to 7 February 2007. The missions took place as part of a 
regional visit to Central American countries with significant numbers of outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p>23. The reports of the country visits to Honduras and El Salvador are contained in addenda to 
this report. Among other recommendations, the Working Group recommended to the 
Government of Honduras that the legislature enact a law defining enforced disappearances as an 
autonomous crime in the Honduran Penal Code. With respect to El Salvador, the Working Group </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>requested that the Salvadorian Legislative Assembly should modify the 1993 Amnesty Law, 
in accordance with the Working Group&#8217;s general observation on article 18 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group has requested visits to Algeria, Argentina, Indonesia, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, Nepal, Nicaragua, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, the 
Sudan and Timor-Leste. The scheduled visit to Argentina in March 2007 was postponed at the 
request of the Working Group, as the dates coincided with the presentation of the Working 
Group&#8217;s Annual Report to the Human Rights Council. The Working Group looks forward to a 
possible visit in 2008. The Governments of Sri Lanka, the Russian Federation and Indonesia 
stated that it would not be possible to schedule a visit by the Working Group in 2007 because 
other special rapporteurs would be visiting the country at that time. The Government of the 
Russian Federation indicated that it continues to be in agreement in principle with the visit, and 
asked that the time for the visit be reviewed after the completion of the process of assessment of 
the mandates of special procedures by the Human Rights Council. The Government of Indonesia 
stated that greater benefit would be derived if the Working Group visited at a later date. The 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran agreed to a visit by the Working Group in 2005, 
which was delayed at the request of the Government. The Working Group deeply regrets that 
Algeria has not responded to repeated requests by the Working Group to visit the country. The 
Working Group invites the Governments of Nepal, Nicaragua, the Philippines, the Sudan and 
Timor-Leste to respond to repeated interest expressed by the Working Group to visit these 
countries. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Statements and general comments </b></p>
<p>25. To commemorate the International Day of the Disappeared on 30 August, the Working 
Group issued a press release on 29 August 2007 to commemorate all victims of enforced 
disappearances. In the press release, the Working Group expressed its concern over the 
increasing number of cases of enforced disappearances around the world and reiterated its 
solidarity with the victims of enforced disappearances and human rights defenders helping the 
victims. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  General comment on the definition of enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>26. As a result of the development of international law, especially with respect to the definition 
of enforced disappearance, the Working Group decided to draft a general comment to provide a 
construction of the definition of enforced disappearance that is most conducive to the protection 
of all persons from enforced disappearance. In March 2007, during its eighty-first session, the 
Working Group adopted the following general comment: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;General comment on the definition of enforced disappearance 
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Preamble 
</i></p>
<p> &#8220;The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has referred in the 
past to the scope of the definition of enforced disappearance under the Declaration on the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (hereinafter the &#8216;Declaration&#8217;), 
particularly in its general comment on article 4 of the Declaration. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> &#8220;According to the Declaration, enforced disappearances occur when persons are 
arrested, detained or abducted against their will or otherwise deprived of their liberty by 
officials of different branches or levels of government or by organized groups or private 
individuals acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or 
acquiescence of the Government, followed by a refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts 
of the persons concerned or a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, which 
places such persons outside the protection of the law.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Working Group has followed closely the development of international human 
rights law on this matter, especially with respect to the definitions of enforced 
disappearance contained in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
(hereinafter the &#8216;Rome Statute&#8217;) and in the recently adopted and not yet in force 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
(hereafter identified as the &#8216;International Convention&#8217;), as well as in the Inter-American 
Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons (hereinafter referred to as the 
&#8216;Inter-American Convention&#8217;). 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Working Group takes note that the international instruments on human rights 
mentioned above, that is, the Declaration, the International Convention and the 
Inter-American Convention, contain definitions of enforced disappearance that are 
substantially similar. The definition contained in the Rome Statute differs from those 
contained in the international instruments on human rights indicated above, inasmuch as 
the definition of enforced disappearance provided by the Rome Statute includes 
(a) political groups as potential perpetrators of the crime, even if they do not act on behalf 
of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the Government, and 
(b) the intention of removing the victim from the protection of the law for a prolonged 
period of time, as an element of the crime. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Working Group deems that it should construe the definition provided by the 
Declaration, in a way that is most conducive to the protection of all persons from enforced 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Based on the foregoing, the Working Group has decided to issue the following 
general comment: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>General comment</i> 
</p>
<p> &#8220;1.  With respect to the perpetrators of the crime, the Working Group has clearly 
established that, for purposes of its work, enforced disappearances are only considered as 
such when the act in question is perpetrated by State actors or by private individuals or 
organized groups (e.g. paramilitary groups) acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct 
or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the Government. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;2.  The Working Group concurs with the provisions of article 3 of the 
International Convention, in connection with the fact that States shall take appropriate 
measures to investigate acts comparable to enforced disappearances committed by persons 
or groups of persons acting without the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State 
and to bring those responsible to justice. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> &#8220;3.  The Working Group has stated, in its general comment on article 4 of the 
Declaration that, although States are not bound to follow strictly the definition contained in 
the Declaration in their criminal codes, they shall ensure that the act of enforced 
disappearance is defined in a way that clearly distinguishes it from related offences such as 
abduction and kidnapping. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;4.  Based on the foregoing, the Working Group does not admit cases regarding 
acts which are similar to enforced disappearances when they are attributed to persons or 
groups not acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or 
acquiescence of the Government, such as terrorist or insurgent movements fighting the 
Government on its own territory, since it considers that it has to strictly adhere to the 
definition contained in the Declaration. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;5.  In accordance with article 1, paragraph 2, of the Declaration, any act of 
enforced disappearance has the consequence of placing the persons subjected thereto 
outside the protection of the law. Therefore, the Working Group admits cases of enforced 
disappearance without requiring that the information whereby a case is reported by a 
source should demonstrate, or even presume, the intention of the perpetrator to place the 
victim outside the protection of the law.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;6.  In those cases in which the Working Group received reports of enforced 
disappearances in which the victim had already been found dead, the Working Group, 
under its methods of work, would not admit the case for transmission to the respective 
Government, since it would be a case clarified <i>ab initio.</i> Indeed, under its methods of 
work, clarification occurs when the whereabouts of the disappeared persons are clearly 
established irrespective of whether the person is alive or dead. However, this does not 
mean that such cases would not fall within the definition of enforced disappearance 
included in the Declaration, if the deprivation of liberty took place (a) against the will of 
the person concerned; (b) with involvement of government officials, at least indirectly, by 
acquiescence; and (c) State officials thereafter refused to acknowledge the act or to 
disclose the fate or whereabouts of the person concerned. That is to say, in accordance with 
the mandate of the Working Group related to monitoring the implementation of the 
Declaration, such reports may be transmitted to the Governments in question under the 
method of &#8216;general allegations&#8217;, but not as an &#8216;urgent appeal&#8217;, nor under the &#8216;normal 
procedure&#8217;, as such terms are used in the Working Group&#8217;s methods of work. Under the 
general allegations method, the Working Group would invite the Governments concerned 
to comment on the measures that should be taken under the Declaration to investigate such 
cases, to bring the perpetrators to justice, to satisfy the right to adequate compensation, as 
well as regarding measures to stop and prevent enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;7. Under the definition of enforced disappearance contained in the Declaration, 
the criminal offence in question starts with an arrest, detention or abduction against the 
will of the victim, which means that the enforced disappearance may be initiated by an 
illegal detention or by an initially legal arrest or detention. That is to say, the protection of 
a victim from enforced disappearance must be effective upon the act of deprivation of 
liberty, whatever form such deprivation of liberty takes, and not be limited to cases of 
illegitimate deprivations of liberty. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> &#8220;8. Even though the Working Group, in its general comment on article 10 of the 
Declaration, has said that any detention that is unduly prolonged constitutes a violation of 
the Declaration, this does not mean that any short-term detention is permitted by the 
Declaration, since the Working Group immediately clarifies that a detention where the 
detainee is not charged so that he can be brought before a court, is a violation of the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;9. As the Working Group stated in the same general comment, administrative or 
pre-trial detention is not per se a violation of international law or of the Declaration. 
However, if a detention, even short-term, is followed by an extrajudicial execution, such 
detention cannot be considered of administrative or pre-trial nature under article 10 of the 
Declaration, but rather as a condition where the immediate consequence is the placement 
of the detainee beyond the protection of the law. The Working Group considers that when 
the dead body of the victim is found mutilated or with clear signs of having been tortured 
or with the arms or legs tied, those circumstances clearly show that the detention was not 
immediately followed by an execution, but that the deprivation of liberty had some 
duration, even of at least a few hours or days. A situation of such nature, not only 
constitutes a violation to the right not to be disappeared, but also to the right not to be 
subjected to torture, to the right to recognition as a person before the law and to the right to 
life, as provided under article 1, paragraph 2, of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;10. Therefore, a detention followed by an extrajudicial execution, as described in 
the preceding paragraph, is an enforced disappearance proper, as long as such detention or 
deprivation of liberty was carried out by governmental agents of whatever branch or level, 
or by organized groups or private individuals acting on behalf of, or with the support, 
direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the Government, and, subsequent to the 
detention, or even after the execution was carried out, State officials refuse to disclose the 
fate or whereabouts of the persons concerned or refuse to acknowledge the act having been 
perpetrated at all.&#8221;

<p><b>Urgent action 
</b></p>
<p>28. Seven cases were sent to the Government of Algeria under the urgent action 
procedure. One case concerned <b>Zaoui Abdelkader</b> who was allegedly arrested at his home, 
on 6 December 2006, by eight officers from the judiciary police. The six other cases occurred 
in 2007. <b>Abdelghani Kennab</b> was last seen entering the Dean&#8217;s Office at Constantine 
University. It is believed that the Department of Investigation and Security Services is 
responsible for his disappearance. <b>Abdelaziz Zoubida</b> was arrested at Zouaghi Slimane II 
University Town in Constantine, reportedly by two agents from the Department of Investigation 
and Security Services. According to the information received, <b>Mohamed Boucekkine</b> was 
arrested at his home by officers from the Department of Investigation and Security Services. The 
last case concerned <b>Fethi Hamaddouche</b>, who was last seen at the Department of Investigation 
and Security Services Barracks in Algiers. Two other cases reportedly took place in Algiers; 
<b>Mohamed Rahmouni</b> was allegedly arrested by the police and <b>Mohamed Fatmia</b> was 
reportedly arrested by agents from the judicial police. 
<b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Working Group transmitted 326 newly reported cases<b> </b>of disappearance that allegedly 
occurred in the 1990s, mainly between 1993 and 1997. Two cases concern disappearances which 
allegedly took place in 2006. The majority of the cases occurred in Algiers and in the Jijel 
Province, while others took place in Ben Acknoun, Sidi M&#8217;hammed, Oran, Tipaza, and Blida 
Provinces. The Police, the Military, and the Security Forces are believed to be responsible for the 
majority of the cases.  
</p>

</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  See annex V for the list of the newly reported cases of disappeared persons. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>30. Three communications were received from the Government of Algeria, 
dated 26 June 2007, 11 July 2007 and 23 July 2007. The information dated 26 June 2007 
concerned one case transmitted under the urgent action procedure. The Government informed 
the Working Group that the case had been transmitted to the competent authorities for their 
examination. No other information was received regarding outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Working Group received new information from sources on two cases which had been 
sent to the Government under the urgent action procedure. Regarding the disappearances of 
<b>Zaoui Abdelkader</b> and <b>Abdelaziz Zoubida</b>, the source informed of the location where they are 
being imprisoned.  
</p>
<p>32. The Working Group also received new information from the source on the case of 
<b>Mohamed Boucekkine,</b> which reportedly took place in June 2007. The source was able to visit 
the subject in prison.  
<b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>33.  Based on information provided by sources, the Working Group decided to clarify three 
cases.  
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>34. On 4 September 2007, a prompt intervention letter was sent by the Working Group to the 
Government of Algeria regarding alleged threats and acts of intimidation against the relatives of 
a disappeared person. The family of <b>Mohamed Rahmouni </b>(subject of an urgent action in 
August 2007) was asked to explain to the police the measures taken to find the fate or 
whereabouts of their son, and told not to take further action. No response was received from the 
Government regarding this letter. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>35. On 25 August 2000, the Working Group first transmitted a request for an invitation to the 
Government of Algeria. The Working Group has since sent several reminders of this request but 
has not yet received a reply.  
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>36. In previous years and during the year under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 1,973 cases to the Government; of those, 9 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the Government, 12 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the source, and 1,952 cases remain outstanding. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Working Group expresses increasing concern that during the period under review, 
seven urgent actions were sent to the Government. 
</p>
<p>38. The Working Group expresses deep concern that little progress has been made in clarifying 
cases of disappearance in Algeria. Additional cases arising from the 1990s continue to be 
received by the Working Group and are being transmitted to the Government of Algeria.  
</p>
<p>39. The Working Group reminds the Government of Algeria of its obligations under article 13 
of the Declaration, that steps shall be taken to ensure that all involved in the investigation are 
protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal. 
</p>
<p>40. The Working Group recalls the general allegation issued in the 2006 annual report 
concerning amnesty laws. The Working Group invites the Government to submit a report to the 
Working Group on the measures taken to align its legislation with article 18 of the Declaration 
and to the general comment on article 18. 
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group strongly reaffirms its request to the Government of Algeria for a 
country visit aimed at clarifying the 1,952 outstanding cases.

</b></p>
<p>43. The Working Group received a communication sent by the Government regarding 72 
cases. This information will be reviewed by the Working Group during the next reporting period.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>44. No information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>45. Based on the information received from the Government, the Working Group decided to 
clarify 55 cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>46. In a communication sent on 15 January 2007, the Working Group informed the 
Government that it would not be possible to hold its eighty-first session in Argentina, and that 
the mission initially planned to follow the session, would have to be postponed to 2008. The 
Government sent a response on 17 January 2007 informing the Working Group that a standing 
invitation is open to all special procedures of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>47. In previous years and during the period under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 3,445 cases to the Government; of those, 43 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the source, 99 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the Government, and 3,303 remain outstanding.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Working Group welcomes the efforts made by the Government to clarify outstanding 
cases, particularly with regard to 55 cases clarified during 2007, as a result of the creation of a 
comprehensive database to establish the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons in that 
country by the Government. The Working Group hopes that,  through this continued cooperation 
with the Government and NGOs, progress can continue towards the clarification of the 3,303 
cases that remain unresolved. The Working Group also commends the continuation of trials 
against perpetrators. </p>

<p>70. The Working Group transmitted 12 newly reported cases to the Government under its 
standard procedure, concerning the disappearance of Chadian army officers and civilians in 
N&#8217;Djamena and in the northern part of the country. These cases allegedly took place in 2006.

</b></p>
<p>76. The Working Group transmitted two urgent actions to the Government of China. The first 
case concerned <b>Lopoe Adruktsang</b>, a Tibetan monk who was arrested at Lithang County 
Public Security Bureau and taken to an unknown location. The second case concerned 
<b>Lobsang Thokmey</b>, who was reportedly arrested in connection with a political protest in his 
hometown. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>77. Three communications were received from the Government, dated 12 February, 10 May 
and 6 June 2007, regarding seven outstanding cases. For six cases, the Working Group found 
that the responses did not contain sufficient information to clarify the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared persons. 
</p>
<p>78. In the communication dated 6 June 2007, the Government reported on one outstanding 
case, indicating that the victim was being held at the detention facility of the Lhasa city public 
security office and legal proceedings were instituted against him. The Working Group decided 
that the reply could constitute a clarification, provided the source did not raise an objection 
within six months. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>79. New information was provided about one case, expressing concern about the well-being of 
the Panchen Lama of Tibet, who has been missing for 12 years.

<p><b>Urgent actions

<p>82. The Working Group transmitted one urgent action to the Government concerning 
<b>Gonzalo Villalba Hern&#225;ndez</b>, a member of the Colombian Communist Party. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>83. Nine communications were received from the Government, dated 12 December 2006, 
4 January, 16 March, 6 July, 18 July, 16 August, 23 August, 28 September and 1 October 2007. 
The information reviewed was considered insufficient to constitute a clarification. The 
communications dated 6 July, 16 August, 23 August and 28 September 2007 could not be 
translated by the United Nations translation services in time for consideration by the Working 
Group for inclusion in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>84. Information was received from sources concerning the case of a man who disappeared 
in 2001 in Medellin. The sources reported that all resources had been exhausted to find the 
whereabouts of the victim, with negative results. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>85. In two communications, dated 6 October 2006 and 13 March 2007, the Government of 
Colombia responded to the Working Group&#8217;s general allegation from 2006 regarding the Justice 
and Peace Law. 
</p>
<p>86. In the communication of 6 October 2006, the Government stated: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Through Act No. 975 of 2005, known as the Justice and Peace Act, adopted by the 
Congress of the Republic, an effort is being made to facilitate the peace processes with the 
illegal armed groups, and the reintegration of their members, guaranteeing above all the 
rights of victims to truth, justice and reparation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> &#8220;From the time of its conception, this act was viewed as an instrument to facilitate 
the attainment of peace and national reconciliation. The National Government is convinced 
that national peace is a desire that has transcended political parties and governments, but 
also that it cannot be attained to the detriment of the rights of the victims of violence. 
Article 2 of Act No. 975 clearly provides that the interpretation and enforcement of the Act 
must necessarily be effected in the light of the provisions of the Constitution, and of the 
international treaties ratified by Colombia. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;In addition, the Constitutional Court, which is the highest Colombian Court and 
responsible for monitoring the conformity of laws with the Constitution, handed down a 
ruling, by decision C-370/06 of 18 May 2006 on a number of unconstitutionality suits 
brought against the Justice and Peace Act. In this decision, the Court limited the scope of a 
number of articles to the benefit of the victims, protecting first and foremost their right to 
truth, justice and reparation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>87. In the communication of 13 March 2007, the Government stated that: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The information submitted to the Working Group concerning the observance of the 
Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, which 
contains a number of provisions on this subject, is not correct since although the 
Declaration is not a legally binding instrument, Colombia has incorporated the principles 
contained in the Declaration into its domestic law. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Government of Colombia reiterates that the Justice and Peace Act is not a law 
on special amnesty or pardon. On the contrary, it is the first law in the world that, in order 
to ensure the rights to peace and justice, establishes an alternative punishment to the 
ordinary punishment provided for in the Criminal Code currently in force. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Government of Colombia informs that institutions have been established in 
which victims of enforced disappearance can receive assistance and participate; these 
include the National Commission to Search for Missing Persons and the National 
Compensation and Reconciliation Commission, whose activities support the National Plan 
to Search for Missing Persons, which allows victims to participate in the search for and 
identification of family members and in the identification and punishment of those 
responsible, as tools to supplement the judicial framework of the Justice and Peace Act and 
the Government&#8217;s human rights policy.&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>88. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning obstacles allegedly 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of Colombia. This 
information was transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>89. In July 2005, the Colombian Congress reportedly approved Law 975 on &#8220;justice and 
peace&#8221;. NGOs alleged that this law suffered from substantial deficiencies that hampered the 
possibility for the victims to achieve justice. Due to the petitions filed against Law 975, the 
Constitutional Court declared the unconstitutionality or conditioned constitutionality of several 
key provisions of this law through ruling C-370. The Working Group has been informed that, 
through decrees, the Government has reportedly modified the content of the ruling C-370, 
substantially affecting the rights of victims acknowledged within. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>90. NGOs also alleged that, according to Colombian legislation, many of the norms contained 
in the decrees are illegal, since the Government does not have the competence to issue them, but 
rather, they are the competence of Congress or judges. For this reason, these norms have been 
filed under administrative contentious proceedings by a large number of Colombian persons and 
organizations. However, it has been reported that, while the legal decisions concerning these 
proceedings may take years, the norms contained in the decrees are being applied to the 
processes before Law 975. 
</p>
<p>91. No reply was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Total case transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>92. In previous years and during the period under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 1,225 cases to the Government; of those, 67 cases have been clarified on the basis 
of information provided by the source, 201 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the Government and 957 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>93. The Working Group notes with satisfaction that, unlike in previous years, only one newly 
reported case was received by the Working Group. The Working Group hopes that this is a trend 
that shows that disappearances are no longer occurring in Colombia, rather than being the effect 
of the phenomenon of underreporting noted in the report of the country visit in 2005. 
</p>
<p>94. The Working Group expresses concern about allegations regarding the issuances of 
decrees that are diluting the effects of the Constitutional Court&#8217;s decision on certain provisions 
of the Justice and Peace Law. 
</p>
<p>95. The Working Group wishes to reaffirm the importance that the Declaration has had as an 
important precedent for the development of instruments of international human rights law 
regarding enforced disappearances, such as the Inter-American Convention on the Forced 
Disappearance of Persons and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>96. The Working Group reiterates its request to the Government of Colombia to take effective 
measures to clarify outstanding cases and to implement the recommendations contained in the 
report of the Working Group issued after its country visit. The Working Group again invites the 
Government to submit a report on the measures taken to implement the recommendations.

<p>167. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of 
Indonesia. This information was transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>168. According to the reports, in early 2005, the National Human Rights Commission 
(Komnas Ham) conducted an investigation into the disappearance in 1998 of 8 activist students 
and 14 democracy activists. However, the Commission&#8217;s efforts to investigate certain members 
of the military and special forces, as well as places where it was believed that the disappeared 
were reportedly detained, were allegedly obstructed at every stage. 
</p>
<p>169. On 8 November 2006, Komnas Ham presented an official report of its findings to the 
Attorney General, the Supreme Court and the Indonesian Parliament. In the report, 27 officers of 
the State Army, the National Police and State Intelligence were implicated in the 
above-mentioned disappearances. However, the Attorney General has reportedly taken no action 
to pursue the matter further by filing formal charges against the alleged perpetrators or pressing 
for prosecution. No response was received from the Government regarding this general 
allegation.

</b></p>
<p>170. On 12 December 2006, the Working Group requested to undertake a mission to Indonesia 
either in late 2007 or early 2008, in order to facilitate the clarification of outstanding cases. A

24 January 2007. In March 2007, at the request of the Permanent Mission of Indonesia, the 
Secretary of the Working Group met with representatives of the Permanent Mission to discuss 
outstanding cases and the mission request. On 8 March 2007, the Secretariat received a note 
from the Permanent Mission, explaining that Indonesia had recently received a visit from a 
Special Rapporteur and that two further visits were scheduled for 2007. For this reason, the 
Government considered that its agenda for 2007 was already full and that greater benefit would 
be derived if the Working Group visited at a later date.

<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>210. No information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>211. During the eighty-first session, the Working Group met with the Mexican National 
Human Rights Institution to discuss outstanding cases of disappearances in Mexico. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>212. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of Mexico. 
This information was transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>213. Reportedly, in 1990, the Special Programme on the Presumed Disappeared 
(PREDES) of the National Commission for Human Rights released a report on the presumed 
enforced disappearances of 532 persons, the majority of cases dating from the 1970s. 
On 27 November 2001, the President of Mexico published in the <i>Official Gazette </i>an agreement 
to establish measures to seek justice for crimes committed against people linked to social and 
political movements from the past. Through this agreement the Government created the &#8220;Special 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office on federal crimes committed directly or indirectly by public servants against 
persons from social and political movements of the past&#8221;. The Working Group has been 
informed of the closing of the Office of Mexico&#8217;s Special Prosecutor for Social and Political 
Movements of the Past. It is reported that despite the lack of results from the Special 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, this was the only institutional mechanism to investigate past human rights 
violations. 
</p>
<p>214. No reply was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>215. In previous years and during the year under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 379 cases to the Government; of those, 22 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the source, 133 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the Government, 16 cases were discontinued and 208 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>216. The Working Group encourages the Government to provide information on the fate or 
whereabouts of the victims that could lead to the clarification of the 208 outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p>217. The Working Group is concerned about the closure of the Special Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and 
believes that a measure of that nature may be contrary to article 16, paragraph 3, of the 
Declaration. </p>

<p>220. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning obstacles allegedly 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of Montenegro. This 
information was transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>221. It was reported that the Montenegrin authorities had failed to ensure reparation to the 
victims and families of victims of disappearance that occurred in 1992. The Government of 
Montenegro had also reportedly failed to ensure the prompt initiation of an independent, 
impartial investigation into the disappearances or to bring to justice those responsible for the 
alleged disappearance of 83 Bosnian Muslim civilians. 
</p>
<p>222. Three civil cases for reparations were allegedly delayed after the Office of the 
State Prosecutor requested a stay until individual criminal responsibility had been determined. 
Reportedly, the initiation of criminal investigations has been used as a pretext to delay the 
progress of proceedings for reparations in civil courts. 
</p>
<p>223. No reply was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

<p>225. The Working Group received five replies from the Government of Morocco, dated 25 
and 29 December 2006, 29 January, 7 February and 15 June 2007. In its communication 
dated 25 December 2007, the Government expressed its commitment to settle the cases of 
missing persons, the efforts made to elucidate these cases, as well as the difficulties encountered 
in this process. 
</p>
<p>226. In the communication dated 29 January 2007, the Government stated that two disappeared 
men had been handed over to Algerian authorities. In a communication dated 15 June 2007, the 
Government stated that five victims had reportedly died. The Working Group decided that, in 
these seven cases, the replies could constitute clarifications, provided the source did not raise an 
objection within six months. In another case, where a death certificate has not been issued, the 
response was not considered sufficient to constitute a clarification. 
</p>
<p>227. At the request of the Government, seven cases were reconsidered. The Working Group 
decided that the responses were not considered sufficient to constitute a clarification. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources

<p>240. The Working Group transmitted 21 cases to the Government under the standard procedure. 
The majority of the cases reportedly took place between 2001 and 2005, mainly in 2002. The 
subjects included a minor and a woman. Members of the Security Forces, the Nepalese Army 
and the police are allegedly responsible for these disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>241. A communication was received from the Government on 5 January 2007, but no 
new information was provided regarding outstanding cases. The Working Group also 
received information from the Government of Nepal dated 10 September 2007, concerning 
one outstanding case. The Government informed the Working Group that the case had been 
transmitted to the authorities with a request for information. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>242. The source replied on two outstanding cases, indicating in one case that the victims had 
been released, and in another that the victim was no longer disappeared. Concerning another 
case, the source informed that the National Human Rights Committee transmitted a letter to the 
subject&#8217;s family acknowledging that he had been arrested and handed over to the Bhiman Army 
Barrack. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>243. On 12 May 2006, the Working Group requested a visit to Nepal in order to follow up on 
the recommendations of its mission in 2004. The Working Group has not yet received a reply.

</b>  See annex V for the list of names of the newly reported cases of disappeared persons. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>244. Based on information received from the Government, the Working Group decided to 
clarify three cases following the expiration of the six-month rule. In all three cases, the current 
addresses of the subjects were provided. Based on information received from sources, the 
Working Group decided to clarify two cases. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>245. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of 
Indonesia. This information was transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>246. According to reports, while many people remain disappeared, impunity still prevails for the 
perpetrators of these crimes. Although some cases of enforced disappearance have been 
investigated and taken to court by the authorities, no accused perpetrators have been prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>247. For its part, the army has allegedly failed to provide information about more than 600 cases 
of Nepalis who were taken into custody by troops and have not been seen since then. The army 
has also reportedly refused to cooperate with investigations instigated by the national police. 
</p>
<p>248. It was also reported that an alleged perpetrator of human rights violations was appointed 
Army Chief of Staff. The allegations against him include enforced disappearances, among other 
human rights violations. He is under investigation by the High Level Probe Commission, 
mandated to investigate human rights violations which occurred between 1 February 2005 
and 24 April 2006. 
</p>
<p>249. Finally, it was reported that the amendments to the Army Act, adopted 
on 22 September 2006, state that no member of the security forces can be prosecuted in any 
court for actions taken while fulfilling his duty. In addition, decisions made by military 
tribunals cannot be appealed, and their hearings are to be closed to the public.  
</p>
<p>250. No reply was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>251. In previous years and during the year under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 531 cases to the Government; of those, 79 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the source, 132 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the Government and 320 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>252. The Working Group welcomes the cooperation it has received from the Government of 
Nepal in providing information for the clarification of cases. The Working Group urges the 
Government to report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Working Group 
following its country visit in 2004. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>253. The Working Group reminds the Government of Nepal of its obligations under article 14 
of the Declaration &#8220;to bring to justice all persons presumed responsible for an act of enforced 
disappearance&#8221;.

<p>254. The Working Group also reminds the Government of its obligations under article 16,

</b></p>
<p>267. The Working Group transmitted two cases under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government of Pakistan. One case concerned <b>Muhammad Kazim Bugti</b>, who was allegedly 
arrested on 29 November 2006. It is believed that Military Intelligence agencies are responsible 
for his disappearance. In another case, <b>Ghulam Mohammad Baloch</b>, president of Baloch 
National Movement, was taken away from a football club by the police in December 2006.

</b>  See annex V for the list of names of the newly reported cases of disappeared persons. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>268. The Working Group transmitted to the Government 29 cases under its standard procedure. 
The majority of these cases reportedly took place in Karachi between June 2005 and 
September 2006. It is believed that the police and intelligence agencies are responsible for most 
of these cases.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>269. The Working Group received three communications from the Government 
dated 22 December 2006, 11 and 16 July 2007. In the first communication, the Government sent 
information concerning 10 outstanding cases. In one case, the Working Group found that the 
response did not contain sufficient information to clarify the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared persons. For nine cases, the Working Group decided to apply the six-month rule. 
The majority of the responses stated that the victims had been released. In one case, the victim&#8217;s 
body was given to his family for burial; one family received compensation from the Government 
for his disappearance; and one man left the country.  
</p>
<p>270. In a communication dated 16 July 2007, the Government replied on one case which had 
been previously clarified by the source. The Government reported that the Pakistani authorities 
had confirmed that he was living at his residence.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>271. The Working Group received new information from the sources on two cases, stating that 
the victims had been released and handed over to their families. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>272. Based on information received from the Government, the Working Group decided to 
clarify 14 cases following the expiration of the six-month rule. In most cases, the current 
addresses of the subjects were provided. Two cases were clarified based on information provided 
by the sources.  
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>273. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>274. According to reports, the higher courts are unable to trace the whereabouts of disappeared 
persons, since they lack the power to search places of detention controlled by the military. It is 
also alleged that the right to habeas corpus has been systematically undermined, and in some 
cases, the courts have ordered that the disappeared persons be produced before the courts, but 
these orders have reportedly been ignored by the military. In addition, those released are warned 
not to speak publicly about their experiences in detention. No response was received from the 
Government regarding this general allegation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>275. The Working Group received reports referring to the state of emergency and the potential 
obstacles that this situation could pose for the implementation of the Declaration. A summary of 
the general allegation was sent to the Government after the eighty-third session and will be 
included in the 2008 annual report, as well as any comments received by the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>276. In previous years and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 
116 cases to the Government; of those, 6 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the source and 18 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the Government. There are eight cases under the six-month rule for which the time limit has been 
temporarily suspended by decision of the Working Group. For two cases, the Working Group 
decided to suspend the six-month rule. A total of 92 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>277. The Working Group expresses concern over the fact that during the period under review, it 
received reports on 32 recent cases. 
</p>
<p>278. On the other hand, the Working Group notes that 14 outstanding cases were clarified, and 
thanks the Government for its cooperation. 
</p>
<p>279. The Working Group wishes to remind the Government that, under article 7 of the 
Declaration, no circumstances whatsoever may be invoked to justify enforced disappearances.

<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>280. The Working Group reviewed a communication from the Government dated 
21 December 2006. However, the Working Group decided that the information submitted was 
insufficient to clarify the outstanding cases. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>281. In October 2007, the Working Group received a seven-page communication from the 
Government. In this communication, the Government provided information on the actions 
implemented regarding the issue of enforced disappearances in Peru. Mention was made of the 
Amnesty Law, and the fact that the Peruvian State acknowledged that the Amnesty Law lacked 
legal effect, and constituted an obstacle for the investigation and punishment of those responsible 
for the violation of the right to justice and truth. Reference was also made to the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission, to the National Council for Reparations, and to the High-level 
Cross-Sector Commission in charge of following up on State actions and policies regarding 
peace, collective reparation and national reconciliation. The communication further referred to 
Law 28413 on enforced disappearances, which aims at providing family members of victims of 
enforced disappearance from 1980 to 2000 with the necessary tools for their rights to be 
acknowledged. In connection with this, the Ombudsman Office may provide the families of the 
victims with a certificate of absence through enforced disappearance, which enables the family 
to start pertinent procedures and acknowledges the status of the disappeared person. The 
Working Group was also informed that during 2004 and 2005, Provincial Prosecutor Offices, 
Courts and a National Criminal Division were created for the investigation and prosecution of 
human rights violations, including enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>282. No information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>283. In 2006, information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning 
obstacles allegedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of 
Peru. This information was transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>284. In a communication dated 21 December 2006, the Government of Peru responded to the 
Working Group&#8217;s general allegation described in the 2006 report (A/HRC/4/41).  
</p>
<p>285. The Government stated:  
</p>
<p> &#8220;Since the current Minister of Defence was appointed in July 2006, he has ordered 
the armed forces to provide as much assistance and information as possible to judges and 
prosecutors in order to clarify any acts in which its personnel may have been involved, and 
this order is being complied with fully. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Despite these efforts, it has been impossible in some cases to provide the 
information requested, because there is no record of the circumstances surrounding the acts 
in question. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The use of pseudonyms by armed forces personnel who served in 
counter-subversion bases is one reason for this. The armed forces have no records of these 
pseudonyms, as these were a protection mechanism used by all personnel over short 
periods while undertaking missions. Furthermore, it has been found that the same 
pseudonym has been used by more than one person. In the case of personnel who served in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>counter-subversion bases, the only information that can be provided is that which appears 
in the personnel records of combat units (which were each responsible for several bases), 
as the appointment to serve in such a base was made verbally. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Personnel served in each base for short periods and were then moved to other bases 
under the responsibility of the combat unit, so that it is impossible to determine at which 
time they were in each base. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Ministry of Defence is working hard to improve its information system, thus 
demonstrating its commitment to work with the Peruvian justice system to clarify alleged 
violations of human rights in Peru.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>286. In previous years and during the period under review, the Working Group has transmitted a 
total of 3,006 cases to the Government; of those, 385 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the source, 253 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the Government and 2,368 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>287. The Working Group welcomes and appreciates the information provided by the 
Government in the communication received in October 2007, which describes measures that 
constitute the implementation of some of the provisions of the Declaration. The Working Group 
encourages the Government to provide information on the fate or whereabouts of the victims that 
could lead to the clarification of the 2,368 outstanding cases.

</b></p>
<p>288. The Working Group transmitted three cases under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government of the Philippines. <b>Abner Hizarsa</b> was arrested on 21 March 2007, and it is 
believed that the 24th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army is responsible for his 
disappearance. In another case, two human rights defenders, <b>Maria Luisa Dominado</b> and 
<b>Leonido Arado</b>, were allegedly shot at and taken away by the Philippine Army. 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>289. The Working Group transmitted 13 newly reported cases of disappearance in the 
Philippines. One case concerned two men who were reportedly arrested and taken to a military 
Camp. One case involved two brothers who were reportedly arrested and detained at a military 
Camp. In three separate cases, three men were arrested by the Philippine Army. Two cases 
concern a couple who reportedly disappeared on 26 October 2006 in General Santos City. 
Another case concerns a man who was arrested while he was travelling to San Mateo. The fourth 
case concerns a man, who was arrested in Cagayan de Oro City. The last case concerns a man 
who was arrested in April 2007 in Quezon City.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>290. The Government of the Philippines sent five communications to the Working Group. In a 
communication dated 8 November 2006, regarding efforts undertaken by the Government to 
implement the recommendations made following the visit to the Philippines by the Working 
Group in 1991, the Government addressed some of the recommendations, particularly with 
regards to separating the national police from the army, creating legislation to narrow powers of 
arrest, facilitating the search for missing persons, and witness protection.  
</p>
<p>291. In a communication dated 16 January 2007, the Government reported on the investigation 
of one case. The Working Group found that the response did not contain sufficient information 
to clarify the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person.  
</p>
<p>292. On 3 April 2007, the Government reported on the investigation of two cases, stating that 
the victims were safe and in good condition, and that one of them was temporarily staying and 
helping at the Philippine Army Camp. For these two cases, the Working Group decided to apply 
the six-month rule. 
</p>
<p>293. In the two communications dated 30 May 2007 and 7 June 2007, the Government 
responded saying that investigations were being carried out by the police with regards to three 
cases of disappearances. The Working Group considered that the information received was not 
sufficient to clarify the cases.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>294. The Working Group received new information from a source regarding three cases. 
Concerning two cases, the source reported that the victims had escaped their captors and had 
found sanctuary. In a third case, the subject&#8217;s body was never found and the case was resolved 
by the Ombudsman as unlawful arrest and violation of domicile.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>295. Two cases were clarified based on information provided by the sources.  
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>296. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>297. According to reports, the absence of an appropriate legal framework on enforced 
disappearances is denying victims and their families the possibility to seek justice and redress. 
Reportedly, no government agencies exist to help locate the disappeared, and police authorities 
have no jurisdiction or lack the capability to investigate the cases of disappearances.  
</p><p>298. When non-governmental organizations try to assist the families of the victims by going to 
police stations and military camps to inquire about the disappeared, they are reportedly either 
harassed or not welcomed by the police and the military.  
</p>
<p>299. No response was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>300. On 24 May 2006, the Working Group requested to undertake a mission to the Philippines. 
No response has been received from the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>301. In previous years and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 
774 cases to the Government; of those, 35 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the source, 124 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government and 615 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>302. The Working Group is deeply concerned about the newly reported cases in the Philippines. 
The Working Group encourages the Government to take steps to clarify outstanding cases, and 
reminds the Government of its obligations under the Declaration to prevent and to terminate all 
acts of enforced disappearance and to prosecute alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>303. The Working Group express its appreciation for the information submitted by the 
Government of the Philippines regarding the efforts undertaken to address the recommendations 
made by the Working Group to the Government following its visit in 1990. The Working Group 
regrets that the information did not address all recommendations, and welcomes any further 
information on the pending recommendations.  
</p>
<p>304. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligation under article 4 of the 
Declaration to make all acts of enforced disappearance &#8220;offences under criminal law punishable 
by appropriate penalties which shall take into account their extreme seriousness&#8221;, and its </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>obligations under article 13, paragraph 5, of the Declaration, to take steps to ensure that any 
ill-treatment, intimidation, reprisal or any other form of interference on the occasion of the 
lodging of a complaint or during the investigation procedure is appropriately punished.  
</p>
<p>305. The Working Group reaffirms its request to the Government of the Philippines for a 
country visit aimed at clarifying the 615 outstanding cases.

in Karabulak by law enforcement officials and members of the Federal Security Service. The 
other case concerned <b>Abdulaziz Murodullayevich Boymatov</b>, who was allegedly arrested in 
the District Department of Internal Affairs of the Nizhneserginsk region, Sverdlovsk district of 
the Russian Federation, by the Uzbek National Security Service and Interior Ministry officials, 
as well as by Russian police officers from the District Department of Internal Affairs of the

provided additional information on outstanding cases of enforced disappearance. However, the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Working Group decided that the information submitted was insufficient to clarify the

</p>
<p><b>Information from sources

<p>309. Information was received from sources regarding two outstanding cases. The source 
presented many questions to the Working Group regarding the investigations undertaken by the 
Russian Federation authorities, which were transmitted to the Government. Sources also replied 
to a case concerning a 34-year-old Armenian citizen, stating that they believe the disappeared is 
being held in a psychiatric hospital in Chekhov.  
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>310. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning obstacles allegedly 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>311. NGOs alleged that impunity for cases of enforced disappearances in Chechnya continues to 
prevail. The Working Group was informed that, although the public prosecutor&#8217;s office has 
opened investigations in thousands of cases of enforced disappearance, NGOs are aware of only 
a handful of cases in which a State official has actually been prosecuted, and in no case has a 
State official been prosecuted for the enforced disappearance itself. 
</p>
<p>312. No reply was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>313. The Working Group proposed September 2007 for a country visit to the Russian 
Federation, following prior agreement in principle by the Government for the visit. However, the 
Government transmitted a communication on 6 February 2007, reaffirming its agreement in 
principle to receive a visit, but stating that the proposed date would no longer be possible; the 
visit could take place once the review of special procedures mandates was completed by the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>314. In previous years and during the period under review, the Working Group has transmitted 
468 cases to the Government; of those, 10 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the source, 1 case has been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 457 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>315. The Working Group encourages the Government to respond to its general allegation letter 
and to take steps to clarify outstanding cases, including the large number of unresolved cases </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>arising from the conflicts in the northern Caucasus. The Working Group reiterates to the 
Government its obligation under the Declaration to prevent and to terminate all acts of enforced 
disappearance and to prosecute alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>316. The Working Group regrets that dates have not been set to visit the country, and would like 
to receive an invitation, regardless of the Human Rights Council&#8217;s completion of the review of 
mandates.  
</p>
<p>317. The Working Group continues to be concerned about suspension of investigations in 
disappearance cases and wishes to remind the Government of its obligations to conduct thorough 
and impartial investigations &#8220;for as long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance 
remains unclarified&#8221;, in accordance with article 13, paragraph 6, of the Declaration.

<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>319. Information was received from sources concerning the case of a man who disappeared 
in 2003 in Kigali. He had been a member of the National Assembly until it was dissolved in 
May 2003. In 2003, the Governing Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union adopted a 
resolution on this case, which it continues to follow. 
</p>
<p><b>Discontinuation of cases 
</b></p>
<p>320. Over the years, the Working Group has made numerous attempts to contact the source of 
the one outstanding case, but to no avail. The Working Group decided, in accordance with its 
methods of work, to discontinue consideration of this case. The Working Group believes that it 
no longer has a useful role to play in trying to elucidate the whereabouts of the person 
concerned, as no follow-up can be given to the case. It can be reopened at any time if presented 
again to the Working Group. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

<p><b>Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>330. The Working Group sent 37 cases under its urgent action procedure to the Government of 
Sri Lanka. The majority of these cases concerned males aged between 22 and 56. One case 
concerned a female victim and one case concerned a 16-year-old male. Eleven cases occurred in 
Jaffna and 19 in Colombo. The Sri Lankan Army and the Criminal Investigation Department 
were allegedly responsible for a large number of these cases. Other possible perpetrators include 
the Sri Lankan security forces, the police, and the Karuna Group. 
</p>

</p>

  </b>The Working Group determined that 378 outstanding cases were duplications and were 
</p>
<p>subsequently deleted. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>331. The Working Group also transmitted 107 cases to the Government under its standard 
procedure. The majority of the cases took place between January 2006 and April 2007. Most 
cases concerned males between 20 and 35, although one case concerned a pregnant female, and 
two cases concerned minors. Seven cases concern humanitarian aid workers, and two concern 
fishermen. The Sri Lankan Army, the Police and the Criminal Investigation Department were 
allegedly responsible for most of these cases. The vast majority of cases occurred in Colombo, 
although several cases of disappearances also occurred in Jaffna, Vavuniya, and Wellawatta. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>332. The Government transmitted two communications to the Working Group. In a 
communication dated 17 January 2007, the Government requested further information on three 
outstanding cases in order to launch proper investigations. 
</p>
<p>333. In a communication dated 26 April 2007, the Government replied on a case regarding a 
priest who disappeared in August 2006. The Government stated that the case had been placed 
before the Commission of Inquiry and the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons. 
In addition, the Government informed that a body presumed to be that of the priest&#8217;s had been 
discovered in March 2007, and that arrangements had been made to conduct the necessary 
forensic examinations. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>334. The source provided additional information on two outstanding cases. Concerning one case 
which reportedly took place in June 2006, the source informed that a police officer approached 
the subject&#8217;s family and unofficially acknowledged that the victim had been killed by Security 
Forces. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>335. Following the expiration of the six-month rule, the Working Group decided to clarify the 
case of a man who disappeared in 1989. 
</p>
<p><b>Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>336. The Working Group met with representatives of the Government of Sri Lanka in March to 
discuss outstanding cases and the request for a visit to Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>337. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>338. According to the reports, there is a growing culture of impunity for perpetrators of 
enforced disappearance, as the Government is not taking effective steps to bring rising numbers 
of disappearances under control. The path to achieving justice for the victims and their families 
is reportedly long and arduous, with delays and interferences by high officials in investigations 
and inquiries, as well as threats to witnesses and family members. 
</p>
<p>339. The Government&#8217;s announcement that it would invite an international commission to 
inquire into recent killings, disappearances and abductions in Sri Lanka promised to be a very 
important initiative. Nevertheless, announcements that the International Independent Group of 
Eminent Persons would only observe the work of the national Commission of Inquiry cast doubt 
on whether the International Group will be perceived as credible and independent by all sectors 
of society. 
</p>
<p>340. No response was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>341. On 16 October 2006, the Working Group requested to undertake a mission to Sri Lanka in 
early 2007. The Government replied, stating that it would not be possible to schedule a visit for 
the Working Group during the requested period due to the planned visits of other special 
procedure mandates, but that the interest of the Working Group would be noted and given due 
consideration. 
</p>
<p>342. At the meeting held by the Working Group with representatives of the Government of 
Sri Lanka during the fourth session of the Human Rights Council, efforts were made to arrange 
the dates for the visit. 
</p>
<p><b> Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>343. In previous years and during the year under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 12,463 cases to the Government; of those, 39 cases have been clarified on the basis 
of information provided by the source, 6,530 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the Government, 378 cases were found to be duplications by the 
Working Group and were therefore deleted, and 5,516 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>344. The Working Group is gravely concerned at the increase in reported cases of recent 
enforced disappearances in the country. The Working Group is particularly concerned about the 
new worrying trend concerning recently reported cases in Colombo, in addition to the cases that 
have reportedly occurred in Jaffna, which seem to indicate a widespread pattern of 
disappearances in the country. 
</p>
<p>345. The Working Group is also concerned that many other cases may be occurring in the 
country and are not being reported because of fear of reprisals. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>346. The Working Group thanks the Government for the reply to its request for a country visit, 
and looks forward to receiving proposed dates as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>347. The Working Group encourages the Government to report on the further implementation of 
the recommendations emanating from the Working Group visits in 1991, 1992 and 1999. 
</p>
<p>348. The Working Group reminds the Government of Sri Lanka of its obligations under article 3 
of the Declaration to &#8220;take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to 
prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory under its jurisdiction&#8221;.

<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>358. The Working Group transmitted three cases to the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic. <b>Abdel-Nasser Khor Al-Masri </b>and<b> Mohamed Ali Abdel-Rahman</b> were reportedly 
arrested in Lebanon by Lebanese Army Intelligence officers, Syrian Intelligence Service officers, 
and the Syrian Army. The third case concerns <b>Dany</b> <b>Mansourati</b>, who was allegedly arrested by 
Syrian Intelligence Service officers in Syria. All victims are reportedly detained in prisons in 
Syria. 
</p>
<p>359. The Working Group transmitted a case to the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic that 
had been originally transmitted to the Government of Jordan. According to the information 
received from the source, the subject was last seen at a prison in Syria in 1997. According to the 
Working Group&#8217;s methods of work, the case will be deleted from Jordan&#8217;s statistics and 
transferred to Syria, where the person was reportedly last seen. 
</p>
<p>360. According to the Working Group&#8217;s methods of work, the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic received a copy of the case concerning <b>Elias Emile Al-Harmouch</b>, who was allegedly 
arrested in Beirut by the Syrian Intelligence Service. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>361. The Working Group received two communications from the Government, both 
dated 10 July 2006. The Working Group decided that, in one case, the reply had sufficient 
information on the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person and could constitute 
clarifications, provided the source did not raise an objection within six months. The Working 
Group decided that the information provided for two cases was not sufficient to clarify the cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>362. Responses were received from sources regarding three outstanding cases. In one case, the 
source stated that the subject was released from prison and is currently living in Lebanon. On 
another case, the source reported that no new information had been provided to the subject&#8217;s 
family regarding his fate or whereabouts. 
</p>
<p>363. The Working Group received new information from the source on one case which had 
been sent to the Government of Jordan. The source informed that the subject was seen at the 
Tadmour and Said Nayyeh (Sednaya) prisons in the Syrian Arab Republic in 1997. According to 
the Working Group&#8217;s methods of work, the case will be transferred to Syria, where the person 
was reportedly last seen. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>364. Based on information received from the Government, the Working Group decided to 
clarify one case following the expiration of the six-month rule. In this case, the Government 
provided the location of the place of detention. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>365. In previous years and during the year under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 44 cases to the Government; of those, 14 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the source, 12 cases have been clarified on the basis of information

<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>382. The Working Group reviewed two communications from the Government of Turkey 
dated 29 January and 9 May 2007. In both communications, the Government of Turkey provided 
death certificates related to five cases, to which the Working Group decided to apply the 
six-month rule. 
</p>
<p>383. The Government also replied in 12 other cases, concerning people having disappeared 
between 1991 and 2001. Most of the replies indicated that investigations by local authorities 
were ongoing. In several cases, the Government indicated that the Prosecutor had concluded that 
the cases fell under the jurisdiction of military courts. The Working Group decided that the 
responses were considered insufficient to clarify the cases. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>384. No information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>385. The Working Group decided to clarify 12 cases where the six-month rule had been 
previously applied. Since no new observations were received from the source, these cases are 
now considered clarified. 
</p>
<p><b>Discontinuation of cases 
</b></p>
<p>386. The Working Group decided, in accordance with its method of work, to discontinue 
consideration of one case. The Working Group has made numerous attempts to contact the 
source, but to no avail. The Working Group believes that it no longer has a useful role to play in 
trying to elucidate the whereabouts of the person involved, as no follow-up can be given to the 
case. The case can be reopened at any time if presented again to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>387. In previous years and during the period under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 181 cases to the Government; of those, 49 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the source, 61 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the Government, and 1 case has been discontinued. For 3 cases, the Working Group 
decided to suspend the six-month rule. A total of 70 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>388. The Working Group would like to remind the Government that according to article 16 of 
the Declaration &#8220;persons alleged to have committed any of the acts referred to in article 4, 
paragraph 1, of the Declaration, shall be tried only by the competent ordinary courts in each

disclosed how many individuals were secretly detained. The Government of the United States 
has reportedly constructed a wide-ranging detention system for terrorism suspects. It is alleged 
that this system includes detention in secret United States-controlled detention facilities outside 
the United States.

<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>416. The Working Group examined two communications sent by the Government 
on 7 May 2007, and 8 August 2007 concerning the three outstanding cases. Regarding one case, 
the Government reported that the four people who had been charged with his murder had been 
acquitted. In the case of a 20-year-old woman alleged to have disappeared with her infant son 
on 1 April 1986, the Government reported that there were no records of the mother&#8217;s case. The 
Government informed that these two cases are now closed. The Working Group decided that the 
Government information was insufficient to clarify these cases.

</b></p>
<p>419. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations to conduct thorough and 
impartial investigations &#8220;for as long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains 
unclarified&#8221;, in accordance with article 13, paragraph 6, of the Declaration.

<p>420. There was no activity during the period under review. A summary of the situation in the 
country appears in the 2005 report (E/CN.4/2006/56). 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  AREAS OF CONCERN, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>421<b>. In 2007, the Working Group transmitted 629 newly reported cases of disappearance 
to 29 Governments, 84 of which allegedly occurred during 2007. The Working Group used 
the urgent action procedure for 65 of these cases, which allegedly occurred within the 
three months preceding the receipt of the report by the Working Group. During the 
reporting period, the Working Group was able to clarify 224 cases of disappearance. The 
Working Group discontinued 6 cases. The Working Group is grateful for the cooperation 
received from a number of Governments. Nevertheless, it remains concerned that, of the 
78 States with outstanding cases, some Governments (Burundi, Guinea, Israel, 
Mozambique, Namibia and Seychelles, as well as the Palestinian Authority), have never 
replied to the Working Group&#8217;s communications. Some Governments provide responses 
that do not contain relevant information. The Working Group urges those Governments to 
fulfil their obligations under the Declaration, the resolutions of the General Assembly, the 
Commission on Human Rights and its successor, the Human Rights Council. The 
cooperation of Governments is indispensable to discovering the fate or whereabouts of 
disappeared persons around the globe.</b> 
</p>
<p>422.<b> The Working Group is still very concerned about the phenomenon of underreporting. 
The Working Group considers that cases of disappearances are happening in certain parts 
of the world, without being reported to the Working Group. This is owing to a variety of 
reasons, including that in a number of countries, particularly in those which have been 
through internal armed conflict, national institutions, including the judicial system, as well 
as security forces have collapsed. The underreporting phenomenon may also be due to 
conditions of poverty, lack of effective civil society organizations and activities, policies 
limiting the activities of NGOs, harassment of human rights defenders, prosecutors and 
judges, families and victims of disappearances. The Working Group strongly urges States 
to establish solid legal frameworks that guarantee NGOs to undertake their work freely.</b> 
</p>
<p>423. <b>In various cases, countries that have gone through or are going through a difficult 
situation of internal disorder or with high rates of criminality, sometimes use the armed 
forces to undertake police activities, under the excuse that the police forces are incapable of 
coping with the maintenance of public order. The Working Group is convinced that the 
duties of the armed forces are different from those of the police force. In a large number of 
cases of reported disappearances worldwide, the armed forces themselves are reported to 
be responsible for the disappearances. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>424. <b>The Working Group received information from a number of countries indicating that 
the investigating authorities are themselves part of the military forces. In addition, trials 
are being held before military tribunals, contrary to article 16, paragraph 2, of the 
Declaration. The Working Group finds that this does not guarantee the independence of 
the investigations or the impartiality of the courts, particularly when the presumed 
perpetrator is part of the military. 
</b></p>
<p>425. <b>The Working Group received information that in some cases, investigations were 
suspended or closed, producing a situation that gives rise to impunity, in contradiction to 
article 18 of the Declaration. Governments are reminded of their obligations under 
article 13, paragraph 6, of the Declaration, which provides that investigations should be 
able to be conducted for as long as the fate of the victim remains unclarified. 
</b></p>
<p>426. <b>In the same vein, the Working Group received allegations concerning the enactment 
or existence of amnesty laws. These laws not only have granted the benefit of grace to 
presumed perpetrators of grave human rights violations, including disappearances, but 
also exclude the possibility to conduct investigations that could lead to the fair 
implementation of justice and the right to truth. On the other hand, the Working Group 
also received reports on countries where laws of this nature have been declared invalid, an 
action that the Working Group considers highly commendable. 
</b></p>
<p>427. <b>During this year, the Working Group adopted an important general comment 
intended to give an interpretation of the definition of enforced disappearance that is most 
conducive to the protection of the victims and their families. One of the issues highlighted 
by the general comment, which is a main concern to the Working Group, is the practice of 
short-term disappearances. Under international human rights law, if a detention, even if 
short-term, is followed by an extrajudicial execution, it is considered an enforced 
disappearance proper, as long as such deprivation of liberty was carried out by 
governmental agents or private individuals acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct 
or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the Government, and, subsequent to the detention, 
or even after the execution was carried out, the Government refuses to disclose the fate or 
whereabouts of the victim or refuses to acknowledge the act having been perpetrated at all. 
</b></p>
<p>428. <b>The Working Group received reports of the enactment of legislation in a number of 
countries which weakens guarantees of due process and personal freedom, as part of the 
strategy against terrorism. The Working Group also received allegations of persons being 
arrested and kept in secret detention centres, sometimes in a country different from the 
country where they were arrested, and where they may be allegedly tortured. In many 
instances, their whereabouts remain unknown for a prolonged period of time. The 
Working Group reminds Governments to comply with their obligations under the 
Declaration, particularly with regards to articles 7 (no circumstances whatsoever may be 
invoked to justify enforced disappearances), 8 (no State shall expel, return (refouler) or 
extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds to believe that s/he 
would be in danger of enforced disappearance), 9 (right of all persons deprived of their 
liberty to a prompt and effective judicial remedy), and 10 (any person deprived of liberty 
shall be held in an officially recognized place of detention, accurate information on the </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>detention and transfer of such persons should be made promptly available to their families 
and counsel, and an official up-to-date register of detainees must be available in every place 
of detention). 
</b>429. <b>The Working Group reiterates that, in many cases where disappearances arise from 
conditions of armed conflict not of an international character, the way to an enduring and 
sustainable solution is for the international community to take concerted action aimed at 
tackling the root causes that give rise to such internal situations. It is crucial that early 
warning indicators pointing to the occurrence of or potential for disappearances be 
monitored with a view to preventing this phenomenon. The Working Group is convinced 
that well-thought-out policies and actions directed at breaking the vicious cycle of 
increasing poverty that gives rise to conflict are among the essential preventive measures to 
consider in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>430. <b>The preventive measures noted above are particularly aimed at democratizing the 
structures of governance, making human rights the cornerstone of public policy, and 
empowering civil society organizations to act as watchdogs. Governments should take steps 
to create and support specific bodies and institutions charged with addressing 
disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p>431. <b>The principles of the Declaration should be disseminated through the mass media for 
the purpose of public education. 
</b></p>
<p>432. <b>These principles, along with all other human rights norms, should be incorporated in 
the curriculum of the police academies and training programmes of security forces. 
</b></p>
<p>433. <b>The Working Group reiterates its encouragement to the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to promote the Declaration and to include in its 
programme of technical cooperation the strengthening of national capacities for the 
prevention and eradication of disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p><b>V.  ADOPTION OF THE REPORT

<p><b>ANNEXES  
</b></p>
<p><b>Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><b>REVISED METHODS OF WORK OF THE WORKING GROUP 
(adopted on 30 November 2007) 
</b></p>
<p><b>Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group&#8217;s methods of work are based on its mandate, as stipulated originally 
in Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) and as developed by the Commission 
in numerous further resolutions. The parameters of its work are laid down in the Charter of the 
United Nations, the International Bill of Human Rights, Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1235 (XLI) and the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992 
(hereinafter referred to as &#8220;the Declaration&#8221;). 
</p>
<p><b>Definition of enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>2. As defined in the preambular part of the Declaration, enforced disappearances occur when 
persons are arrested, detained or abducted against their will or otherwise deprived of their liberty 
by officials of different branches or levels of Government or by organized groups or private 
individuals acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of 
the Government, followed by a refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the persons 
concerned or a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, which places such persons 
outside the protection of the law. Enforced disappearance has been defined as a crime against 
humanity in article 7 (1) (i) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p><b>Basic mandate 
</b></p>
<p>3. The basic mandate of the Working Group is humanitarian in nature, aimed at assisting 
families in determining the fate and whereabouts of their missing relatives who, having 
disappeared, are placed outside the protection of the law. To this end, the Working Group 
endeavours to establish a channel of communication between the families and the Governments 
concerned, with a view to ensuring that sufficiently documented and clearly identified individual 
cases which families, directly or indirectly, have brought to the Group&#8217;s attention are 
investigated with a view to clarifying the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons.  
</p>
<p><b>The Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>4. In addition to its original mandate, the Working Group has been entrusted by the 
General Assembly, the former Commission on Human Rights and its successor, the Human 
Rights Council, with various tasks. In particular, the Working Group is to monitor States&#8217; 
compliance with their obligations deriving from the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance and to provide to Governments assistance in its implementation. 
States are under an obligation to take effective measures to prevent and terminate acts of 
enforced disappearance by making them continuing offences under criminal law and establishing 
civil liability of those responsible. The Declaration also refers to the right to a prompt and 
effective judicial remedy, as well as unhampered access of national authorities to all places of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>detention, the right to habeas corpus, the maintenance of centralized registers of all places of 
detention, the duty to investigate fully all alleged cases of disappearance, the duty to try alleged 
perpetrators of acts of disappearance before ordinary (not military) courts, the exemption of the 
criminal offence of acts of enforced disappearances from statutes of limitation, special amnesty 
laws and similar measures leading to impunity.  
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group reminds the Governments of these obligations not only in the context 
of clarifying individual cases but also that of taking action of a more general nature. It draws the 
attention of Governments and non-governmental organizations to general or specific aspects of 
the Declaration, it recommends ways of overcoming obstacles to the realization of the 
Declaration, it discusses with representatives of Governments and non-governmental 
organizations how to solve specific problems in the light of the Declaration, it assists 
Governments by carrying out on-the-spot visits, organizing seminars and providing similar 
advisory services. The Working Group also makes observations on the implementation of the 
Declaration when the concerned Government has not fulfilled its obligations related to the rights 
to truth, justice and reparation. The Working Group adopts general comments whenever it 
considers that a provision of the Declaration requires further clarification or interpretation. 
</p>
<p><b>Admissibility of reports on disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>6. Reports on disappearances are considered admissible by the Working Group when they 
originate from the family or friends of the missing person. Such reports may, however, be 
channelled to the Working Group through representatives of the family, Governments, 
intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and other reliable sources. 
They must be submitted in writing with a clear indication of the identity of the sender; if the 
source is other than a family member, it must be in a position to follow up with the relatives of 
the disappeared person concerning his or her fate.  
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group does not deal with situations of international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>Elements for admissibility 
</b></p>
<p>8. In order to enable Governments to carry out meaningful investigations, the Working Group 
provides them with information containing at least a minimum of basic data. In addition, the 
Working Group constantly urges the senders of reports to furnish as many details as possible 
concerning the identity of the disappeared person and the circumstances of the disappearance. 
The Group requires the following minimum elements:  
</p>
<p> (a) Full name of the missing person and, if possible, age, gender, nationality, and 
occupation or profession; 
</p>
<p> (b) Date of disappearance, i.e. day, month and year of arrest or abduction, or day, month 
and year when the disappeared person was last seen. When the disappeared person was last seen 
in a detention centre, an approximate indication is sufficient (for example, March or 
spring 1990); 
</p>
<p> (c) Place of arrest or abduction, or where the disappeared person was last seen 
(indication of town or village, at least); </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (d) Parties presumed to have carried out the arrest or abduction or to be holding the 
disappeared person in unacknowledged detention; 
</p>
<p> (e) Steps taken by the family to determine the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared 
person, or at least an indication that efforts to resort to domestic remedies were frustrated or have 
otherwise been inconclusive;  
</p>
<p> (f) A case should be submitted to the Working Group by a reliable source, which, if 
other than a family member, must indicate whether the reported victim&#8217;s family has given their 
direct consent that this case be submitted to the Working Group on their behalf. 
</p>
<p>9. If a case is not admitted, the Working Group sends a response to the source indicating that 
the information received did not fulfil the established requirements, in order to permit the source 
to provide all relevant information. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication with Governments 
</b></p>
<p>10. In transmitting cases of disappearance, the Working Group deals exclusively with 
Governments, basing itself on the principle that Governments must assume responsibility for any 
violation of human rights on their territory.  
</p>
<p><b>Perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Working Group operates on the basis that, and in accordance with the definition 
contained in the Preamble of the Declaration, for purposes of its work, enforced disappearances 
are only considered as such when the act in question is perpetrated by State actors or by private 
individuals or organized groups (e.g. paramilitary groups) acting on behalf of, or with the 
support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the Government. Based on the above, the 
Working Group does not admit cases when they are attributed to persons or groups not acting on 
behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the Government, 
such as terrorist or insurgent movements fighting the Government in its own territory. 
</p>
<p><b>Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>12. Reported cases of disappearances are placed before the Working Group for detailed 
examination during its sessions. Those which fulfil the requirements outlined above are 
transmitted, upon the Working Group&#8217;s specific authorization, to the Governments concerned 
with the request that they carry out investigations and inform the Working Group about the 
results. These cases are communicated by letter from the Working Group&#8217;s Chairperson to the 
Government concerned through the Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office at 
Geneva. 
</p>
<p>13. Any substantive additional information which the sources submit on an outstanding case is 
placed before the Working Group and, following its approval, transmitted to the Government 
concerned. If the additional information received amounts to a clarification of the case, the 
Government is informed immediately without awaiting the Group&#8217;s next session.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeals 
</b></p>
<p>14. Cases that have occurred within the three months preceding receipt of the report by the 
Working Group are transmitted directly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the country 
concerned by the most direct and rapid means. Their transmission can be authorized by the 
Chairman on the basis of a specific delegation of power given to him by the Working Group. 
Cases which occurred prior to the three-month limit, but not more than one year before the date 
of their receipt by the Secretariat, provided that they had some connection with a case which 
occurred within the three-month period, can be transmitted between sessions by letter, upon 
authorization by the Chairman. The Working Group provides the source with a copy of the 
summary of each urgent action, thus helping it to enter into communication with the authorities 
on the case concerned.  
</p>
<p><b>Pregnancy 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the case of the disappearance of a pregnant woman, the child presumed to have been 
born during the mother&#8217;s captivity should be mentioned in the description of the case of the 
mother. The child would be treated as a separate case when witnesses reported that the mother 
had actually given birth to a child during detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Situations of vulnerability 
</b></p>
<p>16. With respect to reported cases of disappearances, the Working Group highlights the 
condition of people in situations of vulnerability, including women, children, the elderly, persons 
with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p><b>Cases concerning two or more countries 
</b></p>
<p>17. Reports on a disappearance indicating that officials from one country are directly 
responsible for or involved in a disappearance in another country, or cases where officials from 
more than one country were directly responsible for or involved in the disappearance would be 
communicated to all Governments concerned. However, the case would only be counted in the 
statistics of the country in which the person was reportedly arrested, detained, abducted or last 
seen. The same principles are applied with respect to the transmission of general allegations and 
prompt interventions. 
</p>
<p><b>Government replies 
</b></p>
<p>18. All replies received from Governments concerning reports of disappearances are examined 
by the Working Group and summarized in the Working Group&#8217;s annual report to the Human 
Rights Council. Any information given on specific cases is forwarded to the sources of those 
reports, who are invited to make observations thereon or to provide additional details on the 
cases. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Reminders 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Working Group reminds every Government concerned once a year of the cases which 
have not yet been clarified and twice a year of all urgent action cases transmitted during the 
preceding six months for which no clarification has been received. On request, the Working 
Group provides to the Government concerned or the source, to the extent possible, updated 
information on specific cases.  
</p>
<p><b>Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>20. Clarification occurs when the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons are clearly 
established as a result of investigations by the Government, inquiries by non-governmental 
organizations, fact-finding missions by the Working Group or by human rights personnel from 
the United Nations or from any other international organization operating in the field, or by the 
search of the family, irrespective of whether the person is alive or dead. 
</p>
<p><b>The six-month rule 
</b></p>
<p>21. Any reply of the Government containing detailed information on the fate or whereabouts 
of the disappeared person is transmitted to the source. If the source does not respond within six 
months of the date on which the Government&#8217;s reply was communicated to it, or if it contests the 
Government&#8217;s information on grounds which are considered unreasonable by the Working 
Group, the case is considered clarified and is accordingly listed under the heading &#8220;Cases 
clarified by the Government&#8217;s response&#8221; in the statistical summary of the annual report. If the 
source contests the Government&#8217;s information on reasonable grounds, the Government is so 
informed and invited to comment. 
</p>
<p><b>Closed cases 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Working Group may consider a case closed when the competent authority specified in 
the relevant national law pronounces, with the concurrence of the relatives and other interested 
parties, on the presumption of death of a person reported missing. Presumption of death should at 
all times respect the right to adequate compensation.  
</p>
<p><b>Discontinuation of cases 
</b></p>
<p>23. In exceptional circumstances, the Working Group may decide to discontinue the 
consideration of cases where the families have manifested, freely and indisputably, their desire 
not to pursue the case any further, or when the source is no longer in existence or is unable to 
follow up the case and steps taken by the Working Group to establish communication with other 
sources have proven unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p><b>Outstanding cases 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Working Group considers cases as outstanding for as long as they have not been 
clarified, closed or discontinued in accordance with the methods of work. This principle is not 
affected by changes of Government in a given country nor in the event of State succession. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Reopening of cases 
</b></p>
<p>25. If sources provide well-documented information that a case has been considered clarified 
or closed erroneously, because the Government&#8217;s reply referred to a different person, does not 
correspond to the reported situation or has not reached the source within the six-month period 
referred to above, the Working Group transmits the case to the Government anew, requesting it 
to comment. In such instances, the case in question is again listed among the outstanding cases 
and a specific explanation is given in the Working Group&#8217;s report to the Human Rights Council, 
describing the above-mentioned errors or discrepancies. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegations 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Working Group regularly transmits to the Governments concerned a summary of 
allegations received from relatives of missing persons and non-governmental organizations with 
regard to obstacles encountered in the implementation of the Declaration in their respective 
countries, inviting them to comment thereon if they so wish. 
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>27. Cases of intimidation, persecution or reprisal against relatives of missing persons, 
witnesses to disappearances or their families, members of organizations of relatives and other 
non-governmental organizations, human rights defenders or individuals concerned with 
disappearances are transmitted to the pertinent Governments, with the appeal that they take steps 
to protect all the fundamental rights of the persons affected. Cases of that nature, which require 
prompt intervention, are transmitted directly to the Ministers for Foreign Affairs by the most 
direct and rapid means. To that end, the Working Group has authorized its Chairperson to 
transmit such cases between sessions. 
</p>
<p><b>Cooperation with other mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>28. If a case or allegation contains information relevant to other thematic mechanisms of the 
Council, the information is transmitted to the mechanism concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>Country missions 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Working Group carries out visits to countries on invitation, but also takes the initiative 
of approaching Governments with a view to carrying out visits to countries, when considered 
appropriate. Such visits are intended to enhance the dialogue between the authorities most 
directly concerned, the families or their representatives and the Working Group, and to assist in 
the clarification of the reported disappearances. The Working Group reports to the Council on its 
country visits in an addendum to its annual report. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>30. With regard to countries in which visits have been carried out, the Working Group 
periodically reminds the Governments concerned of the observations and recommendations 
formulated in the respective reports, requesting information on the consideration given to them, 
and the steps taken for their implementation or the constraints which might have prevented their 
implementation. The Working Group may also take the initiative to carry out follow-up visits. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Working Group meets three times a year to consider the information brought to its 
attention since its previous session. Its meetings are held in private. However, the Working 
Group regularly meets with representatives of Governments, non-governmental organizations, 
family members and witnesses.  
</p>
<p><b>Reports 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Working Group reports annually to the Human Rights Council on the activities which 
it has carried out from the end of Council&#8217;s previous session up until the last day of the Working 
Group&#8217;s third annual session. It informs the Council of its communications with Governments 
and non-governmental organizations, its meetings and missions. Reports on missions are 
contained as addenda to the main report. The Working Group reports on all cases of 
disappearance received by the Working Group during the year, on a country by country basis, 
and on the decision it has taken thereon. It provides the Council with a statistical summary for 
each country of cases transmitted to the Government, clarifications, and the status of the person 
concerned on the date of clarification. It includes graphs showing the development of 
disappearances in countries with more than 100 transmitted cases as of the date of the adoption 
by the Working Group of its annual report. The Working Group includes conclusions and 
recommendations in its report and makes observations on the situation of disappearances in 
individual countries. The Working Group further reports on the implementation of the 
Declaration and the obstacles encountered therein, and periodically reports on broader issues 
surrounding the phenomenon of enforced disappearance.
