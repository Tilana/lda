<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to Council 
resolution 22/7, in which it requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a report, in consultation with States, United 
Nations agencies, funds and programmes, non-governmental organizations and other 
relevant stakeholders, on legal, administrative, economic, physical and any other barriers to 
access to universal birth registration and possession of documentary proof of birth, as well 
as on good practices adopted by States in fulfilling their obligation to ensure birth 
registration, and to submit it to the Council at its twenty-seventh session. 
</p>
<p>2. OHCHR received contributions from States, intergovernmental organizations, 
national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and academia.1  
</p>
<p><b> II. Birth registration: overview 
</b></p>
<p>3. Birth registration is a fundamental right, recognized by article 24, paragraph 2 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 7 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. The fulfilment of the right to be registered at birth is closely linked to 
the realization of many other rights; socioeconomic rights, such as the right to health and 
the right to education, are at particular risk where birth registration is not systematically 
carried out, and the protection of children is jeopardized.  
</p><p>4. Birth registration is the continuous, permanent and universal recording within the 
civil registry of the occurrence and characteristics of birth, in accordance with the national 
legal requirements. It establishes the existence of a person under law, and lays the 
foundation for safeguarding civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.2 As such, it 
is a fundamental means of protecting the human rights of the individual. 
</p>
<p>5. On a procedural level, birth registration involves three interrelated processes. First, 
there must be the declaration of the occurrence of the birth to civil registrars. Second, once 
notified, civil registrars officially record the birth. Registration should include the 
individual&#8217;s name, date and place of birth, as well as, where possible, the name, age or date 
of birth, place of usual residence and nationality of both parents. Third, the State issues a 
birth certificate, a personal document to attest birth registration and the most visible 
evidence of the State&#8217;s legal recognition of the child. Whether this procedure is followed 
automatically after registration or requires another application depends on the country; it is 
vital, however, that this document is accessible easily and provided free of charge. 
</p>
<p>6. While the global rate of birth registration grew from approximately 58 to 65 per cent 
between 2000 and 2010, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 230 
million children under the age of 5 still have not been registered.3 Non-registration is a 
particularly serious problem in developing countries, in sub-Saharan Africa, and in Asia; 
however, even in industrialized countries with high overall rates of birth registration, 
pockets of marginalized and disadvantaged groups who are not registered are often

<p>encountered. Furthermore, the quality of registration systems is also important, and should 
be accurate, efficient and permanent.  
</p>
<p>7. Birth registration should be part of a wider civil registration system that includes the 
free and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of key events &#8211; births, 
deaths, adoptions, marriages and divorces &#8211; and other civil status events pertaining to the 
population. These records are the main source of vital statistics; the complete coverage, 
accuracy and timeliness of civil registration is therefore essential, as is the confidentiality of 
personal data handled by the system. These two systems are interrelated and must be 
developed holistically; improvements in birth registration are rarely possible without the 
improvement of the civil registration system as a whole.4  
</p>
<p><b> III. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. The right to birth registration and the right of everyone to recognition everywhere as 
a person before the law is a universal human right, first acknowledged in article 6 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and specifically recognized in article 24, paragraph 
2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states that every child 
shall be registered immediately after birth. In its general comment No. 17 on the rights of 
the child,5 the Human Rights Committee stated that article 24, paragraph 2 should be 
interpreted as being closely linked to the right to special measures of protection, and that 
the main purpose of the obligation to register children after birth is to reduce the danger of 
abduction, sale of or traffic in children, or of other types of treatment that are incompatible 
with the enjoyment of the rights provided for in the Covenant. 
</p><p>9. The Convention on the Rights of the Child reinforces the fundamental importance of 
the right to birth registration in its article 7, which states that the child should be registered 
immediately after birth and have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a 
nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents. 
It further provides for States parties to ensure the implementation of these rights in 
accordance with their national law and their obligations under the relevant international 
instruments in this field, in particular where the child would otherwise be stateless. 
</p>
<p>10. All rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including article 7, must 
be in full conformity with the general principles of the Convention, namely non-
discrimination, the best interests of the child, the right to life, survival and development and 
the right of the child to express his or her views. 
</p>
<p>11. In the context of birth registration, non-discrimination implies that States must 
ensure that access to registration is not undermined by discrimination of any kind, including 
on the basis of the child&#8217;s &#8211; or the child&#8217;s parent&#8217;s or legal guardian&#8217;s &#8211; race, colour, sex, 
language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, 
disability, birth or other status. All children should have access to birth registration in the 
country where they are born, including non-nationals, asylum seekers, refugees and 
stateless children.6 
</p>
<p>12. The importance of birth registration in a child&#8217;s life and the impact of non-
registration on the enjoyment of the rights of the child are acknowledged regularly by the

<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its general comments No. 3 (HIV/AIDS),7 No. 6 
(treatment of unaccompanied and separated children),8 No. 7 (early childhood),9 No. 9 
(children with disabilities),10 No. 10 (juvenile justice),11 No. 11 (indigenous children),12 No. 
13 (right to freedom from all forms of violence)13 and No. 15 (right of the child to health).14  
</p><p>13. As described by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in its general comment 
No. 7, children who are not registered may be denied basic rights, such as health, education 
and social welfare. It therefore recommended that States take all necessary measures to 
ensure that all children are registered at birth, which can be achieved through a universal, 
well-managed registration system that is accessible to all and free of charge. The 
Committee added that an effective system must be flexible and responsive to the 
circumstances of families, and reminded States of the importance of facilitating late 
registration of birth and ensuring that children who have not been registered have equal 
access to health care, protection, education and other social services. In its general 
comment No. 13, the Committee adopted a progressive view, clearly indicating that the 
lack of birth registration can be a form of neglect and of negligent treatment when those 
responsible for the child&#8217;s care have the means, knowledge and access to services to do so. 
</p>
<p>14. The most recent international human rights instruments all contain provisions 
relating to birth registration, including article 29 of the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and article 
18 the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>15. The right to birth registration is not restricted to human rights law; indeed, it is 
intrinsically connected to issues arising in both international refugee law and international 
humanitarian law.15 In this regard, the Executive Committee of the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has consistently raised the issue of 
birth registration of refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons in its Conclusions on 
International Protection, nine of which include specific recommendations on birth 
registration and the right to identity. In October 2013, the Executive Committee adopted a 
Conclusion on International Protection that specifically focused on civil registration. The 
Conclusion, in which the Executive Committee encouraged States to ensure that every child 
is registered immediately after birth without discrimination of any kind, is a milestone 
document that sets up a framework of action for the protection of the rights of refugees, 
asylum seekers and stateless persons. UNHCR has furthermore made birth registration a 
global strategic priority. The <i>Framework for the Protection of Children</i>, issued by UNHCR 
in 2012,16 also includes a specific objective to ensure girls and boys obtain legal 
documentation, including birth certificates, in a non-discriminatory manner (Goal 4). 
16. At the intergovernmental level, both the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council have been particularly influential in highlighting the importance of universal birth 
registration. The Assembly has included the issues of birth registration and preservation of 
identity in at least one resolution every year since 2001. In its resolutions, the Assembly

<p>consistently urged States to intensify their efforts in order to ensure the implementation of 
the right of the child to birth registration as recognized by law. The Human Rights Council 
has also addressed the issue of birth registration in thematic resolutions, including on 
migration, the rights of the child, arbitrary deprivation of nationality and the fight against 
sexual violence against children. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Impact of non-registration on human rights 
</b></p>
<p>17. The right to birth registration is not only a right of the child but of all human beings. 
Birth registration, and more especially a birth certificate, is a life-long passport for the 
recognition of rights, which may be necessary to, inter alia, vote, marry or secure formal 
employment. In some countries, it may be needed to obtain a driver&#8217;s licence, to open a 
bank account, to have access to social security or a pension, to obtain insurance or a line of 
credit, and, significantly, to be able to register one&#8217;s own children. It is also vitally 
important for securing inheritance and property rights, particularly for women and within 
families. A recent country-specific study suggests that further research is needed to evaluate 
fully the link between access to services and birth registration.17 
</p>
<p>18.  The right to birth registration is closely linked to the realization of many other rights, 
and has profound consequences for children&#8217;s enjoyment of their rights with regard to 
protection, nationality, access to social and health services, and education. In particular, 
inequality in birth registration rates may compound inequalities in access to basic 
services,18 besides heightening discrimination and vulnerability. An effective civil 
registration and statistics system is therefore an important first step to ensuring the 
protection of children. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>19. Birth registration can have a fundamental impact on the right to education for 
children. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has, on numerous occasions, expressed 
concern at cases of children without a birth certificate being refused schooling, in violation 
of their right to education under article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
Furthermore, in some countries, while children are permitted to attend primary school 
without evidence of birth registration, a certificate is required to be able to take the final 
school examinations and thus to receive relevant academic qualifications or to progress to 
secondary school. Access to educational scholarships, free books and uniforms also often 
depend on the presentation of a birth certificate.19 
</p>
<p>20. While some States have argued that the requirement for registration to attend school 
reinforces both education and demand for registration, the relationship between these 
services is ambiguous; such requirements can even have a negative impact if birth 
registration is not universally accessible.20 Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, States have an 
obligation to ensure compulsory and free primary education for all. In its general comment

<p>No. 11, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights defined &#8220;compulsory&#8221; as 
meaning that no one, including the State, is entitled to treat as optional the decision of 
whether a child should have access to primary education.21 Both above-mentioned treaties 
also prohibit discrimination based on birth. Making birth registration a prerequisite for 
enrolment into or completion of primary education would therefore not be in compliance 
with the right to education guaranteed under these treaties. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>21. According to the World Health Organization, of the 6.6 million children who died 
before their fifth birthday in 2012, almost half died of infectious causes, nearly all of which 
were preventable.22 These children may be harder to reach for health-care workers and 
overlooked in public health planning. Furthermore, in some countries, they may not have 
access to immunization or other health-care programmes. OHCHR noted a correlation 
between children who are registered and those who are fully vaccinated, receive vitamin A 
supplementation, and/or are taken to a health-care professional when they are ill.23  
</p>
<p>22. In its general comment No. 3, the Committee on the Rights of the Child emphasized 
the critical implications of proof of identity for children affected by HIV/AIDS, including 
in safeguarding their rights to inheritance, education, health and other social services. 
According to the Committee, birth registration is necessary to minimize the impact of 
HIV/AIDS on the lives and human rights of affected children, and in particular to protect 
children from abuse and exploitation, especially where they have been separated from their 
family as a result of the disease.24 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Statelessness, nationality and citizenship  
</b></p>
<p>23. Birth registration is fundamental to the prevention of statelessness. Not all children 
born without birth registration are stateless; but for those born in certain situations (for 
example, to parents from different countries, in a migratory setting, to refugee or asylum 
seeker parents or in border areas), lack of birth registration can cause statelessness.25  
24. While birth registration does not in itself confer citizenship on a child, it is essential 
to ensure the right of every child to acquire a nationality, as it constitutes an important form 
of proof of the link between an individual and the State. It documents where a child was 
born and who the child&#8217;s parents are, thus providing important evidence of whether a child 
can acquire citizenship on the basis of place of birth (<i>jus soli</i>) or of descent (<i>jus 
sanguinis</i>).26

<p><b> D.  Child labour 
</b></p>
<p>25. Birth registration also plays a vital role in the protection of children from child 
labour. The International Labour Organization estimates that more than 168 million 
children are in child labour, of which 85 million are in hazardous work or work that is 
likely to harm their health, safety or morals, and which should be prohibited for anyone 
under the age of 18.27 While legislation setting legal minimum age for employment is 
important, it will have little effect if the means to prove the age of the child are not 
available. As such, birth registration and the accessibility of a birth certificate are 
prerequisite conditions for the effective prevention and elimination of child labour, 
including in its worst forms. 
</p>
<p>26. In some countries, a birth certificate is required to obtain a social security number 
necessary for working in the formal sector, meaning that all individuals &#8211; whether adults or 
children &#8211; without birth registration or access to a birth certificate are marginalized to the 
informal sector, where there is less scrutiny and a greater risk of exploitation and hazardous 
work.28 Furthermore, in some States, employers exploit the lack of birth registration to hire 
children as cheap labourers, knowing that they will have little recourse before the law.29 
</p>
<p><b> E. Children in conflict with the law 
</b></p>
<p>27. Birth registration is particularly important for children in conflict with the law. 
Article 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides these children with special 
protection, including the protection against prosecution as an adult, while article 37, 
paragraph c includes the right not to be detained with adults. Neither of these rights can be 
effectively safeguarded without proof of age.  
</p>
<p>28. The importance of birth registration was set out by the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child in its general comment No. 10 (juvenile justice), which clarified that a child 
without a provable date of birth is extremely vulnerable to all kinds of abuse and injustice 
in relation to the juvenile justice and penal system.30 The need to ensure birth registration to 
secure children&#8217;s rights and safeguards to prevent and protect children from violence within 
the juvenile justice system was also established by OHCHR, the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence 
against Children in their joint report on the prevention of and responses to violence against 
children within the juvenile justice system.31  
</p>
<p><b> F. Early and forced marriage 
</b></p>
<p>29. Birth registration can also contribute to the elimination and prevention of the 
practice of early and forced marriage. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women and other treaty bodies require States to register births and marriages as a 
means to facilitate monitoring of the age of marriage and to support the effective 
implementation and enforcement of laws on the minimum age of marriage.32

<p><b> G. Human trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>30. Individuals without birth registration or a birth certificate who wish to migrate are 
especially vulnerable to smuggling and trafficking. An individual without legal identity 
documents has to travel by illegal means and is more likely to have to rely on illicit 
intermediaries to facilitate migration.33 They are therefore at greater risk of trafficking and 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p>31. Furthermore, children who have not been registered are particularly vulnerable to 
child traffickers whether or not they are in a migration situation. The legal invisibility of 
unregistered children makes it more likely that their disappearance and exploitation will go 
unnoticed by authorities. This is particularly the case where the trafficking occurs across 
international borders; there is no proof of the child&#8217;s existence, so national authorities may 
be unwilling or unable to pursue the matter.34 
</p>
<p><b> H. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>32. Children without birth registration have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to 
exploitation in the area of illegal adoption and the sale of children. In certain countries, the 
illegal procurement, buying and selling of children for intercountry adoption was made 
possible through the falsification of documents and the production of false birth certificates. 
Children whose births are not registered are particularly targeted. In her recent report to the 
General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography stated that children whose birth had been registered were less likely to 
be sold or illegally adopted, in part because they had proof of who their parents were.35 
</p>
<p><b> I.  Armed conflict and emergency situations 
</b></p>
<p>33. Despite the prohibition of the involvement of children in armed conflict under the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, it is estimated that there are 
250,000 child soldiers active in the world today.36 The importance of birth registration can 
be seen in both the prevention of recruitment and of early conscription (for example, article 
3, paragraph 3 (d) of the Optional Protocol requires voluntary recruits to provide reliable 
proof of age prior to acceptance) but also in protecting children&#8217;s rights after they have 
been rescued from this form of exploitation.  
</p>
<p>34. Where children have been exploited in armed conflict, birth registration is vital to 
ensure that they have effective access to justice, as successful prosecution requires proof 
that the individual was indeed a child at the time of recruitment. Furthermore, birth 
registration is of great importance in the reunification and reintegration process; where 
children are not registered, it is difficult to re-establish their identity and return them to 
their homes.37 
</p>
<p>35. The importance of birth registration is also manifest during and in the aftermath of 
emergency situations. In such situations, the separation of children from their parents and

<p>communities is common, and non-registration can be a significant barrier to family tracing 
and reunification. Reuniting children with family members in emergency situations is the 
best way to provide children with safety, security and care; without a birth certificate or 
other form of identification, however, this process can be exceedingly difficult, especially 
for young children.38 
</p>
<p><b> V. Good governance 
</b>36. To protect the rights of all individuals, birth registration must be part of a 
comprehensive civil registration system that is continuous, permanent, compulsory and 
universal.39 Civil records must be kept in a form that cannot easily be destroyed. 
Furthermore, retrieval of records should be possible for persons at any stage of their life.  
</p>
<p>37. The security of the civil registration and vital statistics system, and of the birth 
certificate that is issued as proof of registration, is also vital. The birth certificate is often a 
&#8220;breeder&#8221; document for other forms of identification, including identity papers, passports, 
driver&#8217;s licences and voter registration cards.Unlike these documents, however, it is not tied 
to the individual by a photograph or biometric data. The use of fraudulent birth certificates 
to obtain genuine identification documents under a false name or age is increasing, and 
poses a threat to national and international security.40  
</p>
<p>38. While birth registration within such a system is a fundamental human right, its 
impact goes beyond the individual to have vital importance for the State, and a profound 
effect on governance at the national and international levels in improving services and 
ensuring accountability. 
</p>
<p>39. The demographic information provided by a comprehensive civil registration 
system, including birth registration, is crucial for government planning and decision-
making, as well as for the monitoring of programmes for children, families and the broader 
community. Accurate information gives the State the ability to not only track, counter and 
prevent abuse against individuals but also to plan service provision for children and their 
caregivers and to evaluate the impact of policies; for example, it can permit the 
Government to plan the construction of adequate numbers of schools and to train a 
sufficient number of nurses and doctors in specialist areas to treat the needs of the 
population. 
</p>
<p>40. This aspect is particularly important for minority groups, as birth registration 
provides a more accurate measurement of child health and more accurate health statistics in 
high-risk populations.41 In fact, UNICEF found that, when lack of birth and death 
registration is concentrated among population groups at high risk (such as minority groups, 
indigenous populations, and families living in slums), child mortality may be systematically 
underestimated.42 In this respect, birth registration must be universal. Where coverage is not 
complete, data from registration are skewed towards those with a higher income and with

<p>better education, and towards urban populations (as those who are overrepresented among 
those who are registered).43 
</p><p>41. Birth registration can also serve as the backbone of an electronic administration 
system, thus help to improve monitoring, planning and service delivery across a wide range 
of governmental services.44 Its importance for the State indeed cannot be underestimated, 
and the advantages of this will trickle down to individuals. 
</p>
<p>42. In addition, birth registration plays a key role in fostering democratic processes, as it 
is a vital link in establishing nationality, and thus conferring on the individual the rights and 
responsibilities of citizenship. The provision of a free and universal legal identity through 
birth registration was highlighted as a crucial element of ensuring good governance and 
effective institutions by the High-level Panel Secretary-General&#8217;s of Eminent Persons on 
the Post-2015 Development Agenda. The Panel considered that providing citizens with a 
legal identity is one of the most basic institutional responsibilities of a Government, which 
requires universal birth registration.45 
</p>
<p>43. Given that electoral roles are often compiled from the civil register, the transparency 
and credibility of voting and the prevention of electoral fraud depend on accurate data on 
births and deaths.46 Registration goes beyond the right to vote, however, and extends to the 
possibility of standing for electoral office and of taking an active role in political life.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Implementation challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political and legal challenges 
</b></p>
<p>44. Birth registration thus has both legal and statistical functions for States and 
individuals. Many countries, however, are yet to recognize this dual role and the intrinsic 
links between a functioning civil registration system and social and economic development, 
day-to-day governance and human rights.47 
</p>
<p>45. In many circumstances, civil registration laws have not been revised for many years, 
and outdated laws and procedures inherited from the past are still in place. The rationales 
and objectives of registration laws therefore do not always reflect social and cultural 
realities of the country.48 
</p>
<p>46. Another difficulty lies in the way in which civil registration has been previously 
used as a source of information to manage the population, an instrument to control the free 
movement of citizens. Similarly, in areas where there has been ethnic conflict, civil records 
have at times been used to engage in persecution. These historical circumstances may affect 
the willingness of parents to interact with official institutions and therefore to register their 
children.

<p>47. It is important that States nurture the trust of the public, reassuring it that civil 
registration will bring benefits to them, and not be misused as an instrument for 
repression.49 Confidentiality is vital to an effectively functioning system, and it is crucial 
that the States demonstrate that it is worthy of being trusted with this information. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Budgets 
</b></p>
<p>48. Small budgets and competing demands may make it difficult for Governments to 
treat birth registration with the priority that it deserves. This can lead to underresourcing 
and a lack of personnel and facilities to manage the registration system.  
</p>
<p>49. It is important to note, however, that a country can realize a high birth registration 
rate even with a low level of per capita income. In countries with an income of above 
$6,000 per capita, it is likely that the birth registration rate will be above 90 per cent. In 
countries with an income below that level, the relationship between income and birth 
registration rate is less clear; some countries have complete coverage, while others still 
have a very low rate.50 
</p>
<p>50. Clear budgetary allocation is of particular importance, especially in countries with a 
decentralized civil registration system, where while the national authority has technical 
responsibility, local registration officials depend, administratively and financially, on local 
authorities.51  
</p>
<p>51. Furthermore, it is important that public funding is allocated to birth registration, and 
that the State not simply rely on foreign funds or external funding sources. Government 
ownership with a budgetary commitment for birth registration as part of the overarching 
civil registration system is the only means to ensure sustainability. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Resources 
</b></p>
<p>52. In many cases, economic barriers due to a lack of State resources allocated to birth 
registration can in turn lead to institutional barriers. A lack of registration supplies, such as 
registration books, paper for standardized forms, and pens for signing the register, have all 
been noted as reasons for non-registration in various countries. 
</p>
<p>53. Human resources are also a significant problem. Many States do not have sufficient 
human resources to carry out registration, or have personnel that are poorly trained and do 
not know their duties. Poor working conditions and lack of appropriate staff support can 
lead to inaccurate registration records and, more worryingly, corruption and fraud. 
Furthermore, civil registration is often simply one task of many that officials are required to 
perform; where pay is low, it may be also seen as an added burden and consequently given 
low priority.52 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Information and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p>54. The provision of information to the community and social awareness of birth 
registration are among the most valuable tools in encouraging birth registration. In many 
communities, registration is seen as little more than a legal formality, and neglected for

<p>other problems that are more immediate and tangible.53 Often parents are unaware of their 
right to register their child and of its importance until they find themselves in a situation 
where they need proof of identity, such as when seeking access to schooling or health 
services.54 
</p>
<p>55. This is a fundamental problem that many countries are working hard to address. 
While top-down approaches to mandating birth registration can be useful, it is vital that 
they are combined with a wider recognition among communities of the importance of this 
issue; greater demand for such services will put pressure on the Government to improve its 
systems and to provide universal access. Awareness-raising is an ongoing process, not 
simply a one-off activity. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>56. Social awareness of the importance of birth registration is of little value without 
measures to facilitate access to this right. In many countries, geographical obstacles are the 
most persistent challenges to achieving high levels of birth registration. This is the case in 
countries where the majority of the population live in rural areas, with the bulk of public 
services being provided in a few major towns. This is highlighted by the differentials in 
urban and rural registration rates: globally, children living in urban areas are one and a half 
times more likely to be registered than children living in rural areas.55 
</p>
<p>57. Accessibility of registration depends not only on location but also on infrastructure 
and the availability of public transport.56 The cost of travelling a long distance to register a 
child may be not only a financial burden but also have opportunity costs, such as the time 
spent away from work to make the journey. In addition, in many countries, the complex 
procedure requires multiple visits, creating an additional obstacle to birth registration for 
populations who are located in remote areas.  
</p>
<p>58. The proliferation of registration offices is not, however, necessarily advantageous. 
Proximity of service to the population is important, but it must be balanced against the 
financial cost of establishing numerous registration offices that are not feasible because of 
their minimal workload. Other solutions must therefore be sought for service delivery; for 
example, interoperability with existing services, such as health and education, and the use 
of new technology for vital event notification.57 
</p>
<p>59. Registration must not only be physically accessible, but socially accessible too. 
Materials concerning registration must be provided in local and minority languages. 
Furthermore, the information must also be presented in a form that is comprehensible, and 
the forms to be filled in simple enough to ensure that those with low literacy levels can 
understand them. Information in an easily accessible form is not only important at the time 
of registration, but also when conducting awareness-raising programmes. 
</p>
<p>60. Excessive documentation requirements is another obstacle to registration. In many 
countries, birth registration requires a child&#8217;s parents to produce a set of documents, such as 
their own identity documents, birth registration documents and/or documents issued by

<p>other authorities or entities. In certain cases, documentation of grandparents of the child 
may also be required. Obtaining these documents can be exceedingly difficult or 
impossible, in particular where there is a low level of birth registration and documentation 
within the general population or a specific group, such as in the case of a minority 
population. As a result, flexible rules of proof are required.  
</p>
<p><b> D.  Costs  
</b></p>
<p>61. In many countries, the cost of birth registration is prohibitively expensive for most 
families. Costs can be incurred by direct payments for registration or the birth certificate, or 
indirect costs for travel and opportunity costs, as discussed above.58 Unfortunately, while 
some of these direct costs are official, others are imposed illegally by registrars in an 
attempt to extort more money from families, a problem that is more difficult to fight.59 In 
addition, some countries also impose fees or fines if registration is delayed or late. This 
may discourage registration for a child once the initial period for registration has passed. 
</p>
<p>62. Children from the poorest households are twice as likely to be unregistered as those 
from the richest.60 This is particularly unfortunate, given that birth registration is one of the 
most powerful instruments to ensure equal access for children over a broad range of 
services, while non-registration will only exacerbate their poverty and prolong their 
marginalization.61 
</p>
<p><b> E.  Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>63. In many countries, parents are required to present their own identity documents in 
order to be able to register their child. In cases where the parents themselves have not been 
registered or are illegal migrants, this may prevent their children from having access to their 
rights, perpetuating marginalization. In addition, such parents may fear approaching the 
authorities to register their children as reporting may lead to their own detection by the 
authorities.62 
</p>
<p>64. Some States refuse to register the children of non-citizens, in particular when they 
do not have permanent residence, or are refugees or asylum seekers. This is problematic, 
given that, in addition to the difficulties experienced by all children without a birth 
certificate, children of non-citizens, and in particular refugee and asylum seeker children, 
face particular challenges when they seek to acquire proof of nationality, and face a 
heightened risk of being left stateless (see para. 23-24 above).  
</p><p>65. Registration has important benefits for the host country, as it improves State 
administration and provides information about the refugee and asylum seeker population. 
Furthermore, in the medium to long term, a birth certificate can assist in the durable return 
of refugees to their areas of origin.63 It can also facilitate repatriation, prove lineage and 
assist families in reclaiming property upon return.

<p>66. Lack of birth registration and therefore of official statistics can lead to an 
underestimation of marginalized groups and therefore diminish their visibility.64 Non-
registration may stem from a deliberate policy or simply a lack of political will to change 
the situation, but can also be caused by less overt obstacles, such as illiteracy and language 
barriers, which prevent families from gaining access to information about birth registration 
procedures and requirements, and its benefits. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Children with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>67. Birth registration is recognized as a right for all children with disabilities under the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Committee on the Rights of the 
Child has highlighted this issue, and made clear that all children should be registered at 
birth, including those with disabilities, without discrimination of any kind, as required 
under article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.65 Unfortunately, children with 
disabilities are often overrepresented among those who are not registered at birth.  
</p>
<p>68. The non-registration of children with disabilities is often due to the families 
themselves. The reluctance of parents of children with disabilities to register them renders 
the children invisible to social services, health-care workers and educational facilities.66 In 
its general comment No. 9, the Committee on the Rights of the Child noted that children 
with disabilities not registered at birth are at a greater risk of neglect, institutionalization, 
and even death.67 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Gender discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>69. Although differences in rates of civil registration by sex are minimal, discrimination 
is seen in countries that allow only the most senior male household member to register a 
child&#8217;s birth, or refuse to register a child at all without the presence of the father or of both 
parents. Such laws discriminate against mothers, and may result in children not being 
registered owing to the lack of the father&#8217;s consent or because the child was born out of 
wedlock.68 Children born out of rape, for instance, cannot be registered; thus, a woman who 
has survived sexual violence is revictimized. Furthermore, some gender-neutral laws, while 
not specifically prohibiting a mother from registering her child, make it difficult or 
impossible for her to do so as a result of indirect discrimination and cultural practices.69 
This is particularly the case where a child is born out of wedlock, and a single mother might 
be reluctant to approach the authorities out of shame and the stigma attached. 
</p>
<p>70. Discrimination against women can also be seen in countries where a woman is 
legally incapable of conferring her nationality to her child. In such circumstances, if the 
father does not acknowledge the child, there is a high risk that the child will be left 
stateless.70

<p><b> F. Registration in emergency situations 
</b></p>
<p>71. Armed conflict, natural disasters and other emergency situations can have a 
significant effect on birth registration rates. In many cases, such situations lead to the 
disruption of civil registration officers and therefore of public services, and can exacerbate 
already existing obstacles, such as legal barriers, lack of financial and human resources and 
distance from registration centres.71 Furthermore, the displacement of the population within 
and across State boundaries can cause difficulties not only for registration but also for the 
retrieval of documents. 
</p>
<p>72. There is also the danger that birth records may be destroyed as a result of the 
emergency situation, which is particularly problematic when there is no digital system is in 
place. In this case, it is not only present birth registrations that are threatened, but past ones 
as well. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Examples of good practices  
</b></p>
<p>73. Good birth registration practices must be approached with consideration of specific 
contextual factors pertaining to the specific social, cultural, legal and governance structures 
of the country. The same practice in another country or context could have very different 
implications. For this reason, the examples cited below should always be seen in their local 
context.  
</p>
<p>74. In Mali, a citizen&#8217;s guide to birth registration has been issued in five languages 
(French, Bamanankan, Fulfulde, Sonrai and Tamasheq). In order to ensure that those who 
were illiterate could benefit from the guide, more than 1,000 audio copies and 600 video 
copies have also been distributed.72 
</p>
<p>75. In Iraq, an information campaign has been launched, and 20,000 copies of a 
brochure on birth registration have been distributed to refugees. An information video 
(available fromhttp://youtu.be/ZvtSIAMXx9U) is currently being shown in 
all camps, UNHCR implementing partners offices and registration offices. 
</p>
<p>76. In the Sekameng area of Mafeteng District in Lesotho, World Vision met with 
officers from the Departments of Home Affairs and Social Welfare, leaders and community 
members to discuss child protection issues. As a result, a plan of action was drawn up under 
which local church leaders agreed to give awareness-raising sermons on birth registration at 
least once a month for three months, to facilitate the registration of names of children in 
need of birth certificates on dedicated days, and to submit the list of names for forwarding 
to the Department of Home Affairs.73 
</p>
<p>77. The Minimbah Project, established by a group of university students at the 
University of New England (Australia), involves a volunteer team that holds birth 
registration days in local primary schools in order to raise community awareness of the 
importance of birth registration. Children whose births have not been registered are 
therefore given the opportunity to register for a birth certificate.74

Family, Community and Life, runs a campaign whereby representatives make house-to-

<p>79. In Brunei Darussalam, &#8220;Flying Doctor Teams&#8221; use helicopters to reach remote 
communities and, as part of their work, to ensure registration of births of children as well as 
providing medical services.76 
</p>
<p>80. In Cambodia, a national mobile registration campaign was started on 1 October 
</p><p>2004. To facilitate the implementation of the campaign, Cambodia amended some 
provisions of the Sub-decree on Civil Registration in 2004 to remove the requirement of a 
court judgement for late birth registration. More than 13,000 mobile team members, 
including civil registration officers, were trained. As a result of the campaign, more than 90 
per cent of the population acquired birth registration (some 11.7 million people have had 
their birth registered during 2006.77 
</p>
<p>81. In 2013, a new birth registration system was tested in the Mbeya region of the 
United Republic of Tanzania using the transmission of data to a centralized system via text 
messaging (SMS). The system is not dependent on any handset or operating system, and 
requires no Internet connectivity; all that is needed is mobile telephone coverage and a 
server to receive the data. Before the start of the campaign, approximately 90 per cent of 
children under the age of 5 in the region were not registered; three months later, only 29 per 
cent were not.78

<p><b> VIII. Going forward 
</b>82.<b> The universal implementation of the right to birth registration for all is 
fundamental to the protection of children and the full implementation of their 
universal human rights. Registration establishes the legal existence of an individual; 
its absence has lifelong consequences. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Birth registration is essential for compiling vital statistics that are needed to 
develop policies and implement services. The demographic data provided by this act 
can help to keep track of the population and provide information that can identify 
areas of improvement. This is particularly important in such areas as child mortality, 
maternal health and gender equality. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> One of the most basic institutional responsibilities of a Government is to 
provide a person with a legal identity; this is central to good governance. Functioning 
civil registration and vital statistics systems therefore have crucial importance in the 
post-2015 development agenda. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> While noting that efforts have been made by States at different levels to ensure 
birth registration, there is still a long way to go before this right is accessible to all. In 
developing a permanent and sustainable civil registration and vital statistics system, in 
accordance with human rights standards, it is fundamental that States:

<p>(a)<b> Ensure that birth registration is accessible to all without discrimination 
of any kind, including on the basis of the child&#8217;s, or the child&#8217;s parents&#8217;, immigration 
status, social origin, sex, ethnicity, language, disability or birth out of wedlock; this is 
essential for children and families living in an irregular migration situation, for 
refugees and for asylum seekers, as well as for children belonging to marginalized 
groups;  
</b></p>
<p>(b)<b> Improve access to registration for individuals living in rural areas, 
including by taking advantage of the most recent advances in information technology 
and innovative technical solutions to improve birth registration and civil registration 
and vital statistics systems; 
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> Adopt simplified administrative procedures that allow flexibility in birth 
registration requirements to ensure that individuals are not denied registration;  
</b></p>
<p>(d)<b> Review laws and administrative regulations that impose a fee on birth 
registration or impose penalties for late or delayed registration. Registration should 
be completely free of charge, and measures should be taken to ensure the registration 
of older children and unregistered adults, in an integrated, inclusive and protective 
approach; 
</b></p>
<p>(e). <b>Carry out a comprehensive assessment of their existing civil registration 
and vital statistics system, including by monitoring and measuring its functionality 
and alignment with human rights standards and principles; this should be done with a 
view to developing a coherent strategy to achieve universal birth registration that 
details budgetary responsibilities, and allocates sufficient human and financial 
resources to the civil registration and vital statistics system. Staff should be 
adequately trained to apply a child-sensitive and rights-based approach, which takes 
account of specific vulnerabilities of children, and complies fully with the obligations 
of States under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international and 
regional human rights instruments; 
</b></p>
<p>(f)<b> Ensure that responsibilities and accountabilities between key 
stakeholders working on birth registration, as well as civil registration and vital 
statistics, have aligned mandates and work in a coordinated manner. Actions should 
also be taken to remove existing obstacles to the effective administration of civil 
registration and vital statistics systems around which donors and development 
partners can align their support. Strategies aimed at improving such systems should 
be innovative and consider the use of technology, where appropriate. States should 
ensure that practitioners engage and partner with relevant stakeholders, including 
technology providers, to seek solutions that meet the needs of national civil 
registration and vital statistics systems, in accordance with international human rights 
standards; 
</b></p>
<p>(g)<b> Participate in regional government initiatives to improve the operation 
of the civil registry; 
</b></p>
<p>(h)<b> Consider the interoperability between birth registration and existing 
services and structures, such as health and education, to allow registration as close as 
possible to the population.  
</b></p>
<p>(i) <b>Mobilize communities, in collaboration with other stakeholders, to raise 
awareness of the importance of birth registration, particularly among marginalized 
groups. The help of respected community members, such as religious leaders, village 
elders and locally elected councillors, should be considered, allowing communities to 
find their own solutions, and thus make the process more sustainable in the long term. 
Authorities should draw on pre-existing community structures and leaderships to </b></p>


<p><b>provide a sense of ownership within the community, and ensure that awareness of the 
benefits of birth registration is raised.
