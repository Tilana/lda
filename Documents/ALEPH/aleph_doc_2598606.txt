9.2.  Principles of compensation
Remuneration is referred to as compensation throughout this report. 
 
Key management personnel have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the 
Company. Key management personnel include the Directors of the Company and senior executives for the Company, 
in accordance with S300A of the Corporations Act 2001.   
 
Compensation levels for Directors and key management personnel of the Company are competitively set to attract and 
retain  appropriately  qualified  and  experienced  Directors  and  executives.  The  Board  obtains  independent  data  on 
compensation packages and trends in comparative companies, and this information is used as one of the determinants 
in deciding the appropriateness of the Company’s compensation strategy. 
 
The  compensation  structures  explained  below  are  designed  to  attract  suitably  qualified  candidates,  reward  the 
achievement  of  strategic  objectives,  and  achieve  the  broader  outcome  of  creation  of  value  for  shareholders.  The 
compensation structures take into account: 
 
- 
-
the capability and experience of the key management personnel; and 
the  key  management  personnel’s  assessed  contribution  to  the  Company’s  financial  and  operational 
performance.

9.2.  Principles of compensation
Key  management  personnel  can  receive  a  portion  of  base  remuneration  as  non-cash  benefits.  Non-cash  benefits 
typically include payment of motor vehicle expenses. Any fringe benefit tax on these benefits is generally borne by the 
executive. 
 
Compensation packages for key management personnel include a mix of fixed and variable compensation and short-
term and long-term performance-based incentives. 
 
The below table represents the target remuneration mix for executives in the current year. The short-term incentive is 
provided at target levels, and the long-term incentive amount is provided based on the value granted in the current 
year.
Executives under service contracts 
CEO 
Executives under standard Company Contracts 
CFO and Company Secretary
Fixed remuneration
64%
At Risk
Short-term incentive
36%
75%
25%
Fixed compensation 
Fixed compensation consists of base compensation (which is calculated on a total cost basis and includes any fringe 
benefits  tax  charges  related  to  employee  benefits  including  motor  vehicles),  as  well  as  employer  contributions  to 
superannuation funds. 
 
Compensation levels are reviewed annually by the Board through a process that considers individual performance and 
overall performance of the Company. In addition, external consultants may be used to provide benchmark data to the 
Board to ensure that key management personnel compensation is competitive in the market place. Key management 
personnel compensation is also reviewed on promotion. Compensation increases are usually effective from 1 July each 
year; however in July 2016 the Board approved a recommendation not to increase fixed compensation for all employees 
and will review salary increases in October 2016.  
 
Performance-linked compensation 
Performance linked compensation includes both short-term and long-term incentives, and is designed to reward key 
management personnel for meeting or exceeding company objectives (both financial and non-financial). The short-
term incentive plan (STI) is a discretionary ‘at risk’ bonus provided in the form of cash. The deferred compensation 
scheme incorporates the issue of options over ordinary shares of the Company under the rules of the employee share 
plan, which vest over a three year period.  
 
Short-term incentive bonus 
The  short-term  incentive  plan  is  intended  to  focus  employee  behaviour  towards  the  achievement  of  activities  and 
milestones that contribute to the Company meeting its business objectives for the financial year.  In addition, it also 
provides clear alignment between personal and business performance and remuneration.  Company objectives are 
used to determine the performance rating. The Chief Executive Officer evaluates the Company’s strategic goals for the 
forthcoming financial year and identifies Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) which are deemed to be critical to the 
Company  achieving  its  mission  each  financial  year.  These  objectives  are  reviewed  and  if  considered  appropriate, 
approved by the Board.  
 
At the end of the financial year the Chief Executive Officer assesses the Company’s performance against the Company 
KPI’s to determine the overall business score.  The Company performance ratings are applied against the Company 
KPI’s to determine the overall performance score.  
 
The performance rating will range between 50% for minimum performance, 75% for target performance and 100% for 
stretch performance. No bonus is awarded where performance does not meet minimum performance standards.  The 
Board recommends and approves the cash incentive to be paid to the individuals. 
 
Employees  are  eligible  for  a  short  term  incentive  award  of  25%  of  Total  Fixed  Remuneration  (base  salary  plus 
superannuation). 
 
There were no company specific KPI’s set for the 2015/6 financial year. STI bonus scheme and the bonus 
determined by the Chairman was based on his assessment of the performance of key management staff, with 
reference to KPI’s business improvement – savings.  
 
The Board approved an amount to be paid to members of the executive team for the 2015/16 year STIP bonus scheme 
in July 2016.

9.2.  Principles of compensation (Continued)
Long Term Incentive Deferred Compensation Scheme – share options 
Options are issued under the Employee Share Option Plan (made in accordance with the criteria as set out in the plan 
approved by shareholders at the 2006 AGM). The total value of share options issued to eligible employees is equivalent 
to 1.25 times the value of the employee’s STI award for the prior financial year (i.e. calculation of the maximum award 
is  dependent  upon  satisfaction  of  STI  performance  hurdles).  These  share  options  vest  subject  to  specific  service 
conditions. All options are issued for no consideration, and are therefore similar in substance to “performance rights”.  
There were no options granted to key personnel during the year ended 30 June 2016 (2015– nil options granted). 
 
All  Directors  and  employees  participating  in  any  Company  equity  incentive  plan  are  prevented  from  hedging  the 
economic benefit of any unvested performance shares or options under such plans, as such arrangements have been 
prohibited by law since 1 July 2011. Hedging is permitted in respect of any performance shares or options that have 
vested. 
 
Short-term and long-term incentive structure 
Each year the Chief Executive Officer recommends the KPI’s for the key management personnel, which are approved 
by the Board. The Board considers that the performance-linked compensation structure provides appropriate incentives 
to key management personnel. No KPI’s were set for the 2015/16 year. 
 
Consequences of performance on shareholder wealth 
In considering the Company’s performance and benefits for shareholder wealth during the year ended 30 June 2016, 
the Board believes that safety performance, profitability, share price performance and achievement of specific strategic 
development  objectives  are  the  key  links  between  the  Company’s  performance  and  the  attainment  of  increased 
shareholder wealth.

The key management personnel are also entitled to receive on termination of employment their statutory entitlements 
of accrued annual and long service leave, together with any superannuation benefits. 
 
The service and employment contracts outline the components of compensation paid to the key management personnel 
but do not prescribe how compensation levels are modified year to year. Compensation levels are reviewed each year 
to take into account cost of living changes, any change in the scope of the role performed and any changes required 
to meet the principles of the compensation policy.   
 
There is no entitlement to termination payment in the event of removal for misconduct.  
 
Non-Executive Directors 
Total compensation for all Non-Executive Directors, last voted upon by shareholders at the 2010 AGM, is not to exceed 
$1,000,000 per annum and is set based on advice from external advisors with reference to fees paid to other Non-
Executive Directors of comparable companies.   
 
Effective from 1 July 2015, the Non- Executive Director’s remuneration has been reset to $57,750 per annum with the 
Chairman’s base remuneration decreasing to $206,500 per annum.

Directors’ fees cover all board activities. Effective from 1 September 2012 Committee fees were increased to $42,000 
per annum (previously $35,000) and are payable to those Non-Executive Directors who sit on two or more Committees 
(including Committees of KML). Non-Executive Directors do not generally receive bonuses but may be issued with 
employee  options  under  the  Employee  Share  Option  Plan  or  via  the  express  approval  of  shareholders/Board  of 
Directors. Nevertheless the Board charter has been amended to formally recognise that at this stage of the Company’s 
development no further options will be issued to Non-Executive Directors. The Board has taken on the role of the 
Committees from 1 January 2015 and no Committee were paid from 1 January 2015.

9.4.  Directors’ and executive officers’ remuneration (Continued) 
 
Notes to the table of Directors’ and executive officers’ remuneration 
 
(a)
Each option entitles the holder to purchase one ordinary share in the Company. The options are unlisted and 
cannot be transferred. The fair value of the options with non-market conditions is calculated at the date of 
grant using a Black-Scholes model and allocated to each reporting period evenly over the period from grant 
date to vesting date.
Options  with  market  conditions  are  determined  using  the  Binomial  model  simulation  in  which  the  market 
conditions have been taken into account in the valuation of the option. The value disclosed above is the 
portion of the fair value of the options allocated to this reporting period.  
 
This remuneration includes a proportion of the fair value of equity compensation granted or outstanding during 
the year. The fair value of equity instruments is determined based on the fair value at grant date, and is 
expensed progressively over the vesting period. The amount included as remuneration is not indicative of the 
benefit  (if  any)  that  individual  executives  may  ultimately  realise  should  the  equity  instrument  vest.  The 
following factors and assumptions were used in determining the fair value of options on grant date:

9.6.  Modification of terms of equity-settled share-based payment transactions
No terms of equity-settled share-based payment transactions (including options and rights granted as compensation 
to a key management person) have been altered or modified by the issuing entity during the reporting period or the 
prior period, other than all options were deemed vested by the Directors during the financial year. This modification 
did not result in an increase in the fair value of the options. 
 
9.7.  Exercise of options granted as compensation
During the reporting period, nil shares were issued on the exercise of options previously granted as compensation:

The value of options granted in the year is the fair value of the options calculated at grant date using either

table above. This amount is allocated to remuneration over the relevant vesting period. 
The value of options exercised during the year is calculated as the market price of shares of the Company on 
the  Australian  Securities  Exchange  as  at  close  of  trading  on  the  date  the  options  were  exercised  after 
deducting the price paid to exercise the option.

LEAD AUDITOR’S INDEPENDENCE DECLARATION & NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The Lead Auditor’s Independence Declaration is set out on page 15 and forms part of the Directors’ Report for the 
year ended 30 June 2016. 
 
During the year KPMG, the Company’s auditor, has performed certain other services in addition to their statutory 
duties. The Board has considered the non-audit services provided during the year by the auditor and in accordance 
with written advice provided by resolution of the Board, is satisfied that the provision of those non-audit services 
during the year by the auditor is compatible with, and did not compromise, the auditor independence requirements 
of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:  
 

all non-audit services were subject to the corporate governance procedures adopted by the Company and have 
been reviewed by the Board to ensure they do not impact the independence and objectivity of the auditor.  
 
the non-audit services provided do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set 
out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the 
auditor’s  own  work,  acting  in  a  management  or  decision  making  capacity  for  the  Company,  acting  as  an 
advocate for the Company or jointly sharing risks and rewards.
Details of the amounts paid to the auditor of the Company, KPMG, and its related practices for audit and non-audit 
services provided during the year are set out below:


2016/191 and in accordance with that Instrument, amounts in the financial statements and directors’ report have 
been rounded off to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated  
 
13.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Gindalbie Metals Ltd
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying ﬁnancial report of Gindalbie Metals Ltd (the Company),
which comprises the statement of ﬁnancial position as at 30 June 2016, and the statement of
comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash ﬂows for the year
ended on that date, notes 1 to 24 comprising a summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies and
other explanatory information and the directors’ declaration.
Directors ’ responsibility ﬁar the financial report
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial report that gives
a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations
Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of the ﬁnancial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to ﬁ‘aud or
error. In note 2(a), the directors also state, in accordance with Australian Accounting Standard
AASB 10] Presentation of Financial Statements, that the ﬁnancial statements comply with
International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor is responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the ﬁnancial report based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards These Auditing Standards require that
we comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the ﬁnancial report is free from material
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the ﬁnancial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial report, whether due
to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant
to the entity‘s preparation of the ﬁnancial report that gives a tme and fair view in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial report.
We performed the procedures to assess whether in all material respects the ﬁnancial report presents
fairly, in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting Standards, a true
and fair view which is consistent with our understanding of the Company’s ﬁnancial position and
of its performance.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
1.
REPORTING ENTITY
Gindalbie is a company domiciled in Australia.   
 
The address of the Company’s registered office is 6 Altona Street, West Perth. These financial statements comprise the 
Company and its investments. 
 
The Company is a for-profit entity primarily involved in iron ore exploration and development activities. 
 
2.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
Statement of compliance
Basis of measurement
(a) 
 
The  financial  statements  are  general  purpose  financial  statements  which  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with 
Australian  Accounting  Standards  (AASBs)  adopted  by  the  Australian  Accounting  Standards  Board  (AASB)  and  the 
Corporations  Act  2001.  The  financial  statements  comply  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRSs) 
adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
 
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 6 September 2016. 
 
(b) 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. 
 
(c)  Investment in KML and Going Concern 
 
Gindalbie has a 47.84% investment in Karara Mining Limited (KML), a special purpose entity established to develop 
and operate the Karara Iron Ore Project in Western Australia. The remaining 52.16% is ultimately owned by Ansteel 
Group Corporation (Ansteel). Gindalbie does not have joint control or the ability to significantly influence KML and the 
investment has been recorded at fair value. 
The investment in KML is valued at $nil (2015: $nil). 
The Company has contingent liabilities with respect to shareholders’ guarantees provided by the Company to Ansteel 
and KML contractors. Refer to note 23. 
For the guarantees to be called upon, it would require a default by KML on the loans provided by Ansteel or any other 
contracts where a shareholder’s guarantee has been provided by Gindalbie, and for the holder of a guarantee or Ansteel 
to enforce their rights under the relevant guarantees. The Directors of the company review KML performance and at 
the date of this report, the Directors are unaware of any guarantees being called. There remains a risk that Ansteel may 
not continue to fund or support KML which could lead to guarantees being called upon. If Gindalbie is required to repay 
its proportional share of the shareholders’ guarantees to Ansteel, the potential obligation is currently in excess of the 
value of the shares in KML and net assets of Gindalbie. 
The Directors of the Company have identified that inherent uncertainties exist, being the contingent liabilities of the 
potential shareholders’ guarantees. In the event the Company becomes liable under these guarantees, the inherent 
uncertainty casts significant doubt on Gindalbie’s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore it may be unable 
to realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the 
financial report. 
Nevertheless after making enquiries and considering the uncertainties described above the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the guarantees  will  not be called upon and the company  have adequate resources to continue  in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and pay its debts as and when they are due. For these reasons they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial report. 
  
(d) 
 
In  September  2013  Ansteel  arranged  the  provision  of  US$230  million  of  additional  short  term  funding  to  KML. This 
working  capital  facility  was  made  available  through  a  series  of  prepaid  sales  agreements  for  delivery  of  magnetite 
concentrate between KML and an Ansteel subsidiary (US$100 million) and a US$130 million bank debt facility provided 
by Bank of China (BOC USD130m Facility) (guaranteed by Ansteel).  
 
A condition to arrangement of this additional working capital facility to KML was that at Ansteel’s option KML’s financial 
obligations under the prepaid sales agreement and the BOC USD130 million Facility could be repaid using proceeds 
received by KML, or through issue of new KML equity share capital to Ansteel at $3.02 per share. The potential impact 
of the conversion is KML issuing 80,848,132 new shares to Ansteel which would decrease Gindalbie’s equity by 9.60%. 
 
Any further equity contribution to KML from Ansteel could further dilute Gindalbie’s ownership percentage of KML. 
 
(e)  
 
These financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial 
information has been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated.

Use of estimates and judgements
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
 
(f)  
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with AASB requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and 
in any future periods affected.
Information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in Note 7 – Income Tax Expense – deferred tax 
recognition.
Information  about  assumptions  and  estimation  uncertainties  that  have  a  significant  risk  of  resulting  in  a  material 
adjustment within the next financial year are included in the following Notes:

  Note 12 - Impairment test: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts 
  Note 19 - Financial Instruments 
  Note 21(b) - Share-Based Payments 
  Note 23 -  Contingent Liabilities
3.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Foreign currency
Financial instruments
The  accounting  policies  set  out  below  have  been  applied  consistently  to  all  periods  presented  in  these  financial 
statements, and have been applied consistently. 
 
(a)  
 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currency of the Company at exchange rates 
at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date 
are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on 
monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted 
for payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of 
the period. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss.  
 
(b)  
 
(i)    Non-derivative financial instruments 
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents 
and trade and other payables. 
 
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through 
profit or loss, any directly attributable transaction costs, except as described below. Subsequent to initial recognition non-
derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.  
 
A  financial  instrument  is  recognised  if  the  Company  becomes  a  party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of  the  instrument. 
Financial assets are derecognised if the Company’s contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or 
if the Company transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control of substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of the asset. Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at trade date, i.e., the date that the 
Company commits itself to purchase or sell the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Company’s obligations 
specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.

Financial instruments (Continued)
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
3.   
 
(b)  
 
The Company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. 
 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and 
only when, the Company has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.  
 
Non-derivative  financial  liabilities  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  plus  any  directly  attributable  transaction  costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. 
 
Financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and trade and other payables. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.  
 
Accounting for finance income and expenses is discussed in Note 3(j). 
 
(ii)  
An instrument is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is held for trading or is designated as such upon initial 
recognition.  Financial  instruments  are  designated  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  if  the  Company  manages  such 
investments  and  makes  purchase  and  sale  decisions  based  on  their  fair  value  in  accordance  with  the  Company’s 
documented  risk  management  or  investment  strategy.  Upon  initial  recognition,  attributable  transaction  costs  are 
recognised in profit or loss when incurred. Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair 
value, and changes therein are recognised in profit or loss.  
 
(iii)   Other 
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment losses.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss
Recognition and measurement
(iv)    Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to issue of ordinary shares and share 
options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any related income tax benefit. 
 
(c)    Property, plant and equipment 
 
(i)  
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses.   
 
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.  The cost of self-constructed assets 
includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working 
condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are 
located and capitalised borrowing costs. Cost also may include transfers from other comprehensive income of any gain 
or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.  Purchased 
software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment. 
 
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. 
 
The gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds 
from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within other income/other 
expenses in profit or loss.   
 
(ii)    Mine properties and development 
When  proved  reserves  are  determined  and  development  is  sanctioned,  capitalised  exploration  and  evaluation 
expenditure is reclassified as mine properties and development, and is disclosed as a component of property, plant and 
equipment.  All subsequent development expenditure is capitalised and classified as mine properties and development.  
Development expenditure is net of proceeds from the sale of ore extracted during the development phase.  
 
(iii)   Depreciation and amortisation 
Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part or item of 
property, plant and equipment.  Land is not depreciated.

Impairment
Financial assets
Non-financial assets
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date. 
 
(d)   
 
(i)  
A  financial  asset  is  assessed  at  each  reporting  date  to  determine  whether  there  is  any  objective  evidence  that  it  is 
impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had 
a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. 
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its 
carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest 
rate. An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by reference to its current fair 
value. 
 
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets 
are assessed collectively in the companies that share similar credit risk characteristics. 
 
All impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any cumulative loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial 
asset recognised previously in equity is transferred to profit or loss. 
 
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss 
was recognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost and available-for-sale financial assets that are debt 
securities, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss. For available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, the 
reversal is recognised directly in equity. 
 
(ii)  
The carrying amounts of the Company’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed 
at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset of the Company that generates cash flows that are 
largely independent from other assets. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. 
 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs 
to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
 
Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has 
decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount 
does  not  exceed  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been  determined,  net  of  depreciation  or  amortisation,  if  no 
impairment loss had been recognised. 
 
(e)    Employee benefits 
 
(i)    Defined contribution superannuation funds 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution superannuation funds are recognised as an expense in profit or loss 
when they are due. 
 
(ii)    Other long-term employee benefits 
The Company’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees 
have  earned  in  return  for  their  service  in  the  current  and  prior  periods  plus  on-costs;  that  benefit  is  discounted  to 
determine its present value. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated (Corporate bond rate) 
bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company’s obligations. 
 
(iii)    Termination benefits 
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic 
possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement date.

(e)    Employee benefits (Continued) 
 
(iv)    Short-term benefits 
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service 
is provided. 
 
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus plans if the Company has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the 
obligation can be estimated reliably. 
 
(v) 
The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding 
increase  in  equity,  over  the  period  during  which  the  employees  become  unconditionally  entitled  to  the  options.  The 
amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest, except where 
forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
(f)    Provisions
Share-based payment transactions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that 
can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. 
 
(g)   Revenue 
 
Revenue  is measured at the fair value of the gross consideration received or receivable. The Company recognises 
revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, and when it is probable that future economic benefits 
will flow to the entity. 
 
(i)   Sale of goods  
Revenue from the sale of goods and disposal of other assets is recognised when persuasive evidence, usually in the 
form of an executed sales agreement, or an arrangement exists, indicating there has been a transfer of risks and rewards 
to the customer, no further work or processing is required by the Company, the quantity and quality of the goods has 
been  determined  with  reasonable  accuracy,  the  price  can  be  reasonably  estimated,  and  collectability  is  reasonably 
assured.
Trade receivables
(h)  
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. An allowance for impairment of trade receivables is established 
when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due.
Lease payments
(i)   
 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
 
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction 
of the outstanding liability.  The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a 
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
 
(j)   
 
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, and gains on the disposal of available-for-sale financial 
assets. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

(j)   
 
Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, bank charges, unwinding of the discount on provisions and 
performance bond facility fees.  
 
Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are 
recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.   
 
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis either as finance income or finance costs depending on 
whether they are in a net gain or loss position. 
 
(k)
Income Tax
Earnings per share
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
 
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred 
tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based 
on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
 
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
 
(l)   
 
The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated 
by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to 
ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees. 
 
(m)   
 
Exploration and evaluation assets 
Exploration and evaluation costs, including the costs of acquiring licences, are capitalised as exploration and evaluation 
assets on an area of interest basis.  Costs incurred before the Company has obtained the legal rights to explore an area 
are recognised in the income statement. 
 
Exploration and evaluation assets are only recognised if the rights of tenure to the area of interest are current and 
either: 
 
(i)
the expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area of 
interest; or 
activities in the area of interest have not, at the reporting date, reached a stage  which permits a reasonable 
assessment  of  the  existence  or  otherwise  of  economically  recoverable  reserves  and  active  and  significant 
operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.
Intangible assets
(ii)
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying 
amount  exceeds  the  recoverable  amount  (see  impairment  accounting  policy  3(e)).    For  the  purposes  of  impairment 
testing, exploration and evaluation assets are allocated to cash-generating units to which the exploration activity relates.  
The cash generating unit shall not be larger than the area of interest. 
 
Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are 
demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and 
then reclassified from intangible assets to mining property and development assets within property, plant and equipment.  
 
Exploration  and  evaluation  costs  are  not  amortised  until  such  time  as  they  are  transferred  to  mine  properties  and 
production has commenced. 
 
(n)    Segment reporting 
 
Determination and presentation of operating segments 
An  operating  segment  is  a  component  of  the  Company  that  engages  in  business  activities  from  which  it  may  earn 
revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Company’s

other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Company’s Chief Executive 
Officer to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and for which 
discrete financial information is available. 
 
Segment results that are reported to the Chief Executive Officer include items directly attributable to a segment as well 
as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.  Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets (primarily 
the Company’s headquarters), head office expenses, and income tax assets and liabilities. 
 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and 
exploration expenditure. 
 
(o)   
 
The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been identified as those which may impact 
the entity in the period of initial application. They are available for early adoption at 30 June 2016, but have not been 
applied in preparing this financial report.  
 
(i)
AASB 9 Financial Instruments includes requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets 
resulting from the first part of Phase 1 of the project to replace AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement. AASB will become mandatory for the Company’s 30 June 2019 financial statements. Retrospective 
application is generally required. The Company has not yet determined the potential effect of the standard.
New Standards and interpretations not yet adopted
(ii)
AASB  15  Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers,  which  replaces  IAS  11  Construction  Contracts,  IAS  18 
Revenue and related Interpretations. AASB 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, 
how much and when revenue is recognised. AASB will become mandatory for the Company’s 30 June 2018 
financial statements. Retrospective application is generally required. The Company has not yet determined the 
potential effect of the standard.
4.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES
Share-based payment transactions
A number of the Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial 
and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes 
based on the following methods. Where applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair 
values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability. 
 
(i)   
The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo formula. Measurement 
inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the option, expected volatility (based on weighted 
average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), expected life of the option, 
expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). Service and non-market performance 
conditions attached to the option are not taken into account in determining fair value. 
 
(ii) 
Investments and other financial assets in the scope of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 
are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, or held-to-maturity 
investments  as  appropriate.  The  classification  depends  on  the  purpose  for  which  the  investments  were  acquired. 
Designation is re-evaluated at each financial year end, but there are restrictions on reclassifying to other categories. 
 
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value.

5.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
(a)    Overview 
 
The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
credit risk 
 
 
liquidity risk 
  market risk
This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks, their objectives, policies and 
processes for measuring and managing risk, and the management of capital including risks resulting from its investment 
in fair value accounted Investment. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout this financial report.  
 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management framework. 
The  Board  is  responsible  for  developing  and  monitoring  risk  management  policies.  The  Board  reviews  its  activities 
regularly. 
 
Risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate 
risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed 
regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities. The Company, through its training and 
management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all 
employees understand their roles and obligations. 
 
The Company’s Board oversees how management monitors compliance with the Company’s risk management policies and 
procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. 
 
(b)    Credit Risk 
 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s cash and cash equivalents. 
 
The Company has an internal policy to ensure its cash assets are invested amongst reputable financial institutions.  
 
(c)    Guarantees  
 
The Company’s policy is to provide financial guarantees where contractually necessary to certain suppliers or Ansteel. 
Refer to Note 23 for a list of outstanding performance and financial guarantees at balance date. 
 
(d)  
 
The Company limits its exposure to credit risk on cash balances by only investing in  liquid securities and only  with 
counterparties that have credit ratings of between A2 and A1+ from Standard & Poor’s and A from Moody’s, with more 
weighting given to investments in the higher credit ratings. Given these credit ratings, management does not expect any 
counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. The Company’s Board considers and implements appropriate investment 
strategies and ensures investment policies are adhered to.   
 
(e)    Liquidity risk 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company’s 
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage 
to the Company’s reputation. 
 
Typically the Company ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period 
of 180 days, including the servicing of financial obligations.  Refer to Notes 2(c), 13 and 19 for more information. 
 
(f)    Market risk 
 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices that 
will  affect  the  Company’s  income  or  the  value  of  its  holdings  of  financial  instruments.  The  objective  of  market  risk 
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
 
All transactions are carried out within Treasury Policy guidelines (refer to Note 5(d)), and these are considered and 
monitored by the Treasury Committee.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)
(g)    Capital management 
 
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business.  The Company manages its capital to ensure its entities will be able to 
continue as going concerns while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of its capital structure 
comprising equity and debt. 
 
The capital structure of the Company consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued 
capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 14 and 15 respectively. 
 
During 2016 the Company has maintained the capital base through a cash management strategy. Refer to Note 2(c).

Gindalbie has estimated unrecouped tax losses of $118,760,887 (2015: $115,410,667 ) available to be offset against 
future taxable income. The net deferred tax asset of 30% of $118,760,887 (2015: $115,410,667) for the Company has 
not been recognised by the Company on the basis that it is not probable that there will be future taxable income available 
against which the tax losses can be utilised.

Tax assets and liabilities 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following:
The deductible temporary differences and tax losses do not expire under current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets 
have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the Company can utilise the benefits there from.

Accounting for equity investments 
Up to 31 December 2014, the Company applied the equity method of accounting to recognise the value of its KML 
investment. The equity method applies when an investor has significant influence over the investee. 
 
Gindalbie no longer has the ability to significantly influence KML and has therefore reclassified the investment from an 
investment in an Associate to a financial asset on the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2015.  
 
The carrying amount of the investment determined by the equity method remains the carrying amount of the 
investment. The fair value of the investment in KML at both 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2016 is nil. 
 
As the investment in KML is valued at nil, no further note disclosures in regards to the investment in KML are required, 
other than contingent liabilities set out in Note 23.

12.   EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION ASSETS
Costs carried forward in respect of areas of interest in: 
 
Exploration and evaluation assets 
Carrying amount at beginning of year  
Additions 
Impairment expense of exploration and evaluation assets  
Carrying amount at end of year
Exploration  programs  in  each  area  of  interest  continue  but  have  not  reached  a  stage  which  permits  a  reasonable 
assessment  of  economically  recoverable  reserves.  The  recoverability  of  the  carrying  amounts  of  exploration  and 
evaluation assets is dependent on the successful development and commercial exploitation or sale of the respective 
area of interest. 
 
At the balance date the Directors have reviewed the Company’s exploration assets and determined that certain areas of 
interest have been impaired to reflect current market sentiment for Iron ore projects. Accordingly, $4,051,000 has been 
recognised as an impairment expense.

18.   EARNINGS PER SHARE 
 
Basic earnings per share 
The calculation of basic earnings per share at 30 June 2016 was based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders 
of $6,260,000 (2015: loss $15,695,000 ) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the 
financial year ended 30 June 2016 of 1,495,609,522(2015: 1,495,232,237 ) calculated as follows:

Fair values versus carrying amounts 
The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by the Company using available market 
information and appropriate valuation methods. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts 
that will ultimately be realized by the Company upon maturity or disposal. The use of different market assumptions 
and/or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. For all financial assets and 
liabilities the carrying value approximates fair value.

(a)   Defined contribution superannuation funds 
 
The Company makes contributions to defined contribution superannuation funds. The Company has a legally enforceable 
obligation  to  contribute  to  these  plans  and  contributes  at  the  statutory  rate  of  9.5%  of  gross  earnings.  The  amount 
recognised as expense or capitalised was $78,151 for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 (2015: $77,086).
(b)   Share based payments
The Company has an employee share option plan which was approved at the 2006 Annual General Meeting held on 
22 November 2006. 
 
Each option is convertible to one ordinary share. The exercise price of the options, determined in accordance with the 
rules of the plan, is based on the weighted average price of the Company’s shares traded during the five business days 
preceding the date of granting the option. 
 
All employee options expire on the earlier of their expiry date or three months after the termination of the employee’s 
employment. Option issues generally contain a vesting period and exercise is solely at the discretion of the holder. All 
options are unlisted and cannot be sold or transferred. 
 
There are no voting rights attached to the options or to the unissued ordinary shares. Voting rights will be attached to the 
issued ordinary shares when the options have been exercised. 
 
Summary of options over unissued ordinary shares 
Details of options over unissued ordinary shares as at the beginning and end of the reporting period and movements 
during the year are set out below. 
 
The fair value of shares issued as a result of exercising options during the reporting period is the market price of the 
shares of the Company on the Australian Securities Exchange as at close of trading on the date of issue. 
 
There were 174,915 options exercised during the year (2015: 1,440,644).

23.   CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
 
There has been a material change in the contingent liabilities  of the Company since 30 June 2015. The amended 
Anshan Share Mortgage was not approved by the non-Ansteel associated Gindalbie shareholders at the annual general 
meeting held on 27 November 2015, resulting in the Company being released from an estimated maximum potential 
liability, based on funding facilities provided as at 30 June 2015, of $708 million USD. 
The  Company  has  the  following  remaining  contingent  liabilities  with  respect  to  potential  shareholders’  guarantees 
provided by the Company in relation to certain liabilities and obligations of KML. 
Under the Agreement for the Joint Development of the Karara Iron Ore Project between Ansteel and Gindalbie (“the 
Joint  Development  Agreement”),  Gindalbie  has  provided  a  shareholder  guarantee  to  Ansteel  whereby,  with  prior 
consent of Gindalbie, any guarantees given by Ansteel to third party in respect of any liabilities or obligations of KML 
will be guaranteed by Gindalbie for its proportionate participating interest. As at 30 June 2016, Gindalbie has provided 
shareholder guarantees totalling $688 million in relation to term loans that have been provided to KML by various banks 
and bank guarantees provided to a supplier of KML. Gindalbie has accepted its proportionate share of the liability under 
the guarantees, which at the date of this report has not been triggered. 
Gindalbie has also provided parent company performance guarantees to a combined value of $70 million (2015- $70 
million), in terms of KML contract for rail haulage facility and tailings management facility.
