<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and noting the relevant recommendations of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming further</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Beijing Declaration and 
</p>
<p>Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on 
</p>
<p>Population and Development, and the outcomes of their review conferences, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council, as well as those of 
</p>
<p>the Commission on Human Rights, on the elimination of all forms of violence against 
</p>
<p>women, and recalling also relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, including its 
</p>
<p>resolution 69/147 of 18 December 2014 on the intensification of efforts to eliminate all 
</p>

<p>forms of violence against women and girls, and those of the Security Council, and relevant 
</p>
<p>resolutions and agreed conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the political declaration adopted by the Commission on the Status of 
</p>
<p>Women at its fifty-ninth session on the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and 
</p>
<p>Platform for Action, in which States pledged to take further concrete action to ensure the 
</p>
<p>full, effective and accelerated implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, and the 
</p>
<p>outcome document of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the resolution, adopted by the World Health Assembly at its sixty-
</p>
<p>seventh session, on strengthening the role of the health system in addressing violence, in 
</p>
<p>particular against women and girls, and against children, and noting the recent work on the 
</p>
<p>development of a global plan of action to strengthen the role of the health system within a 
</p>
<p>national multisectoral response to address interpersonal violence, in particular against 
</p>
<p>women and girls and against children, building on existing relevant work of the World 
</p>
<p>Health Organization, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the important and useful role that can be played by regional 
</p>
<p>conventions, instruments and initiatives to combat violence against women and girls, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that violence against women and girls is rooted in historical and 
</p>
<p>structural inequality in power relations between women and men, and that all forms of 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls seriously violate and impair or nullify their enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>all human rights and fundamental freedoms and constitute a major impediment to women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>full, equal and effective participation in society, the economy and political decision-
</p>
<p>making, 
</p>
<p><i>Gravely concerned</i> that domestic violence, including intimate partner violence, 
</p>
<p>remains the most prevalent form of violence affecting women of all social strata across the 
</p>
<p>world, and emphasizing that such violence is a violation, abuse or impairment of the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of their human rights and, as such, is unacceptable, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that violence against women and girls, including in the domestic 
</p>
<p>sphere, is a form of discrimination that seriously inhibits women&#8217;s ability to enjoy rights 
</p>
<p>and freedoms on a basis of equality with men, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that violence against women and girls, including domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, is, inter alia, a serious violation or abuse of human rights, a societal problem and a 
</p>
<p>manifestation of unequal power relations, and is intrinsically linked with gender stereotypes 
</p>
<p>that underlie and perpetuate such violence, while stressing that women&#8217;s empowerment, 
</p>
<p>including women&#8217;s economic and political empowerment, full and equal access to and 
</p>
<p>control over land and resources, and participation in decision-making processes, is essential 
</p>
<p>for addressing the underlying causes of violence against women and girls, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing further</i> the serious immediate and long-term implications for health, 
</p>
<p>including psychological, physical, sexual and reproductive health, and the enjoyment of all 
</p>
<p>human rights, that domestic violence against women of all ages can present for individuals 
</p>
<p>and families,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the vulnerability of those who suffer multiple and intersecting forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination, such as older women, indigenous women, migrant women and women with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, and the particular risk of violence they face, and stressing the urgent need to 
</p>
<p>address violence and discrimination against them, 
</p>
<p><i>Underscoring</i> the fact that shame, stigma, fear of reprisals and negative economic 
</p>
<p>consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced household income, prevent many 
</p>
<p>women and girls from leaving dangerous relationships, reporting or acting as witnesses in 
</p>
<p>cases of domestic violence, and seeking redress and justice for these crimes,  </p>


<p><i>Noting with deep concern</i> that children can also be victims of domestic violence, 
</p>
<p>including as witnesses, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that child, early and forced marriage places individuals, in particular the 
</p>
<p>girl child, at risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and 
</p>
<p>violence throughout their lives, including domestic violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that the risk and prevalence of violence against women and girls, 
</p>
<p>including domestic violence, are exacerbated in armed conflict and humanitarian crisis 
</p>
<p>situations, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Stresses</i> that &#8220;violence against women&#8221; means any act of gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or 
</p>
<p>suffering to women of any age and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life, and also notes the 
</p>
<p>economic and social harm caused by such violence; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also</i> <i>stresses</i> that domestic violence can take many different forms, including 
</p>
<p>physical, psychological and sexual violence, economic deprivation and isolation, and 
</p>
<p>neglect, occurs within the family or domestic unit, and generally between individuals who 
</p>
<p>are related through blood or intimacy; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Strongly condemns</i> all forms of violence against women of all ages, including 
</p>
<p>domestic violence, while recognizing that it is an impediment to achieving gender equality 
</p>
<p>and to the full realization of all human rights of women, while expressing concern that 
</p>
<p>domestic violence is the most prevalent and least visible forms of violence against women 
</p>
<p>and girls and that its consequences are long lasting and profound and affect many areas in 
</p>
<p>the lives of victims; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Recognizes</i> that violence against women, including domestic violence, can 
</p>
<p>take the form of an isolated act or pattern of abusive behaviour that may occur over a period 
</p>
<p>of time, which as a pattern constitute violence against women, and can include acts such as 
</p>
<p>cyberbullying and cyberstalking; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Urges</i> States to strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and 
</p>
<p>girls, and to refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid 
</p>
<p>their obligations with respect to its elimination, including harmful practices, such as child, 
</p>
<p>early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, as set out in the Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Violence against Women; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Underscores</i> that domestic violence is of public concern and that States have 
</p>
<p>the primary responsibility for protecting and promoting the human rights of women and 
</p>
<p>girls facing violence, including those facing domestic violence; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Urges</i> States to support initiatives aimed at promoting gender equality and at 
</p>
<p>preventing, responding to, and protecting women and girls from, domestic violence, 
</p>
<p>undertaken by, inter alia, relevant women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s organizations, international and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations, the private sector, media, faith and community groups, 
</p>
<p>religious leaders, parliamentarians, human rights defenders, including women human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, and other relevant civil society actors, as part of their efforts to develop targeted 
</p>
<p>and accessible programmes and policies; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Calls upon</i> States to take effective action to prevent domestic violence, 
</p>
<p>including by: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Publicly condemning, addressing and penalizing the perpetrators of offences 
</p>
<p>involving physical, sexual and psychological violence and economic deprivation occurring 
</p>
<p>in the family, which encompasses but is not limited to battering, sexual abuse of women 
</p>
<p>and girls in the household, incest, dowry-related violence, marital rape, intimate partner </p>


<p>violence, femicide, female infanticide, crimes committed against women and girls in the 
</p>
<p>name of so-called &#8220;honour&#8221;, crimes committed in the name of passion, practices harmful to 
</p>
<p>women and girls such as child, early and forced marriage, and female genital mutilation; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Preventing violations and taking steps to prevent abuses of all human rights 
</p>
<p>of women and girls, devoting particular attention to abolishing practices and legislation that 
</p>
<p>discriminate against women and girls, eliminating prejudices, harmful practices and gender 
</p>
<p>stereotypes and raising awareness of the unacceptability of violence against women and 
</p>
<p>girls, including domestic violence, at all levels; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Accelerating efforts to develop, review and strengthen inclusive policies, 
</p>
<p>including by allocating adequate resources to address the structural and underlying causes 
</p>
<p>of domestic violence against women and girls, to overcome gender stereotypes, to 
</p>
<p>encourage media to examine the impact of gender-role stereotypes, including those 
</p>
<p>perpetuated by commercial advertisements that foster gender-based violence and 
</p>
<p>inequalities, to promote zero tolerance for such violence and to remove the stigma of being 
</p>
<p>a victim and survivor of violence, thus creating an enabling and accessible environment 
</p>
<p>where women and girls can easily report incidents of violence and make use of the services 
</p>
<p>available, including protection and assistance programmes; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Ensuring access to justice and effective remedies for domestic violence, to 
</p>
<p>ensure accountability of perpetrators as a deterrent for domestic violence against women 
</p>
<p>and girls; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Promoting effective preventive measures at an early stage with women, 
</p>
<p>families and children exposed to or at risk of domestic violence, such as parenting 
</p>
<p>education and programmes and child counselling services, to reduce the risk of possible 
</p>
<p>perpetration of violence or re-victimization; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Emphasizing the important role that men and boys can play in preventing and 
</p>
<p>eliminating violence against women and girls, and further developing and implementing 
</p>
<p>measures that reinforce non-violent actions, attitudes and values, and encourage men and 
</p>
<p>boys to take an active part and become strategic partners and allies in the prevention and 
</p>
<p>elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls, and the 
</p>
<p>importance of effectively responding to violence against boys as well, in order to break 
</p>
<p>intergenerational cycles of violence; 
</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) Promoting primary prevention efforts with a coordinated range of mutually 
</p>
<p>reinforcing strategies to drive a change in the culture, attitudes and behaviour that underpin 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls; 
</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) Taking measures to empower women by, inter alia, strengthening their 
</p>
<p>economic autonomy and ensuring their full and equal participation in society and in 
</p>
<p>decision-making processes by adopting and implementing social and economic policies that 
</p>
<p>guarantee women full and equal access to quality education, including comprehensive 
</p>
<p>sexuality education,1 and training and affordable and adequate public and social services, as 
</p>
<p>well as full and equal access to financial resources and decent work, and full and equal 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Sexuality education is defined as an age-appropriate, culturally relevant approach to teaching about 
</p>
<p>sex and relationships by providing scientifically accurate, realistic and non-judgemental information. 
</p>
<p>Sexuality education provides opportunities to explore one&#8217;s own values and attitudes and to build 
</p>
<p>decision-making, communication and risk-reduction skills about many aspects of sexuality. United

<p>rights to own and have access to and control over land and other property, and guaranteeing 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; inheritance rights; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to take effective action to respond to domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, including by: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Adopting, strengthening and implementing legislation that prohibits such 
</p>
<p>violence, including partner violence and marital rape, prescribes punitive measures and 
</p>
<p>establishes adequate legal protection against such violence, including victim and witness 
</p>
<p>protection from reprisals for bringing complaints or giving evidence; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Ensuring women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; unimpeded access to justice, effective legal 
</p>
<p>assistance and information regarding their rights without discrimination so that they have 
</p>

</p>
<p>through, where necessary, the adoption of national legislation; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Exercising due diligence to prevent, investigate and penalize all forms of 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls and to ensure accountability for acts of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, including by providing safe and appropriate complaint channels; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Creating, developing and implementing a set of policies, and supporting the 
</p>
<p>establishment of rehabilitative services, in order to encourage and bring changes in the 
</p>
<p>attitudes and behaviour of perpetrators of violence against women and girls, and to reduce 
</p>
<p>the likelihood of reoffending, including in cases of domestic violence, rape and harassment, 
</p>
<p>as well as monitoring and assessing their impact and effect; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Establishing comprehensive, coordinated, interdisciplinary, accessible and 
</p>
<p>sustained multisectoral services, programmes and responses at all levels to provide 
</p>
<p>immediate protection and support through which shelter and legal, health and psychological 
</p>
<p>counselling and other services are available to all women facing or subjected to violence, 
</p>
<p>and promoting collaboration and coordination among agencies; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Providing training to relevant public officials in law enforcement, the 
</p>

</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Providing relevant, comprehensive victim-centered legal protections to 
</p>
<p>support and assist victims of domestic violence within the framework of their national legal 
</p>
<p>systems, including, as appropriate, legislative or other measures throughout the criminal

<p>and civil justice system, such as specialized courts, protection orders, the use of threat 
</p>
<p>assessments and risk analysis tools, and provisions to address their special needs as 
</p>
<p>witnesses, at all stages of investigations and judicial proceedings; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Establishing comprehensive, coordinated, interdisciplinary, accessible and 
</p>
<p>sustained multisectoral services, programmes and responses at all levels for all victims and 
</p>
<p>survivors of all forms of violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, 
</p>
<p>that are adequately resourced and include effective and coordinated action by, as 
</p>
<p>appropriate, police and the justice sector, legal aid services, health-care services, including 
</p>

</p>
<p>assistance, protection and support through access to long-term accommodation; </p>


<p>(<i>c</i>) Fulfilling their obligations at all levels to promote and protect all human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms, including those of women and girls, and exercising due 
</p>
<p>diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and hold to account perpetrators, and to 
</p>
<p>eliminate impunity and provide for access to appropriate remedies for victims and

</p>
<p>orders of protection and criminal sanctions; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Establishing and/or strengthening police and health workers&#8217; response 
</p>
<p>protocols and procedures to ensure that all appropriate actions are taken to protect victims 
</p>
<p>of domestic violence and to prevent further acts of domestic violence; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Also urges</i> States to ensure the promotion and protection of the human rights 
</p>
<p>of all women and their sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population 
</p>
<p>and Development, the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their 
</p>
<p>review conferences, including through the development and enforcement of policies and 
</p>
<p>legal frameworks and the strengthening of health systems that make universally accessible 
</p>
<p>and available quality, comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services, 
</p>
<p>commodities, information and education, including, inter alia, safe and effective methods of 
</p>
<p>modern contraception, emergency contraception, prevention programmes for adolescent 
</p>
<p>pregnancy, maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric 
</p>
<p>care, which will reduce obstetric fistula and other complications of pregnancy and delivery, 
</p>
<p>safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law, and prevention and 
</p>
<p>treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and 
</p>
<p>reproductive cancers, recognizing that human rights include the right to have control over 
</p>
<p>and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and 
</p>
<p>reproductive health, free from coercion, discrimination and violence; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Encourages</i> States to improve the collection, harmonization and use of data 
</p>
<p>disaggregated by sex, administrative data, including, where appropriate, from the police, 
</p>
<p>the health sector and the judiciary, on incidents of violence against women and girls, 
</p>
<p>including domestic violence, such as data on the relationship between the perpetrator and 
</p>
<p>victim and geographic location, ensuring that confidentiality and ethical and safety 
</p>
<p>considerations are taken into account in the process of data collection, and improving the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of the services and programmes provided and protecting the safety and 
</p>
<p>security of the victim; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Reaffirms</i> the importance of a stand-alone goal on achieving gender equality 
</p>
<p>and the empowerment of women and girls, including a target on eliminating all forms of 
</p>
<p>violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres by 2030, and looks 
</p>
<p>forward to the integration of a gender perspective into the post-2015 development agenda 
</p>
<p>and the mainstreaming of gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment into all sustainable 
</p>
<p>development goals, as reflected in the report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Goals,<footnote name="2">See General Assembly resolution 68/309, and A/68/970 and Corr.1.  
</footnote> which is the main basis for integrating sustainable development goals 
</p>
<p>into the post-2015 development agenda, while recognizing that other inputs will also be 
</p>
<p>considered; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Welcomes</i> the mandate and the work of the Special Rapporteur on violence 
</p>
<p>against women, its causes and consequences, and takes note of the thematic report on 
</p>
<p>regional initiatives to combat violence against women;<footnote name="3">A/HRC/29/27. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>15. <i>Notes</i> that, in its report,<footnote name="4">A/HRC/29/40. </footnote> the Working Group on the issue of discrimination 
</p>
<p>against women in law and in practice underlines the pervasiveness of domestic violence and 
</p>
<p>the negative impact it has on women and on society as a whole; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Welcomes</i> the panel discussion on domestic violence against women and 
</p>
<p>girls, held during the annual full-day discussion on women&#8217;s human rights at the twenty-
</p>
<p>ninth session of the Human Rights Council, and requests the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
