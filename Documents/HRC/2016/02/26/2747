<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent elaborated the present 
draft Programme of Action for the Decade for People of African Descent (2013&#8211;<footnote name="2">5. International human rights law7  has recognized the need for special measures to 
remedy or compensate for the effects of past injustice and structural discrimination in order 
to avoid the perpetuation of such discrimination and as a means of guaranteeing substantive 
equality and the enjoyment of fundamental rights. 
</footnote>023) as 
requested by General Assembly resolution 66/144. The draft is firmly anchored in the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the Outcome document of the Durban 
Review Conference, the political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General 
Assembly to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action (General Assembly resolution 66/3) and the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is based on contributions 
received from Member States and other stakeholders, as well as comments made during the 
eleventh session of the Working Group. It gives an overview of the current human rights 
situation of and the challenges faced by people of African descent, thereby strengthening 
the rationale for the Decade. It proposes &#8220;recognition, justice and development&#8221; as themes 
</p>
<p>for the Decade and identifies priority areas and specific recommendations, including in the 
areas of education and awareness-raising around the history, experiences and contributions 
of people of African descent to global development; the participation and inclusion of 
people of African descent in all areas of society; discrimination in the administration of 
justice; the adoption of special measures; the promotion of the right to development and 
measures against poverty; access to quality education, employment, housing and health; 
and addressing multiple forms of discrimination. It also proposes an international strategy,

<p> United Nations A/HRC/21/60/Add.<footnote name="2">4. Concerning reparations for slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, the Durban 
Declaration recognizes and reaffirms the right of individual victims to seek just and 
adequate reparation or satisfaction for any damage suffered as a result of racial 
discrimination (para. 104) and affirms that &#8220;telling the truth about history [is an essential 
element] for international reconciliation and the creation of societies based on justice, 
equality and solidarity&#8221; (para. 106).  Further, the Declaration notes &#8220;that some States have 
taken the initiative to apologize and have paid reparation, where appropriate, for grave and 
massive violations committed&#8221; (para. 100) and calls on those that have not yet expressed 
remorse or presented apologies to contribute to the restoration of the dignity of the victims 
(para. 101) and cites that taking appropriate steps to address the lasting consequences is a 
&#8220;moral obligation&#8221; (para. 102).

</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.<footnote name="2">3. The notion of justice recognizes that people of African descent have historically 
been and continue to be victims of violations of their human rights. It is therefore necessary 
to ensure the full and effective implementation of relevant human rights instruments; 
combat the widespread impunity for manifestations and practices of racism and racial 
discrimination against people of African descent and ensure equal access to justice and 
equal protection of the law at all stages of law enforcement, from interaction with the 
police, to presentation of court cases and sentencing.

<p>and coordination mechanisms at the national, regional and international levels. Owing to 
the special and unique nature of discrimination often faced by people of African descent, 
particularly related to the legacies of colonialism, slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, 
the Working Group deems it appropriate to make a careful distinction between their 
situation and that of other groups who also face racial and other forms of discrimination. It 
also sees the need to construct and delineate specific juridical categories that make it 
possible to address their needs adequately and overcome the obstacles they face. Therefore, 
in line with a recommendation from the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, the Working Group recommends the elaboration of a draft United Nations 
declaration on the promotion and full respect of the human rights of people of African 
descent by 2015 for the approval by the Human Rights Council.

</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. The General Assembly, in its resolution 66/144, adopted at its sixty-sixth session, 
encouraged the Working Group to develop a programme of action, including a theme for 
adoption by the Human Rights Council, with a view to proclaiming the decade starting 
2013 the Decade for People of African Descent.   
</p>
<p>2. In developing this draft Programme of Action, the Working Group stresses the 
centrality of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and is committed to acting 
within the context of its full and effective implementation, especially its recommended 
strategies to address the legacies of slavery, the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism, 
which have largely determined the present condition of people of African descent. The 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action is very clear about the causes and 
consequences of the current condition of people of African descent, stating in paragraph 13 
that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;slavery and the slave trade are a crime against humanity and should always have 
been so, especially the transatlantic slave trade and are among the major sources and 
manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Africans and people of African descent, Asians and people of Asian descent and 
indigenous peoples were victims of these acts and continue to be victims of their 
consequences&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>3. In that light, the Working Group has developed the present Draft Programme of 
Action for the Decade for People of African Descent, to be submitted for adoption to the 
twenty-first session of the Human Rights Council and subsequently to the sixty-seventh 
session of the General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>4. The  Working Group stresses that the Decade should build on the International Year 
for People of African Descent in 2011 during  which many events and forums took place, 
particularly in the Caribbean and Latin America, including the High-Level Ibero-American 
Summit to Celebrate the International Year for People of African Descent in Salvador, 
Brazil, the World Summit of African Descendants in La Ceiba, Honduras, the International 
Meeting of Afro-Descendents and Revolutionary Transformations in Latin America and the 
Caribbean in Caracas, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and events in Europe and in 
North America organized by civil society actors. Subsequent to these various events, 
Member States, international organizations and civil society recommended launching a 
decade for people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>5. In addition to being firmly anchored in the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action, the present Draft Programme of Action is based on provisions contained in the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference, the political declaration contained 
in General Assembly resolution 66/3; conclusions and recommendations adopted by the 
Working Group, general recommendations made by human rights treaty monitoring bodies, 
particularly general recommendation No. 34 (2011) on racial discrimination against people 
of African descent, No. 32 (2009) on the meaning and scope of special measures in the 
International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and No. 31 (2005) on 
the prevention of racial discrimination in the administration and functioning of the criminal 
justice system adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination; 
country and thematic reports prepared by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the Independent Expert 
on minority issues and other relevant special procedures of the Human Rights Council. In 
addition, the Working Group has taken into account the responses to the questionnaire 
requesting inputs for the elaboration of the present draft Programme of Action, circulated in 
February 2012, to Member States, United Nations bodies, programmes, funds and 
specialized agencies, regional organizations, national human rights institutions and civil 
society. The Working Group has also drawn from presentations and comments made by 
panellists and participants during its eleventh session and comments received in June 2012 
on the first draft Programme of Action. Relevant studies made at the regional level by the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the European Commission against 
Racism and Intolerance were also taken into account. 
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group would like to extend a special thanks to all stakeholders 
participated in the drafting process, providing important and insightful suggestions and 
contributions. The Working Group notes with appreciation the numerous steps and 
advances towards and measures to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the rights of people 
of African descent that States have already taken and the invaluable role that other actors 
including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have played in these processes.   
</p>
<p>7. A compilation of the submissions received is available for consultation in the 
secretariat of the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent. The list of 
stakeholders that provided replies to the questionnaire seeking views for the elaboration of 
the draft Programme of Action for the Decade and written comments to the first draft of the 
Programme of Action is contained in annex I. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Overview of the current human rights situation of people of African 
</b></p>
<p><b>descent 
</b></p>
<p>8. In line with the definition contained in general recommendation No. 34 of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, people of African descent are 
those referred to as such in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and who 
identify themselves as of African descent. People of African descent comprise a 
heterogeneous group with diverse histories, experiences and identities. The circumstances 
in which these people live and the problems they face differ from country to country and 
region to region. Nevertheless, it is possible to highlight a series of general and global 
cross-cutting issues that must be addressed.  
</p>
<p>9. Racism and structural and institutional discrimination against people of African 
descent, rooted in the infamous regime of slavery, the slave trade and colonialism and 
reinforced by the context of globalization, are evident in the situations of inequality, 
marginalization and stigmatization affecting those people worldwide. They are manifested, 
inter alia, in their grouping among the poorest of the poor in many countries, often 
inhabiting the regions, districts and areas, both rural and urban, with the most precarious 
infrastructure and being more exposed to crime and violence; low levels of participation 
and underrepresentation in political and institutional decision-making processes; barriers in 
access to and completion of quality education, which results in the intergenerational 
transmission of poverty; inequality in access to labour markets; a disproportionate presence </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>in prison populations; limited social recognition and valuing of their ethnic and cultural 
diversity; and intolerance against religions of African origin.<footnote name="1">5 Durban Declaration, para. 107.  </footnote>  
</p>
<p>10. Many people of African descent facing racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance on the grounds of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin 
suffer multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination based on other related grounds such 
as age, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, social origin, property, birth or 
other status. Women of African descent have historically suffered and continue to suffer 
compounded discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, socioeconomic status and 
gender. This multiple discrimination manifests in situations of limited access to education, 
employment and security, and vulnerability to gender-based violence. Furthermore, they 
often suffer higher rates of maternal mortality due to limited access to maternal health 
care.2 Multiple forms of discrimination are also a recurring reason for the denial or 
deprivation of nationality and therefore a cause of statelessness. 
</p>
<p>11. The relationship between race, social and economic status and citizenship means 
that migrants, refugees and asylum seekers of African descent around the world are often in 
particularly vulnerable situations. Many experience violations related both to xenophobia as 
foreigners and racism based on their African descent. They often encounter barriers in 
access to employment and work in informal and precarious jobs, often in dangerous 
conditions. Access to health services, education, housing and social security is also 
particularly limited for many such migrants.   
</p>
<p>12. Public and political discourse and its impact on immigration policies often results in 
migrants and indeed nationals facing racial discrimination and being used as scapegoats for 
economic and social difficulties faced by societies, particularly in relation to the availability 
of jobs, housing and health services. Within such discourse, they are often portrayed as 
criminals and security threats, which enflames mistrust, fear and resentment resulting in 
further discrimination, racism and xenophobic attitudes and often manifested in violent 
acts.3 Migrants in an irregular situation, refugees and asylum seekers are particularly 
targeted. In some countries, people of African descent are also often disproportionately 
represented among groups of internally displaced persons.  
</p>
<p>13. Institutional discrimination in justice systems often impacts upon people of African 
descent. The impossibility of accessing domestic judicial remedies and complaint 
mechanisms, be they administrative or judicial, is a factor contributing to the persistence of 
racism. In addition, the absence of judicial guarantees and the lack of sensitivity of justice 
system operators with respect to racial discrimination, contribute to even deeper resignation 
on the part of the discriminated groups, and help perpetuate patterns of exclusion and 
impunity.<footnote name="4">5. Relevant civil society actors, including NGOs, workers&#8217; and employers&#8217; 
organizations, labour unions, the mass media, religious organizations, community 
organizations, the family, independent information, resource and training centres and others 
should be mobilized for the purpose of incorporating inclusive education which challenges 
racism and discrimination into non-formal programmes. 
</footnote>   
</p>
<p>14. Young men of African descent face alarmingly high rates of police violence. Racial 
profiling continues to be widely applied as a selective and discretionary mechanism for 
detaining and investigating and this practice is inextricably linked to the overrepresentation 
of people of African descent in arrest rates, and in prison populations.

</b></p>
<p>15. The discrimination that people of African descent face perpetuates cycles of 
disadvantage which hinder human development. Yet in accordance with the Declaration on 
the Right to Development, they should be guaranteed equal right to full, active and 
meaningful participation in development decision-making, and to benefit equally and fairly 
from development gains. Article 6 embodies non-discrimination and the elimination of 
obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights, as well 
as economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>16. The situation of people of African descent in many cases remains largely invisible, 
with a lack of official disaggregated statistical data to demonstrate the extent of 
discrimination. Furthermore, there is limited recognition of their histories, heritage and 
contributions to nations&#8217; development in education curricula, popular culture or the media, 
and images of people of African descent often reinforce negative stereotypes informed by 
deep-rooted discriminatory attitudes. Insufficient recognition and respect have been given 
to the efforts of people of African descent to seek redress for their present conditions, 
including through calls &#8220;of the moral obligation on the part of all concerned States to take 
</p>
<p>appropriate and effective measures to halt and reverse the lasting consequences of those 
practices&#8221;.<footnote name="5">Durban Declaration, para. 102. </footnote> This should include reparations. The Working Group hopes that it will see 
progress in this regard during the Decade. 
</p>
<p>17. It is expected that the Programme of Action for the Decade for People of African 
Descent will contribute to achieving equality and non-discrimination and strengthening the 
rule of law and democracy. It should be a useful tool to pave the way for future work by all 
States in all regions of the world, the international community and civil society for the 
promotion and protection of all human rights of all people of African descent. Further 
efforts are needed by States to protect people of African descent from racial discrimination 
and to ensure their equal enjoyment of all human rights. As such the Working Group calls 
on all relevant actors to work together at national, regional and international levels to 
achieve the goals set forth in the Draft Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Normative framework for the Decade 
</b></p>
<p>18. Non-discrimination and equality before and of the law constitute fundamental 
principles of international human rights law and underpin the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the main international human rights treaties and instruments. 
Furthermore, the International Court of Justice held that the prohibition of racial 
discrimination constituted an obligation <i>erga omnes</i>.  
</p>
<p>19. The right to equality and non-discrimination requires States to guarantee non-
discrimination in the exercise of human rights; they must therefore strive to guarantee 
human rights on the basis of equality of access, opportunity and results, in fact and in law, 
for all persons, including people of African descent. States have the obligation to prevent 
and punish the violation of human rights by any State or non-State actor and adopt all 
necessary measures, including special measures, to remove obstacles that may impinge 
upon the enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights are 
also essential for achieving the aims and objectives of the Decade.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Theme 
</b></p>
<p>21. The suggested theme for the Decade is &#8220;Recognition, Justice, Development,&#8221; which 
the Working Group considers as interdependent and mutually reinforcing.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Recognition 
</b></p>
<p>22. Recognition of people of African descent as a distinct group is essential to 
increasing their visibility and thus to the realization of their rights. People of African 
descent must be recognized in national constitutions and legislation. Special attention must 
be paid to the collection of data to assess their situation, which should be disaggregated in 
accordance with provisions on human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as data 
protection regulations and privacy guarantees.6 Respect for the culture, identity, history and 
heritage of people of African descent should be guaranteed and is essential for States to 
acknowledge and address the discrimination faced by people of African descent.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Development  
</b></p>
<p>26. Paragraph 158 of the Durban Programme of Action &#8220;recognizes that &#8230; historical 
injustices have undeniably contributed to the poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, 
social exclusion, economic disparities, instability and insecurity that affect many people in 
different parts of the world, in particular in developing countries&#8221; and recognizes &#8220;the need 
</p>
<p>to develop programmes for the social and economic development of these societies and the 
diaspora, within the framework of a new partnership based on the spirit of solidarity and 
mutual respect&#8221; in areas such as debt relief, poverty eradication, market access and the 
promotion of foreign direct investment. The draft Programme of Action therefore considers 
development for people of African descent in two ways. Firstly, the role that people of 
African descent have played in global development must be recognized both in terms of the 
contribution that the African continent has historically made to worldwide development, 
including during the transatlantic slave trade, and the contributions that Africans and the 
African diaspora have made and continue to make to the development of nations. Secondly, 
in a period of economic and financial crisis, a human rights-based approach should be 
integrated into all development activities where the realization of rights including the fight 
against poverty and access to education, health, employment and political participation are 
the goals of development. The Declaration on the Right to Development recognizes that 
development is a comprehensive economic, social, cultural and political process, which 
aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all 
individuals on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development 
and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom, without any kind of 
discrimination. It should also be stressed that repairing the damage done by slavery and the 
slave trade will contribute to development. 
</p>
<p>27. The historic and continued underdevelopment that has plagued people of African 
descent throughout the world must be reversed and specific attention must be paid to this 
group in initiatives to realize the Millennium Development Goals and post-2015 
international and national development objectives. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Objectives 
</b></p>
<p>28. Based on the given mandate and with due consideration to the current and historic 
situation of people of African descent and the imperatives outlined in the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, it is recommended that the Programme of Action for 
the Decade should have the following key objectives:  
</p>
<p> (a) To ensure the right to the full enjoyment by people of African descent in all 
regions of the world of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, as recognized in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, through the effective implementation of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the Outcome Document of the Durban 
Review Conference, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, and other relevant international and regional human rights 
instruments; 
</p>
<p> (b) To eliminate racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance and promote full and effective equality for people of African descent 
particularly through special measures/affirmative action and in a manner that is culturally 
relevant; 
</p>
<p> (c) To create for people of African descent an appropriate tool for empowerment 
which guarantees their meaningful participation and inclusion in development processes; in 
social, economic, cultural, political and civil life; and in decisions that affect their lives; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p> (d) To increase the visibility of people of African descent by ensuring the 
collection of disaggregated data and research, and sensitizing them and wider society about 
their human rights, cultures and contributions to the development of  societies and their 
histories including the history and ongoing consequences of slavery, the slave trade, the 
transatlantic slave trade and colonialism; 
</p>
<p> (e) To urge international financial and development institutions and the 
operational programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations to give greater 
priority to and allocate appropriate funding for programmes addressing the development 
challenges of the affected States and societies, in particular those on the African continent 
and in the diaspora;<footnote name="8">Durban Programme of Action, para. 159. </footnote>  
</p>
<p> (f) To adopt and strengthen international, regional and national legal framework 
on the rights of people of African descent, particularly as recommended by the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, through the adoption of a United Nations 
declaration on the promotion and full respect of the human rights of people of African 
descent.

<p>29. States should take the necessary steps to give full effect to the right to equality and 
non-discrimination of people of African descent: 
</p>
<p> (a) Recognizing the interdependence of rights and the importance of a holistic 
approach to achieving equality and non-discrimination, take necessary steps to remove all 
obstacles that prevent the equal enjoyment of economic, social, cultural, civil and political 
rights by people of African descent and promote the effective implementation of relevant 
national and international legal framework;  
</p>
<p> (b) Undertake a comprehensive review of domestic legislation, with a view to (i) 
identifying and abolishing provisions that entail direct or indirect discrimination; (ii) 
recognizing where relevant people of African descent in national constitutions; (iii) 
adopting comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation ensuring its effective enforcement. 
Reform of existing norms is an obligation, and also an important tool for shedding light on 
the situation of people of African descent and helping to raise awareness and alter historical 
patterns of marginalization and exclusion; 
</p>
<p> (c) Adopt and implement projects, programmes and any initiative designed to 
ensure full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by people of 
African descent, including national action plans against racial discrimination;  
</p>
<p> (d) Establish and maintain a body or a system of coordinated bodies to promote 
racial equality. States must ensure the independent status and competences of such bodies 
in line with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and 
protection of human rights (Paris Principles), as well as ensuring adequate funding and 
transparent procedures for the appointment and removal of their members; 
</p>
<p> (e) Provide training and capacity-building for national human rights institutions 
and other relevant governmental bodies to ensure principles of equality and non-
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>discrimination and issues affecting people of African descent are addressed through their 
work.  Relevant Government bodies should carry out activities to promote and protect the 
rights of people of African descent within their programmes.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Education on equality and awareness-raising  
</b></p>
<p>30. Recognizing the contribution of the African Continent and people of African descent 
to the development, diversity and richness of world civilizations and cultures which 
constitute the common heritage of humankind, States should, in collaboration with relevant 
United Nations bodies and agencies, particularly the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and international donors:  
</p>
<p> (a) Preserve and promote greater knowledge of and respect for people of African 
descent&#8217;s heritage, culture and history, including the transatlantic slave trade, and increase 
</p>
<p>their visibility and recognition of people of African descent and the African Continent 
contributions to their respective societies and to global development, emphasizing them as 
survivors or resisters, whilst also recognizing them as victims of human rights violations 
under international law;  
</p>
<p> (b) Recalling paragraph 99 of the Durban Declaration, in which States concerned 
are called upon &#8220;to honour the memory of the victims of past tragedies and affirm that, 
wherever and whenever these occurred, they must be condemned and their recurrence 
prevented&#8221;, adopt measures to preserve, protect and restore the intangible patrimony and 
spiritual memory of sites and places of the slave trade and slave resistance, giving increased 
visibility to this history and culture through museums, monuments, visual arts and other 
means, such as the permanent memorial at the United Nations headquarters to honour the 
memory of the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade; 
</p>
<p> (c) Revise and develop specific curricula and corresponding teaching materials 
which respect and recognize the history, including the transatlantic slave trade. Such 
curricula should be incorporated into formal and informal education at the early childhood, 
primary, secondary, post-secondary and adult education levels. People of African descent 
should have the opportunity to contribute to the development of such curricula; 
</p>
<p> (d) Through intercultural education, dialogue and awareness-raising measures 
work towards the elimination of sociocultural ideas inherited from the period of slavery and 
colonialism, which perpetuate racism and racial discrimination against people of African 
descent and their continued invisibility at all levels of society;  
</p>
<p> (e) Make history a compulsory subject at the primary and secondary educational 
levels, thereby giving children of African descent a connection with their past and a sense 
of cultural identity; 
</p>
<p> (f) Support radio, television and Internet programmes about history and cultures 
of people of African descent and promote more positive and inclusive representations 
which increase their visibility within society and challenge negative stereotypes and 
resultant discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (g) Promote research on past and present conditions of people of African descent 
and compile existing information on their contribution to their respective societies in order 
to foster the development of national identity from a democratic perspective, recognizing 
diversity and promoting knowledge and understanding of the causes and consequences of 
racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p> (h) Special attention should be given to the training of Government officials, 
including law enforcement officers, such as the police, lawyers, judges and migrant and 
prison officials, the Armed Forces, teachers and curriculum developers, international civil 
servants, development officers, peacekeepers, the media, parliamentarians, civil society </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>organizations and other groups which are in a particular position to affect the rights of 
people of African descent. Such training should aim at ending negative representations of 
Africans and African descendants that cause racism and racial discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (i) Consider establishing a national day for people of African descent and for the 
commemoration of the victims of the slave trade in consultation with people of African 
descent. Other relevant days, such as the International Day for the Remembrance of the 
Slave Trade and its Abolition (23 August), the International Day of Remembrance of the 
Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade (25 March), African Liberation Day 
(25 May), and the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (21 
March) should also be commemorated; 
</p>
<p> (j) Share and exchange good practices from countries and regions that address 
the legacy of slavery and build inclusive, intercultural and multi-ethnic societies. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General recommendation No. 34 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>31. Recalling the Committee&#8217;s general recommendation No. 34, which recognizes that 
people of African descent live in many countries of the world, either dispersed among the 
local population or in communities, where they are entitled to exercise, without 
discrimination, individually or in community with other members of their group, as 
appropriate, the following specific rights: 
</p>
<p> (a) The right to property and to the use, conservation and protection of lands 
traditionally occupied by them and to natural resources in cases where their ways of life and 
culture are linked to their utilization of lands and resources; 
</p>
<p> (b) The right to their cultural identity, to keep, maintain and foster their mode of 
life and forms of organization, culture, languages and religious expressions; 
</p>
<p> (c) The right to the protection of their traditional knowledge and their cultural 
and artistic heritage; 
</p>
<p> (d) The right to prior consultation with respect to decisions which may affect 
their rights, in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Information-gathering 
</b></p>
<p>32. In accordance with paragraph 92 of the Durban Programme of Action, States should:  
</p>
<p> (a) Collect, compile, analyse, disseminate and publish reliable statistical data at 
the national and local levels and undertake all other related measures which are necessary 
to assess regularly the situation of individuals and groups of individuals who are victims of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 
</p>
<p> (b) Such statistical data should be disaggregated in accordance with national 
legislation. Any such information shall, as appropriate, be collected with the explicit 
consent of the victims, based on their self-identification and in accordance with provisions 
on human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as data protection regulations and privacy 
guarantees. This information must not be misused; 
</p>
<p> (c) The statistical data and information should be collected with the objective of 
monitoring the situation of marginalized groups, and the development and evaluation of 
legislation, policies, practices and other measures aimed at preventing and combating 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, as well as for the purpose 
of determining whether any measures have an unintentional disparate impact on victims. To 
that end, it recommends the development of voluntary, consensual and participatory 
strategies in the process of collecting, designing and using information; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p> (d) The information should take into account economic and social indicators, 
including, where appropriate, health and health status, infant and maternal mortality, life 
expectancy, literacy, education, employment, housing, land ownership, mental and physical 
health care, water, sanitation, energy and communications services, poverty and average 
disposable income in order to elaborate social and economic development policies with a 
view to closing the existing gaps in social and economic conditions. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Participation and inclusion 
</b></p>
<p>33. States must facilitate full participation and inclusion of people of African descent in 
all political, economic, social and cultural aspects of society, including all levels of 
decision-making processes and in the advancement and economic development of the 
country in which they live, as well as their country of origin. To this end, States are 
requested to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Undertake capacity-building and awareness-raising campaigns in 
communities to encourage active participation in electoral processes; 
</p>
<p> (b) Consult and involve people of African descent in the development and 
implementation of laws, policies and programmes that concern them; 
</p>
<p> (c) Implement activities and programmes to strengthen leadership among people 
of African descent; 
</p>
<p> (d) Undertake initiatives for participation which should be carried out with 
special consideration for the meaningful participation of women and young people of 
African descent. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Justice 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>34. Much of the unjust treatment experienced by people of African descent stems from 
the triple effects of colonialism, slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. States must 
therefore introduce all the necessary steps to ensure equality before the law, notably in the 
enjoyment of the right to equal treatment before the tribunals and all other organs 
administering justice, including: 
</p>
<p> (a) Assuring for people of African descent effective protection and remedies, 
through the competent national tribunals and other State institutions, against any acts of 
racial discrimination, as well as the right to seek from such tribunals just and adequate 
reparation or satisfaction for any damage suffered as a result of such discrimination;<footnote name="9">Art. 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 
 10 Ibid, art. 4. </footnote>  
</p>
<p> (b) Criminalizing all acts of racism in particular the dissemination of ideas based 
on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial hatred, violence or incitement to racial 
violence, but also racist propaganda activities and participation in racist organizations. 
States are also encouraged to incorporate a provision in their criminal legislation to the 
effect that committing offences for racial reasons generally constitutes an aggravating 
circumstance;<footnote name="1">4 Ibid., para. 100.  </footnote>0   
</p>
<p> (c) Fully implementing general recommendation No. 31 of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, particularly:  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>(i) Facilitating access to justice for people of African descent who are victims of 
racism, by supplying the requisite legal information about their rights; promoting, in 
areas where people of African descent live, institutions such as free legal help and 
advice centres, and centres for reconciliation and mediation; granting victims 
effective judicial cooperation and legal aid, including the assistance of counsel and 
an interpreter free of charge;  
</p>
<p>(ii) Instructing competent services to receive people of African descent who are 
victims of acts of racism in police stations in a satisfactory manner, so that 
complaints are recorded immediately, investigations are pursued without delay and 
in an effective, independent and impartial manner, and files relating to racist or 
xenophobic incidents are retained and incorporated into databases;  
</p>
<p>(iii) Seeking to eliminate the potential discriminatory effects of certain domestic 
legislation on terrorism, immigration, nationality, banning or deportation of non-
citizens from a country, as well as legislation that has the effect of penalizing 
without legitimate grounds certain groups or membership of certain communities, 
including people of African descent, and in any case respecting the principle of 
proportionality in its application; 
</p>
<p>(iv) Pursuing national strategies with the objective of eliminating  laws that have 
an impact in terms of racial discrimination, particularly those which target people of 
African descent indirectly by penalizing acts which can be committed only by them, 
or laws that apply only to non-nationals without legitimate grounds or which do not 
respect the principle of proportionality; and  developing, through appropriate 
education programmes, training in respect for human rights, as well as sensitization 
to intercultural relations for law enforcement officials, police personnel, and persons 
working in the system of justice to eliminate discriminatory practices including 
institutional racism;  
</p>
<p>(v) Taking the necessary steps to prevent questioning, arrests and searches which 
are in reality based solely on the physical appearance of people of African descent, 
or any profiling which exposes them to greater suspicion. To that end, it is vital both 
to modify institutionalized stereotypes concerning people of African descent and to 
apply appropriate sanctions against law enforcements officials who act on the basis 
of racial profiles;  
</p>
<p>(vi) Preventing and punishing violence, acts of torture, cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment and all violations of human rights affecting people of African 
descent which are committed by State officials, particularly police and army 
personnel, customs authorities, and persons working in airports, penal institutions 
and social, medical and psychiatric services;  
</p>
<p>(vii) Ensuring  that people of African descent, like all other persons, enjoy all the 
guarantees of a fair trial and equality before the law, as enshrined in the relevant 
international human rights instruments and specifically the right to presumption of 
innocence, the right to assistance of counsel and to an interpreter; the right to an 
independent and impartial tribunal and guarantees of fair punishment and the 
enjoyment of all the rights to which prisoners are entitled under the relevant 
international norms.  
</p>
<p> (d) Bring to justice all offenders involved in trafficking and designing anti-
trafficking campaigns, setting up special protection mechanisms, such as sheltered housing 
and special residence permits for women who want to escape from traffickers, and ensuring 
that social inclusion programmes for victims of trafficking are established; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p> (e) Special attention should be given to the training and sensitization of police, 
prison officials, lawyers, judges and other justice officials. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Special measures 
</b></p>
<p>35. The adoption of special measures, such as affirmative action, is essential to 
alleviating and remedying disparities in the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms affecting people of African descent, protecting them from discrimination and 
overcoming persistent or structural disparities and de facto inequalities resulting from 
historical circumstances.<footnote name="1">3 Ibid., para. 5.  </footnote>1 As such States should: 
</p>
<p> (a) Develop or elaborate national action plans to promote diversity, equality, 
social justice, equality of opportunity and the participation of all. Through, among other 
things, affirmative or positive actions and strategies, these plans should aim at creating 
conditions for all to participate effectively in decision-making and realize civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social rights in all spheres of life on the basis of non-
discrimination;<footnote name="12">Durban Programme of Action, para. 99.  </footnote>   
</p>
<p> (b) Supported by international cooperation as appropriate, consider positively 
concentrating additional investments in health-care systems, education, public health, 
electricity, drinking water and environmental control, as well as other affirmative or 
positive action initiatives, in communities of primarily African descent;13  
</p>
<p> (c) Establish, on the basis of statistical information, national programmes, 
including affirmative or positive measures, to promote access to basic social services, 
including primary education, basic health care and adequate housing for people of African 
descent;14 
</p>
<p> (d) Design, promote and implement at the national, regional and international 
level strategies which may include special and positive measures, for furthering equal social 
development and the realization of the civil and political, economic, social and cultural 
rights of people of African descent, including through more effective access to the political, 
judicial and administrative institutions;15  
</p>
<p> (e) Adopt measures to achieve appropriate representation in educational 
institutions, housing, political parties, parliaments and employment, especially in the 
judiciary, police, army and other civil services, which in some cases might involve electoral 
reforms, land reforms and campaigns for equal participation.16  
</p>
<p><b> C. Development 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Right to development and measures against poverty  
</b></p>
<p>36. States should take measures to realize the right to development for people of African 
descent as required by the 1986 Declaration on the Right to Development, taking into 
</p>
<p>  
 11 See general recommendations Nos. 34 and 32 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, as well as reiterated in observations and recommendations made by the Committee to 
State parties. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>account17 the need to redress historical injustices through development programmes.  
Recognizing that poverty is both a cause and a consequence of discrimination, States 
should also take a rights-based approach to poverty alleviation which eliminates 
discrimination including: 
</p>
<p> (a) Implementing development initiatives which aim to realize the rights of 
people of African descent, in a manner appropriate to their culture and identity.  
Approaches should recognize the interdependence and interrelatedness of rights, taking a 
holistic approach to development and ensuring the full, active and meaningful participation 
of people of African descent throughout development programme cycles;  
</p>
<p> (b) Undertaking all necessary measures for the realization of the right to 
development of people of African descent through ensuring equality of opportunities in 
their access to basic resources, education, technology, health, services, food, housing, 
employment, markets, loans and the fair distribution of income; 
</p>
<p> (c) States, in accordance with international human rights standards and their 
respective domestic legal framework, should resolve problems of ownership of ancestral 
lands inhabited for generations by people of African descent and promote the productive 
utilization of land and the comprehensive development of these communities, respecting 
their culture and their specific forms of decision-making. 
</p>
<p> (d) Adopting measures to preserve, protect and restore traditional knowledge of 
people of African descent; 
</p>

ensure that development projects address the economic and social situation of people of 
African descent; 
</p>
<p> (g) Cooperating to create an enabling international environment for ensuring 
investment, aid and trade policies which can further positive development outcomes for 
people of African descent and minimize harmful impacts, through human rights impact 
assessment and monitoring and evaluating such policies.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Education 
</b></p>
<p>37. States should take all necessary measures to give effect to the right of people of 
African descent, particularly children and young people, to free primary education and 
access to all levels and forms of quality public education without discrimination. States 
should: 
</p>
<p> (a) Ensure quality education is accessible and available in areas where 
communities of African descent live, particularly rural and marginalized communities, with 
attention to improving the quality of public education; 
</p>
<p> (b) Take measures to ensure that public and private education systems do not 
discriminate against or exclude children of African descent, and that they are protected 
from direct or indirect discrimination, stigmatization and violence from peers or teachers. 
To this end, training and sensitization should be provided to teachers and measures should 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>be taken to increase the number of teachers of African descent working in educational 
institutions; 
</p>
<p> (c) Counter all forms of symbolic violence and indirect discrimination faced by  
children and young people of African descent in education systems by removing negative 
stereotypes and imagery in teaching materials;

technological development and long-distance learning in local communities;   
</p>
<p> (f) Guarantee a smooth transition from early childhood to primary and secondary 
educational facilities without discriminatory competitive placement systems (e.g. common 
entrance examinations). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Employment  
</b></p>
<p>38. States should take measures to ensure that people of African descent, including 
migrant workers, are not subject to discriminatory conditions of labour, and, inter alia, 
employment or salary. States should: 
</p>
<p> (a) Ensure that the workers&#8217; rights of people of African descent particularly 
migrants are respected and protected including those related to fair wages and equal 
remuneration for work of equal value without distinction of any kind, and to the right to 
security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other 
lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond their control, social security, including social 
insurance, access to education, health care, social services and respect for their cultural 
identity;18  
</p>
<p> (b) Support and encourage trade unions to work with African diaspora civil 
society to ensure respect for their rights as workers;

</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Housing 
</b></p>
<p>39. Recognizing the poor and insecure housing conditions in which many people of 
African descent live, States should develop and implement policies and projects aimed at 
ensuring they gain and sustain a safe and secure home and community in which to live in 
peace and dignity. States should: 
</p>
<p> (a) Implement special measures to ensure people of African descent have access 
to necessary services, potable water and sanitation, avoiding the segregation or 
ghettoization of people of African descent into low standards of housing;  
</p>

services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, affordability, habitability, accessibility, 
location and cultural adequacy and prevent the forced eviction of people of African descent 
from their homes in both urban and rural contexts. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Health  
</b></p>
<p>40. States must enhance measures to fulfil the right of people of African descent to 
enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, with a view to 
progressively achieving the full realization of this right and eliminating disparities in health 
status, which might result from racial discrimination, including; 
</p>
<p> (a) Involving people of African descent in designing and implementing health-
based programmes and projects;

culturally appropriate manner; 
</p>
<p> (d) Ensuring health education material and information is available in a wide 
variety of languages and accessible to people of African descent including those most 
vulnerable. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Multiple forms of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>41. States should adopt and implement laws, policies and programmes which provide 
effective protection for and review and repeal all policies and laws that could negatively 
affect people of African descent facing multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination 
based on related grounds, such as sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, social 
origin, property, birth or other status deriving from the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action (see paragraph 2 of the Declaration). States should pay particular attention to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Ratifying and implementing legislation that has particular relevance for the 
rights of women and girls of African descent including International Labour Organization 
(ILO) Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning decent work for domestic workers; </p>

Treatment of Migrant Workers, and ensuring effective implementation;  
</p>
<p> (k) Ensuring that information on health, employment, housing and other services 
is accessible and available in all relevant languages and in a manner consistent with the 
cultures of migrants of African descent; 
</p>
<p> (l) Working with the media while maintaining full respect for freedom of 
opinion and expression, to develop codes of conduct which include measures to prevent 
inaccurate and negative stereotypical depictions of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers 
which can cause or exacerbate xenophobic and racial hatred and violence and guaranteeing 
victims equal access to justice, including in the context of racist crimes;  
</p>
<p> (m) Refraining from taking discriminatory measures and from enacting or 
maintaining legislation that would arbitrarily deprive persons of their nationality, especially 
if such measures and legislation render a person stateless. Ensuring that all migrant 
children, regardless of the migratory status of their parents, have access to birth registration; </p>

<p> (n) Respecting and implementing humanitarian obligations relating to the 
protection of refugees, asylum seekers, returnees and internally displaced persons; 
</p>
<p> (o) Recognizing that older persons of African descent face increased risk of 
discrimination and vulnerability, and adopting measures to ensure they have access to 
pensions, social security or relevant social protection schemes and to culturally relevant and 
sensitive health care; 
</p>
<p> (p) Ensuring full promotion and protection of people of African descent with 
disabilities, particularly equal access to health, education and employment, and adopt 
measures for their inclusion in social, economic, political and cultural life, with particular 
attention to ensuring their participation in the design of programmes and policies that 
concern them. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Target groups and other actors 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Decade should be perceived as an international initiative, which will bring 
together several actors at the international, regional and national levels,  including United 
Nations bodies, the specialized agencies, all Member States, intergovernmental 
organizations and relevant NGOs, as well as people of African descent to (a) raise public 
awareness of the situation of people of African descent through active communications; (b) 
bring in international experience and expertise to help make progress on challenging issues; 
(c) develop legal mechanisms to acknowledge and effectively address racism against people 
of African descent; (d) memorialize the transatlantic slave trade; (e) launch initiatives for 
affirmative action policies and collection of disaggregated data; (f) learn and exchange 
experiences and (g) bring international attention to the need to repair the damage done to 
people of African descent by slavery and the transatlantic slave trade; 
</p>
<p>43. Activities carried out under the Decade should be designed to bring its objectives to 
as wide an audience as possible, through campaigns, events, research, development of 
legislation and policies, and through both formal and non-formal education.   
</p>
<p>44. The general public should be the subject of far-reaching information initiatives 
designed to inform them of the histories, contemporary experiences and human rights 
situation of people of African descent, as well as their role in development at both 
international and national levels.

<p><b> VII. Strategies at the international level 
</b></p>
<p>49. The international community in general and in particular relevant United Nations 
programmes, funds, specialized agencies and other bodies; international financial and 
development institutions; regional organizations and other international mechanisms within 
their areas of competence should give the highest priority to addressing the human rights 
and development challenges faced by people of African descent, by inter alia implementing 
sustainable programmes and measures and allocating appropriate funding. They should 
therefore: 
</p>
<p> (a) Address the issues related to people of African descent from the perspective 
of equality and non-discrimination and as a cross-cutting issue across their respective areas 
of work and ensure that initiatives, research and measures are adopted to realize all their 
rights and freedoms; 
</p>
<p> (b) Create mechanisms to monitor the situation of people of African descent with 
a particular focus on patterns of discrimination and its effect on the enjoyment of economic, 
social, cultural, civil and political rights.   
</p>
<p> (c) Adopt human rights-based development programmes in their fields of 
competency which address the rights of people of African descent, including access to 
education, employment, health, housing, land and labour; 
</p>
<p> (d) Use the Decade as an opportunity to engage with people of African descent 
on the issue of reparation and reconciliation for slavery, the slave trade and the transatlantic 
slave trade in captured African people; 
</p>
<p> (e) Introduce initiatives to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals and 
future development objectives post-2015 take full consideration of the situation and rights 
of people of African descent;  
</p>
<p> (f) Monitor, evaluate and measure the impact of such activities on people of 
African descent through the use of appropriate indicators and collection of reliable 
disaggregated data;  
</p>
<p> (g) Encourage United Nations specialized agencies to develop studies and 
reports, regarding the themes of the Decade such as the Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO), the World Bank Group, ILO, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNESCO, 
and the following United Nations programmes, funds and offices such as the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
</p>
<p>(UNICEF), Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and OHCHR 
and regional commissions. Such studies could be used to inform a mid-term review of the 
Decade to monitor the progress made, share learning practices between key actors and 
inform plans and policies for the remaining five years of the Decade and beyond; 
</p>
<p> (h) Encourage ILO to carry out activities and programmes to combat racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against people of African descent 
including migrants in work-related areas and to support actions of States, employers&#8217; 
organizations and trade unions in this field;  
</p>
<p> (i) Invite UNESCO to provide support to States in the preparation of teaching 
materials and tools for promoting teaching, training and educational activities relating to 
rights of people of African descent and their contribution to societies and their history;  
</p>
<p> (j) Encourage OHCHR to continue its fellowship programme for people of 
African descent during the Decade;  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p> (k) International human rights treaty monitoring bodies and thematic and 
country-specific special procedures of the Human Rights Council, where relevant, should 
systematically monitor the human rights situations of people of African descent and request 
disaggregated information on this group during reporting, periodic sessions and country 
visits; 
</p>
<p> (l) Encourage OHCHR to continue its work on the development of a database 
containing good practices which has positive impact on addressing racial discrimination 
faced by people of African descent and invite States to share experiences, learning and 
practices to improve and systematise policies and programmes; 
</p>
<p> (m) Encourage the media to represent the diversity of a multicultural society and 
play a role in fighting racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
faced by people of African descent.  
</p>
<p> (n) Invite the General Assembly to consider: 
</p>
<p>(i) Requesting the Working Group on People of African Descent in 
collaboration with the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination to elaborate a draft United Nations declaration 
on the promotion and full respect of the human rights of people of African descent 
by 2015 for the approval by the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Establishing as a result of the Decade a United Nations permanent forum for 
people of African descent to serve as consultation mechanism for representative 
organizations of people of African descent and other interested stakeholder; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Inviting UNESCO to create an archive of African memory to provide a user-
friendly platform of knowledge about people of African descent history and 
contribution to the development of nations.   
</p>
<p><b> VIII.  Coordination of the Decade 
</b></p>
<p>50. In recognition of the fact that action at the national and local levels is crucial to the 
effective promotion and protection of rights of people of African descent, as is an effective 
international coordination structure, this Programme of Action lays out coordination plans 
at the following levels. 
</p>
<p><b> A. National level  
</b></p>
<p>51. National focal points for implementation of the Programme of Action should be 
designated in States with populations of people of African <b>d</b>escent. Such focal points may 
consist of specially constituted committees, including representatives of relevant 
Government agencies and NGOs (including people of African descent organizations) or, 
alternatively, existing appropriate structures or national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>54. States shall be encouraged to establish national human rights resource and research 
centres capable of engaging in research, training of trainers, preparation, collection, 
translation and dissemination of material related to the history and current situation of 
people of African descent, and organization of conferences, workshops and courses. 
</p>
<p>55. Civil society should (a) be encouraged to form national, regional and international 
networks to share learning, experiences and good practices, raise awareness of the situation 
of people of African descent and carry out joint advocacy and development initiatives; and 
(b) develop capacity-building programmes intended for people of African descent with a 
particular focus on developing leadership skills.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International and regional levels 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Working Group recommends that the Human Rights Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Invite the General Assembly to convene a mid-term World Summit on people 
of African descent involving the Member States, the United Nations specialized agencies, 
programmes and funds and civil society in order to assess the progress achieved part way 
through the Decade for People of African Descent and to adjust plans and strategies for the 
remaining years as appropriate; 
</p>
<p> (b) Request the Secretary-General to appoint the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights as the Coordinator of the Decade in order to follow up on the implementation of the 
provisions of the Programme of Action for the Decade. A progress report on the 
implementation of these provisions will be presented by the Secretary-General to the 
General Assembly biannually, taking into account information and views provided by 
States, relevant human rights treaty monitoring bodies, special procedures of the Human 
Rights Council and other mechanisms of the United Nations, international, regional and 
NGOs, including organizations of people of African descent and national human rights 
institutions; 
</p>
<p> (c) Invite the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action to adopt as a standing 
agenda item the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Decade for people of 
African descent and to act as a reporting mechanism for the Decade; 
</p>
<p> (d) Request that an inter-agency meeting with active participation of the 
Working Group be organized immediately after the proclamation of the Decade, with a 
view to planning working meetings and other activities; 
</p>
<p> (e) Request the High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish a project for 
the Decade of People of African descent to assist the funding of projects and programmes 
which promote the goals of the Decade and ensure the participation of people of African 
descent to the Working Group and the Permanent Forum. </p>
