<p><b>  22</b>/&#8230;<b> The work and employment of persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to be 
guaranteed the full enjoyment of their rights and freedoms without discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> all previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council on the rights 
of persons with disabilities, the most recent of which was resolution 19/11 of 22 March 
2012, and welcoming the efforts of all stakeholders to implement those resolutions, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>further</i> the right to work, as set out in article 23 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, which states that everyone has the right to work, to free 
choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against 
unemployment, as well as, inter alia, States parties&#8217; obligations under articles 6 and 7 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, article 11 of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and, most 
recently and with regard to persons with disabilities, in article 27 of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that the above-mentioned article 27 of the Convention reaffirms the right 
of persons with disabilities to work, including their right to the opportunity to gain a living 
by work freely chosen or accepted in a labour market and work environment that is open, 
inclusive and accessible, and that States parties to the Convention are required to take 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>appropriate steps, including through legislation, to ensure that persons with disabilities 
enjoy this right on an equal basis with others, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> relevant conventions, declarations, recommendations and codes of 
practice of the International Labour Organization, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that progress has been made, yet deeply concerned that many persons 
with disabilities in all regions continue to face significant obstacles in exercising their right 
to work on an equal basis with others, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the right to work is a key factor in ensuring the full and effective 
participation and inclusion, as well as equality of opportunity, of persons with disabilities in 
society, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the need to build awareness among persons with disabilities, their 
families, communities and all those working in education systems of the right of persons 
with disabilities to work and to enjoy equal employment opportunities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple, 
aggravated or intersecting forms of discrimination, including in the context of realizing 
their right to work on an equal basis with others,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>further</i> the important role of the public and private sectors in employing 
persons with disabilities and the need to raise awareness of all employers of the valuable 
contribution that persons with disabilities can make in a diverse workplace, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the decision of the General Assembly to hold a high-level meeting, on 
23 September 2013, with the overarching theme &#8220;The way forward: a disability inclusive 
</p>
<p>development agenda towards 2015 and beyond&#8221;, in order to strengthen efforts to ensure 
</p>
<p>accessibility for and inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of development, and 
looking forward to the contribution that the outcome document thereon could make in 
mainstreaming the rights of persons with disabilities in the post-2015 development agenda, 
</p>
<p>1.<i> Welcomes</i> the fact that, to date, 155 States have signed and 128 States and 
one regional integration organization have ratified or acceded to the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and that 91 States have signed and 76 States have 
ratified or acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention, and calls upon those States 
and regional integration organizations that have not yet ratified or acceded to the 
Convention and the Optional Protocol to consider doing so as a matter of priority;  
</p>
<p>2.<i> Encourages</i> States that have ratified the Convention and have submitted one 
or more reservations to it to initiate a process to review regularly the effect and continued 
relevance of such reservations, and to consider the possibility of withdrawing them;  
</p>

</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties to ensure that persons with disabilities can 
effectively and fully enjoy the right to work on an equal basis with others, including the 
right to the opportunity to gain a living by work freely chosen or accepted in a labour 
market and work environment that is open, inclusive and accessible to persons with 
disabilities; 
</p>

<p>5. <i>Also calls upon</i> States parties to adopt and implement appropriate measures, 
including legislative measures, to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy the right to 
work on an equal basis with others, including by, inter alia:

work and at all phases of employment, including the denial of reasonable accommodation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Promoting equal access for persons with disabilities to the open labour

</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Adopting positive measures, as appropriate, to increase employment of 
persons with disabilities in the public and private sectors, in particular for women and youth

diversity in the workplace and of equal career development for all;  
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Employing persons with disabilities in the public sector and considering 
setting targets for such employment; 
</p>

</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>) Establishing and maintaining access to social protection programmes, 
including those created pursuant to recommendation No. 202 of the International Labour 
Organization concerning national floors for social protection, that support persons with 
disabilities in seeking, transitioning to and maintaining work, and that recognize the 
additional costs that persons with disabilities face in their access to the open labour market; 
</p>
<p> (<i>k</i>) Promoting public awareness campaigns to address negative attitudes, stigma 
and stereotypes of persons with disabilities, including women with disabilities, that hinder 
their opportunity to participate in work and employment on an equal basis with others; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Reaffirms</i> the obligation of States parties to ensure that persons with 
disabilities are not held in slavery or in servitude, and are protected, on an equal basis with 
others, from forced or compulsory labour;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties, and urges private sector employers and workers&#8217; 
organizations, to ensure that measures to assist persons with disabilities in their access to 
and maintaining employment are consistent with the Convention, including the general 
principles of inclusion in society, individual autonomy, including the freedom to make 
one&#8217;s own choices, and independence of persons;  </p>


<p>8. <i>Further calls upon</i> States, in realizing the right to work for persons with 
disabilities, to engage the private sector and, in this regard, urges the private sector to 
employ persons with disabilities, to create a welcoming working environment and to 
identify and eliminate barriers that hinder their access to the workplace on an equal basis 
with others; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Urges </i>States to consult closely with and actively involve persons with

and monitoring policies and programmes relating to the employment of persons with 
disabilities;  
</p>
<p>10. <i>Encourages </i>States and invites other relevant stakeholders, including national

work for persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Encourages</i> all relevant actors in the design of products, environments, 
programmes and services relating to work and employment to pay due attention to universal

avoid the need for any subsequent adaptation or specialized design;  
</p>
<p>13. <i>Acknowledges</i> the importance of international cooperation at all levels and, in 
this regard, encourages all relevant actors in taking measures of international cooperation to 
consider appropriate and effective measures in support of national efforts to promote 
employment opportunities for persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others;
