<p><b>Summary  
</b></p>
<p> The present report summarizes contributions and views expressed by Governments, 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations on the content and scope of a possible 
future mandate of an independent expert in the field of cultural rights. These contributions and 
views are summarized in the main body of the present report.  
</p>
<p> The wide variety of different approaches contained in the responses received only allowed 
to draw some very general conclusions at the end of the report. Fifteen out of the seventeen 
responses received supported the establishment of an independent expert in the field of cultural 
rights and cultural diversity. Two contributions considered that there was no need for a new 
special procedures mandate in this area. Submissions that favoured the establishment of an 
independent expert mechanism generally shared the opinion that it would enhance the 
understanding and protection of cultural rights, as well as help bridge a protection gap suffered 
by cultural rights. Those opposing the creation of a new mandate argued that existing norms and 
mechanisms within the United Nations system adequately addressed cultural rights or that 
cultural rights should be further mainstreamed and strengthened within existing human rights 
mechanisms. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 6/6 of 28 September 2007 entitled &#8220;Promotion 
of the enjoyment of the cultural rights of everyone and respect for cultural diversity&#8221;, requested 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights &#8220;to consult States, intergovernmental 
and non-governmental organizations on the content and scope of the mandate of the independent 
expert in the field of cultural rights, the basis of which would be the comprehensive 
implementation of the present resolution, and to report on the results of those consultations to the 
Council in accordance with its annual programme of work&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2. On 2 June 2008, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
sent a request to Member States and intergovernmental organizations for their views and 
contributions. A letter inviting contributions from non-governmental organizations was also sent 
out.  
</p>
<p>3. Replies were received from the Governments of Algeria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Burkina Faso, Cuba, Egypt, Guatemala, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kuwait, Mexico, Portugal, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey. Contributions were also received 
from UNESCO and the Observatory for Cultural Diversity and Cultural Rights,<b>1</b> which is a 
network of institutes, non-governmental organizations and experts based at the Interdisciplinary 
Institute for Ethics and Human Rights, University of Fribourg, Switzerland.  
</p>
<p>4. The present report summarizes the submissions by Governments, UNESCO and by the 
coalition of non-governmental organizations and institutes, and makes some concluding remarks 
on the basis of the information and suggestions received. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  RESPONSES FROM GOVERNMENTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Algeria 
</b></p>
<p>5. The submission by Algeria underscored the importance of cultural rights and the lack of 
attention generally paid to them. Algeria described its efforts towards realizing cultural rights, 
and identified some challenges to the full enjoyment of cultural rights and the respect for cultural 
diversity. Algeria supported the establishment of an independent expert, underscoring that it 
would enhance the promotion of cultural rights. The reply also identified some thematic areas 
that the mandate of the independent expert could include: the issue of international cultural 
cooperation; the cultural gaps created by the unequal distribution of new information and 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The following non-governmental organizations associated themselves with this submission: 
</p>
<p>ATD Fourth World; Points-Coeur; International Council of Women; Baha&#8217;i International 
Community; Catholic Child Bureau; Organisation internationale pour le droit &#225; l&#8217;&#233;ducation et la 
libert&#233; d&#8217;enseignement (OIDEL). Experts from the &#8220;Groupe de Fribourg&#8221; also contributed. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>communication technologies between North and South; and the issue of the repatriation of 
objects of cultural patrimony. Algeria held that the mandate of the independent expert should 
avoid any overlap with existing activities of UNESCO and other United Nations bodies.  
</p>

 [12 September 2008]  
</p>
<p><b>Bosnia-Herzegovina 
</b></p>
<p>6. The reply received from Bosnia-Herzegovina contained a detailed overview of measures 
taken to realize cultural rights and respect for cultural diversity. These measures included, for 
example, the adoption of legislation, ratification of international human rights instruments, 
establishment of advisory bodies to strengthen multiculturalism and mutual respect of cultures 
and religions, and promotion of cultural activities. 
</p>

 [29 July 2008]  
</p>
<p><b>Burkina Faso 
</b></p>
<p>7. In its response, Burkina Faso recalled the international foundations of cultural rights, and 
underscored the need to equip an independent expert in this field with the necessary competences 
to fulfil his or her mandate. The submission identified several tasks to be carried out by an 
independent expert, proposed conditions to be fulfilled by the mandate holder and suggested a 
time period for the mandate. 
</p>
<p>8. Burkina Faso proposed the following elements to be included in a mandate of an 
independent expert: manage and coordinate cultural actions in countries and to oversee respect 
for international instruments in this field; prepare reports on the manifestation of culture by 
different ethnic groups in countries; prepare projects for the development of culture; prepare and 
propose draft legislation on the manifestation of culture, in accordance with the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; recommend norms and practices; liaise with 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and with the Human Rights Council 
Advisory Committee; organize and participate in meetings, seminars, workshops in the field of 
cultural rights; collaborate with Governments and non-governmental organizations in the field of 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The submission from Burkina Faso suggested that the period of the mandate of an 
independent expert on cultural rights should be for three years, with the possibility of renewal. 
</p>
<p> [Original:  French] 
 [1 October 2008]  
</p>
<p><b>Cuba 
</b></p>
<p>10. The submission from Cuba underscored the importance of the establishment of an 
independent expert in the field of cultural rights and respect for cultural diversity. Cuba pointed 
out that the mandate would contribute to the objectives set out in the 1993 Vienna World </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Conference on Human Rights, namely to give equal treatment to every category of human rights, 
whilst bearing in mind their interdependence, indivisibility and universality. According to the 
submission, the establishment of an independent expert would help to overcome the existing 
protection gap regarding cultural rights. Cuba noted that the establishment of a new mandate in 
this field would not be in contradiction with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 on the 
rationalization of mandates, given that the resolution required the Council to pay equal attention 
to all human rights, and to the balance of thematic mandates between civil and political, 
economic, social and cultural rights. In the same vein, the resolution required the Council to 
identify and address thematic gaps in the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>11. While the contribution recognized the work of other United Nations institutions, such as 
UNESCO in the field of cultural rights, it noted that the establishment of an independent expert 
on cultural rights would help to address the issue from a human rights perspective, dealing with 
it in the framework of a specialized human rights body of the United Nations. The independent 
expert would follow-up the issue and on compliance with resolutions adopted by the Human 
Rights Council in the field. 
</p>
<p>12. Cuba proposed that the independent expert could also undertake studies on the global state 
of the promotion and protection of cultural rights, and of the respect and preservation of cultural 
diversity, and make recommendations to counter the increasing trend of cultural homogenization 
and the preservation of peoples&#8217; cultural patrimony.

</p>
<p><b>Egypt 
</b></p>
<p>13. Egypt&#8217;s response offered a detailed account of issues and tasks that an independent expert 
should be mandated to do. Such a mandate should include the protection and promotion of 
cultural rights of all; respect for cultural diversity; guarantees of the exercise of these rights; the 
dissemination of a human rights culture in general and the consolidation of these values. The 
submission underscored the need to include in the mandate a framework for cooperation with 
UNESCO, other United Nations agencies and institutions, including the United Nations 
&#8220;Alliance of Civilizations&#8221; initiative; States, NGOs, international and regional cultural 
organizations and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in order to avoid 
overlap with their activities. 
</p>
<p>14. Egypt identified, inter alia, the following tasks to be undertaken by an independent expert 
in this field: submitting proposals and recommendations to the Human Rights Council on the 
implementation of the Council&#8217;s resolutions on the promotion of cultural rights; preparing, in 
conjunction with UNESCO, studies on the protection of cultural rights, including the protection 
of cultural property from destruction or damage, and on ways of including the cultural dimension 
in the educational system; commenting on studies, proposals or reports by the Human Rights 
Council on the protection of cultural rights and respect for cultural diversity; supporting the role 
of civil society institutions and civil organizations which develop cultural and educational 
concepts conducive to the advancement of understanding and dialogue between civilizations in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>coordination and cooperation with their counterparts in the international arena, and encouraging 
dialogue with other civilizations; promoting cooperation with UNESCO, other international and 
regional cultural institutions and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 
order to further cultural dialogue, establish joint programmes in this area and benefit from the 
capacities of these institutions in implementing joint programmes. 
</p><p>15. Furthermore, an independent expert should be mandated to safeguard the cultural rights of 
minorities, indigenous populations and peoples living under foreign occupation through: 
supporting cultural, media, language and heritage-based projects for members of minorities, 
indigenous populations and peoples living under foreign occupation; establishing educational 
institutions for all stages of education, in accordance with general national regulations, in order 
to develop knowledge of the history, philosophy, culture, arts and way of life of these groups and 
to encourage them to carry out their development projects to meet their real and legitimate needs, 
dealing with educational programmes in all Government institutions in the light of a 
comprehensive national vision, guaranteeing impartiality, multiculturalism and the respect for 
the cultural, ethnic and religious diversity of all; establishing self-administered, decentralized 
centres and institutions where these groups can perform their rituals and practise their traditions, 
heritage and culture in freedom and without intimidation or censorship; ensuring respect for the 
cultural specificity of all without discrimination; preserving the cultural heritage as a source of 
creativity, and protecting local languages, traditions and arts from erosion.  
</p>
<p>16. In addition, a mandate should focus on guaranteeing the cultural rights of persons with 
disabilities, in order to prevent exploitation, develop the creative and artistic capacities of 
persons with disabilities in all areas of traditional and contemporary literature, arts and thought; 
enhance their capacity to enjoy all forms of leisure, culture and sports and ensure that persons 
with disabilities have access to literary and other cultural materials. 
</p>
<p>17. In order to perform these tasks, an independent expert should conduct annual visits to 
States in order to examine, evaluate and provide feedback on the progress made in the exercise 
of cultural rights and respect for cultural diversity; and submit an annual report of activities to 
the Human Rights Council for consideration.

</p>
<p><b>Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>18. In its contribution, Guatemala offered an account of the legal provisions and other 
measures it had adopted to realize cultural rights and promote the respect of cultural diversity. 
</p>
<p>19. The submission pointed out a number of areas that would merit consideration by an 
independent expert on cultural rights. These included: paying special attention to the field of 
education; and reviewing legislation addressing respect for cultural expressions, access to 
cultural goods and the preservation of cultural patrimony, in order to suggest improvements. 
Guatemala also considered that, while it was important to monitor the respect for cultural rights </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of indigenous peoples, the true aspiration of every State was to realize the enjoyment of all rights 
for the whole population in order to strengthen a cultural identity respectful of diversity and of 
different cultural expressions existing in each country.  
</p>
<p>20. According to the submission, an independent expert should also take into account that the 
realization of cultural rights and the respect for cultural diversity entailed socio-economic 
aspects, and thus should not be considered in isolation. Guatemala considered the promotion of 
culture as a propeller of development. The reply also underscored that in countries where there 
existed broad cultural diversity, the independent expert should have an open-minded and 
objective vision to avoid leaning in favour of one group or another, and to ensure when assessing 
the measures adopted by Governments that they benefited the whole population and were 
directed to promoting intercultural understanding. 
</p>
<p>21. Guatemala also suggested that an important task for an independent expert would be to 
prepare a list of institutions and organizations addressing the promotion and preservation of 
culture at national levels. This would, in turn, facilitate the coordination and strengthen the 
institutional framework to realize cultural life and respect for cultural diversity.

 [30 October 2008]  
</p>
<p><b>Islamic Republic of Iran 
</b></p>
<p>22. The contribution from the Islamic Republic of Iran proposed certain substantive elements 
that should be included in the mandate of an independent expert in the field of cultural rights, 
including: considering the role and impact of respect for cultural diversity in providing an 
equitable international order based on dialogue, cooperation, increasing interaction and avoiding 
uniformity and cultural domination; examining the political motivations and efforts made to 
equate a particular culture with terrorism, violence and human rights violations; calling attention 
to the fact that the world today was composed of nations with diverse political, social, cultural 
and religious systems, based on their history, traditions, values and diverse cultures, and that 
stability and peace would be possible through the worldwide recognition of the right of nations 
to freely determine their own approach towards prosperity; examining ways for preserving 
cultural identity as a human characteristic and an element for forming the human cultural 
heritage; enlightening about the significance of cultural diversity and its relevance to tolerance 
and respect for others to decide on their own directions towards further development, which was 
amongst the fundamental values in international relations; contributing to the recognition of 
cultural diversity and cultural development as the sources for mutual enrichment of cultures 
within the cultural background of human society; raising awareness about the relationship 
between cultural diversity and prosperity and welfare, and that attaching value to cultural 
diversity could empower human society. 
</p>
<p>23. The mandate of an independent expert should also: remind Governments of their collective 
obligations to listen to and learn from each other and to respect cultural diversity; play a role in 
facilitating dialogue, prosperity and cooperation; examine the role of tolerance, respect for 
cultural, religious and linguistic identity, as well as dialogue with mutual respect among </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>civilizations, cultures and religions for the realization of peace, understanding and friendship 
among individuals, peoples and States; examine the extent to which respect for cultural diversity 
affected the expansion of international cooperation, aiming at solving existing problems of the 
world community; examine the negative impact of the lack of respect for cultural diversity and 
its non-recognition on human rights, implementation of justice and the right to development; 
address efforts made and measures taken to instrumentally use economic and political power for 
imposing cultural domination on others; examine ways for preventing cultural uniformity and 
cultural exclusion in the globalization processes through the promotion of dialogue among 
civilizations and cultural interaction for strengthening respect for cultural diversity.

 [9 October 2008]  
</p>
<p><b>Kuwait 
</b></p>
<p>24. The submission from Kuwait included a description of measures taken to respect human 
rights in general, and cultural rights and cultural diversity in particular.  
</p>
<p>25. Kuwait proposed that the mandate of an independent expert in the field of cultural rights 
should include the following tasks and duties: assess measures taken at the national and 
international levels to promote the enjoyment of cultural rights and the respect for cultural 
diversity; identify obstacles to the enjoyment of cultural rights and the challenges to respect for 
cultural diversity; submit recommendations and proposals to promote the enjoyment of cultural 
rights nationally and internationally; submit an annual report to the Human Rights Council on 
the activities undertaken; follow-up and attend international conferences in the field of cultural 
rights; assess the relationship between the promotion and protection of human rights and the 
observance of human rights, identifying best practices; assess the extent to which women enjoy 
their cultural rights and are empowered to exercise them; conduct visits to States to determine 
the extent to which individuals enjoy cultural rights, the State respects cultural diversity and a 
culture of tolerance is promoted; conduct research, studies and statistical analysis and find 
appropriate solutions for cultural diversity issues and respect for national cultures.

 [23 October 2008]  
</p>
<p><b>Mexico 
</b></p>
<p>26. The reply from Mexico suggested specific thematic areas that the mandate of an 
independent expert should cover. These areas included language, cultural and artistic production; 
author&#8217;s rights; access of minorities to culture; access of persons and communities to different 
cultural manifestations; and participation in cultural manifestations in conditions of equality and 
respect.

 [29 October 2008]  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Portugal 
</b></p>
<p>27. According to the submission by Portugal, the mandate of an independent expert should be 
limited to the existing provisions of human rights instruments related to cultural rights - namely 
article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 15 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Portugal indicated that it would oppose any 
mandate focusing on issues related to cultural diversity in connection with the promotion and 
realization of human rights. 
</p>
<p> [Original:  English] 
 [21 October 2008]  
</p>
<p><b>Spain 
</b></p>
<p>28. The contribution received from Spain pointed out that the mandate of an independent 
expert should underscore the changes that were taking place in the field of culture, with an 
approach aimed to protect access to culture by people. It also emphasized the need to focus on 
the legal and economic effects of the protection of cultural diversity, such as fostering 
inter-culturalism, dialogue between cultures and social cohesion, and access to public subsidies 
for culture and cultural industries. This aspect would demonstrate the value of culture as a factor 
for growth and employment. Spain noted the need to create synergies between the mandate of an 
independent expert and all relevant stakeholders working in the field of cultural rights, and to 
insist on the question of cultural diversity within the organs and agencies of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p> [Original:  Spanish] 
 [22 July 2008]  
</p>
<p><b>Sweden 
</b></p>
<p>29. In its response, Sweden stressed the need to ensure that an independent expert would 
coordinate and cooperate with additional relevant intergovernmental organizations such as 
UNESCO, the Council of Europe and other regional bodies, as well as the research community. 
</p>
<p> [Original:  English] 
 [26 September 2008]  
</p>
<p><b>Switzerland 
</b></p>
<p>30. The response received from Switzerland highlighted the present recognition of cultural 
rights and of cultural components of other human rights in existing international human rights 
treaties and its interpretation by treaty bodies. Switzerland pointed out that there were a number 
of international mechanisms in place to protect and implement these rights, such as treaty bodies, 
several special rapporteurs, the independent experts on minority issues and the Working Group 
on Indigenous Populations. Switzerland was not convinced that the establishment of an 
independent expert would not overlap with the existing mandates and experts. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>31. The submission by Switzerland noted that issues related to cultural rights and cooperation 
and collaboration in the cultural field and the protection of cultural heritage were dealt with by 
UNESCO. Switzerland was not convinced that the activities of an independent expert in the field 
of cultural rights would not overlap with or duplicate those of UNESCO.  
</p>
<p>32. Therefore, Switzerland was of the opinion that it was not necessary to establish an 
independent expert in the field of cultural rights, while it accepted that a more systematic 
mainstreaming of cultural rights and the cultural dimension of human rights was desirable and 
could be achieved through already existing human rights mechanisms.

<p> [Original:  French] 
 [31 July 2008]  
</p>
<p><b>Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p>33. The submission by the Syrian Arab Republic emphasized that the mandate of an 
independent expert should respect the specific nature of countries and take into consideration the 
cultural individual rights and respect of cultural diversity within the framework of the national 
cultural unity. 
</p>
<p> [Original:  English] 
 [9 September 2008]  
</p>
<p><b>Turkey 
</b></p>
<p>34. Turkey recalled that resolution 5/1 of the Human Rights Council required the Council, 
when considering the establishment of new special procedures mandates, to avoid unnecessary 
duplication, identify thematic gaps and address them by means other than the creation of special 
procedures mandates, and define new mandates as clear and specific as possible, to avoid 
ambiguity. According to Turkey, cultural rights were effectively addressed and monitored by 
various mechanisms within the United Nations system. Examples provided included different 
special procedures mandates, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other 
treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>35. Turkey believed that UNESCO&#8217;s mandate also covered cultural rights in many dimensions, 
and offered examples about instruments adopted by UNESCO relating to cultural rights, and 
about UNESCO&#8217;s mechanisms to promote and protect cultural rights. The submission by Turkey 
concluded that there was no thematic gap in the United Nations system, and that the 
establishment of a new mechanism on cultural rights would lead to an unnecessary duplication 
among different United Nations mandates. Moreover, the submission indicated that it would be 
difficult to avoid ambiguity when creating a new mandate in such a broad field. Turkey 
suggested that thematic gaps, if any, could be overcome by making good use of the relevant 
existing United Nations mechanisms that were competent in this field.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. RESPONSES FROM INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND  
NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>36. The submission by <b>UNESCO</b> explains its understanding of the notion of culture and of the 
challenges of cultural diversity. It includes several annexes listing relevant UNESCO 
bibliography and key international standard-setting instruments and recommendations in the 
field of culture, and highlighting the existence of UNESCO Procedure 104, which allows for the 
reception of complaints on alleged violations of human rights related to its competence, 
including cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>37. Regarding the mandate of the independent expert, the submission suggests a number of 
topics that could be addressed in the mandate. One is the need to clarify the dual challenges of 
cultural diversity: on the one hand, to defend the creative diversity as each culture takes shape in 
its heritage or regenerates itself in creation and cultural expressions; and on the other hand, 
ensuring a harmonious coexistence and a readiness to live together in peace for individuals and 
groups who come from a variety of cultural horizons yet share the same living space. Other 
topics that, according to UNESCO, the independent expert could look upon are the body of 
relevant<b> </b>standard-setting instruments developed by UNESCO; intercultural dialogue as a key 
dimension in facilitating mutual appreciation and understanding of cultural differences; the 
potential tensions between the universality of human rights and the diversity of cultural practices 
and beliefs, in particular regarding gender equality, rights of minority groups and indigenous 
peoples, and linguistic diversity as a fundamental component of cultural rights. Finally, the 
submission suggests that a mechanism could be established for the independent expert to forward 
communications alleging violations of cultural rights to UNESCO, as a way to coordinate the 
expert&#8217;s work with UNESCO Procedure 104. 
</p>
<p> [Original:  English] 
 [22 December 2008]  
</p>
<p>38. The <b>Observatory of Cultural Diversity and Cultural Rights</b>, based at the 
Interdisciplinary Institute for Ethics and Human Rights, at the University of Fribourg, 
Switzerland, is a network including researchers, institutions and non-governmental 
organizations. Their submission addressed four main points: the need to clarify the definition and 
content of cultural rights, the opportunity for this clarification, and the content and scope of the 
mandate of an independent expert on cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>39. The submission maintained that the need for clarification of the definition, nature and 
consequences of violations of cultural rights, would prevent the mandate from being employed in 
favour of cultural relativism, or as a pretext for turning communities or peoples against each 
other. The contribution underscored that an independent expert should make clear that cultural 
rights were to be understood in a universal manner, and not linked solely with minorities or 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. The submission also pointed to the need to clarify the links of 
cultural diversity and human rights, and the cultural content of other human rights. 
</p>
<p>40. The contribution noted that cultural rights had not been granted the attention they deserved 
in the international sphere. While it was recognized that different treaty bodies had some 
competence on the matter, their actual practice had relegated cultural rights to a minor issue, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>dealing with them randomly and selectively. The submission underscored the clarity of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 6/6, which placed cultural rights as the central subject, while 
cultural diversity was an element in their exercise. Therefore, according to this contribution, it 
was clear that cultural identities should be respected as long as they did not deny human rights.  
</p>
<p>41. Regarding the content of the mandate of an independent expert, it was felt that the 
establishment of such a mechanism could offer a more precise and more coherent definition of 
the content of cultural rights and of their protection. An independent expert should adopt a 
transversal and global approach to cultural rights, employing as a source all pertinent human 
rights instruments. This would be the first specific mechanism on cultural rights, allowing for 
better dissemination and awareness-raising about their content, their status, the obstacles for their 
application and the measures that should be adopted to ensure their implementation. Failures and 
violations of cultural rights could also be more easily identified. 
</p>
<p>42. The joint contribution from non-governmental organizations proposed that the mandate of 
an independent expert should include following objectives: contribute to the clarification of 
cultural rights on the basis of existing legal instruments; report on the state of the respect for, 
protection and fulfilment of cultural rights worldwide, and on the obstacles to their 
implementation, taking into account the information and observations received from concerned 
States, United Nations organizations, other international organizations, national human rights 
institutions and non-governmental organizations; prepare, on the basis of information and 
observations received, concrete recommendations regarding the promotion of the effective 
enjoyment of cultural rights for all. 
</p><p>43. The submission also underscored that the establishment of an independent expert 
mechanism would not duplicate the work of treaty bodies. Rather, it could offer inputs to treaty 
bodies in a field which, up until the present, had scarcely been explored. Experience had shown 
that it was not sufficient to rely on treaty bodies, which were already overburdened, to develop 
the content of cultural rights. It was believed that an independent expert would not duplicate the 
competences of the UNESCO mechanisms in the field of cultural rights. An independent expert 
should develop a constructive and continuous dialogue and examine potential areas for 
collaboration with specialized United Nations organs and institutions, and international 
organizations competent in the field of cultural rights, such as UNESCO, as well as with other 
organizations whose activities could have important indirect effects on the respect of cultural 
rights. An independent expert mechanism should also collaborate with other special procedures, 
by underscoring the importance of including the cultural dimension of every human right in their 
reports and recommendations, and cooperate closely with those special procedures whose 
mandates specifically comprise cultural right issues, including the possibility of undertaking 
joint studies and making joint recommendations.

<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>44.<b> The wide variety of different approaches contained in the responses received only 
allowed to draw some very general conclusions. Fifteen out of the seventeen responses 
received supported the establishment of an independent expert in the field of cultural 
rights and cultural diversity. Two contributions considered that there was no need for a 
new special procedures mandate in this area. Submissions that favoured the establishment 
of an independent expert mechanism generally shared the opinion that it would enhance 
the understanding and protection of cultural rights, as well as help bridge a protection gap 
suffered by cultural rights. Those opposing the creation of a new mandate argued that 
existing norms and mechanisms within the United Nations system adequately addressed 
cultural rights or that cultural rights should be further mainstreamed and strengthened 
within existing human rights mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>45.<b> Several submissions shared the view that the mandate of an independent expert 
should include the capacity to assist in the implementation of cultural rights, by reviewing 
or assessing legislation, projects, policies and other measures taken to realize these rights. 
Some submissions suggested that an independent expert mechanism should be enabled to 
conduct studies about existing measures adopted to promote and protect cultural rights, 
respect for cultural diversity and the preservation of cultural heritage. 
</b></p>
<p>46.<b> Some contributions noted that the mandate of an independent expert mechanism 
should also focus on the enjoyment of cultural rights by indigenous groups and ethnic, 
religious and national minorities, as well as by women and persons with disabilities.</b>  
</p>
<p>47.<b> The international dimensions of cultural rights were also raised by several 
contributors as meriting attention, including international respect for cultural diversity, 
cooperation in the area of access to new information and communication technologies and 
the repatriation of cultural heritage. Others, however, emphasized that a new mandate on 
cultural rights should not be an excuse to weaken human rights obligations in the name of 
cultural diversity. Some responses noted the relations between culture, development, 
growth and employment to be addressed by an independent expert. 
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> Several submissions emphasized that an independent expert should coordinate closely 
and cooperate with UNESCO, other relevant international organizations and bodies, treaty 
bodies, special procedures mandates, non-governmental organizations, civil society groups 
and institutions working in the field of cultural rights and cultural diversity. Others, 
however, felt that an independent expert would duplicate existing activities and mandates 
in the field of cultural rights. 
</b></p>
<p>49.<b> Other more specific issues were also raised in various submissions. In some cases, 
some of the issues were only raised in some of the submissions, and in other cases opposing 
viewpoints were expressed on the same issue. For example, whilst some submissions 
underscored that an independent expert should explore different dimensions of cultural 
diversity, one of the replies clearly opposed the inclusion of cultural diversity in such a 
mandate.</b>
