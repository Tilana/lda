</p>
<p>It contains information on relevant developments relating to human rights bodies and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and outlines the activities undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights at Headquarters and in the field that contribute to the 
</p>
<p>promotion and full application of the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and follow-up on the effectiveness of the Declaration. The 
</p>
<p>report covers the period from May 2014 to May 2015. 
</p>

<p> 
 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 27/13 on human rights and indigenous peoples, the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to 
</p>
<p>submit to it an annual report on the rights of indigenous peoples containing information on 
</p>
<p>relevant developments in human rights bodies and mechanisms. It also requested the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner to report on activities undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) at Headquarters and in the field that contribute 
</p>
<p>to the promotion of, respect for and full application of the provisions of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>2. Rather than providing an exhaustive overview of the work of OHCHR on the rights 
</p>
<p>of indigenous peoples, the present report focuses on some illustrative examples of OHCHR 
</p>
<p>activities and initiatives undertaken at Headquarters and by field offices that contribute to 
</p>
<p>the full application of the rights of indigenous peoples. It also outlines recent developments 
</p>
<p>within United Nations human rights mechanisms as far as their work pertains to indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>3. During the period under review, OHCHR continued to work in a wide range of 
</p>
<p>contexts for the promotion and full application of the Declaration. The rights of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples have continued to be a priority topic for the High Commissioner, and indigenous 
</p>
<p>issues figure prominently in the OHCHR Management Plan, 2014&#8211;2017,1 including in 
</p>
<p>connection with the key thematic priorities of enhancing equality and combating 
</p>
<p>discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>A. World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and its outcome document 
</b></p>
<p>4. In the lead-up to the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held on 22 and 
</p>
<p>23 September  2014, the High Commissioner consistently stressed the importance of the 
</p>
<p>full and effective participation of indigenous peoples. The World Conference was among 
</p>
<p>the first meetings attended by the High Commissioner upon assuming office. In his opening 
</p>
<p>remarks at the Conference, he emphasized the need for the United Nations to open its doors 
</p>
<p>even wider for indigenous peoples and strengthen efforts to involve indigenous peoples in 
</p>
<p>all international initiatives that affect them, including the post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>He also called for national action plans and strategies to be developed, and underlined that 
</p>
<p>such plans should be fully consistent with the principles and objectives of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, in its capacity as chair of the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Issues, also drew attention to a series of papers on themes ranging from land rights 
</p>
<p>to traditional knowledge prepared by the Support Group as contributions to the World 
</p>
<p>Conference. 
</p>
<p>5. The regional and country offices of OHCHR participated actively in the preparations 
</p>
<p>for the World Conference by drafting information notes and facilitating discussions among 
</p>
<p>indigenous representatives about their contributions to the Conference. In July 2014, the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>/pdf/0_THE_WHOLE_REPORT.pdf </p>


<p>OHCHR office in Guatemala facilitated bilateral meetings with indigenous representatives 
</p>
<p>and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promote indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in the 
</p>
<p>preparatory activities for the World Conference. The OHCHR regional office for South 
</p>
<p>America, in Chile, organized and participated in a national meeting of indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>towards the World Conference, within the framework of an inter-agency project with 
</p>
<p>indigenous leaders. The meeting aimed at promoting the participation of indigenous leaders 
</p>
<p>in the World Conference and in the drafting of the outcome document.2 
</p>
<p>6. In the lead-up to the World Conference, indigenous representatives focused on the 
</p>
<p>need to introduce more inclusive United Nations processes and to accord indigenous 
</p>
<p>representative structures a status that would facilitate their effective participation. As such, 
</p>
<p>the outcome document includes a request for the Secretary-General to submit specific 
</p>
<p>recommendations on how to enable participation of indigenous peoples at the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, through the Economic and Social Council, to the General Assembly at its 
</p>
<p>seventieth session. 
</p>
<p>7. Following the World Conference, the OHCHR office in the Plurinational State of 
</p>
<p>Bolivia coordinated and initiated dialogues with various United Nations agencies to provide 
</p>
<p>technical assistance in the design of actions, adaptation and implementation of 
</p>
<p>commitments contained in the outcome document. 
</p>
<p>8. OHCHR continued to play an active role in various inter-agency initiatives, as it 
</p>
<p>chaired the Support Group during the reporting period. The Support Group had engaged 
</p>
<p>actively in the World Conference then supported follow-up to its outcome document, in 
</p>
<p>which the Support Group&#8217;s important role in ensuring coordinated and coherent United 
</p>
<p>Nations action in relation to indigenous peoples was recognized. 
</p>
<p>9. Supporting such follow-up was the main focus of the annual meeting of the Support 
</p>
<p>Group, hosted by OHCHR in Geneva on 1 and 2 December 2014. The meeting brought 
</p>
<p>together focal points for indigenous peoples&#8217; issues from 17 agencies and benefitted from 
</p>
<p>the active participation of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, the 
</p>
<p>Chair of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the focal point of the Permanent 
</p>
<p>Forum for the Support Group. 
</p>
<p>10. At the meeting, the Support Group began preparation of a system-wide action plan, 
</p>
<p>to be developed in consultation and cooperation with indigenous peoples and Member 
</p>
<p>States. The Support Group discussed lessons that could be drawn from other United 
</p>
<p>Nations system-wide action plans, including those on youth and gender, and highlighted 
</p>
<p>key considerations, such as the need to root the action plan in the Declaration, the 
</p>
<p>importance of engaging United Nations regional and country presences and the relevance of 
</p>
<p>the post-2015 development agenda. A small informal working group was set up to further 
</p>
<p>advance work on the action plan in cooperation with indigenous and Member State 
</p>
<p>partners. 
</p>
<p>11. The Support Group also took stock of various initiatives concerning the 
</p>
<p>development and use of indicators related to indigenous peoples and is now working to 
</p>
<p>build support for operationalizing agreed indicators, including with a view to their 
</p>
<p>application in connection with the post-2015 development agenda. In addition, the Support 
</p>
<p>Group examined how to encourage national human rights institutions to advance 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; rights at the national and international levels, in line with the outcome 
</p>
<p>document of the World Conference. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 General Assembly resolution 69/2.  </p>


<p>12. OHCHR also played an active role in raising the profile of indigenous peoples in the 
</p>
<p>context of the Human Rights Council, including through its support of the Expert 
</p>
<p>Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, for example, by reviewing the mandate by 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council. During the twenty-ninth session of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>in September 2014, OHCHR organized a panel discussion on indigenous peoples&#8217; issues 
</p>
<p>devoted to prevention and protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; in disaster risk reduction and 
</p>
<p>prevention and preparedness initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b> B. United Nations Indigenous Peoples</b>&#8217;<b> Partnership initiative 
</b></p>
<p>13. The United Nations Indigenous Peoples Partnership initiative, a joint initiative 
</p>
<p>between OHCHR, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Development Programme (UNDP) completed activities under its four-year strategic 
</p>
<p>framework for 2011&#8211;2014. Implementation of the Partnership started in 2012 with six 
</p>
<p>United Nations joint programmes in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Cameroon, the 
</p>
<p>Central African Republic, Nicaragua and the Congo, as well as through a regional 
</p>
<p>programme in South-East Asia. The programmes were built upon the Declaration, ILO 
</p>
<p>Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169) and other key standards, and 
</p>
<p>reflected the findings of the Special Rapporteur, treaty bodies and other human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>14. During the course of the Partnership&#8217;s activities, through its six joint country 
</p>
<p>programmes and one regional project, over 100 partners were brought together and more 
</p>
<p>than 5,500 government officials, indigenous peoples and other key stakeholders were 
</p>
<p>reached through capacity-building and training initiatives in Asia, Africa and Latin 
</p>
<p>America. Approximately 40 thematic studies and publications were produced, including on 
</p>
<p>issues related to maternal health, reproductive rights, HIV/AIDS and conditions in the 
</p>
<p>forestry sector. The Partnership&#8217;s initiatives to support legal and policy reform and access 
</p>
<p>to justice have contributed to the development of national decrees and reviews of national 
</p>
<p>and municipal laws to ensure the recognition and inclusion of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in 
</p>
<p>local and national legal systems. 
</p>
<p>15. The Board of the Partnership is currently discussing how to align its next phase with 
</p>
<p>the system-wide action plan mandated by the outcome document of the World Conference 
</p>
<p>on Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>16. In September 2014, the OHCHR regional office for South America in Santiago 
</p>
<p>prepared a joint proposal with United Nations agencies in Chile for submission to the 
</p>
<p>Partnership on the topic of the right to consultation of indigenous youth and children. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Capacity-building and participation of indigenous peoples  
</b></p>
<p><b>in United Nations processes 
</b></p>
<p>17. In 2014, the OHCHR Indigenous Peoples and Minorities Section carried out a 
</p>
<p>number of training and briefing sessions for key stakeholders that included United Nations 
</p>
<p>country teams, OHCHR staff, members of human rights treaty bodies, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>organizations, government officials, parliamentarians and staff of national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, in an effort to promote the full application of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>18. During the reporting period, OHCHR continued to build the capacity and expertise 
</p>
<p>of representatives of indigenous peoples through its annual training programme on 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments and mechanisms. A total of 31 indigenous people, 
</p>
<p>including 18 women, originating from Algeria, Australia, Bangladesh, the Plurinational </p>


<p>State of Bolivia, Brazil, Burundi, Cambodia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Libya, 
</p>
<p>Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Russian 
</p>
<p>Federation, Rwanda and the United Republic of Tanzania participated in the 2014 
</p>
<p>indigenous fellowship that took place in Geneva from 16 June to 25 July. These fellows 
</p>
<p>attended theoretical and practical training sessions on how to use international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments and mechanisms to more effectively advocate for and promote the rights of 
</p>
<p>their respective communities at the international level. In addition, four indigenous fellows 
</p>
<p>who had participated in the training in Geneva were given the opportunity to enhance their 
</p>
<p>knowledge and experience by taking part in national or regional fellowships with OHCHR 
</p>
<p>country offices in the Russian Federation, Guatemala, Mexico and Cameroon. Their active 
</p>
<p>involvement in and input to the activities of OHCHR were much appreciated, as was their 
</p>
<p>first-hand knowledge of indigenous issues, which was an asset for the work of OHCHR on 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; issues. In order to give indigenous people the opportunity to learn 
</p>
<p>through direct and practical engagement in the activities of OHCHR, the Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples and Minorities Section continues to organize a Senior Indigenous Fellowship over 
</p>
<p>a period of four months to provide on-the-job training. 
</p>
<p>19. In addition to Headquarters, OHCHR regional and country offices have also run 
</p>
<p>capacity-building programmes for indigenous peoples. For example, the human rights 
</p>
<p>adviser in Bangladesh served as a resource for the regional training programme of the Asia-
</p>
<p>Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh, together with the Bangladesh Human Rights Commission. 
</p>
<p>20. The OHCHR country office in the Plurinational State of Bolivia conducted training 
</p>
<p>activities for numerous indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations that focused on collective rights 
</p>
<p>and the use of national and international protection mechanisms, and sought to develop 
</p>
<p>their understanding of the right to consultation. In coordination with the indigenous 
</p>
<p>university of &#8220;Apiaguaiki Tupa&#8221;, the office developed the first version of a course entitled 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rights of indigenous peoples in the universal human rights system and introduction to 
</p>
<p>cultural expertise&#8221;. A second version of the course is currently being taught to a new group 
</p>
<p>of leaders representing indigenous peoples form the East, Chaco and Amazon regions. 
</p>
<p>21. The office in the Plurinational State of Bolivia also organized a joint workshop in 
</p>
<p>coordination with ILO and the departmental assembly of the Guarani people to inform 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples about international and regional human rights mechanisms and to train 
</p>
<p>them to write communications to these mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>22. The OHCHR country office in Colombia held a workshop on the basic concepts of 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights with an emphasis on the rights of indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>and Afro-Colombian communities. In June 2014, the OHCHR regional office for Central 
</p>
<p>America in Panama organized training for indigenous youth organizations on the use of 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms, with a view to developing their capacity to submit reports to the 
</p>
<p>special procedures of the Human Rights Council and the second cycle of the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review. 
</p>
<p>23. Through the Maya Programme, the office in Guatemala developed several training 
</p>
<p>courses specifically on the administration of justice, lands and territory and the right to 
</p>
<p>consultation. The target audience for the courses included the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, 
</p>
<p>the Institute of Public Defence, the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court. The Office 
</p>
<p>also supported the Attorney General&#8217;s Office in developing a diagnosis tool on access to 
</p>
<p>justice for indigenous peoples. As a result, the Indigenous Peoples Unit in the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General&#8217;s Office developed an action plan that provided for internal policy reforms and 
</p>
<p>specialized training for interpreters, and designed an institutional policy focusing on 
</p>
<p>victims. </p>


<p>24. The office in Mexico also provided training courses on rights of indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>to federal authorities and advised representatives of indigenous communities in relation to 
</p>
<p>specific cases. 
</p>
<p>25. The regional office in the Pacific distributed copies of the Declaration to the Pacific 
</p>
<p>Islands Association of Non-governmental Organizations to raise awareness on the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples in the region. The Association is a regional network of non-
</p>
<p>governmental organization focal points based in 22 Pacific island countries and territories. 
</p>
<p>26. The United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations, managed by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR and assisted by a board of trustees, continued to support the participation of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations in the sessions of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Issues, the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, including its universal periodic review mechanism, and the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>27. In addition to encouraging the participation of indigenous people&#8217;s representatives in 
</p>
<p>the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and the integration of human rights standards 
</p>
<p>in its outcome document, OHCHR, through the Voluntary Fund, supported indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; participation in the Conference and its related preparatory process. The Fund 
</p>
<p>supported the participation of 21 indigenous representatives in the preparatory meetings and 
</p>
<p>the participation of 84 indigenous representatives in the Conference. 
</p>
<p>28. In 2014, 66 grants were allocated to enable the participation of representatives of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations and communities, including 25 for the thirteenth session 
</p>
<p>of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues; 20 for the seventh session of the Expert 
</p>
<p>Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; 4 for sessions of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council; 2 for sessions of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review; 5 for 
</p>
<p>sessions of the Human Rights Committee; 1 for the sessions of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women; 5 for the sessions of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination; 1 for the sessions of the Committee on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child; 1 for the sessions of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
</p>
<p>and 2 for the sessions of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>29. The Board of Trustees has selected 86 representatives of indigenous communities 
</p>
<p>and organizations to attend various sessions, including 32 for the 2015 sessions of the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues; 32 for the sessions of the Expert Mechanism on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; 6 for the sessions of the Human Rights Council; 4 for the 
</p>
<p>sessions of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review; 2 for the sessions of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee; 1 for the sessions of the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women; 2 for the sessions of the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination; 2 for the sessions of the Committee on the Rights of the Child; 3 for 
</p>
<p>the sessions of the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights; 1 for the sessions 
</p>
<p>of the Committee against Torture; and 1 for the sessions of the Committee on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities. Furthermore, the Board has set aside funds to enable 
</p>
<p>representatives of indigenous communities and organizations to attend the sessions of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, human rights treaty bodies and the universal periodic review to be 
</p>
<p>held between September 2015 and March 2016. The selection will be made at the 
</p>
<p>intersessional meetings to be held in August and November 2015. 
</p>
<p>30. The Fund also continues to employ resources to increase the capacity of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples to effectively participate in United Nations meetings. For example, in 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Fund organized four human rights training sessions in Geneva and New York. Moreover, in 
</p>
<p>cooperation with non-governmental organization partners, the Fund provided assistance to 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives in targeting their advocacy, tailoring interventions to 
</p>
<p>specific sessions and contributing to the implementation of recommendations by human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms and the implementation of the Declaration at the national level. </p>


<p><b> D. Guidance tools 
</b></p>
<p>31. OHCHR continued to support parliamentarians in fulfilling their role in protecting 
</p>
<p>the rights of indigenous peoples. A handbook for parliamentarians,3 jointly authored with 
</p>
<p>UNDP, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the Inter-Parliamentary Union 
</p>
<p>and the secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, was officially released in 
</p>
<p>the margins of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples in September 2014. 
</p>
<p>32. Through wide-ranging consultations, OHCHR and the Asia Pacific Forum of 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Institutions completed a manual4 in 2013. The publication was 
</p>
<p>translated into Russian, French and Spanish, and subsequently launched in June 2014 by the 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples and Minorities Section, and the OHCHR regional office for South 
</p>
<p>Africa. National human rights institutions from Angola, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, the 
</p>
<p>United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe participated in the training, which 
</p>
<p>increased their understanding about operationalizing the Declaration at the country level. A 
</p>
<p>meeting was organized in Krasnoyarsk, Russian Federation, in October 2014 to discuss the 
</p>
<p>role of national human rights institutions in the follow-up process to the outcome document 
</p>
<p>of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>33. The OHCHR country office in the Plurinational State of Bolivia published a 
</p>
<p>compendium of international norms relating to the protection of the rights of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples, an informative brochure on the right to free, prior and informed consultation and 
</p>
<p>three studies on decision-making systems of indigenous peoples and nations (on the 
</p>
<p>Captaincy of the High Parapet&#237;, the Organization of the Moset&#233;n Indigenous Peoples, and 
</p>
<p>the Jacha&#8217;a Karangas Nation). 
</p>
<p>34. The OHCHR country office in Colombia published an updated versions of its 
</p>
<p>publications on the right to consultation and prior, free and informed consent.  
</p>
<p><b> E. OHCHR support for the rights of indigenous peoples at the country 
</b></p>
<p><b>and regional levels 
</b></p>
<p>35. OHCHR field offices carried out a range of activities on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights 
</p>
<p>at the regional and country levels, including providing support to special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders. The present section describes select projects clustered under interrelated 
</p>
<p>areas. For example, the absence of consultation or exclusion from development or mining 
</p>
<p>projects may lead to forms of violence. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Right to participation, consultation and free, prior and informed consent 
</b></p>
<p>36. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, the office provided technical assistance during 
</p>
<p>the drafting of a Law on Consultation, including through two legal opinions that set out the 
</p>
<p>international human rights framework. In May 2014, the President submitted a bill to 
</p>
<p>Parliament on prior, free and informed consultation The office is of the view that its prompt

<p>adoption would significantly contribute to enhancing respect for the collective rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>37. The the Plurinational State of Bolivia office also prepared a legal opinion aimed at 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing consultation processes on mining projects&#8217; respect for international standards. 
</p>
<p>It helped to ensure that costs relating to the consultation process in developing the bill were 
</p>
<p>covered by the State. The Mining and Metallurgy Law 535 of May 2014 recognizes the 
</p>
<p>right of indigenous peoples to share the benefits from the exploitation of resources on their 
</p>
<p>lands, and the application of the collective right to prior, free and informed consultation. 
</p>
<p>However, the scope of the Law extends only to new mining contracts and is limited to the 
</p>
<p>exploitation phase; it does not mandate consultation and consent during the prospecting and 
</p>
<p>exploration phases. OHCHR is of the opinion that regulations under the Act that affect the 
</p>
<p>interests of indigenous peoples should be drawn up in consultation with indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; organizations. 
</p>
<p>38. To promote respect for the right to consultation, the Plurinational State of Bolivia 
</p>
<p>office also promoted the inclusion of human rights issues at an international conference on 
</p>
<p>oil and gas and conducted several meetings with relevant ministries. 
</p>
<p>39. In the context of Colombia, OHCHR continues to advocate for space for social 
</p>
<p>dialogue on public policy issues of participation, consultation and representation of 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities. It continues work with rights holders to strengthen their 
</p>
<p>organizations and the design of protocols in dealing with authorities, as well as business 
</p>
<p>enterprises. 
</p>
<p>40. The office in Guatemala monitored various social protests of indigenous peoples as 
</p>
<p>high-level dialogues with authorities were not effective. The office also provided assistance 
</p>
<p>to the Ixil Mayan communities of San Juan Cotzal, who claimed that the State had not 
</p>
<p>respected its duty to consult with indigenous peoples. In April 2015, a court ruling was 
</p>
<p>made in favour of the claims made by the communities in this case. 
</p>
<p>41. In Mexico, the office documented and monitored consultation processes and was in 
</p>
<p>contact with different stakeholders, including federal, state and municipal authorities and 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations. The office opened communication channels between indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples and the authorities responsible for the development of consultation processes in 
</p>
<p>line with international standards. In addition, it submitted information on standards on the 
</p>
<p>rights of indigenous peoples, more specifically the recognition of customs and traditions 
</p>
<p>and traditional legal systems, to the judiciary in relation to a case of an alleged arbitrary 
</p>
<p>arrest of an indigenous leader. 
</p>
<p>42. In the context of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, the regional office 
</p>
<p>for Central America organized two workshops to facilitate a more inclusive dialogue 
</p>
<p>between indigenous peoples and the Government of Costa Rica, during which the World 
</p>
<p>Conference outcome document was disseminated. As a result, indigenous peoples and 
</p>
<p>government authorities agreed on the need to relaunch a dialogue with special attention to 
</p>
<p>land tenure. The regional office, along with the United Nations Resident Coordinator, ILO 
</p>
<p>and the national human rights institution, are seeking to expand the dialogue to cover other 
</p>
<p>urgent issues that indigenous peoples face. 
</p>
<p>43. In Panama, the indigenous round-table, established by OHCHR and the Office of the 
</p>
<p>Resident Coordinator to advance the ratification of the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples 
</p>
<p>Convention, 1989 (No. 169) and the adoption of the law for a national development plan for 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, continued its work. The regional representative and Resident 
</p>
<p>Coordinator facilitated the dialogue between indigenous peoples opposed to the 
</p>
<p>construction of the Barro Blanco hydroelectric dam and the high-level government 
</p>
<p>commission appointed by the President and led by the Vice President and Minister for 
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs. </p>


<p>44. Likewise, the OHCHR regional office for South America in Santiago, along with 
</p>
<p>other United Nations agencies in Chile, raised the need for inclusive government 
</p>
<p>consultations with indigenous peoples, emphasizing the need to ensure the participation of 
</p>
<p>indigenous women and children. 
</p>
<p>45. In the context of Nepal, OHCHR organized two stakeholder engagement meetings at 
</p>
<p>the district level in cooperation with the Office of the Resident Coordinator to enhance 
</p>
<p>dialogue between Constituent Assembly members, civil society actors and indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; representatives on promoting the rights of indigenous peoples in the country. 
</p>
<p>Participation in decision-making processes were stressed as critical in preventing conflict 
</p>
<p>and promoting dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Recognition, autonomous governance, economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>46. In Colombia, the office attended meetings of the inter-administrative working group, 
</p>
<p>which constitutes a forum for the departmental government of the Amazon, associations of 
</p>
<p>indigenous traditional authorities and environmental entities to pursue an intercultural 
</p>
<p>dialogue and for indigenous peoples to articulate their demands in relation to their 
</p>
<p>education and health systems, territory and government. With a view to illustrating 
</p>
<p>difficulties in implementing the Victims and Land Restitution Law and sharing relevant 
</p>
<p>expertise, three meetings were held with concerned institutions. The office in Colombia is 
</p>
<p>also seeking to enhance coordination between the indigenous and the national health 
</p>
<p>systems. It follows up on relevant cases, such as the death of indigenous children in Choc&#243; 
</p>
<p>and R&#237;o Sucio, and on lack of access to health care for indigenous peoples in the Amazon. 
</p>
<p>It monitors incidents of human poisoning and territorial contamination with mercury and 
</p>
<p>cyanide, as a result of gold mining. With a view to drawing attention to the critical health 
</p>
<p>situation of indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombians and the extreme vulnerability of 
</p>
<p>Hitn&#252; peoples in Arauca, the representative of the office in Colombia and the ombudsman 
</p>
<p>travelled to Choc&#243; and Arauca in order to give greater visibility to the critical health 
</p>
<p>situation of indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombians, as well as the extreme vulnerability 
</p>
<p>of Hitn&#252; peoples in Arauca. 
</p>
<p>47. The office in the Plurinational State of Bolivia continued to monitor the applications 
</p>
<p>to the Plurinational Constitutional Court of six municipalities for autonomy statutes, four of 
</p>
<p>which have been declared constitutional.  
</p>
<p>48. The office in Guatemala undertook missions to the interior of the country to assess 
</p>
<p>the situation of the rights of indigenous peoples, especially in terms of agricultural labour 
</p>
<p>and the exploitation of natural resources in indigenous territories in the departments of 
</p>
<p>Huehuetenango, Quich&#233;, Alta Verapaz, Chiquimula and the municipalities of San Juan 
</p>
<p>Sacatep&#233;quez and San J&#243;se Del Golfo. The office also provided technical assistance to the 
</p>
<p>Gender and Multiculturalism Unit of the Ministry of the Environment and Natural 
</p>
<p>Resources. In August 2014, the office organized several events on environmental and social 
</p>
<p>impact assessments with different actors, including civil servants of the Ministry, the 
</p>
<p>National Council of Protected Areas, the National Forest Institute and representatives of 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities. Against that backdrop, a panel discussion on the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles on Business and Human Rights was held. In addition, the office in Guatemala 
</p>
<p>and the national human rights institution evaluated the &#8220;Zero Hunger Plan&#8221;, a government 
</p>
<p>strategy aimed at the eradication of chronic and acute malnutrition in the country. In the 
</p>
<p>same vein, the office accompanied various actors involved in the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>National Court&#8217;s ruling on the violation of the right to food of five Chort&#237; children that 
</p>
<p>called for a protocol to establish the right to food at the administrative level. 
</p>
<p>49. In the context of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations Joint 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Office has assessed that Pygmy peoples have very limited access to health 
</p>
<p>and education as they live in remote areas of the country. </p>


<p><b>3. Violence against indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>50. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, exclusion from public life, discrimination 
</p>
<p>and extreme marginalization have not only led to adverse health outcomes, but also 
</p>
<p>increased tensions between communities. From 16 to 19 September 2014, a joint human 
</p>
<p>rights office investigation mission to Kabalo, Katanga province, learned about serious 
</p>
<p>allegations of human rights violations, including killings and inhumane, cruel and 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment, as well as abductions and lootings. These violations were allegedly 
</p>
<p>committed by Bantu militia and <i>Buzolezole</i>-Luba militia and targeted mostly Batwa 
</p>
<p>Pygmies. 
</p>
<p>51. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office investigated another recent large-
</p>
<p>scale attack on the internally displaced persons site in Nyunzu on 30 May 2015, allegedly 
</p>
<p>perpetrated by Bantu-Luba militia called <i>El&#233;ments Katangais, </i>which resulted in numerous 
</p>
<p>human rights violations, namely, 44 killings, 8 rapes and 57 cases of abduction. The victims 
</p>
<p>were mainly of Batwa Pygmy ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>52. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office also monitored the arrest of a Batwa 
</p>
<p>Pygmy non-governmental organization activist who had been accused of incitement to 
</p>
<p>hatred. The trial at the Tribunal of Grand Instance led to his release. In another emblematic 
</p>
<p>case, on 19 May 2015, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</p>
<p>placed under protection and later relocated a Batwa activist from Nyunzu to a safe place. 
</p>
<p>Allegedly, elements of the Luba militia had threatened him for opposing the Luba 
</p>
<p>leadership, burned his house and forced his family into hiding. 
</p>
<p>53. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, the office expressed concern about the lack of 
</p>
<p>police protection for Yampara and Qhara Qhara indigenous leaders during a vigil in June 
</p>
<p>2014, when they were subjected to physical violence and discriminatory language and 
</p>
<p>behaviour. Symbols of indigenous authorities were also destroyed by peasants from the 
</p>
<p>area. Acts of violence between a group of leaders belonging to the National Council of 
</p>
<p>Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu were also highlighted. 
</p>
<p>54. The office in Colombia continued field monitoring activities in the Amazon, Cauca, 
</p>
<p>Choc&#243;, Nari&#241;o, Caribbean Coast and Putumayo, where armed actors had committed abuses, 
</p>
<p>including killings of leaders. Situations where legal and illegal mining had led to violence 
</p>
<p>also were of concern, for example, in La Toma, where abuses had been committed against 
</p>
<p>representatives of a women&#8217;s organization, including sexual violence, by illegal miners in 
</p>
<p>their territory. The organization has asked OHCHR for accompaniment as they are 
</p>
<p>threatened and in need of protection. 
</p>
<p>55. The office in Guatemala held a dialogue with indigenous authorities of Totonicap&#225;n, 
</p>
<p>Solol&#225;, Chichicastenango, Nebaj and Quich&#233; to assess the situation of the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. As a follow-up to the dialogue, the office undertook observation 
</p>
<p>missions to identify best practices for the prevention of violence in indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities. The office in Guatemala also maintained regular meetings with the conflict 
</p>
<p>analysis unit of the national human rights institution in order to exchange information on a 
</p>
<p>set of six priority conflicts and to build a common strategy, including on a process to 
</p>
<p>remedy the human rights violations that had occurred in the 1980s due to the construction 
</p>
<p>of the Chixoy Dam, and on the current conflict in the municipality of San Juan 
</p>
<p>Sacatepequez due to the construction of a concrete factory of the company Cementos 
</p>
<p>Progreso. The office in Guatemala and the national human rights institution were 
</p>
<p>designated as &#8220;honour witnesses&#8221; in the dialogue established by the State authorities to 
</p>
<p>address both conflicts. </p>


<p><b>4. Follow-up to recommendations of United Nations mechanisms and developing United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations programmes 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Human Rights Adviser in Bangladesh has been promoting the use of and 
</p>
<p>interaction with international human rights mechanisms by various indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>organizations and the International Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission. He works closely 
</p>
<p>with United Nations agencies, programmes and funds to ensure that the principles 
</p>
<p>contained in the Declaration are integrated into ongoing and planned United Nations 
</p>
<p>programmes and activities, such as the Chittagong Hill Tracts development programme and 
</p>
<p>a new nation-wide United Nations programme related to indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>57. The office in the Plurinational State of Bolivia sought to strengthen coordination 
</p>
<p>mechanisms among relevant United Nations and other actors with a view to developing a 
</p>
<p>plan of action to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration. It also provided technical 
</p>
<p>assistance to representatives of indigenous peoples who participated in the fourteenth 
</p>
<p>session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. 
</p>
<p>58. The office in Guatemala, with a view to prioritizing human rights, helped to develop 
</p>
<p>a work plan for a donor group called the Working Group on Indigenous Peoples. In the 
</p>
<p>framework of the periodic assessment of Guatemala by the Committee on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>of Racial Discrimination, the office assisted with the elaboration of an internal document by 
</p>
<p>the Multicultural Society and Diversity Inter-Agency Group. The document reviews the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system&#8217;s role in helping Guatemala to implement the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>59. In Costa Rica, the regional office for Central America emphasized the need to 
</p>
<p>publish the national policy on racism and racial discrimination as part of its support to the 
</p>
<p>inter-institutional committee of the Government that follows up on treaty body, special 
</p>
<p>procedures and universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. With a view to implementing the recommendations made to Panama in its 2010 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review, the regional office for Central America collaborated with the 
</p>
<p>civil registry of Panama and UNICEF in order to support the registration at birth of 
</p>
<p>indigenous children of the Mama Tata religion living in remote areas, in line with 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights bodies and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>61. During its seventh session, in July 2014, the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples conducted panel discussions on the post-2015 development agenda and 
</p>
<p>on the role of parliaments in the implementation of the Declaration. Furthermore, the 
</p>
<p>session was an opportunity to discuss final preparations for the World Conference on 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples, including the draft of the outcome document. The Expert Mechanism 
</p>
<p>also finalized and adopted its follow-up study and advice on access to justice in the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, as well as its study and advice 
</p>
<p>on the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in natural disaster risk 
</p>
<p>reduction, prevention and preparedness initiatives. These studies, together with a number of 
</p>
<p>proposals made by the Expert Mechanism, were presented to the Human Rights Council at 
</p>
<p>its twenty-seventh session, in September 2014. 
</p>
<p>62. The Expert Mechanism also undertook a number of intersessional activities, 
</p>
<p>including participation in the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and the thirteenth 
</p>
<p>and fourteenth sessions of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. In </p>


<p>February 2015, OHCHR and the University of Lapland (Finland) co-organized an expert 
</p>
<p>seminar on the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples with respect to 
</p>
<p>their cultural heritage. The main objective of the seminar was to obtain substantive input for 
</p>
<p>a study conducted by the Expert Mechanism in response to a request made by the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council in its resolution 27/13. The study is to be finalized at the eighth session of 
</p>
<p>the Expert Mechanism, in July 2015. In March 2015, the Expert Mechanism held its first 
</p>
<p>ever intersessional meeting in Winnipeg, Canada. 
</p>
<p>63. OHCHR also supported the review of the mandate of the Expert Mechanism, 
</p>
<p>requested by the General Assembly in the outcome document of the World Conference, 
</p>
<p>including facilitating consultations between indigenous peoples and States and supporting 
</p>
<p>the Expert Mechanism members&#8217; engagement in discussions in follow-up to the World 
</p>
<p>Conference. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Special procedures and treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur carried out various activities in four interrelated areas: 
</p>
<p>promoting good practices; country reports; cases of alleged human rights violations; and 
</p>
<p>thematic studies. She also participated in the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples in 
</p>
<p>September 2014; the nineteenth Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework 
</p>
<p>Convention on Climate Change; as an expert witness for a case under consideration by the 
</p>
<p>Inter-American Court of Human Rights concerning the Kali&#241;a and Lokono indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples in Suriname in February 2015; an expert seminar on cultural heritage in 
</p>
<p>Rovaniemi, Finland; as a panel member in a high-level panel discussion on human rights 
</p>
<p>and climate change organized by the Human Rights Council; a global consultation with 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples convened by the World Bank; and a meeting with the Executive Board 
</p>
<p>members, the President and senior management of the World Bank. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur carried out a visit to Paraguay to examine the situation of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. She also carried out informal working visits to Australia, Canada, 
</p>
<p>Finland, Peru and the Philippines. 
</p>
<p>66. In September 2014, the Special Rapporteur submitted her first report 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/27/52) to the Human Rights Council, in which she set out the thematic priorities 
</p>
<p>for her mandate and announced her intention to focus on issues related to economic, social, 
</p>
<p>cultural and environmental rights of indigenous peoples. In her report to the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly at its sixty-ninth session (A/69/267), the Special Rapporteur reflected on these 
</p>
<p>rights in the context of the post-2015 development framework. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur issued public statements relating to situations that require 
</p>
<p>immediate and urgent attention by the concerned Governments. These drew attention to: 
</p>
<p>(a) the new framework for disaster risk reduction, including a call for the needs of 
</p>
<p>indigenous persons with disabilities to be met by effective action; (b) a new oil project 
</p>
<p>threatening further harm to indigenous peoples in Peru; (c) the elusiveness of justice in 
</p>
<p>many parts of the world; and (d) a call on Member States to include indigenous peoples in 
</p>
<p>development efforts. The Special Rapporteur, together with other mandate holders, signed a 
</p>
<p>number of letters to the States parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
</p>
<p>and raised concerns regarding planned amendments to the World Bank&#8217;s draft 
</p>
<p>environmental and social safeguards framework that would likely have an adverse effect on 
</p>
<p>human rights. 
</p>
<p>68. Other special procedures also took up issues related to indigenous peoples. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights paid a visit to Botswana, where she looked 
</p>
<p>at policies in the fields of culture, language, education and tourism. She met with the San 
</p>
<p>people, heard their concerns and, in relation to implications of the inclusion of the </p>


<p>Okavango Delta in the World Heritage List of UNESCO, encouraged the Government to 
</p>
<p>closely consult with indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>69. At the third Forum on Business and Human Rights, held in December 2014, during a 
</p>
<p>session on the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms, the impact of trade and investment agreements on indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples was flagged as an area where the Working Group on the issue of human rights and 
</p>
<p>transnational corporations and other business enterprises could compliment the work of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. Furthermore, some sessions at the 
</p>
<p>Forum focused on access to justice and reparations for indigenous peoples in the context of 
</p>
<p>business operations and extractive industries. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>70. During the reporting period, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination expressed concern and made recommendations in relation to indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples. Under the early warning and urgent action procedure, the Committee sent a letter 
</p>
<p>of concern to the Russian Federation, while under the follow-up procedure it sent follow-up 
</p>
<p>letters to Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and the Russian Federation. At its eighty-fifth 
</p>
<p>session, the Committee raised issues on indigenous peoples and made recommendations to 
</p>
<p>Cameroon, El Salvador, Japan, Peru and the United States of America. At its eighty-sixth 
</p>
<p>session, the Committee made recommendations on the rights of indigenous peoples in 
</p>
<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark, Guatemala and the Sudan. Concluding observations of 
</p>
<p>the Committee during these sessions included issues such as the rights to identity, self-
</p>
<p>identification and recognition of indigenous peoples, the lack of disaggregated data and 
</p>
<p>lack of socioeconomic indicators pertaining to indigenous peoples, the inadequacies in legal 
</p>
<p>frameworks and the structural discrimination affecting indigenous peoples. Other 
</p>
<p>observations focused on participation in political and public life, discrimination within the 
</p>
<p>criminal justice system, labour market and stereotyping of indigenous peoples, as well as 
</p>
<p>incidents of hate speech. The situation of indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation, free 
</p>
<p>prior and informed consent and the land rights of indigenous peoples were also raised. 
</p>
<p>71. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights highlighted the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples to recognition and self-identification, and to seek free prior and 
</p>
<p>informed consent on decisions affecting them and their lands. On many occasions, the 
</p>
<p>Committee made reference to the Declaration and the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples 
</p>
<p>Convention, 1989 (No. 169) as it considered reports of El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, 
</p>
<p>Nepal and Paraguay. The Committee also raised questions concerning indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>and sent a list of issues to States parties, including Burundi, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, 
</p>
<p>Guyana, Iraq, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Thailand, Uganda and Viet Nam. The main 
</p>
<p>questions raised by the Committee related to recognition of indigenous peoples, land rights, 
</p>
<p>consultation, non-discrimination, poverty, education and cultural rights. The Committee 
</p>
<p>also met with the Chair of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues to 
</p>
<p>discuss areas of common interest in view of the fourteenth session of the Permanent Forum, 
</p>
<p>dedicated to economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>72. The Committee against Torture considered the reports of Australia, Colombia and 
</p>
<p>New Zealand. In its concluding observations, it highlighted that violence against women 
</p>
<p>affected indigenous women disproportionately and urged national authorities to take 
</p>
<p>additional measures to address it. The Committee also requested information from States 
</p>
<p>parties concerning indigenous peoples through the list of issues prior to reporting from 
</p>
<p>Canada, Gabon, Japan and Mexico. </p>


<p><b> D. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>73. Issues concerning indigenous peoples were frequently addressed in the context of 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review. During the reporting period, 42 countries were reviewed for 
</p>
<p>the second time during the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first sessions of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group on the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>relating to indigenous peoples were made to a number of countries, in particular with regard 
</p>
<p>to harmonizing legislation with obligations under the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples 
</p>
<p>Convention, 1989 (No. 169) and strengthening of the legal and institutional framework for 
</p>
<p>the protection and promotion of the rights of indigenous peoples. Calls were also made, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, to reinforce efforts to eliminate discrimination against indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p>guarantee birth registration of all indigenous children; ensure access to education and health 
</p>
<p>services and to land and natural resources; and enhance cooperation and involvement of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples in decision-making. 
</p>
<p>74. Examples of the above-mentioned recommendations included the adoption of a law 
</p>
<p>on the autonomous development of indigenous peoples in Costa Rica; special attention to 
</p>
<p>land rights of Pygmy peoples in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; efforts to eliminate 
</p>
<p>discrimination against indigenous women and girls in Nicaragua; and strategies to combat 
</p>
<p>discrimination against indigenous peoples and others in Norway. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The rights of indigenous peoples have remained a priority for the Office of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), as illustrated by its 
</b></p>
<p><b>actions in the country and regional contexts and its support to mechanisms of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council and other intergovernmental bodies, as well as international 
</b></p>
<p><b>processes. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The first ever World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held in 2014, was a 
</b></p>
<p>landmark event in the advancement of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. It resulted in 
</p>
<p><b>commitments by Member States to enhance the implementation of the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples through national action plans and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other measures in key areas ranging from violence against indigenous women to 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing the impact of major development projects on indigenous peoples. It is 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential that Member States, in partnership with indigenous peoples and with 
</b></p>
<p><b>support from OHCHR and other United Nations partners, ensure robust follow-up to 
</b></p>
<p><b>these and other commitments contained the outcome document. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>During the period under review, OHCHR further expanded its work on 
</b></p>
<p><b>advancing the rights of indigenous peoples at the country level. Various capacity-
</b></p>
<p><b>building initiatives have revealed persistent obstacles to the exercise of the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation across sectors in some country contexts. The absence of consultation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>many instances has led to unfavourable outcomes for indigenous peoples. Even where 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal frameworks contain provisions on consultation and consent, multiple challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b>hinder their implementation, contrary to the provisions of the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The work of OHCHR across the globe, assessments by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the rights of indigenous peoples, concluding observations by the treaty bodies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations of other United Nations mechanisms reveal recurring patterns of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights concerns. Problematic areas include the recognition of indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples and their self-determination with respect to autonomous governance; the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights to lands, territories and resources; the absence of mechanisms for justice and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the adjudication of claims; inadequacies in legal frameworks; the absence of </b></p>


<p><b>disaggregated data that could serve as an evidence-base for policymaking; and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>exclusion of indigenous peoples from decision-making on laws and policies that affect 
</b></p>
<p><b>them, particularly in the sectors of development and the environment. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>In terms of joint programmes, the United Nations Indigenous Peoples</b>&#8217;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Partnership initiative has prompted United Nations partners to come together in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategic manner, guided by the principles set forth in the Declaration and the ILO 
</b></p>
<p><b>Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169). OHCHR has worked 
</b></p>
<p><b>closely with indigenous experts and relevant United Nations agencies to ensure that all 
</b></p>
<p><b>Partnership </b>country programmes are designed with indigenous peoples&#8217; participation 
</p>
<p><b>and implemented in true partnerships between indigenous peoples and States. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The present report captures many achievements on the normative front at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international level and some successes at the country level. However, much remains to 
</b></p>
<p><b>be done to fill the gaps in national policies and strategies and fully comply with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration. OHCHR continues to work in partnership with indigenous peoples, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations system and Member States to contribute to the promotion and full 
</b></p>
<p><b>application of the Declaration, as well as to the follow up on its effectiveness at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national and local levels.
