EcoStim Energy Solutions Reports Second Quarter 2016 Results
HOUSTON, TEXAS & NEUQUEN CITY, ARGENTINA – August 15, 2016 - Eco-Stim Energy
Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: ESES) (“EcoStim” or the “Company”) announced today its financial
and operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
●Revenues increased by 30% sequentially in a challenging market
    
 ●Company awarded new well stimulation contracts; additional contracts under
discussion
    
 ●New equipment arrives in Neuquén; successful importation of new turbine powered
technology
    
 ●2nd crew is being readied for field operation
    
 ●Capacity added in 2016 allows the Company to qualify for and provide services to the
tight gas and unconventional markets
    
 ●TPU’s now in Argentina and training of local employees under way
Argentina Overview
Our 2016 second quarter financial results improved over the first quarter but also were impacted
by the challenging market conditions in Argentina’s conventional oil markets resulting from (1)
the deterioration in international oil prices; (2) uncertainty relating to the sustainability of the
subsidized $67.50 oil prices and (3) a change in senior management and the upstream capital
investment strategy at one of our largest customers. Generally, operators in Argentina are shifting
their focus to natural gas and away from oil related investments other than those in the Vaca
Muerta. Areas impacted the most have been the heavy and conventional oil plays. It is important
to note that while the majority of Argentina’s produced oil benefits from a subsidized wellhead
price, much of the heavy oil produced in the country is exported from Argentina and is no longer
economic at current international oil prices. As a result of these factors, operators greatly reduced
their drilling and completion activities for these type of wells.
In contrast, natural gas drilling has remained strong and the current $7.50 per mmbu gas price is
not considered a subsidy given that imported LNG is comparable in cost after including
regasification and distribution expenses. Thus, while tight gas and unconventional horizontal
drilling activity is currently at an all-time high in Argentina, the oil services segment focused on
the conventional oil plays has become temporarily oversupplied thus resulting in a more
competitive pricing environment.
The Company’s revenues and financial results for the second quarter reflect these market
conditions. Nevertheless, our strategy remains focused on expanding our current capability and
horsepower which will allow the Company to qualify for more work in the growing tight gas
market and eventually transition to the unconventional horizontal well market.
In terms of capacity, the Company has increased its capability from a small four pump operation
in 2015 to a nine pump operation in the first half of 2016 thus allowing for the execution of limited
tight gas work in the second quarter of 2016. Recently, the Company has added four new turbine
powered pumps and expects to ship eight additional turbine powered pumps in September while
taking delivery of two additional diesel powered pumps later this year. The Company is also in
negotiations to lease four additional diesel pumps from a local company on an “as needed” basis
beginning in the first quarter of 2017. In total, this should give the company the ability to market
over 60,000 HHP for 2017.
J. Chris Boswell, EcoStim’s President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “As I have stated
previously we needed to deploy sufficient capacity to service our customers’ needs in both the
tight gas and unconventional markets. We believe those markets will be undersupplied as the
2017 capital spending plans get under way and will remain undersupplied for the foreseeable
future. I believe more than ever that we are perfectly positioned for the next several years where
we should be able to achieve sustainable growth and strong margins. Our decision to raise
capital in 2015 was based upon our view that we needed to upgrade our capability to participate
in the higher end market segments. I firmly believe this was the correct decision and I appreciate
the support of our shareholders during this transition period and we are nearly there.”
Bjarte Bruheim, EcoStim’s Chairman stated, “The pressure pumping markets in the U.S. and
Canada remain very difficult with several of our larger competitors experiencing substantial
EBITDA losses. I am proud that our team was able to improve revenues in a difficult market.
Despite the net loss for the quarter of $3.7 million, we were able to limit the negative adjusted
EBITDA in the second quarter to just $1.6 million. With a second crew starting up this quarter, I
am optimistic that management will reach positive or at least neutral cash flow soon afterwards.
Our team’s proven ability to execute our business plan, despite the recent headwinds, remains a
strength of the Company, as demonstrated by the recent contract successes and the successful
importation of new technology.”
Quarter Financial Results
For the second quarter of 2016, EcoStim reported a net loss of $3.7 million, or a loss of $0.27 per
basic and diluted share as compared to a net loss of $3.5 million, or a loss of $0.52 per basic and
diluted share, reported in the second quarter of 2015. The net loss for the first quarter of 2016
was $4.9 million, or a loss of $0.36 per basic and diluted share. Net loss for the second quarter of
2016 includes approximately $1.5 million of non-cash expenses consisting of depreciation, debt
amortization and stock compensation. In addition, the majority of the Company’s interest expense
is paid once per year in May, but we accrue interest quarterly in accordance with GAAP. The net
losses in the last two years reflect the start-up / early stage nature of our business and the efforts
to increase our capacity to a level that will allow the Company to operate two separate crews and
eventually provide services in all three market segments, conventional, tight gas and
unconventional. We believe that the second crew will allow the company to achieve positive
cash flow and eventually the third crew will allow the company to become profitable and allow for
sustainable growth. The Company has invested in much of the equipment necessary to achieve
these objectives and will soon begin operating the second crew with our preferred customers.
G&A Expense
General and administrative (“G&A”) expense in the second quarter of 2016 was approximately
$1.6 million compared to $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $1.6 million for the prior
quarter . The G&A expense is primarily related to the sales and administrative offices in Buenos
Aires and Neuquén and the cost associated with being a public Company, including our small
corporate office in Houston. The Company has managed its G&A expenses tightly and is working
to maintain liquidity while we work to get the second crew operational and to achieve positive
cash flow.
R&D Expense
Research & development (“R&D”) expense in the second quarter of 2016 was $0.11 million
compared to $0.25 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $0.17 million for the prior quarter.
R&D expense for the second quarter 2016 was primarily related to expenditures for research and
development efforts around the use of fiber optic diagnostic tools and turbine-powered well
stimulation equipment.
Cash and Total Liquidity
On June 30, 2016, EcoStim had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.9 million
compared to $7.2 million on June 30, 2015 and $10.3 million at March 31, 2016.
Capital Expenditures
Total capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2016 were approximately $1.6 million
compared to $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $1.1 million in the first quarter of
2016, comprised mainly of additional pressure pumping equipment for the Company’s capacity
expansion.

Non-GAAP Financial Information:
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, are used by management to evaluate, assess
and benchmark our operational results, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement measure to
review and should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow
from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in
accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all items that
affect net income and operating income. Limitations to using EBITDA as an analytical tool
include:
EBITDA is defined as net loss with adjustments for depreciation and amortization, gain on sale of
trading securities, interest expense, Income tax provision, and other income (expense) net.
Adjusted EBITDA used by the Company is defined as EBITDA plus adjustments for other income
(expense)-net, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
