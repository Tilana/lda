<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its seventeenth session 
from 21 October to 1 November 2013. The review of Belize was held at the 12th meeting 
on 28 October 2013. The delegation of Belize was headed by Judith Alpuche, Chief 
Executive Officer, Ministry of Human Development, Social Transformation and Poverty 
Alleviation. At its 18th meeting, held on 31 October 2013, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Belize. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Belize: Brazil, Germany and Maldives. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Belize: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/BLZ/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/BLZ/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/BLZ/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, 
Norway, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 
transmitted to Belize through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the 
universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Belize stated that respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, both at home and abroad, was a cornerstone of the State&#8217;s domestic and foreign 
policy. The preparation of the UPR report had provided Belize with an unparalleled 
opportunity to reflect on the meaning of human rights in the context of its own national 
development, on the status of the implementation of its international human rights 
obligations, and on the duty of the Government in that respect. 
</p>
<p>6. In drafting the national report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had coordinated with 
the full range of ministries and with civil society partners. The report reflected inputs from 
the Ministry of Human Development, Social Transformation and Poverty Alleviation, the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Ministry, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education, Youth 
and Sports. A number of non-governmental organizations had also been consulted during 
the process, including the Women&#8217;s Issues Network of Belize, the Human Rights 
Commission of Belize, the Belize Council of Churches, the Belize Association of 
Evangelical Churches, the United Belize Advocacy Movement and the Young Men&#8217;s 
Christian Association (YMCA). Once the final draft of the report was ready, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs had convened a validation workshop with government and non-
governmental agencies to share the report and receive final comments. The report was </p>


<p>subjected to spirited debate. Thereafter, the final report had been submitted to Cabinet, the 
highest policy body of the Government, which had given its unqualified endorsement. 
</p>
<p>7. Belize was a small, developing country with a population of about 316,000 people. 
It faced all the challenges of a small State: vulnerability to exogenous shocks, dependence 
on eroding preferential terms of trade, the vagaries of climate change, and high external 
debt. 
</p>
<p>8. According to the recent Living Standards Measurement Survey, household poverty 
increased from 25 per cent in 2002 to 33 per cent in 2009 and the indigence rate increased 
from 10.8 per cent to 15.8 per cent. 
</p>
<p>9. Belize was a multicultural society, with diverse groups coexisting peacefully. A total 
of 64 per cent of its population were under the age of 29. Belize had a low population 
density, with the majority of the population residing in rural areas, including at remote 
locations. 
</p>
<p>10. Belize was proud of its democratic traditions and the fundamental freedoms that 
were enshrined in its Constitution. Labour union activism and citizen participation were 
defining features of its colonial and post-independence history. Respect for rule of law and 
judicial independence were hallmarks of its judiciary. 
</p><p>11. Belize was a party to the majority of international human rights treaties, including 
the regional human rights treaties of the inter-American system. The Government took 
seriously its obligation to implement the treaties. To that end, a number of national laws 
formed the framework of the national human rights regime. That national framework was 
anchored firmly in the Constitution, which affirmed the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of all Belizeans and the equal and inalienable rights of all persons. 
</p>
<p>12. At the frontline of the Government&#8217;s efforts to promote and protect human rights 
was the Ministry of Human Development, Social Transformation and Poverty Alleviation. 
Four quasi-governmental agencies had specialized functions with the purpose of ensuring 
the protection of key vulnerable populations. The National Committee for Families and 
Children was tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child (CRC). The National AIDS Commission coordinated a multi-stakeholder 
response aimed at addressing the policy, legislative and practical challenges relating to 
HIV/AIDS. The National Council on Ageing advocated for the rights of older persons. The 
National Women&#8217;s Commission oversaw the implementation of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention of Belem 
do Para (Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of 
Violence against Women), as well as the implementation of the revised National Gender 
Policy. 
</p>
<p>13. Following on recommendations received during the first review, the Government 
had moved to strengthen the Office of the Ombudsman, which had independent powers to 
investigate citizen complaints and seek redress. The Office of the Ombudsman continued to 
enjoy the confidence of Belizeans as evidenced by the number of persons who accessed the 
Office. 
</p>
<p>14. The Government had also invested significantly in strengthening the Legal Aid 
Office, both in terms of resources and capacity. Belize hoped to expand the services of the 
Legal Aid Office to all districts and to employ an attorney dedicated to juvenile justice. 
</p><p>15. Civil society also played an important role in promoting and protecting human 
rights. Civil society advocacy work had been instrumental in sustaining a national 
discussion about the rights of citizens, the national human rights framework and the role of 
Government. </p>


<p>16. Human rights must be realized in all their dimensions: legal, social, political and 
economic. In that regard, the Government had taken a rights-based approach to 
development. Respect for human rights was a guiding principle of Horizon 2030, its 
national development blueprint. National development and the full realization of the human 
rights of all Belizeans were two sides of the same coin. All Belizeans must be assured of a 
certain minimum standard of living, which served as a common basis for the full enjoyment 
of all human rights. 
</p>
<p>17. Belize subscribed fully to the aspirations of the Millennium Development Goals, and 
had worked assiduously since 2000, in concert with its development partners, to meet the 
goals. Belize had done fairly well in meeting its education and health targets. 
</p>
<p>18. Belize was actively participating in the inter-governmental discussions on the post-
2015 agenda and was commencing the realignment of its national development plans in 
anticipation of the new global development framework. 
</p>
<p>19. Belize was acutely aware that persistent pockets of poverty continued to pose a 
challenge to development; poverty remained an obstacle to the full realization of all human 
rights of all Belizeans. Poverty alleviation and the expansion of economic opportunities 
were the overarching objectives of the national development strategy and action plans. 
</p><p>20. Over the past five years, considerable efforts had been invested in the reform of the 
social protection systems of Belize, focusing in particular on the modernization of social 
safety net programmes. The Government had sought to guarantee social protection to key 
population groups, including older persons, children, people living with HIV/AIDS, women 
and youths. 
</p>
<p>21. At the center of Government efforts were a number of targeted interventions 
designed to support the poorest segments of the population in the areas of health and 
education. 
</p>
<p>22. The National Health Insurance scheme provided free and low-cost access to health 
care for those living in south-side Belize City and southern Belize, the poorest areas of the 
largest city and of the country, respectively. 
</p>
<p>23. The Building Opportunities for Our Social Transformation (BOOST) initiative, a 
conditional cash transfer programme, provided cash grants for poor and indigent 
individuals and families. The cash transfers served as an incentive to keep children in 
school and ensured that they were up to date with their immunization protocols. The most 
recent data from the Ministry of Human Development, Social Transformation and Poverty 
Alleviation indicated that there were some 8,600 beneficiaries. Belize was most proud of its 
high rates of &#8220;bankerization&#8221; among its beneficiaries, with 96 per cent of those 
beneficiaries receiving benefits through credit unions. The positive effect of the BOOST 
programme was confirmed by a 2012 World Bank evaluation that concluded that the 
programme was showing some good results. 
</p>
<p>24. The Food Pantry programme provided a weekly basket of basic food items to 
beneficiaries at half the market price. Over 3,000 families were currently benefiting from 
the programme. 
</p>
<p>25. Health care and income security were the primary concerns for the elderly. To that 
end, the Government continued to support the Non-Contributory Pension programme for 
older persons, which provided coverage to approximately one quarter of the elderly 
population. Additionally, 48 per cent of the elderly population had access to the National 
Health Insurance scheme. 
</p>
<p>26. Belize had made significant gains in addressing the multiple challenges associated 
with HIV/AIDS. Notwithstanding a small increase in new infections in 2012, for four years </p>


<p>previously, new infections rates were on the decline. The Prevention of Mother-to-Child 
Transmission programme had a coverage rate of 95 per cent. The Government continued to 
provide universal access to antiretroviral treatment. In tandem with civil society partners, 
the Government also continued to sensitize the general population on HIV issues, targeting 
in particular adolescent females and most-at-risk populations. 
</p>
<p>27. While the Government had endeavored to ensure implementation of all the treaties 
to which Belize was a party, it was mindful that reporting remained a major challenge. The 
Attorney General&#8217;s Ministry had established an International Legal Affairs Department to, 
inter alia, provide advice on treaty obligations which would, in turn, inform the 
consideration of joining new treaties. The Government continued to study closely the 
treaties recommended by Members of the Human Rights Council during the previous 
review. In 2011, Belize ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
(CRPD). It would continue to work towards completing processes already under way for 
accession to the major international human rights treaties that were still pending. 
</p><p>28. The feasibility of establishing a new architecture or a national human rights 
institution in accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for 
the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles) was a challenge in the 
present economic context of strained resources. However, the priority of ensuring 
compliance with the State&#8217;s human rights obligations remained undiminished. Since the 
first UPR cycle, and with the assistance of OHCHR, Belize had convened a number of 
workshops to build technical capacity and instituted an interministerial mechanism to 
coordinate the preparation of reports to the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>29. The challenge of timely reporting was not unique to Belize. It was a common 
problem among all small States. Belize therefore encouraged the Human Rights Council 
and the treaty bodies to continue streamlining the process in an effort to ease the reporting 
burden of small countries with limited resources. 
</p>
<p>30. Parliament had enacted new laws in the context of its ongoing national efforts to 
continuously improve the legislative framework to ensure the protection of human rights of 
all Belizeans, taking on board a number of recommendations emanating from its first 
universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>31. Belize had, for example, earlier this year, enacted improved domestic legislation 
implementing the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime. Parliament had also passed the Commercial Sexual 
Exploitation of Children Prohibition Act in order to implement the provisions of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography (OP-CRC-SC). 
</p><p>32. The Education and Training Act, which entered into force in 2010, prohibited 
corporal punishment in schools. Amendments to the Labour Act treating issues related to 
age of admission to work were pending for consideration. Additionally, a draft 
Occupational Health and Safety Act aimed at, inter alia, prohibiting the involvement of 
children in hazardous work, in accordance with International Labour Organization (ILO) 
conventions and other international standards, was also pending consideration. 
</p>
<p>33. During its first UPR, Belize received a number of recommendations relating to the 
promotion and protection of the rights of women. Those recommendations were focused on 
sexual and reproductive health, labour and gender-based violence. In 2010, the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in collaboration with a number of other partners, 
conducted an assessment of the linkage between sexual and reproductive health and HIV in 
Belize and found that Belize had a comprehensive and supportive national policy 
framework. </p>


<p>34. Belize had adopted a similar comprehensive approach to addressing gender-based 
violence. To complement the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act, the Women&#8217;s 
Department had rolled out the National Gender-based Violence Plan of Action, the 
domestic violence protocol for police officers had been revised and a number of user-
friendly publications had been distributed to ensure that victims of gender-based violence 
were fully aware of their rights and the support services available to them. 
</p>
<p>35. In terms of labour-related issues, the Women&#8217;s Department continued to organize a 
number of training courses for women to build their capacity to engage in the marketplace 
and to develop skills to enable them to generate their own income. The Decent Work 
Agenda currently being implemented by the Labour Department focused on women and 
youth. 
</p>
<p>36. The revised National Gender Policy was endorsed by Cabinet in March 2013. It built 
on the 2002 policy and focused on strategies to reduce gender disparities in five key areas: 
health; education/skills training; wealth and employment generation; violence-producing 
conditions; and power and decision-making. It was the subject of spirited debate among 
Belizeans and provided an opportunity for a truly national dialogue about gender relations, 
diversity and human rights. 
</p>
<p>37. Since Belize had a very young population, protecting the rights of children and 
providing opportunities for youths were a high priority of the Government. Following on 
the recommendations of the first UPR cycle, significant improvements had been made to 
the national birth registration system to ensure greater access. Birth registration was at 
95 per cent and approaching universal coverage. 
</p>
<p>38. Improving access to quality education continued to be a major focus of the 
Government&#8217;s efforts. While universal access to primary education appeared to be within 
reach, challenges remained at the preschool, secondary and tertiary levels. The Government 
had embarked on an ambitious reform programme to transform the education sector. The 
Education and Training Act of 2010 provided the legal framework for those reforms. 
</p>
<p>39. The Government had invested significantly in providing opportunities for 
employment and for rehabilitation for youths, particularly those at risk. 
</p>
<p>40. In relation to indigenous rights, the delegation stated that the Mayas of southern 
Belize exemplified human rights in action. In July 2013, the Court of Appeal of Belize 
affirmed that the Mayas were entitled to indigenous title and the rights thereunder in respect 
of the lands they occupied. However, that high court did not affirm the Government&#8217;s duty 
to give effect to those rights through the remedies offered by the lower court. Consequently, 
the Government had been in communication with the representatives of the Mayas to 
determine a mutually agreeable framework for the implementation of the judgment of the 
Court of Appeal. 
</p>
<p>41. Belize continued to be concerned about persistent pockets of poverty and low social 
indicators in the Toledo District, where the majority of Mayas lived. A number of targeted 
interventions had been implemented to provide the Mayas with assistance and support, 
including the Improving Children&#8217;s Health and Nutrition in Poor Mayan Communities in 
Toledo project, which had a very high rate of coverage. 
</p><p>42. With regard to the advance questions submitted by Members of the Human Rights 
Council, the delegation stated that Belize was a steadfast supporter of the International 
Criminal Court, and one of the earliest depositors of the instrument of ratification of the 
Rome Statute. Indeed, Belize was the eighth country to deposit its ratification instrument. 
Another demonstration of its commitment was that Belize participated actively in the 
Assembly of States Parties and had, along with Trinidad and Tobago, proposed an 
amendment to the Rome Statute to expand the crimes under the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction to </p>


<p>include international drug trafficking. Although Belize did not yet have in place a single 
comprehensive law to implement the Rome Statute, existing domestic laws did respond to 
the State&#8217;s obligations under the Rome Statute, including the Genocide Act and several 
other pieces of legislation that cover crimes under the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction. 
</p><p>43. Belize was encouraged by the recent pace of ratifications of the amendments 
adopted at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute, held in Kampala. Belize was 
reviewing those amendments and welcomed the offer of Liechtenstein to provide technical 
assistance to support the Government&#8217;s consideration of the amendments. 
</p>
<p>44. Despite its best endeavors and intentions, Belize was unable to submit a full national 
report to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination; that continued to be a 
work in progress. 
</p>
<p>45. The Constitution of Belize prohibited discrimination against all persons and 
affirmed that &#8220;all persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any 
discrimination to the equal protection of the law&#8221;. The Prime Minister had reiterated that 
Government would not &#8220;shirk its duty to ensure that all citizens, without exception, enjoy 
the full protection of the law&#8221;. Belize noted in that context, as well, an advance question 
regarding a section of the Criminal Code which criminalized sodomy. The section of the 
Criminal Code was sub judice. 
</p><p>46. The delegation stated that the inextricable link between development and human 
rights was the recurring theme of its presentation and of the national report. Belize was a 
small State, facing severe economic and financial constraints in the context of the global 
financial crisis. The Government was proud that, despite resource challenges, Belize had 
found ways to increase investments in its social and economic development to enable 
Belizeans to actualize their social and economic human rights as well as their civil, political 
and cultural rights, which were firmly entrenched in the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>47. The delegation emphasized that room for improvement existed and welcomed the 
opportunity provided by the UPR to engage in a good-faith discussion with Members of the 
Human Rights Council on how to further strengthen the system of protections. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>48. During the interactive dialogue, 40 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>49. Cuba praised the strategy implemented by Belize to address the economic and social 
impact of natural disasters, which were common in the country. It welcomed efforts to 
achieve gender equality, reduce poverty and address income disparity. It noted that the 
implementation of an education strategy had allowed Belize to make progress on access to, 
and the quality of, teaching, despite persistent challenges. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Ecuador congratulated Belize on the progress it had made regarding human rights, 
particularly in the areas of gender, older persons, young people and persons with 
disabilities. Ecuador made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. France welcomed the efforts made by Belize since its first UPR, particularly the 
ratification of CRPD. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Germany recognized many of the challenges and resource constraints faced by 
Belize. It was, however, concerned that Belize had failed to implement many of the 
recommendations accepted in 2009, and encouraged the country to continue to implement 
its accepted first-cycle recommendations. Germany made recommendations. </p>


<p>53. Honduras noted that the report submitted by Belize reflected the progress made and 
challenges relating to human rights in the country since its previous UPR. It commended 
Belize for the appointment of an ombudsman and encouraged the State to provide the 
mechanism with sufficient resources. It also supported the suggestion of the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination that Belize establish a national human rights 
institution in line with the Paris Principles. Honduras made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Indonesia noted that, despite challenges, Belize continued to advance human rights. 
It welcomed the mainstreaming of human rights into the national framework and 
commended the country&#8217;s commitment to combating HIV/AIDS and reducing the stigma 
and discrimination associated with the condition. It commended efforts to protect women&#8217;s 
rights and combat gender-based violence, and expressed its hope that the establishment of a 
national human rights institution would remain on the agenda. Indonesia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Ireland commended the progress made by Belize, particularly concerning women&#8217;s 
rights. Ireland was concerned by reports of violence against women and lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. It encouraged Belize to take measures 
preventing such violence and facilitating the reporting of allegations. It was concerned by 
the status of Belize as a country of departure, transit and arrival for trafficked persons, but 
praised steps taken in that area. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Malaysia noted developments since the first review in 2009. It commended efforts to 
mainstream human rights into the national policy framework of Belize. The progress it 
noted also included the promotion and protection of the rights of women, children, persons 
with disabilities and older persons. Significant efforts had also been made in education. 
It appreciated the State&#8217;s frankness in identifying challenges, particularly concerning the 
eradication of poverty. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Maldives welcomed the ratification by Belize of CRPD and noted positively its 
accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It praised efforts to promote women&#8217;s 
entrepreneurship and looked forward to the full implementation of the revised National 
Gender Policy. Noting the State&#8217;s constraints regarding treaty enforcement and reporting, it 
called on the international community to provide technical assistance. Maldives made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Mexico commended the creation by Belize of a national ombudsman in 2012 and 
was confident that it would contribute to improving the human rights situation. Mexico 
praised efforts to combat the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, as 
well as legislation prohibiting the sexual exploitation of children. It noted the country&#8217;s 
commitment to education, efforts to integrate persons with disabilities and ratification of 
CRPD. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Montenegro commended the State&#8217;s ratification of CRPD and asked what steps were 
planned to align domestic legislation with the Convention&#8217;s obligations, and what measures 
were envisaged to facilitate the treatment and rehabilitation of persons with disabilities. 
Montenegro was concerned by the lack of timely reporting to treaty bodies and asked what 
the main domestic challenges were that prevented reporting under the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Montenegro made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Morocco asked what measures were envisaged under the three-year medium-term 
strategy to enhance implementation and monitoring of sectoral plans relating to economic, 
social and cultural rights. It also asked what measures were envisaged to improve planning 
to achieve the objectives for 2015 set out in the plan of action for children and adolescents. </p>


<p>It urged the international community to provide technical support to help Belize fulfil its 
obligations under international instruments. 
</p>
<p>61. The Netherlands commended measures taken by Belize to enhance access to health 
care, the decrease in maternal and infant mortality and the increase in births attended by 
skilled personnel. It recalled two recommendations that Belize accepted in 2009, namely 
raising the minimum age for marriage from 16 to 18 and abolishing criminal sanctions for 
same-sex activity between consenting adults. It remained concerned by certain aspects of 
sexual and reproductive rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Nicaragua noted that, despite the economic difficulties facing Belize, it had made 
efforts to fulfil its human rights obligations. Although Nicaragua understood that lack of 
resources hindered compliance with international obligations, it noted that such compliance 
was important. It urged Belize to continue to cooperate with the mechanisms of the United 
Nations system in the follow-up and implementation of its international commitments in the 
field of human rights. Nicaragua made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>63. Nigeria commended the Government on designing a national development scheme, 
entitled Horizon 2030, and on embedding human rights within the national policy 
framework. It also commended Belize on achieving gender parity in primary and secondary 
education and on improved life expectancy and infant mortality rates. Nigeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Norway observed that Belize lacked any constitutional or statutory provision 
expressly prohibiting discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and/or gender identity 
and that its Immigration Act included homosexuals in the list of prohibited persons for the 
purposes of immigration. Being opposed to the use of capital punishment under all 
circumstances and aiming for its universal abolition, Norway noted that Belize retained the 
death penalty. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Paraguay noted the appointment of an ombudsman and welcomed the priority given 
to combating poverty. It welcomed the adoption of Horizon 2030 and constitutional 
provisions on human rights protection, which prohibited discrimination on the grounds of 
race, religion, colour and place of origin. It requested information on the outcome of the 
implementation of the revised National Gender Policy and the National Gender-Based 
Violence Plan of Action. Paraguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Peru noted advances in human rights, including the creation of a long-term national 
development framework; the launching of policies, plans and initiatives to promote gender 
equality and combat gender-based violence; and the adoption of measures to assist persons 
living in poverty and reduce maternal mortality, including the extension of National Health 
Insurance coverage. It also noted the request made by Belize for technical assistance in 
addressing various human rights challenges. Peru made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. The Philippines welcomed the inclusion of human rights protection in the 
Constitution and the State&#8217;s strong commitment to promoting, protecting and ensuring the 
enjoyment of human rights. It noted that technical and financial constraints hindered the 
establishment of a national human rights institution. It was encouraged that eradication of 
poverty was central to medium-term development. It urged Belize to consider prohibiting 
corporal punishment in all settings. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Singapore noted various measures adopted by the Government on the rights of older 
persons, including on pensions, food programmes and access to health-care facilities, and 
its work on a study with UNFPA to identify the constraints and challenges faced by older 
persons. Singapore also noted a broad range of efforts to tackle the challenges posed by 
HIV/AIDS. Singapore made recommendations. </p>


<p>69. The delegation of Belize thanked States for their recommendations, comments and 
questions. On the matter of disabilities, the delegation replied that, even prior to becoming a 
party to CRPD, Belize had been operating under a framework of action for persons with 
disabilities. There were services available for their protection as well as for their 
rehabilitation and treatment. Belize was developing a comprehensive action plan to ensure 
that it could meet all the obligations under CRPD. Various legislation protected persons 
with disabilities, but Belize needed a complete assessment to ensure that there were no 
loopholes in the law. The Government was committed to working with partners and civil 
society to develop a renewed comprehensive framework. The first lady of Belize herself 
was a champion for the issue. She was establishing the Inspiration Center in Belize City, 
which would focus on rehabilitation and psychosocial support targeting particularly poor 
children with disabilities and their families. The Center would provide a space where 
children without disabilities could come and interact with children with disabilities, which 
boded well for the promotion of a culture of tolerance vis-&#224;-vis persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>70. Concerning lack of timely reporting under ICERD and other treaty obligations, the 
delegation clarified that, although Belize did not submit an entire national report under 
ICERD, it did submit answers to the list of questions relating to ICCPR. Belize was acutely 
aware that it needed to meet its obligations and would continue to be engaged in the 
dialogue with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The issue was 
simply a matter of personnel to prepare reports. Belize had a very small unit, established in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the State was steadily building its capacity in that 
regard. In order to put together robust and meaningful reports, Belize had another limitation 
in terms of the availability of timely and accurate data. The State was strengthening 
administrative and microsystems within the key ministries so that data would be available 
and that compiling reports to treaty bodies would be easier. 
</p>
<p>71. With regard to the National Gender-based Violence Plan of Action, the delegation 
stated that Belize had received a considerable grant from the United Nations Trust Fund to 
End Violence against Women to support its implementation, including an evaluation. There 
were no concrete results from the evaluation as yet, but the plan was very much being 
implemented and was a front-burner issue. 
</p>
<p>72. As for the National Plan of Action for Children and Adolescents not meeting the 
targets for 2015, the delegation indicated that it was rather an ambitious plan. Although 
Belize would not meet some of the targets, what it gained was the process. Belize was able 
to have major stakeholders and civil society work together in a concerted way on children&#8217;s 
issues to set the groundwork. 
</p>
<p>73. Slovenia welcomed steps to promote gender equality and tackle domestic violence, 
although reports of domestic violence against women continued. It commended the 
adoption of legislation to prohibit corporal punishment in schools and initiatives to promote 
alternative discipline. It was concerned that corporal punishment was still lawful under the 
Criminal Code. It indicated that Belize should address the problems it faced in reporting to 
the treaty bodies. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. Spain congratulated Belize on making human rights a top priority. It welcomed the 
ratification of CRPD and the development of integrated policy approaches to gender. It was 
concerned about discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and hostility towards 
LGBT communities. It commended the Supreme Court of Justice&#8217;s 2010 judgement 
recognizing the land tenure rights of Maya communities in the Toledo district. Spain made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Thailand applauded legislation prohibiting corporal punishment of children and 
ensuring the right to safe drinking water and sanitation. It encouraged the establishment of 
an independent national human rights institution. It welcomed progress in ensuring access </p>


<p>to health services, including to HIV/AIDS treatment, but noted that challenges remained. It 
urged the international community to provide technical assistance. Thailand made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Trinidad and Tobago noted steps taken by Belize to strengthen its human rights 
framework, despite the challenge of being a small island developing State. It noted 
particularly the revision, amendment and enactment of legislation and policy developments 
in the areas of gender, early marriage, the commercial exploitation of children, youth 
empowerment and protecting the rights of persons living with HIV. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. Turkey commended the adoption of respect for the rule of law and human rights as a 
guiding principle for Horizon 2030. It noted achievements in the areas of women&#8217;s rights 
and gender equality and welcomed legislation enacted to levy severe penalties for human 
trafficking. It considered that the establishment of the Legal Affairs Department would be 
pivotal in overcoming the obstacles to the implementation of international human rights 
instruments. Turkey made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>78. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland supported the country&#8217;s 
commitment to gender equality. It was disappointed that Belize had not supported a 
worldwide moratorium on executions. Referring to equality in the enjoyment of human 
rights and the inadmissibility of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, it 
welcomed the recent comments of the Prime Minister recognizing the rights of all citizens 
without exception. The United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>79. The United States of America commended progress in addressing discrimination 
against women, particularly the approval of the revised National Gender Policy. 
It encouraged a reform of existing laws that might be used to discriminate against LGBT 
persons. It observed that, despite the State&#8217;s commitment to improving its technical and 
policy capacities during its first UPR, the second report indicated the same human rights 
training and institution-building needs. The United States made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>80. Uruguay highlighted the ratification of CRPD and strategies to facilitate birth 
registrations in public hospitals, where 90 per cent of births occurred. It noted the 
promulgation of the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Prohibition Act and the 
Trafficking in Persons Prohibition Act, which envisaged more severe penalties for 
trafficking and related crimes; and the Education and Training Act, which prohibited 
corporal punishment in schools. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>81. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted initiatives against poverty, such as 
BOOST and the Food Pantry programmes. It emphasized that the expansion of the National 
Health Insurance programme had led to reduced maternal mortality, and noted the 
ratification of CRPD. Recognizing government investment in education and compulsory 
primary schooling, it noted measures to improve access to, and the quality of, education. 
It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>82. Viet Nam welcomed the comprehensive presentation of the national report, and 
commended the commitment of Belize to the UPR process and the implementation of 
recommendations accepted during the first cycle. It also welcomed human rights 
achievements in institutional reform, gender balance, education, child protection, youth 
rights, health care and social protection. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>83. Algeria acknowledged efforts to protect and promote human rights, including 
ratification of CRPD. It reiterated the call for technical assistance from the international 
community in establishing a national human rights institution. It asked how technical 
assistance could contribute to the implementation of recommendations received during the 
UPR. Algeria made a recommendation. </p>


<p>84. Argentina applauded efforts to protect older persons&#8217; rights. It noted that a strategic 
plan for the National Council for the Ageing was currently being prepared and asked for 
more information about that plan. It invited Belize to share its good practices with the 
Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons to be appointed 
by the Human Rights Council. It welcomed the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of 
Children Prohibition Act and encouraged efforts to combat the scourge. Argentina made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>85. Australia welcomed the appointment of the new Ombudsman in 2013, although it 
was disappointed that the Ombudsman had failed to produce annual reports since 2009. 
It commended human rights training for law enforcement officials, judicial officers and 
State officials, but remained concerned about the use of excessive force by security forces. 
It noted that the death penalty remained law, but acknowledged the de facto moratorium on 
executions. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>86. Barbados noted that it collaborated with Belize on trade, environment, security and 
human rights and commended the consultative nature of the national report. It welcomed 
the incorporation of human rights into the national policy framework, including the 
medium-term strategy framework and Horizon 2030, and efforts to combat poverty. 
It noted protection of the rights of vulnerable groups, including older persons and those at 
risk of HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>87. Brazil welcomed the revised National Gender Policy and National Gender-Based 
Violence Plan of Action. It commended ratification of CRPD and encouraged Belize to 
make a declaration under article 14 of ICERD. It acknowledged progress in children&#8217;s 
rights, noting that the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Prohibition Act 
implemented OP-CRC-SC. Commending poverty-reduction efforts, it asked about the 
expected results of the National Poverty Elimination Strategy. Brazil made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>88. Costa Rica encouraged efforts to ensure access to medical care and income security 
for older persons. Welcoming efforts to ensure gender equality, it called nevertheless for 
the low participation of women in politics to be addressed. Commending the ratification of 
CRPD, Costa Rica encouraged its enactment in domestic law. It encouraged Belize to 
continue with the de facto moratorium on the death penalty with a view to its abolition. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>89. Chile commended the integration of human rights in public policies and new action 
plans and legislative reform under Horizon 2030 and the three-year medium-term strategy. 
It welcomed future planning under the 2014-2017 strategy, which focused on eradicating 
poverty which, as noted in the national report, hampered the exercise of human rights and 
freedoms. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>90. China expressed its appreciation for efforts to implement recommendations accepted 
during the previous UPR cycle relating to the National Poverty Elimination Strategy, 
protection of the rights of vulnerable groups, promotion of gender equality, HIV/AIDS 
monitoring and improving legal aid provision. It noted ongoing difficulties in the areas of 
poverty reduction and social security. It urged the international community to meet 
technical assistance needs. China made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>91. Colombia recognized efforts to implement recommendations made during the 
previous UPR cycle and the transparent collaboration with international mechanisms. It 
noted that all countries faced human rights challenges, but nations had a legal and moral 
obligation to make citizens&#8217; lives better, particularly for the most vulnerable and 
discriminated populations. It offered to share its experience in the design and 
implementation of mechanisms for policies relating to international human rights. 
Colombia made recommendations. </p>


<p>92. Canada recalled recommendations made by the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child to reduce poverty among children of indigenous and minority groups. It asked 
whether more people would be able to benefit from the BOOST and Food Pantry 
programmes. It encouraged ongoing efforts in the reporting, investigation and punishment 
of offences by police officers and steps to improve access to preschool and secondary 
education and reduce poverty and crime. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>93. With regard to the question from Canada about increasing coverage of two social 
safety net programmes, the delegation stated that Belize had taken a deliberate policy step 
to ensure that the cash transfer programme and the Food Pantry programme were funded 
from recurrent revenue to ensure sustainability. The investment in improving health and 
education for poor children was a long-term one, and Belize wanted to ensure the 
sustainability of those programmes. Belize would continue to do so for the current and next 
financial year and had a plan to increase the number of beneficiaries of those programmes. 
There was also full political support. The Prime Minister said on various occasions that 
those pro-poor policies and programmes were the centrepiece for his Government. 
</p>
<p>94. As to the National Gender Policy and its aims, the delegation reported that it was 
designed to tackle issues of gender equality, gender equity and women&#8217;s empowerment. 
This was a revised policy that had built on the previous policy. Belize was working on a 
revised implementation plan for the policy. 
</p>
<p>95. Provisions for amendments to the Criminal Code that dealt with sexual offences 
were before the national assembly. The National Gender-Based Violence Plan of Action 
and other issues in terms of, inter alia, strengthening the implementation framework for the 
gender-based violence programme, and the decent work agenda, were all part and parcel of 
the Government commitment under the revised gender policy. The cabinet had approved 
the revised policy only this year. It was hoped that, by the first quarter next year, and 
following extensive consultations, there would be a multidisciplinary and multisectoral plan 
of action to ensure the implementation of the gender policy. 
</p>
<p>96. The delegation stated that a part of what constituted a barrier to the development of 
the implementation plan for the gender policy was resistance from churches, especially the 
evangelical churches. In certain sectors, they requested complete withdrawal of the policy 
because it spoke to respect for diversity, including the acknowledgement of sexual 
orientation as a type of diversity. It spoke to providing sexual and reproductive health 
services for vulnerable groups, including men who have sex with men and commercial sex 
workers. Because of those factors, the evangelical council and other churches had called for 
a complete removal of the policy. Nonetheless, the Prime Minister stated his commitment 
to the policy and opened the door for submissions of concerns by the council, but the plans 
of action for various sectors were in place and Belize would continue the work in ensuring 
gender equity and equality and women&#8217;s empowerment under the rubric of that policy.
