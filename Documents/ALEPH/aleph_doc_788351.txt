ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE
EXHIBIT 99.1
The following additional disclosure supplements disclosure contained in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that was filed on
June 27, 2012 by GeoResources, Inc. (“GeoResources”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and was mailed on
or about June 28, 2012 to stockholders of GeoResources in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
April 24, 2012 (the “merger agreement”), by and among GeoResources, Halcón Resources Corporation (“Halcón”), Leopard Sub I,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Halcón (“Merger Sub”), and Leopard Sub II, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Halcón (“Second
Merger Sub”). The additional disclosure is incorporated by reference into, and should be read in conjunction with, the joint proxy
statement/prospectus, which should be read in its entirety. Unless otherwise defined below, terms used below shall have the
meanings set forth in the joint proxy statement/prospectus.
LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER
As previously disclosed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus under the heading “—Litigation Related to the Merger,” several
substantially similar stockholder lawsuits styled as class actions were filed by alleged GeoResources stockholders challenging the
merger and naming as defendants GeoResources, its board of directors and, in certain instances, Halcón, Merger Sub and Second
Merger Sub as aiders and abettors, and HALRES LLC (“HALRES”) in one lawsuit. To date, such stockholder actions have been
filed in Harris County, Texas (the “Harris County Actions”); the District Court for the City and County of Denver (the “Denver County
Action”); and the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado (the “Federal Action”). On May 25, 2012, the Harris County Actions
were consolidated under the style Coyne v. Lodzinski et al., Consolidated Cause No. 2012-24423, in the 215th Judicial District
Court of Harris County, Texas.
Each lawsuit has been brought by a purported stockholder of GeoResources and alleges, among other things, that the members of
the GeoResources board of directors, aided and abetted by GeoResources, Halcón, Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub, and in
one lawsuit, HALRES, breached its fiduciary duties to the GeoResources stockholders by entering into the merger agreement for
merger consideration the plaintiff claims is inadequate and pursuant to a process the plaintiff claims to be flawed. The Federal
Action alleges that GeoResources and the board of directors of GeoResources violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 14a-9 of the Exchange Act by omitting material facts in the registration statement on
Form S-4 filed by Halcón on May 18, 2012. Further, the Federal Action alleges that the GeoResources board of directors violated
Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The lawsuits seek, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from consummating the
merger on the agreed-upon terms or to rescind the merger to the extent already implemented, as well as damages, expenses, and
attorneys’ fees. Halcón, GeoResources and all of the other defendants believe these suits are without merit and intend to
vigorously defend against such claims.
On July 16, 2012, the defendants reached a settlement agreement with the plaintiff in the Federal Action, subject to court approval,
to settle the class action lawsuit pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. No agreement has been reached
with plaintiffs in the other cases. In connection with the settlement agreement, certain additional disclosures are being made to
GeoResources’ stockholders, which are contained in this supplement to the joint proxy statement/prospectus. The settlement
agreement contains customary provisions and the parties further agree that approval of the settlement must, and will, be sought
from the court following notice to the stockholders of GeoResources and consummation of the merger. In connection with the
approval of the settlement, a hearing will be scheduled at which the court will consider the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy
of the settlement which, if finally approved by the court, will resolve all of the claims that were or could have been brought in the
action being settled, including all claims relating to the merger, the merger agreement and any disclosures made in connection
therewith. If approved by the court, the proposed preliminary approval order in the Federal Action would enjoin GeoResources
stockholders from pursuing other litigation over these claims, including but not limited to the Denver County Action and the Harris
County Actions. The proposed final judgment in the Federal Action, if approved by the court, would likewise permanently enjoin
GeoResources stockholders from pursuing these claims in any forum, including the Denver County Action and the Harris County
Actions. The settlement agreement provides individual stockholders with the right to object to the settlement and appear in person
or by his, her or its attorney at the settlement hearing and provide evidence or argument that may be proper and relevant provided
that such individual stockholder
1
follows the procedures set forth in the notice that will be delivered to members of the settlement class. In addition, in connection
with the settlement, the parties contemplate that plaintiff’s counsel in the Federal Action will petition the court for an award of
attorneys’ fees and expenses to be paid by the defendants in an amount not to exceed $450,000. We cannot be certain that the
court will approve the settlement. If the court does not approve the settlement, the proposed settlement as contemplated by the
settlement agreement may be modified or terminated.
The settlement will not affect the merger consideration to be paid to stockholders of GeoResources in connection with the merger
or the timing of the special meeting of stockholders of GeoResources scheduled for July 31, 2012 at GeoResources’ headquarters
located at 110 Cypress Station Drive, Suite 220, Houston, Texas 77090 at 10:00 a.m., local time, to consider and to vote upon a
proposal to adopt the merger agreement, among other things.
SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES TO THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS
GeoResources is making the following supplemental disclosures to the joint proxy statement/prospectus. These disclosures
should be read in connection with the joint proxy statement/prospectus, which should be read in its entirety. Defined terms used
but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the joint proxy statement/prospectus. Page numbers referenced herein
correspond to page numbers in the joint proxy statement/prospectus mailed to stockholders of GeoResources. New text is bolded
and underlined and deleted text is stricken through. All page numbers refer to the pages of the joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Without admitting in any way that the disclosures below are material or otherwise required by law, GeoResources makes the
following supplemental disclosures:
The following shall be substituted for the fifth sentence of the paragraph beginning, “More recently, since April 2011…” on page 52:
These and earlier discussions resulted in GeoResources signing numerous seven confidentiality agreements with parties that had
expressed interest in discussing a possible transaction with GeoResources.
The following shall be substituted for the sixth sentence of the paragraph beginning, “More recently, since April 2011…” on page
52:
The potential transaction with Company A did not occur because the strategic goals of both companies could not be
reconciled. As to Company B, the potential transaction did not proceed because of differing views regarding valuation and
the proposed board and management composition of the combined entity. Discussions with both Company A and Company
B did not evolve into definitive agreements but did however involve significant diligence reviews of GeoResources’ assets and
prospects and the active overview and involvement of the full board, as well as advanced negotiations concerning the valuation of
GeoResources.
The following shall be added as the last two sentences of the paragraph beginning, “On December 22, 2011, Mr. Lodzinski
contacted…” on page 53:
Neither Mr. Mitchell nor Mitchell Energy Advisers, LLC is affiliated with GeoResources or its affiliates. Neither Halcón nor
any of its affiliates are affiliated with GeoResources or its affiliates.
The following shall be added before the first sentence of the paragraph beginning, “On April 3, 2012, after several discussions
beginning on February 22, 2012…” on page 57:
In connection with the selection of a financial advisor, management and the board of GeoResources considered several
investment banks to advise GeoResources and the board regarding a potential transaction with Halcón. GeoResources
management had worked with and maintained relationships with several investment banks, over many years and therefore
had good knowledge regarding the experience and capabilities of potential financial advisors. As part of the decision
making process, management gathered information about potential investment banks including their experience in
advising on
2
comparable transactions, potential conflicts of interest, potential fee levels, their familiarity with GeoResources, and the
general capabilities of each investment bank. Although engagements with other investment banks besides Wells Fargo
Securities were discussed among the GeoResources board members; management, based on its review, recommended to
the board that Wells Fargo Securities be retained due to its significant familiarity with GeoResources in particular, as well
as its expertise and reputation. The GeoResources board agreed with management’s recommendation, and it then
determined to engage Wells Fargo Securities as the financial advisor for GeoResources in a potential transaction.
The following shall be added after the first sentence of the paragraph beginning, “Also, on April 11, 2012, Halcón notified
GeoResources…” on page 58:
GeoResources had been advised that Mr. Wilson had been seeking a waiver of this covenant from the acquirer of his
former employer, to the extent the non-compete provision applied to portions of GeoResources’ Eagle Ford properties.
However, he was not able to obtain the waiver.
The following shall be added after the last sentence of the paragraph beginning, “Also, on April 11, 2012, Halcón notified
GeoResources…” on page 58:
An implied valuation of the Eagle Ford properties in this context was considered by both GeoResources management
supported in part by work performed by Wells Fargo Securities with reference to comparable prices paid for oil and gas
properties in the area considering GeoResources’ drilling results on its Eagle Ford properties. This led to management’s
conclusion that the implied value of the Eagle Ford properties when considered as part of the total merger consideration
was more than the probable sales value of the properties on a separate, stand-alone basis. In addition, the Eagle Ford
acreage would constitute less than 10% of the combined entity’s assets, so management believed that exposure to other
potentially significant upside resource plays would be available to GeoResources stockholders going forward despite a
possible sale of the Eagle Ford properties.
The following shall be added after the last sentence of the paragraph beginning, “On April 12, 2012, as one of their continued
actions to ensure…” on page 59:
Baker Botts, LLP had been initially contacted by an independent director to potentially advise certain independent
directors with respect to the voting agreements relating to GeoResources common stock. Ultimately Baker Botts, LLP was
not engaged to advise with respect to the voting agreements but it did advise the independent directors generally
regarding their fiduciary duties and with respect to the key terms of the merger agreement including its non-solicitation,
fiduciary out, termination and expense reimbursement provisions. Baker Botts, LLP was not engaged to advise the
independent board members regarding the possible sale of the Eagle Ford properties of GeoResources.
The following shall be substituted for the third bullet on page 65:
Because the exchange ratio of 1.932 is fixed and will not be adjusted as a result of changes in the market price of Halcón
common stock, the value of the merger consideration to be received by stockholders of GeoResources will fluctuate with
the market price of Halcón common stock. The market price of Halcón common stock will likely be different, and may be
higher or lower, than the market price of shares of Halcón common stock as of the date of the merger agreement, the date
of joint proxy statement/prospectus, the effective date of the merger, or the date the former GeoResources stockholders
receive their shares of Halcón common stock. There is no limit in the merger agreement relating to decreases or increases
in the price of Halcón common stock between such dates, and the exchange ratio of 1.932 will remain the same regardless
of any upward or downward fluctuation in the market price of Halcón common stock.
3
The following shall be substituted for the fourth bullet on page 65:
that the merger agreement generally prohibits GeoResources, its management employees, directors and advisors from taking any
action to seek or solicit an alternative transaction or takeover proposal and from recommending, participating in discussions
regarding or furnishing information with respect to an alternative takeover proposal, except in each case in limited circumstances,
which permit the members of the GeoResources board to comply with their fiduciary duties. In the belief of management of
GeoResources, these types of provisions are industry standard and would not preclude any serious alternative acquirer
from making a superior acquisition proposal. In addition, while some companies use a formal auction process to solicit
potential acquirers, it is the view of GeoResources management and its board that auctions tend to attract financially
questionable buyers, that companies with the ability to pay premium prices in corporate acquisitions generally avoid
auctions, and that failed auctions tend to adversely impact the share prices of companies who conduct auctions, inhibit
their ability to issue equity at a reasonable cost in the near term and make it significantly more difficult to later enter into a
negotiated sales transaction. After careful consideration of these issues, the GeoResources board determined that
pursuing a negotiated transaction was the best means of achieving the maximum possible merger consideration for
GeoResources stockholders;
The following shall be added immediately after the paragraph under, “—Recommendation of GeoResources Board of Directors” on
page 66:
Recent Events – Pending Acquisition by Halcón of East Texas Assets
As described above under “The Companies – Halcón Resources Corporation – Recent Developments”, Halcón is in the
process of acquiring producing and non-producing oil and gas properties in east Texas referred to as the East Texas
Assets. Management of GeoResources has evaluated the production, acreage and prospectivity of the East Texas Assets
and believes the acquisition is consistent with the previously articulated strategy of Halcón in an area that had been
reviewed technically by GeoResources management. GeoResources management believes the purchase price to be paid
by Halcón for the East Texas Assets is reasonable, given the estimates of proved reserves, current production and
undeveloped acreage being acquired. GeoResources management also concluded that the acquisition is a positive
transaction for Halcón and its stockholders from a strategic and financial perspective and therefore will be positive for
GeoResources stockholders who will become stockholders of Halcón. Based upon these analyses, management of
GeoResources believes that the acquisition of the East Texas Assets is a positive development and therefore did not deem
it desirable or necessary to request an updated fairness opinion of Wells Fargo Securities.
The following shall be added after the first sentence of the paragraph beginning, “Barclays reviewed and compared the purchase
prices…” on page 73:
The selected transactions included recent corporate and asset acquisitions in the geographic areas that Halcón and
GeoResources operate.
The following sentence and tables shall be added after the last sentence of the paragraph beginning, “Barclays reviewed and
compared the purchase prices…” on page 73:
The following table summarizes the transactions Barclays employed to perform its comparable transaction analysis for
GeoResources.

The following, including the insertion of the table, shall be substituted for the paragraph beginning, “Discounted Cash Flow
Analysis. Wells Fargo Securities performed an illustrative…” on page 78:
GeoResources Financial Analyses
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Wells Fargo Securities performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis of GeoResources
using the GeoResources Projections to determine an implied present value per share of GeoResources common stock. Using the
GeoResources Projections and NYMEX strip pricing as of April 20, 2012, Wells Fargo Securities first calculated the projected
after-tax unlevered free cash flows (calculated as cash EBITDA minus cash taxes minus capital expenditures) for
GeoResources for the calendar years, which we refer to as CY, 2012 through 2027, as presented in the following table ($ in
millions):
Unlevered Free
Cash Flow
2012E    2013E   2014E   2015E   2016E   2017E   2018E   2019E   2020E   2021E   2022E    2023E    2024E   2025E   2026E   2027E
($140.9)   $ 9.0    $ 49.1    $ 62.6    $ 76.7    $ 82.4    $ 79.4    $ 79.6    $ 61.9    $ 29.1    $ 14.1    $105.1    $ 94.8    $ 81.8    $ 74.8    $ 66.4
Wells Fargo Securities selected the terminal value EBITDA multiples used in this analysis based on the range of TEV (as defined
below)/estimated CY 2012 EBITDA multiples derived from the comparable public companies analysis (4.8x-11.2x), the
median of the TEV/estimated CY 2012 multiples derived from the comparable public companies analysis (5.9x) and its
experience and professional judgment. Wells Fargo Securities discounted the terminal value and the cash flow streams to present
values using discount rates ranging from 10%-12% to arrive at a range of illustrative enterprise values for GeoResources. Wells
Fargo Securities derived the range of discount rates used in this analysis based on its experience and professional judgment
taking into account GeoResources’ first by performing a weighted average cost of capital, which Wells Fargo Securities
calculated using standard corporate finance methodologies, “WACC,” analysis for GeoResources based on certain financial
metrics for GeoResources and the comparable public companies, including betas for the comparable public companies
and the assumed cost of debt for GeoResources and then selected the applied discount rates ranging from 10% to 12%
using its professional judgment as to an illustrative range based on this WACC analysis. Wells Fargo Securities then
adjusted the range of illustrative enterprise values of GeoResources to account for GeoResources’ pro forma net cash and debt
outstanding as of December 31, 2011 to arrive at a range of implied equity values for GeoResources of $476 million to $596
million. Wells Fargo Securities then divided
7
this range of implied equity values by 27.4 million (the total number of fully diluted shares of GeoResources common stock
outstanding as provided by GeoResources’ management) to arrive at a range of illustrative value indications per share for
GeoResources common stock of $17.34 to $21.73.
The following shall be substituted for the last two sentences of the paragraph beginning, “Sum-of-the-Parts Analysis. Wells Fargo
Securities also performed…” on page 79:
This analysis of the implied value of GeoResources’ proved reserves was performed under three scenarios, applying various risk
levels to the three categories of proved reserves, which ranging from 90%-100% for proved developed producing reserves,
from 80%-90% for proved developed non-producing reserves and from 60%-80% for proved undeveloped reserves. This
analysis yielded implied enterprise values for GeoResources’ proved reserves ranging from $509.9 million to $584.3 million
The following shall be substituted for the second sentence of the paragraph beginning, “In calculating a sum of the parts
analysis…” on page 79:
In conducting this analysis, Wells Fargo Securities utilized different value per acre metrics for each of GeoResources’ different
project areas based on input from GeoResources’ management, including with respect to the application of various risk
levels, and Wells Fargo Securities’ professional judgment, in addition to a review of precedent acreage transactions that have
occurred in proximity to each of GeoResources’ project areas.
The following shall be substituted for the paragraph beginning, “Wells Fargo Securities then added the range of implied…” on page
79:
Wells Fargo Securities then added the range of implied enterprise values associated with GeoResources’ proved reserves to the
range of implied enterprise values associated with GeoResources’ undeveloped acreage and adjusted these. This yielded a
combined enterprise value amounts ranging from $778.1 million to $994.0 million. The combined enterprise value was
adjusted to account for net total debt outstanding (of $40.4 million (pro forma for the Austin Chalk acquisition), cash of $67.2
million, hedges outstanding of $8.1 million and less capitalized future general and administrative expenses )of $106.6 million
(based on estimates provided by GeoResources’ management), and hedges outstanding to arrive at a range of total an implied
equity range of net asset values for GeoResources of $706.4 million to $922.4 million. This range of equity values was then
divided by 27.4 million (the total number of fully diluted shares of GeoResources common stock outstanding as provided by
GeoResources’ management) and resulted in a range of illustrative equity value indications per share of GeoResources common
stock of $25.74 to $33.61.
The following shall be added as the last sentence of the paragraph beginning, “Comparable Public Companies Analysis. Wells
Fargo Securities reviewed and compared certain…” on page 79:
In evaluating the comparable public companies, Wells Fargo Securities made judgments and assumptions concerning
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of GeoResources, such as the impact of competition on the business of GeoResources and the
industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and
prospects of GeoResources or the industry or the financial markets in general. Wells Fargo Securities also made
judgments as to the relative comparability of the various valuation parameters with respect to the companies. The
numerical results may not in themselves be meaningful in analyzing the transaction as compared to the comparable
public companies.

Unlevered
Free

Next, Wells Fargo Securities calculated the net present value of the illustrative terminal value of Halcón in CY 2027 by applying a
range of terminal value EBITDA multiples of 5.0x-7.0x to estimated Halcón EBITDA for CY 2027. Wells Fargo Securities selected
the terminal value EBITDA multiples used in this analysis based on the range of TEV/estimated CY 2012 EBITDA multiples

derived from the comparable public companies analysis (5.4x) and its experience and professional judgment. Wells Fargo
Securities discounted the terminal value and the cash flow streams to present values using discount rates ranging from 10%-12%
to arrive at a range of illustrative enterprise values for Halcón. Wells Fargo Securities derived the range of discount rates used in
this analysis based on its experience and professional judgment taking into account Halcón’s first by performing a weighted
average cost of capital, which Wells Fargo Securities calculated using standard corporate finance methodologies. “WACC,”
analysis for Halcón based on certain financial metrics for Halcón and the comparable public companies, including betas
for the comparable public companies and the assumed cost of debt for Halcón and then selected the applied discount
rates ranging from 10% to 12% using its professional judgment as to an illustrative range based on this WACC analysis.
