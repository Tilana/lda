BILL BARRETT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
June 30, 2016
1. Organization
Bill Barrett Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Company"), is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration,
development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids ("NGLs"). Since its
inception in January 2002, the Company has conducted its activities principally in the Rocky
Mountain region of the United States.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation. The accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include
the accounts of the Company. These statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of
management, the accompanying financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals and adjustments) necessary to present fairly, in all material respects, the
Company's interim results. However, operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. The Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K includes certain definitions and a summary of significant accounting policies and should
be read in conjunction with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as disclosed herein, there
have been no material changes to the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements included in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Use of Estimates. In the course of preparing the Company's financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, management makes various assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine the
reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and in the disclosure of commitments
and contingencies. Changes in these assumptions, judgments and estimates will occur as a result
of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events and, accordingly, actual results could
differ from amounts initially established.
Areas requiring the use of assumptions, judgments and estimates relate to volumes of oil, natural
gas and NGL reserves used in calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A"), the
amount of expected future cash flows used in determining possible impairments of proved oil and
gas properties and the amount of future capital costs used in these calculations. Assumptions,
judgments and estimates also are required in determining asset retirement obligations, the timing of
dry hole costs, impairments of unproved oil and gas properties, valuing deferred tax assets and
estimating fair values of derivative instruments and stock-based payment awards.
Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable is comprised of the following:
Accrued oil, gas and NGL sales $ 26,271
Due from joint interest owners 5,526
Other
2,120
$ 33,594

Oil and Gas Properties. The Company's oil, gas and NGL exploration and production activities are
accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs
and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending
determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find
proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and remain within cash flows
from investing activities in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. If an exploratory
well does find proved reserves, the costs remain capitalized and are included within additions to oil
and gas properties and remain within cash flows from investing activities in the Unaudited
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether
8
Table of Contents
proved reserves are added or not. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Upon
sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated DD&A
are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized.
Other exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals
for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. The sale of a partial interest in a proved
property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this
treatment does not significantly affect the unit-of-production amortization rate. Maintenance and
repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate
property and equipment accounts.
Unproved oil and gas property costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if the properties
are subsequently determined to be productive or are assigned proved reserves. Proceeds from
sales of partial interests in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without
recognizing any gain until all costs are recovered. Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed
periodically for impairment based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance,
commodity price outlooks, future plans to develop acreage, recent sales prices of comparable
properties and other relevant matters.
Materials and supplies consist primarily of tubular goods and well equipment to be used in future
drilling operations or repair operations and are carried at the lower of cost or market value, on a first-
in, first-out basis.
The following table sets forth the net capitalized costs and associated accumulated DD&A and non-
cash impairments relating to the Company's oil, natural gas and NGL producing activities:

Excludes oil and gas properties held for sale of $33.7 million, comprised of $571.9 million of
proved oil and gas properties and $3.2 million of unproved oil and gas properties, net of
accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of $541.4 million. Held for
sale balances are included in current assets as assets held for sale, net of amortization and
impairment, in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016. See Note 4 for
additional information on assets held for sale.
The Company reviews proved oil and gas properties on a field-by-field basis for impairment on a
quarterly basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of
their carrying value may have occurred. The Company estimates the expected undiscounted future
net cash flows of its oil and gas properties based on the Company's best estimate of development
plans, future production, commodity pricing, gathering and transportation deductions, production tax
rates, lease operating expenses and future development costs. The Company compares such
undiscounted future net cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine
if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the undiscounted future net cash flows exceed the carrying
amount of the proved oil and gas properties, no impairment is taken. If the carrying value of a
property exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows, the Company will impair the carrying
value to fair value based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors existing as of the
balance sheet date. The Company does not believe that the undiscounted future net cash flows
analysis of its proved property represents the applicable market value. The factors used to
determine fair value include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties,
indications from marketing activities, the present value of future revenues, net of estimated
operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future
production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate
with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the projected cash flows.

Table of Contents
Oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment once they meet the criteria to be classified as
held for sale. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying cost or fair value less costs to
sell. The fair value of the assets is determined using a market approach, based on an estimated
selling price, as evidenced by current marketing activities, if possible. If an estimated selling price is
not available, the Company utilizes the income valuation technique which involves calculating the
present value of future revenues, as discussed above. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds
the fair value less costs to sell, an impairment will result to reduce the value of the properties down
to fair value less costs to sell.
The Company recognized non-cash impairment, dry hole costs and abandonment expense in the
Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations, as follows:
Non-cash impairment of proved oil and gas
properties
Non-cash impairment of unproved oil and gas
properties
Dry hole costs
Abandonment expense and lease expirations

Non-cash impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015 related to the Company's remaining Powder River Basin properties based
upon a true up of previously estimated fair value relative to carrying value. These assets were
classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2014 and sold in February 2015.
The provision for DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated on a field-by-field basis using the
unit-of-production method. Natural gas and NGLs are converted to an oil equivalent, Boe, at the
standard rate of six Mcf to one Boe and forty-two gallons to one Boe, respectively. Estimated future
dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs are taken into consideration by this calculation.
Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are comprised
of the following:
Accrued drilling, completion and facility costs
Accrued lease operating, gathering, transportation and
processing expenses
Accrued general and administrative expenses
Accrued interest payable

Revenue Recognition. Oil, gas and NGL revenues are recognized when production is sold to a
purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred and title has transferred, and
collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. The Company uses the sales method to account
for gas and NGL imbalances. Under this method, revenues are recorded on the basis of gas and
NGLs actually sold by the Company. In addition, the Company records revenues for its share of gas
and NGLs sold by other owners that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to
insufficient remaining reserves. The Company also reduces revenues for other owners' volumetric
share of gas and NGLs sold by the Company that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future
due to insufficient remaining reserves. The Company's remaining over- and under-produced gas
and NGLs balancing positions are taken into account in determining the Company's proved oil, gas
and NGL reserves. Imbalances at June 30, 2016 and 2015 were not material.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company periodically uses derivative financial
instruments to achieve a more predictable cash flow from its oil, natural gas and NGL sales by
reducing its exposure to price fluctuations.

Table of Contents
Derivative instruments are recorded at fair market value and are included in the Unaudited
Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities and in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements
of Operations as commodity derivative gain (loss).
Income Taxes. Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial
statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain
income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting
purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of
those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or liabilities
are settled. Deferred income taxes also include tax credits and net operating losses that are
available to offset future income taxes. Deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently
enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are regularly reviewed, considering all positive and negative
evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
taxable strategies and results of recent operations. The assumptions about future taxable income
require significant judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
asset will be realized. If it is determined that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a
valuation allowance will be recorded against the deferred tax asset.
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes for tax positions taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. Only tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are
recognized. The Company does not have any uncertain tax positions recorded as of June 30, 2016.
Earnings/Loss Per Share. Basic net income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net
income (loss) attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per common share is calculated by dividing net
income attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and other dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities for the diluted net income per
common share calculations consist of nonvested equity shares of common stock, in-the-money
outstanding stock options to purchase the Company's common stock and shares into which the
Convertible Notes are convertible. No potential common shares are included in the computation of
any diluted per share amount when a net loss exists, as was the case for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share:

New Accounting Pronouncements. In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting. The objective of this update is to simplify the current guidance
for stock compensation. The areas for simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of
awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09
is effective for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The objective of this update is to
increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and
lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim
periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
this standard.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
Taxes. The objective of this update is to require deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as
noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
11
Table of Contents
annual periods. The standard will be adopted retrospectively and will not have a significant impact
on the Company's disclosures and financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.
The objective of this update is to require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt
liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt
liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,
Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit
Arrangements. This ASU amends ASU 2015-03 which had not addressed the balance sheet
presentation of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements. Under
ASU 2015-15, a Company may defer debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit
arrangements and present such costs as an asset, subsequently amortizing the deferred debt
issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there
are any outstanding borrowings. ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 are effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, should be applied
retrospectively and represent a change in accounting principle. The Company adopted ASU 2015-
03 and ASU 2015-15 as of March 31, 2016, and as a result, $8.7 million of debt issuance costs
related to the Company’s senior notes and convertible senior notes was reclassified from deferred
financing costs and other noncurrent assets to long-term debt in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The Company elected to continue presenting the debt
issuance costs associated with its credit facility within deferred financing costs and other noncurrent
assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The objective of this update is to provide guidance in
GAAP about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an
entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU
2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods
and interim periods thereafter. The standard will be adopted prospectively.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The
objective of this update is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common
revenue standard. ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective reporting periods of ASU 2014-09, and it is
now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this
standard.

4. Assets Held for Sale
Assets are classified as held for sale when the Company commits to a plan to sell the assets and
there is reasonable certainty the sale will take place within one year. Upon classification as held for
sale, long-lived assets are analyzed for impairment to identify and expense any excess of carrying
value over fair value less costs to sell. In addition, the assets are no longer depreciated or depleted.
12
Table of Contents
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company committed to a plan to sell certain
non-core assets in the Uinta Basin. Therefore, the related assets and liabilities were classified as
held for sale in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2016. The related
assets continue to be classified as held for sale in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
June 30, 2016, as the sale did not close until July 14, 2016. See Note 15 for additional information
regarding this subsequent event.
Assets held for sale are recorded at the lesser of their respective carrying value or fair value less
estimated costs to sell. The fair value of the net assets held for sale was $28.9 million and was
presented as assets held for sale, net of amortization and impairment, of $33.7 million and liabilities
associated with assets held for sale of $4.8 million on the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet
as of June 30, 2016.

The aggregate estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes was approximately $0.5 million as of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 based on reported market trades of these instruments.
The Company has the right at any time, with at least 30 days' notice, to call the remaining
Convertible Notes, and the holders have the right to require the Company to purchase the notes
on each of March 20, 2018 and March 20, 2023.
The aggregate estimated fair value of the 7.625% Senior Notes was approximately $245.4
million and $270.2 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, based on
reported market trades of these instruments.
The aggregate estimated fair value of the 7.0% Senior Notes was approximately $292.7 million
and $272.0 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, based on reported
market trades of these instruments.
The aggregate estimated fair value of the Lease Financing Obligation was approximately $3.0
(5)million as of June 30, 2016 and $3.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Because there is no
active, public market for the Lease Financing Obligation, the aggregate estimated fair value was
based on market-based parameters of comparable term secured financing instruments.
The current portion of the long-term debt as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 includes
the current portion of the Lease Financing Obligation.

Amended Credit Facility
The Amended Credit Facility had commitments and a borrowing base of $335.0 million from 13
lenders as of June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had no amounts outstanding under
the Amended Credit Facility. As credit support for future payment under a contractual obligation, a
$26.0 million letter of credit was issued under the Amended Credit Facility, which reduced the
available borrowing capacity of the Amended Credit Facility as of June 30, 2016 to $309.0 million.
The borrowing base will not be impacted by the sale of certain non-core assets in the Uinta Basin
described in Note 4 and Note 15.
Interest rates are LIBOR plus applicable margins of 1.5% to 2.5% or ABR plus 0.5% to 1.5% and the
unused commitment fee is between 0.375% and 0.5% based on borrowing base utilization. There
have not been any borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility in 2016.
13
Table of Contents
The borrowing base under the Amended Credit Facility is determined at the discretion of the
lenders, based on the collateral value of our proved reserves that have been mortgaged to such
lenders, and is subject to regular re-determinations on or about April 1 and October 1 of each year,
as well as following any property sales. On April 11, 2016, the borrowing base was reduced from
$375.0 million to $335.0 million based on proved reserves and the commodity hedge position in
place at December 31, 2015. Future borrowing bases will be computed based on proved oil, natural
gas and NGL reserves, hedge positions and estimated future cash flows from those reserves
calculated using future commodity pricing provided by our lenders, as well as any other outstanding
debt. Lower commodity prices will impact the amount lenders will provide for a borrowing base.
The Amended Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants. The Company is currently in
compliance with all financial covenants and has complied with all financial covenants since
issuance.
If the Company fails to comply with the covenants or other terms of any agreements governing the
Company's debt, the Company's lenders and holders of the Company's convertible notes and
senior notes may have the right to accelerate the maturity of that debt and foreclose upon the
collateral, if any, securing that debt. The occurrence of any such event would adversely affect the
Company's financial condition. In September 2015, the Company obtained an amendment to the
Amended Credit Facility that replaced the Company's debt-to-EBITDAX (earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses) covenant in the facility with a
secured debt-to-EBITDAX covenant and an EBITDAX-to-interest covenant through March 31, 2018.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain similar amendments, or waivers
of covenant breaches, in the future if needed.
5% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2028
On March 12, 2008, the Company issued $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible
Notes. On March 20, 2012, $147.2 million of the outstanding principal amount, or approximately
85% of the outstanding Convertible Notes, were put to the Company and redeemed by the
Company at par. On March 20, 2015, $24.8 million of the remaining outstanding principal amount,
or approximately 98% of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes, were put to the Company
and redeemed by the Company at par. After the redemption, $0.6 million aggregate principal
amount of the Convertible Notes were outstanding as of June 30, 2016. The Convertible Notes
mature on March 15, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or purchased by the Company. The
Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of the
Company's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, are senior in right of payment to all
of the Company's future subordinated indebtedness, and are effectively subordinated to all of the
Company's secured indebtedness with respect to the collateral securing such indebtedness. The
Convertible Notes are structurally subordinated to all present and future secured and unsecured
debt and other obligations of the Company's subsidiaries. The Convertible Notes are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by the subsidiaries that guarantee the Company's indebtedness under
the Amended Credit Facility, the 7.625% Senior Notes and the 7.0% Senior Notes.
The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on
March 15 and September 15 of each year. Holders of the remaining Convertible Notes may require
the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes for cash on each of March 20,
2018 and March 20, 2023 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding
the applicable purchase date. The Company has the right with at least 30 days' notice to call the
Convertible Notes.
7.625% Senior Notes Due 2019
On September 27, 2011, the Company issued $400.0 million in principal amount of 7.625% Senior
Notes due 2019 at par. On June 3, 2016, the Company completed a debt exchange with a holder of
the 7.625% Senior Notes (the "Debt Exchange"). The holder exchanged $84.7 million principal
amount of the 7.625% Senior Notes for 10 million newly issued shares of the Company’s common
stock. Based on the fair value of the shares issued, the Company recognized an $8.7 million gain
on extinguishment of debt on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016. After the Debt Exchange, $315.3 million aggregate principal amount of the
7.625% Senior Notes were outstanding as of June 30, 2016.
The 7.625% Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2019. Interest is payable in arrears semi-annually
on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 7.625% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations
of the Company and rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company's other existing and
future senior unsecured indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes and 7.0% Senior Notes. The
7.625% Senior Notes are currently redeemable at the Company's option at a specified redemption
price. The 7.625% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the subsidiaries that
guarantee the Company's indebtedness under the Amended Credit Facility, the Convertible Notes
and the 7.0% Senior Notes. The 7.625% Senior Notes include certain
14
Table of Contents
covenants that limit the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted
payments, create liens or sell assets and that generally prohibit the Company from paying
dividends. The Company is currently in compliance with all financial covenants and has complied
with all financial covenants since issuance.
7.0% Senior Notes Due 2022
On March 12, 2012, the Company issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.0%
Senior Notes due 2022 at par. The 7.0% Senior Notes mature on October 15, 2022. Interest is
payable in arrears semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 7.0% Senior Notes
are senior unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company's other
existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes and 7.625%
Senior Notes. The 7.0% Senior Notes are redeemable at the Company's option beginning on
October 15, 2017 at an initial redemption price of 103.5% of the principal amount of the notes. The
7.0% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the subsidiaries that guarantee the
Company's indebtedness under the Amended Credit Facility, the Convertible Notes and the 7.625%
Senior Notes. The 7.0% Senior Notes include certain covenants that limit the Company's ability to
incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, create liens or sell assets and that
generally prohibit the Company from paying dividends. The Company is currently in compliance
with all financial covenants and has complied with all financial covenants since issuance.
Lease Financing Obligation Due 2020
The Company has a lease financing obligation with a balance of $3.0 million as of June 30, 2016
resulting from the Company's sale and subsequent lease back of certain compressors and related
facilities owned by the Company (the "Lease Financing Obligation"). The Lease Financing
Obligation expires on August 10, 2020, and the Company has the option to purchase the equipment
at the end of the lease term for the then current fair market value. The Lease Financing Obligation
also contains an early buyout option pursuant to which the Company may purchase the equipment
for $1.8 million on February 10, 2019. The lease payments related to the equipment are recognized
as principal and interest expense based on a weighted average implicit interest rate of 3.3%. See
Note 13 for a discussion of aggregate minimum future lease payments.
The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, the cash or accrued portion of interest
expense related to the Amended Credit Facility, the outstanding Convertible Notes, the 7.625%
Senior Notes, the 7.0% Senior Notes and the Lease Financing Obligation along with the non-cash
portion resulting from the amortization of the debt discount and transaction costs through interest

The stated interest rate for the Convertible Notes is 5% per annum. The effective interest rate of
the Convertible Notes includes amortization of the debt discount, which represented the fair
value of the equity conversion feature at the time of issue. The stated interest rate of 5% on the
Convertible Notes will be the effective interest rate of the $0.6 million remaining principal
balance, as the related debt discount was fully amortized as of March 31, 2012.
The stated interest rate for the 7.625% Senior Notes is 7.625% per annum with an effective

7. Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The
Company uses market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability, including assumptions about risk. These inputs can be readily observable, market
corroborated or generally unobservable. A fair value hierarchy was established that prioritizes the
inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
Level 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the
reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Level 2 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and in non-
active markets for identical or similar instruments. Model-derived valuations have inputs that are
observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. These models are primarily industry-
standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for
commodities, time value, volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the
underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these
assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be
derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are
executed in the marketplace.
Level 3 – Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable than objective
sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in
management's best estimate of fair value. At each balance sheet date, the Company performs an
analysis of all applicable instruments and includes in Level 3 all of those whose fair value is based
on significant unobservable inputs.
The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the Company's assets and
liabilities that were measured at fair value in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(1)This represents a financial asset or liability that is measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
(2)
This represents a non-financial asset or liability that is measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis.
Cash equivalents – The highly liquid cash equivalents are recorded at carrying value. Carrying
value approximates fair value, which represents a Level 1 input.
Deferred compensation plan – The Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation
plan which allows certain management employees to defer receipt of a portion of their
compensation. The Company maintains assets for the deferred compensation plan in a rabbi trust.
The assets of the rabbi trust are invested in publicly traded mutual funds and are recorded in other
current and other long-term assets in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred
compensation plan financial assets are reported at fair value based on active market quotes, which
represent Level 1 inputs.
Commodity derivatives – The fair value of crude oil, natural gas and NGL forwards and options are
estimated using a combined income and market valuation methodology with a mid-market pricing
convention based upon forward commodity price and volatility curves. The curves are obtained from
independent pricing services reflecting broker market quotes. The Company did not make any
adjustments to the obtained curves. The pricing services publish observable market information
from multiple brokers and exchanges. No proprietary models are used by the pricing services for the
inputs. The Company utilized the counterparties' valuations to assess the reasonableness of the
Company's valuations.
The commodity derivatives have been adjusted for non-performance risk. For applicable financial
assets carried at fair value, the credit standing of the counterparties is analyzed and factored into
the fair value measurement of those assets. In addition, the fair value measurement of a liability has
been adjusted to reflect the nonperformance risk of the Company. The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities in the table above.
Oil and gas properties – Oil and gas property costs are evaluated for impairment and reduced to fair
value when there is an indication that the carrying costs may not be recoverable. If an impairment is
necessary, the fair value is estimated by using either a market approach based on recent sales
prices of comparable properties and/or indications from marketing activities or by using the income
valuation technique, which involves calculating the present value of future revenues. The present
value, net of estimated operating and development costs, is calculated using estimates of reserves,
future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various
discount rates commensurate with the risk and current

market conditions associated with realizing the projected cash flows, predominantly all of which are
designated as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. During the year ended December 31,
2015, the Company reduced its Uinta Oil Program assets to a fair value of $183.8 million, resulting
in a non-cash impairment charge of $572.4 million.
Properties classified as held for sale are valued using a market approach, based on an estimated
selling price, as evidenced by current marketing activities, if possible. If an estimated selling price is
not available, the Company utilizes the income valuation technique discussed above. The fair value
of net assets classified as held for sale was $28.9 million as of June 30, 2016. See Note 4 for
additional information on assets held for sale.
Long-term Debt – Long-term debt is not presented at fair value on the Unaudited Consolidated
Balance Sheets, as it is recorded at carrying value, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. The fair
values of the Company's fixed rate 7.625% Senior Notes and 7.0% Senior Notes totaled $538.1
million as of June 30, 2016. The fair values of the Company's fixed rate 7.625% Senior Notes and
7.0% Senior Notes totaled $542.2 million as of December 31, 2015. The fair values of the
Company's fixed rate Senior Notes are based on active market quotes, which represent Level 1
inputs.
The Company estimated the fair value of the Debt Exchange based on the fair value of the
Company's common stock. The fair value of the common stock is based on active market quotes,
which represent Level 1 inputs. The Company recognized an $8.7 million gain on extinguishment of
debt on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 as a result of the Debt Exchange. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the Debt
Exchange.
There is no active, public market for the Amended Credit Facility, Convertible Notes or Lease
Financing Obligation. The recorded value of the Amended Credit Facility approximates its fair value
due to its floating rate structure based on the LIBOR spread and the Company's borrowing base
utilization. The Amended Credit Facility had a balance of zero as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. The Convertible Notes had a fair value of $0.5 million as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. The fair value of the Convertible Notes is measured based on market-based
parameters of the various components of the Convertible Notes and over the counter trades. The
Lease Financing Obligation fair values of $3.0 million and $3.1 million as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, are measured based on market-based parameters of comparable
term secured financing instruments. The fair value measurements for the Amended Credit Facility,
Convertible Notes and Lease Financing Obligation represent Level 2 inputs.
8. Derivative Instruments
The Company uses financial derivative instruments as part of its price risk management program to
achieve a more predictable cash flow from its production revenues by reducing its exposure to
commodity price fluctuations. The Company has entered into financial commodity swap contracts
related to the sale of a portion of the Company's production. The Company does not enter into
derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
In addition to financial contracts, the Company may at times be party to various physical commodity
contracts for the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs that have varying terms and pricing provisions.
These physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale exception
and, therefore, are not subject to hedge or mark-to-market accounting. The financial impact of
physical commodity contracts is included in oil, natural gas and NGL production revenues at the
time of settlement.
All derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchase and normal sale
exception as mentioned above, are recorded at fair value and included in the Unaudited
Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities. The following table summarizes the location,
as well as the gross and net fair value amounts of all derivative instruments presented in the
Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated.

The Company's derivative financial instruments are generally executed with major financial or
commodities trading institutions. The instruments expose the Company to market and credit risks
and may, at times, be concentrated with certain counterparties or groups of counterparties. The
Company had derivatives in place with eight different counterparties as of June 30, 2016. Although
notional amounts are used to express the volume of these contracts, the amounts potentially subject
to credit risk, in the event of non-performance by the counterparties, are substantially smaller. The
creditworthiness of counterparties is subject to continual review by management, and the Company
believes all of these institutions currently are acceptable credit risks. Full performance is
anticipated, and the Company has no past due receivables from any of these counterparties.
It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that are lenders in the
Amended Credit Facility or affiliates of lenders in the Amended Credit Facility. The Company's
derivative contracts are documented using an industry standard contract known as a Schedule to
the Master Agreement and International Swaps and Derivative Association, Inc. ("ISDA") Master
Agreement or other contracts. Typical terms for these contracts include credit support requirements,
cross default provisions, termination events and set-off provisions. The Company is not required to
provide any credit support to its counterparties other than cross collateralization with the properties
securing the Amended Credit Facility. The Company has set-off provisions in its derivative contracts
with lenders under its Amended Credit Facility which, in the event of a counterparty default, allow
the Company to set-off amounts owed to the defaulting counterparty under the Amended Credit
19
Table of Contents
Facility or other obligations against monies owed to the Company under the derivative contracts.
Where the counterparty is not a lender under the Company's Amended Credit Facility, it may not be
able to set-off amounts owed by the Company under the Amended Credit Facility, even if such
counterparty is an affiliate of a lender under such facility. The Company does not have any
derivative balances that are offset by cash collateral.
9. Income Taxes
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes for tax positions taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return in accordance with the FASB’s rules on income taxes. The Company
recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. During the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, the Company had no uncertain tax positions.
The Company’s policy is to classify accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax
benefits in the Company’s income tax provision. The Company did not record any accrued interest
or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Income tax benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 differs from the
amounts that would be provided by applying the U.S. statutory income tax rates to pretax income or
loss principally due to the effect of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, stock based
compensation, political lobbying expense, political contributions, nondeductible officer
compensation and state income taxes. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the
effective tax rate remains at zero as a result of recording a full valuation allowance against our
deferred tax asset balance. The Company considers all available evidence (both positive and
negative) to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of
the existing deferred tax assets. Such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax
liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment,
and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence. The
Company continues to monitor facts and circumstances in the reassessment of the likelihood that
operating loss carryforwards, credits and other deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their
expiration.
10. Stockholders' Equity
On June 3, 2016, the Company issued 10 million shares of common stock pursuant to a debt
exchange with a holder of the Company's 7.625% Senior Notes. The holder exchanged $84.7
million principal amount of the 7.625% Senior Notes for 10 million newly issued shares of the
Company’s common stock.
11. Equity Incentive Compensation Plans and Other Long-term Incentive Programs
The Company maintains various stock-based compensation plans and other employee benefits as
discussed below. Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of
the awards, and the fair value is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period
(usually the vesting period). Cash-based compensation is measured at fair value at each reporting
date and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (usually the vesting
period).
The following table presents the long-term cash and equity incentive compensation related to
awards for the periods indicated:

2016 Program. In March 2016, the Compensation Committee approved a performance cash
program (the "2016 Program") granting performance cash units that will settle in cash. The
performance-based awards contingently vest in February 2019, depending on the level at which the
performance goal is achieved. The performance goal, which will be measured over the three year
period ending December 31, 2018, will be the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") based on
a matrix measurement of the Company's absolute performance and ranking relative to a defined
peer group's individual TSRs ("Relative TSR"). The Company's absolute performance is measured
against the December 31, 2015 closing share price of $3.93 and if the Company's absolute
performance is lower than the $3.93 share price, the payout is zero. If the Company's absolute
performance is greater than the $3.93 share price, then the performance cash units will vest
depending on the compound annual growth rate of the Company's absolute performance and the
Relative TSR up to 200% of the original grant.
12. Equity Distribution Agreement
On June 10, 2015, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the "Agreement")
with Goldman, Sachs and Co. (the "Manager"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the
Company may sell, from time to time through or to the Manager, shares of its common stock having
an aggregate gross sales price of up to $100.0 million. Sales of the shares, if any, will be made by
means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange, at
market prices, in block transactions, to or through a market maker, through an electronic
communications network or as otherwise agreed by the Company and the Manager. As of June 30,
2016, no shares have been sold pursuant to the Agreement.

Transportation Charges. The Company is party to two firm transportation contracts to provide
capacity on natural gas pipeline systems. The remaining term on these contracts is five years. The
contracts require the Company to pay transportation charges regardless of the amount of pipeline
capacity utilized by the Company. These monthly transportation payments are included in unused
commitments expense in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of
previous divestitures in 2013 and 2014, the Company will likely not utilize the firm capacity on the
natural gas pipelines.

Litigation. The Company is subject to litigation, claims and governmental and regulatory
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of the Company's
management that current claims and litigation involving the Company are not likely to have a
material adverse effect on its Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet, Cash Flows or Statements of
Operations.
14. Guarantor Subsidiaries
In addition to the Amended Credit Facility, the 7.625% Senior Notes, 7.0% Senior Notes and

statements include statements as to future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance of
Bill Barrett Corporation (the "Company", "we", "us" or "our"). Forward-looking statements are
dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results
could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating
to:
•
•
•
potential failure to achieve expected production from existing and future exploration or
development projects or acquisitions;
volatility of market prices received for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids ("NGLs"), and the risk
of a prolonged period of depressed prices;
reduction of proved undeveloped reserves due to failure to develop within the five year
development window defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission;
•derivative and hedging activities;
legislative, judicial or regulatory changes including initiatives to impose standard setbacks from
occupied structures and other sensitive areas, initiatives to give local governmental authorities the
ability to regulate or to ban oil and gas development activities within their boundaries, and
initiatives related to drilling and completion techniques such as hydraulic fracturing;

Overview
We develop oil and natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. We seek to build
stockholder value by delivering profitable growth in cash flow, reserves and production through the
development of oil and natural gas assets. In order to deliver profitable growth, we allocate capital
to our highest return assets, concentrate expenditures on exploiting our
28
Table of Contents
core assets, maintain capital discipline and optimize operations while upholding high-level
standards for health, safety and the environment. Substantially all of our revenues are generated
through the sale of oil and natural gas production and NGL recovery at market prices.
We were formed in January 2002 and are incorporated in the State of Delaware. In December 2004,
we completed our initial public offering of 14,950,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the
public of $25.00 per share.
Oil prices declined severely beginning in 2014, and price decreases continued through 2015 and
into 2016. Natural gas and NGL prices have experienced decreases of comparable magnitude over
the same period. These decreases have increased the volatility and amplitude of the other risks
facing us as described in this report and in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, have
impacted our average realized unit price and are having an impact on our business and financial
condition. Commodity prices are inherently volatile and are influenced by many factors outside of
our control. We endeavor to maintain flexibility in our activities and capital budgeting using what we
believe to be conservative sales price assumptions and our existing hedge position. If commodity
prices continue at current or lower levels, our capital availability, liquidity and profitability are likely
to be adversely affected as current hedges are realized in 2016 and 2017.
As we go through 2016, our priority remains ensuring ample liquidity and adjusting our
development plans as necessary to this end. Further, we continue to monitor debt, equity and
hedging markets for opportunities to strengthen our liquidity position. On April 11, 2016, the
borrowing base under our Amended Credit Facility was reduced to $335.0 million based on proved
reserves in place at December 31, 2015. Our re-determined borrowing base of $335.0 million is
reduced by $26.0 million to $309.0 million due to an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit related
to a firm transportation agreement.
We are committed to developing and producing oil and natural gas in a responsible and safe
manner. Our employees work diligently with regulatory agencies, as well as environmental, wildlife
and community organizations, to ensure that exploration and development activities meet
stakeholders' expectations and regulatory requirements.
Future acquisitions or dispositions could have a material impact on our financial condition and
results of operations by increasing or decreasing our reserves, production and revenues as well as
expenses and future capital expenditures. We currently anticipate that we would finance any future
acquisitions with available borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility, sales of properties, other
indebtedness, and/or debt, equity or equity-linked securities. Our prior acquisitions and capital
expenditures were financed with a combination of cash on hand, funding from the sale of our equity
securities, our Amended Credit Facility, other debt financing and cash flows from operations.
Because of our growth through acquisitions and, more recently, development of our properties and
sales of properties in 2015, our historical results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of
these results and certain financial data may not be meaningful. In addition, past results are not
indicative of future results.
Commodity prices are inherently volatile and are influenced by many factors outside of our control.
We currently have hedged 1,426,000 barrels of oil and 920,000 MMbtu of natural gas or
approximately 48% of our expected 2016 production and 1,410,250 barrels of oil and 1,825,000
MMbtu of natural gas for our 2017 production at price levels that provide some economic certainty to
our cash flows. We focus our efforts on increasing oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves and
production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long-term operations. Our future
earnings and cash flows are dependent on our ability to manage our revenues and overall cost
structure to a level that allows for profitable production.
We operate in one industry segment, which is the development and production of crude oil, natural
gas and NGLs, and all of our operations are conducted in the Rocky Mountain region of the United
States. Consequently, we currently report a single reportable segment.
On April 28, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of certain non-core
assets in the Uinta Basin. Total gross consideration, prior to customary closing adjustments, was
$33.7 million, including cash proceeds of $28.9 million and $4.8 million related to the relief of asset
retirement obligations. The transaction closed July 14, 2016. The related assets and liabilities were
classified as held for sale in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2016 and
June 30, 2016.

Included in general and administrative expense is long-term cash and equity incentive
compensation of $2.6 million (or $1.61 per Boe) and $2.8 million (or $1.70 per Boe) for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The DD&A rate per Boe excludes production of 114 MBoe associated with our properties that
were classified as held for sale in the Uinta Basin, as these were not depleted throughout the
quarter ended June 30, 2016.
Production Revenues and Volumes. Production revenues decreased to $47.0 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 from $61.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The
decrease in production revenues was primarily due to a 22% decrease in average realized prices
before hedging.

Lease Operating Expense ("LOE"). LOE decreased to $5.28 per Boe for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 from $7.01 per Boe for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease per
Boe for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended June 30,
2015 is primarily related to operational efficiencies, a decrease in service industry costs, reduced
workover activity in the Uinta Basin, our decision to shut-in certain Uinta Basin wells due to the
current low commodity price environment and non-core asset sales in the DJ Basin.
Production Tax Expense. Total production taxes decreased to $3.5 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 from $3.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Production taxes
are primarily based on the wellhead values of production, which exclude gains and losses
associated with hedging activities. Production taxes as a percentage of oil, natural gas and NGL
sales before hedging adjustments were 7.5% and 6.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2016
and June 30, 2015, respectively.
Production tax rates vary across the different areas in which we operate. As the proportion of our
production changes from area to area, our average production tax rate will vary depending on the
quantities produced from each area and the production tax rates in effect for those areas.
Impairment, Dry Hole Costs and Abandonment Expense. Our impairment, dry hole costs and
abandonment expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below:

Non-cash impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties for the three months ended
June 30, 2015 related to our remaining Powder River Basin properties based upon a true up of
previously estimated fair value relative to carrying value. These assets were classified as held for
sale as of December 31, 2014 and sold in February 2015.
We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis or
whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying
value may have occurred. We estimate the expected future cash flows of our oil and gas properties
and compare these undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas
properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural
gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to,
recent sales prices of comparable properties, indications from marketing activities, the present value
of future revenues, net of estimated operating and development costs using
31
Table of Contents
estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital
expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions
associated with realizing the projected cash flows.
Oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment once they meet the criteria to be classified as
held for sale. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying cost or fair value less costs to
sell. The fair value of the assets is determined using a market approach, based on an estimated
selling price, as evidenced by current marketing activities, if possible. If an estimated selling price is
not available, we utilize the income valuation technique, which involves calculating the present
value of future revenues, as discussed above. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair
value less costs to sell, an impairment will result to reduce the value of the properties down to fair
value less costs to sell.
Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on a property-by-property
basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price
outlooks, future plans to develop acreage, recent sales prices of comparable properties and other
relevant matters. We generally expect impairments of unproved properties to be more likely to occur
in periods of low commodity prices because we will be less likely to devote capital to exploration
activities.
Given the decline in current and projected future commodity prices, we will continue to review our
acreage position and future drilling plans. In addition, we will assess the carrying value of our
properties relative to their estimated future net cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows from our
properties are based on our aggregate best estimates of future production, commodity pricing,
gathering and transportation deducts, production tax rates, lease operating expenses and future
development costs as of the balance sheet date.
Our current recoverability test on our existing proved oil and gas properties as of June 30, 2016
uses commodity pricing based on a combination of assumptions, which are closely aligned with the
assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process adjusted for geographical
location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact
realized prices. The application of this test as of June 30, 2016 results in a surplus of future
estimated net cash flows over carrying value of approximately $400.6 million and $95.4 million for
the Uinta Oil Program and DJ Basin, respectively. We estimate that the surplus in the Uinta Oil
program would decrease by approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million and the DJ Basin would
decrease by approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million for every $1.00 decrease in the oil price
assumptions used in the recoverability test. If impairment is necessary, we would reduce the
carrying value to fair value. If future commodity prices assumed in the recoverability test are not
realized, it is likely that we will incur a significant impairment.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization ("DD&A"). DD&A decreased to $40.4 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 compared with $52.7 million for the three months ended June 30,
2015. The decrease of $12.3 million was primarily due to a 16% decrease in the DD&A rate for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Under successful efforts accounting, depletion expense is calculated on a field-by-field basis based
on geologic and reservoir delineation using the unit-of-production method. The capital expenditures
for proved properties for each field compared to the proved reserves corresponding to each
producing field determine a depletion rate for current production. For the three months ended
June 30, 2016, the relationship of capital expenditures, proved reserves and production from certain
producing fields yielded a depletion rate of $27.05 per Boe compared with $32.36 per Boe for the
three months ended June 30, 2015.
Unused Commitments. During March 2010, we entered into two firm natural gas pipeline
transportation contracts to provide a guaranteed outlet for production from the West Tavaputs area
of the Uinta Basin and the Gibson Gulch area of the Piceance Basin. These transportation contracts
were not included in the sales of these assets in December 2013 and September 2014,
respectively. Both firm transportation contracts require the pipeline to provide transportation
capacity and require us to pay transportation charges regardless of the amount of pipeline capacity
utilized and expire July 31, 2021. Unused commitments expense for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 consisted of $4.6 million and $4.4 million related to these
contracts, respectively.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense decreased to $9.9
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $14.7 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in employee compensation and benefits.

Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $15.4 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 from $17.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to recognizing
additional interest expense associated with amending the credit facility during the three months
ended June 30, 2015.
Interest expense will decrease in future periods due to the Debt Exchange completed on June 3,
2016 (see Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements), which reduced the principal of our
7.625% Senior Notes by $84.7 million.
Commodity Derivative Gain (Loss). Commodity derivative gain (loss) was a loss of $22.0 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared with a loss of $27.7 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. The gain or loss on commodity derivatives is related to fluctuations of oil and
natural gas future pricing compared to actual pricing of commodity hedges in place as of June 30,
2016 and 2015 or during the periods then ended.

Realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives are presented herein as
separate line items but are combined for a total commodity derivative gain (loss) in the Unaudited
Consolidated Statements of Operations. This separate presentation is a non-GAAP measure.
Management believes the separate presentation of the realized and unrealized commodity
derivative gains and losses is useful because the realized cash settlement portion provides a
better understanding of our hedge position. We also believe that this disclosure allows for a more
accurate comparison to our peers.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, approximately 65% of our oil volumes and 22% of
our natural gas volumes were subject to financial hedges, which resulted in an increase in oil
income of $23.9 million and natural gas income of $1.1 million after settlements for all commodity
derivatives.
During the three months ended June 30, 2015, approximately 92% of our oil volumes and 96% of
our natural gas volumes were subject to financial hedges, which resulted in an increase in oil
income of $33.3 million and natural gas income of $3.2 million after settlements for all commodity
derivatives.
Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded an
additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset balance which reduced our effective
tax rate to zero. The income tax benefit of $26.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015
resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.7%. In regard to the valuation allowance recorded against our
deferred tax asset balance we considered all available evidence in assessing the need for a
valuation allowance. Such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment, and
judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive
33

evidence. We continue to monitor facts and circumstances in the reassessment of the likelihood that
operating loss carryforwards, credits and other deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their
expiration. Additionally, for both the 2016 and 2015 periods, our effective tax rate differs from the
federal statutory rate primarily as a result of recording permanent differences for stock-based
compensation expense, lobbying and political contributions, and officer compensation as well as
the effect of state income taxes.

The DD&A rate per Boe excludes production of 114 MBoe associated with our properties that
were classified as held for sale in the Uinta Basin, as these were not depleted throughout the
quarter ended June 30, 2016.
Production Revenues and Volumes. Production revenues decreased to $76.1 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 from $109.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The
decrease in production revenues was due to a 25% decrease in average realized prices before
hedging and a 7% decrease in production volumes. The decrease in average realized prices before
hedging decreased production revenues by approximately $27.8 million, while the decrease in
production volumes reduced production revenues by approximately $6.0 million.
Total production volumes of 3.0 MMBoe for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased from 3.2
MMBoe for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily related to a 39%
decrease in production from the Uinta Oil Program due to natural production declines with no
significant drilling or recompletion activities to offset these declines and our decision to shut-in
certain Uinta Basin wells due to the current low commodity price environment. In addition, the
increase in the DJ Basin production was offset by non-core asset sales completed during the year
ended December 31, 2015. Additional information concerning production is in the following table:

Lease Operating Expense. LOE decreased to $5.82 per Boe for the six months ended June 30,
2016 from $7.85 per Boe for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease per Boe for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared with the six months ended June 30, 2015 is primarily
related to operational efficiencies, a decrease in service industry costs, reduced workover activity in
the Uinta Basin, our decision to shut-in certain Uinta Basin wells due to the current low commodity
price environment and non-core asset sales in the DJ Basin.
Production Tax Expense. Total production taxes decreased to $3.2 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 from $6.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The overall decrease in
production tax expense is related to the annual true-up of Colorado ad valorem tax based on actual
assessments and a true-up of the Colorado severance tax based on the annual severance tax
calculation. In addition, production tax expense decreased due to a 25% decrease in average
realized prices before hedging. Production taxes are primarily based on the wellhead values of
production, which exclude gains and losses associated with hedging activities.
Production tax rates vary across the different areas in which we operate. As the proportion of our
production changes from area to area, our average production tax rate will vary depending on the
quantities produced from each area and the production tax rates in effect for those areas.
Impairment, Dry Hole Costs and Abandonment Expense. Our impairment, dry hole costs and
abandonment expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below:

Non-cash impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties for the six months ended
June 30, 2015 related to our remaining Powder River Basin properties based upon a true up of
previously estimated fair value relative to carrying value. These assets were classified as held for
sale as of December 31, 2014 and sold in February 2015.
We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis or
whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying
value may have occurred. We estimate the expected future cash flows of our oil and gas properties
and compare these undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas
properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural
gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to,
recent sales prices of comparable properties, indications from marketing activities, the present value
of future revenues, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves,
future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various
discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing
the projected cash flows.
Oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment once they meet the criteria to be classified as
held for sale. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying cost or fair value less costs to
sell. The fair value of the assets is determined using a market approach, based on an estimated
selling price, as evidenced by current marketing activities, if possible. If an estimated selling price is
not available, we utilize the income valuation technique, which involves calculating the present
value of future revenues, as discussed above. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair
value less costs to sell, an impairment will result to reduce the value of the properties down to fair
value less costs to sell.
Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on a property-by-property
basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price
outlooks, future plans to develop acreage, recent sales prices of comparable properties and other
relevant matters. We generally expect impairments of unproved properties to be more likely to occur
in periods of low commodity prices because we will be less likely to devote capital to exploration
activities.
Given the decline in current and projected future commodity prices, we will continue to review our
acreage position and future drilling plans. In addition, we will assess the carrying value of our
properties relative to their estimated future net cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows from our
properties are based on our aggregate best estimates of future production, commodity pricing,
gathering and transportation deducts, production tax rates, lease operating expenses and future
development costs as of the balance sheet date.
Our current recoverability test on our existing proved oil and gas properties as of June 30, 2016
uses commodity pricing based on a combination of assumptions, which are closely aligned with the
assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process adjusted for geographical
location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact
realized prices. The application of this test as of June 30, 2016 results in a surplus of future
estimated net cash flows over carrying value of approximately $400.6 million and $95.4 million for
the Uinta Oil Program and DJ Basin, respectively. We estimate that the surplus in the Uinta Oil
program would decrease by approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million and the DJ Basin would
decrease by approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million for every $1.00 decrease in the oil price
assumptions used in the recoverability test. If impairment is necessary, we would reduce the
carrying value to fair value. If future commodity prices assumed in the recoverability test are not
realized, it is likely that we will incur a significant impairment.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. DD&A decreased to $82.4 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared with $104.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The
decrease of $22.5 million was a result of the 7% decrease in production for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared with the six months ended June 30, 2015 and a decrease in the DD&A
rate. The decrease in the DD&A rate accounted for a $14.8 million decrease in DD&A expense,
while the decrease in production accounted for a $7.7 million decrease in DD&A expense.
Under successful efforts accounting, depletion expense is calculated on a field-by-field basis based
on geologic and reservoir delineation using the unit-of-production method. The capital expenditures
for proved properties for each field compared to the proved reserves corresponding to each
producing field determine a depletion rate for current production. For the six months ended June 30,
2016, the relationship of capital expenditures, proved reserves and production from certain
producing fields yielded a depletion rate of $28.81 per Boe compared with $32.70 per Boe for the
six months ended June 30, 2015.

Unused Commitments. During March 2010, we entered into two firm natural gas pipeline
transportation contracts to provide a guaranteed outlet for production from the West Tavaputs area
of the Uinta Basin and the Gibson Gulch area of the Piceance Basin. These transportation contracts
were not included in the sales of these assets in December 2013 and September 2014,
respectively. Both firm transportation contracts require the pipeline to provide transportation
capacity and require us to pay monthly transportation charges of $1.5 million regardless of the
amount of pipeline capacity utilized and expire July 31, 2021. Unused commitments expense for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 consisted of $9.1 million and $8.8 million
related to these contracts, respectively.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense decreased to $22.4
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $28.0 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015 primarily due to a reduction of employee related costs and benefits.
Included in general and administrative expense is long-term cash and equity incentive
compensation of $6.5 million and $5.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The components of long-term cash and equity incentive compensation for the six

Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $31.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 from $33.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to recognizing
additional interest expense associated with amending the credit facility during the six months ended

Commodity Derivative Gain (Loss). Commodity derivative gain (loss) was a loss of $13.3 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with a gain of $6.8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. The gain or loss on commodity derivatives is related to fluctuations of oil and natural

understanding of our hedge position. We also believe that this disclosure allows for a more accurate
comparison to our peers.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, approximately 70% of our oil volumes and 24% of our
natural gas volumes were subject to financial hedges, which resulted in increased oil income of
$55.9 million and natural gas income of $2.1 million after settlements for all commodity derivatives.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, approximately 91% of our oil volumes and 94% of our
natural gas volumes were subject to financial hedges, which resulted in increased oil income of
$77.4 million and natural gas income of $5.5 million after settlements for all commodity derivatives.
Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded an additional
valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset balance which reduced our effective tax rate to
zero. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the income tax benefit was $33.8 million resulting in
an effective tax rate of 37.5%. In regard to the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax
asset balance, we considered all available evidence in assessing the need for a valuation
allowance. Such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected
future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment, and judgment is
required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence. We continue to
monitor facts and circumstances in the reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss
carryforwards, credits and other deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their expiration.
Additionally, for both the 2016 and 2015 periods, our effective tax rate differs from the federal
statutory rate primarily as a result of recording permanent differences for stock-based compensation
expense, lobbying and political contributions, and officer compensation as well as the effect of state
income taxes.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity since our formation in January 2002 have been net cash provided
by operating activities, sales and other issuances of equity and debt securities, notes and senior
notes, bank credit facilities, proceeds from sale-leasebacks, joint exploration agreements and sales
of interests in properties. Our primary use of capital has been for the development, exploration and
acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. As we pursue profitable reserves and production
growth, we continually monitor the capital resources, including potential issuances of equity and
debt securities, available to us to meet our future financial obligations, fund planned capital
expenditure activities and ensure adequate liquidity. Our future success in growing proved reserves
and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available to us and our success in
finding or acquiring additional reserves. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity available to us
from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and under our Amended Credit Facility for our
planned uses of capital for the remainder of 2016. However, we expect to pursue opportunities to
further improve our liquidity position through capital markets or other transactions, such as
additional property dispositions, if we believe conditions to be favorable.
At June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $87.4 million and no amounts outstanding
under our Amended Credit Facility. At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of
$128.8 million and no amounts outstanding under our Amended Credit Facility. Our borrowing base
was $335.0 million as of June 30, 2016. Our effective borrowing capacity as of that date was
reduced by $26.0 million to $309.0 million due to an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit related
to a firm transportation agreement. The borrowing base is dependent on our proved reserves and
hedge position and is calculated using future commodity pricing provided by our lenders, and may
be adjusted in the future at the sole discretion of the lenders. The borrowing base will not be
impacted by the sale of certain non-core assets in the Uinta Basin described in Note 4 and Note 15.
Cash Flow from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was
$48.8 million and $91.1 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating
activities was primarily due to a decrease in production revenues and cash from derivative
settlements.
Commodity Hedging Activities
Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which are the prices
we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce. Prices for these commodities are
determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. National and worldwide economic activity and
political stability, weather, infrastructure capacity to reach markets, supply levels and other variable
factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are
difficult to predict.
38
Table of Contents
To mitigate some of the potential negative impact on cash flow caused by changes in oil, natural
gas and NGL prices, we have entered into financial commodity swap contracts to receive fixed
prices for a portion of our production revenues. At June 30, 2016, we had in place crude oil and
natural gas swaps covering portions of our 2016 and 2017 production.
In addition to financial contracts, we may at times enter into various physical commodity contracts
for the sale of oil and natural gas that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing
provisions. These physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales
exception and, therefore, are not subject to hedge or mark-to-market accounting. The financial
impact of physical commodity contracts is included in oil, gas and NGL production revenues at the
time of settlement.
All derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchase and normal sales
exception as mentioned above, are recorded at fair market value and are included in the Unaudited
Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities. All fair values are adjusted for non-
performance risk. All changes in the derivative's fair value are recorded in earnings. These mark-to-
market adjustments produce a degree of earnings volatility but have no cash flow impact relative to
changes in market prices. Our cash flow is only impacted when the associated derivative instrument
contract is settled by making a payment to or receiving a payment from the counterparty.
At June 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of all of our commodity derivative instruments,
summarized in the following table, was a net asset of $48.2 million, comprised of current and
noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities.

By removing the price volatility from a portion of our oil, natural gas and NGL related revenue, we
have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing prices on our operating cash
flow for those periods. While mitigating negative effects of falling commodity prices, these derivative
contracts also limit the benefits we would receive from increases in commodity prices.
It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that are lenders in the Amended
Credit Facility or affiliates of lenders in the Amended Credit Facility. Our derivative contracts are
documented using an industry standard contract known as a Schedule to the Master Agreement
and International Swaps and Derivative Association, Inc. ("ISDA") Master Agreement or other
contracts. Typical terms for these contracts include credit support requirements, cross default
provisions, termination events and set-off provisions. We are not required to provide any credit
support to our counterparties other than cross collateralization with the properties securing the
Amended Credit Facility. We have set-off provisions in our derivative contracts with lenders under
our Amended Credit Facility which, in the event of a counterparty default, allow us to set-off
amounts owed to the defaulting counterparty under the Amended Credit Facility or other obligations
against monies

owed to us under the derivative contracts. Where the counterparty is not a lender under the
Amended Credit Facility, we may not be able to set-off amounts owed by us under the Amended
Credit Facility, even if such counterparty is an affiliate of a lender under such facility.

Our current estimated capital expenditure budget in 2016 is between $75.0 million and $100.0
million, with all drilling activities targeting oil. The low end of the estimated capital expenditure
budget of $75.0 million assumes that we will not drill additional wells in 2016. The budget includes
facilities costs and excludes acquisitions. We may adjust capital expenditures throughout the year
as business conditions and operating results warrant. The amount, timing and allocation of capital
expenditures is generally discretionary and within our control. If oil, natural gas and NGL prices
decline below acceptable levels or costs increase above acceptable levels, we could choose to
defer a portion of our budgeted capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired
balance between sources and uses of liquidity. We would generally do this by prioritizing capital
projects to first focus on those that we believe will have the highest expected financial returns and
ability to generate near-term cash flow. The 2016 capital program is designed to closely align
capital expenditures with expected cash flows as certain drilling activity may be deferred to protect
our liquidity position.
We believe that we have sufficient available liquidity with available cash on hand, cash under the
Amended Credit Facility and cash flow from operations to fund our 2016 budgeted capital
expenditures. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including our level of oil and
natural gas production, commodity prices and operating costs. There can be no assurance that
operations and other capital resources will provide sufficient amounts of cash flow to maintain
planned levels of capital expenditures.
Financing Activities
Amended Credit Facility
The Amended Credit Facility had commitments and a borrowing base of $335.0 million from 13
lenders as of June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under the
Amended Credit Facility. As credit support for future payment under a contractual obligation, a
$26.0 million letter of credit has been issued under the Amended Credit Facility, which reduced the
available borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Facility as of June 30, 2016 to $309.0
million. The borrowing base will not be impacted by the sale of certain non-core assets in the Uinta
Basin described in Note 4 and Note 15.
40
Table of Contents
Interest rates are LIBOR plus applicable margins of 1.5% to 2.5% or ABR plus 0.5% to 1.5% and the
unused commitment fee is between 0.375% to 0.5% based on borrowing base utilization. There
have not been any borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility in 2016.
The borrowing base under the Amended Credit Facility is determined at the discretion of the
lenders, based on the collateral value of our proved reserves that have been mortgaged to such
lenders, and is subject to regular re-determinations on or about April 1 and October 1 of each year,
as well as following any property sales. On April 11, 2016, the borrowing base was reduced from
$375.0 million to $335.0 million based on proved reserves in place at December 31, 2015. Future
borrowing bases will be computed based on proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, hedge
positions and estimated future cash flows from those reserves calculated using future commodity
pricing provided by our lenders, as well as any other outstanding debt. Lower commodity prices will
impact the amount lenders will provide for a borrowing base.
The Amended Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants. We are currently in
compliance with all financial covenants and have complied with all financial covenants since
issuance. We expect to be in compliance with all financial covenants based on the 2016 budget.
However, if commodity prices continue at current levels or lower, EBITDAX will be significantly
reduced, which is a critical underpinning of our required financial covenants. If this were to occur,
it will make it necessary for us to negotiate an amendment to one or more of these financial
covenants.
If we fail to comply with the covenants or other terms of any agreements governing our debt, our
lenders and holders of our convertible notes and our senior notes may have the right to accelerate
the maturity of that debt and foreclose upon the collateral, if any, securing that debt. The occurrence
of any such event would adversely affect our financial condition. In September 2015, we obtained
an amendment to the Amended Credit Facility that replaced our debt-to-EBITDAX covenant in the
facility with a secured debt-to-EBITDAX covenant and an EBITDAX-to-interest covenant through
March 31, 2018. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain similar amendments, or
waivers of covenant breaches, in the future if needed.
5% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2028
On March 12, 2008, we issued $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes. On
March 20, 2012, $147.2 million of the outstanding principal amount, or approximately 85% of the
outstanding Convertible Notes, were put to us and redeemed by us at par. On March 20, 2015,
$24.8 million of the remaining outstanding principal amount, or approximately 98% of the remaining
outstanding Convertible Notes, were put to us and redeemed by us at par. After the redemption,
$0.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes were outstanding as of June 30,
2016. The Convertible Notes mature on March 15, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or
purchased by us. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of
payment to all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, are senior in right of
payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness, and are effectively subordinated to all of our
secured indebtedness with respect to the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Convertible
Notes are structurally subordinated to all present and future secured and unsecured debt and other
obligations of our subsidiaries. The Convertible Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
the subsidiaries that guarantee our indebtedness under the Amended Credit Facility, the 7.625%
Senior Notes and the 7.0% Senior Notes.
The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on
March 15 and September 15 of each year. Holders of the remaining Convertible Notes may require
us to purchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes for cash on each of March 20, 2018 and
March 20, 2023 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes
to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the applicable
purchase date. We have the right with at least 30 days' notice to call the Convertible Notes.
7.625% Senior Notes Due 2019
On September 27, 2011, we issued $400.0 million in principal amount of 7.625% Senior Notes due
2019 at par. On June 3, 2016, we completed the Debt Exchange, pursuant to which a holder of the
7.625% Senior Notes exchanged $84.7 million principal amount of the 7.625% Senior Notes for 10
million newly issued shares of our common stock. Based on the fair value of the shares issued, we
recognized an $8.7 million gain on extinguishment of debt on the Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
The 7.625% Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2019. Interest is payable in arrears semi-annually
on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 7.625% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations
and rank equal in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured
indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes and 7.0% Senior Notes. The 7.625% Senior Notes
are currently redeemable at our option at a specified redemption price. The 7.625% Senior Notes
are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our subsidiaries that guarantee our indebtedness under
the Amended Credit Facility, the

Table of Contents
Convertible Notes and the 7.0% Senior Notes. The 7.625% Senior Notes include certain covenants
that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, create liens or sell
assets and that generally prohibit us from paying dividends. We are currently in compliance with all
financial covenants and have complied with all financial covenants since issuance.
7.0% Senior Notes Due 2022
On March 12, 2012, we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.0% Senior Notes
due 2022 at par. The 7.0% Senior Notes mature on October 15, 2022. Interest is payable in arrears
semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 7.0% Senior Notes are senior
unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our other existing and future
senior unsecured indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes and 7.625% Senior Notes. The
7.0% Senior Notes are redeemable at our option beginning on October 15, 2017 at an initial
redemption price of 103.5% of the principal amount of the notes. The 7.0% Senior Notes are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by our subsidiaries that guarantee the Amended Credit Facility, the
Convertible Notes and the 7.625% Senior Notes. The 7.0% Senior Notes include certain covenants
that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, create liens or sell
assets and that generally prohibit us from paying dividends. We are currently in compliance with all
financial covenants and have complied with all financial covenants since issuance.
Lease Financing Obligation Due 2020
We have a Lease Financing Obligation with a balance of $3.0 million as of June 30, 2016 resulting
from our sale and subsequent lease back of certain compressors and related facilities owned by us.
The Lease Financing Obligation expires on August 10, 2020, and we have the option to purchase
the equipment at the end of the lease term for the then current fair market value. The Lease
Financing Obligation also contains an early buyout option pursuant to which we may purchase the
equipment for $1.8 million on February 10, 2019. The lease payments related to the equipment are
recognized as principal and interest expense based on a weighted average implicit interest rate of
3.3%. See Note 13 to the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of aggregate minimum future lease payments.

The aggregate estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes was approximately $0.5 million as of
both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 based on reported market trades of these
instruments.
We have the right at any time with at least 30 days' notice to call the Convertible Notes, and the
holders have the right to require us to purchase the notes on each of March 20, 2018 and
March 20, 2023.
The aggregate estimated fair value of the 7.625% Senior Notes was approximately $245.4
million and $270.2 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, based on
reported market trades of these instruments.
The aggregate estimated fair value of the 7.0% Senior Notes was approximately $292.7 million
and $272.0 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, based on reported
market trades of these instruments.
The aggregate estimated fair value of the Lease Financing Obligation was approximately $3.0
million and $3.1 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Because
there is no active, public market for the Lease Financing Obligation, the aggregate estimated fair
value was based on market-based parameters of comparable term secured financing
instruments.

Credit Ratings. Our credit risk is evaluated by two independent rating agencies based on publicly
available information and information obtained during our ongoing discussions with the rating
agencies. Moody's Investor Services and Standard & Poor's Rating Services currently rate our
7.625% Senior Notes and 7.0% Senior Notes and have assigned a credit rating. We do not have
any provisions that are linked to our credit ratings, nor do we have any credit rating triggers that
would accelerate the maturity of amounts due under our Amended Credit Facility, Convertible
Notes, 7.625% Senior Notes or 7.0% Senior Notes. However, our ability to raise funds and the costs
of any financing activities will be affected by our credit rating at the time any such financing activities
are conducted.

Included in notes payable is a $26.0 million letter of credit that accrues interest at 2.0% and
0.125% per annum for participation fees and fronting fees, respectively. The expected term of the
letter of credit is April 30, 2018. There is currently no balance outstanding under the Amended
Credit Facility.
On September 27, 2011, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Senior
Notes. On June 3, 2016, we completed the Debt Exchange, reducing our aggregate principal
balance to $315.3 million. We are obligated to make annual interest payments through maturity in
2019 equal to $24.0 million.
On March 25, 2012, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.0% Senior Notes.
We are obligated to make annual interest payments through maturity in 2022 equal to $28.0
million.
On March 12, 2008, we issued $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes.
On March 20, 2012 approximately 85% of the outstanding Convertible Notes, representing
(4)
(5)
$147.2 million of the then outstanding principal amount, were put to us. On March 20, 2015,
approximately 98% of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes, representing $24.8 million of
the then outstanding principal amount, were put to us, leaving $0.6 million principal amount
remaining. We are obligated to make semi-annual interest payments on the Convertible Notes
until either we call the remaining Convertible Notes or the holders put the Convertible Notes to
us, which is expected to occur by 2018.
The Lease Financing Obligation is calculated based on the aggregate undiscounted minimum
future lease payments, which include both an interest and principal component. The Lease
Financing Obligation contains an early buyout option pursuant to which we may purchase the
equipment for $1.8 million on February 10, 2019.

We have entered into contracts that provide firm transportation capacity on pipeline systems. The
remaining term on these contracts is five years. The contracts require us to pay transportation
demand charges regardless of the amount of gas we deliver to the processing facility or pipeline.
This balance includes asset retirement obligations of $4.8 million at June 30, 2016 related to
assets held for sale. Neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor the timing of our asset
retirement obligations can be precisely determined in advance. See "Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

involved in estimating asset retirement obligations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2016.
Trends and Uncertainties
We refer you to the corresponding section in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015 for a discussion of trends and uncertainties that may affect our
financial condition or liquidity. Also see "Risk Factors" in Part II of this report.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We refer you to the corresponding section in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015 and the notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of critical
accounting policies and estimates.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and
qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term "market risk" refers to
the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices and interest rates.
The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather
indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of
how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk sensitive
instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading.
Commodity Price Risk
Our primary market risk exposure is in the prices we receive for our production. Commodity pricing
is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot regional market prices
applicable to our U.S. oil and natural gas production. Pricing for oil, natural gas and NGLs has been
volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future.
The prices we receive for future production depend on many factors outside of our control, including
volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price.
Based on our average daily production and our derivative contracts in place for the six months
ended June 30, 2016, our income before income taxes would have decreased by approximately
$0.4 million for each $1.00 per barrel decrease in crude oil prices, approximately $0.3 million for
each $0.10 decrease per MMBtu in natural gas prices and $0.4 million for each $1.00 per barrel
decrease in NGL prices.
We routinely enter into commodity hedges relating to a portion of our projected production revenue
through various financial transactions that hedge future prices received. These transactions may
include financial price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price and pay a variable market price
to the contract counterparty. These commodity hedging activities are intended to support oil, natural
gas and NGL prices at targeted levels that provide an acceptable rate of return and to manage our
exposure to oil, natural gas and NGL price fluctuations.
As of July 22, 2016, we have financial derivative instruments related to oil and natural gas volumes
in place for the following periods indicated. Further detail of these hedges is summarized in the
table presented under "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations— Capital Resources and Liquidity— Commodity Hedging Activities."

Commodity Price Risk - Carrying Value of Proved Oil and Gas Properties
44
Table of Contents
Our current recoverability test on our existing proved oil and gas properties as of June 30, 2016
uses commodity pricing based on a combination of assumptions, which are closely aligned with the
assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process adjusted for geographical
location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact
realized prices. The application of this test as of June 30, 2016 results in a surplus of future
estimated net cash flows over carrying value of approximately $400.6 million and $95.4 million for
the Uinta Oil Program and DJ Basin, respectively. We estimate that the surplus in the Uinta Oil
program would decrease by approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million and the DJ Basin would
decrease by approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million for every $1.00 decrease in the oil price
assumptions used in the recoverability test. If impairment is necessary, we would reduce the
carrying value to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to,
recent sales prices of comparable properties, indications from marketing activities, the present value
of future revenues, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves,
future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various
discount rates used by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the
development and production of the underlying oil and natural gas. If future commodity prices
assumed in the recoverability test are not realized, it is likely that we will incur a significant
impairment.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of June 30, 2016, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of June 30,
2016.
Changes in Internal Controls. There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the second fiscal quarter of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
We are not a party to any material pending legal or governmental proceedings, other than ordinary
routine litigation incidental to our business. While the ultimate outcome and impact of any
proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty, our management does not believe that the resolution
of any currently pending proceeding will have a material effect on our financial condition or results
of operations.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
As of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes or updates to the risk factors
previously disclosed in the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 except as described below. An investment in our securities involves
various risks. When considering an investment in our Company, you should carefully consider all of
the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. These risks and uncertainties are not the only
ones facing us, and there may be additional matters that we are unaware of or that we currently
consider immaterial. All of these could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows and, thus, the value of an investment in our Company.
Proposed ballot initiatives in Colorado, if approved, could have severely adverse effects on our
operations, reserves and financial condition.
As previously disclosed, several statewide ballot initiatives have been filed for the 2016 election
cycle that seek to restrict or limit oil and natural gas development in Colorado. Proponents are
attempting to collect the required number of signatures to have two such proposals included on the
ballot for the November 2016 election. One would amend the Colorado constitution to impose a
2,500 foot statewide drilling setback from occupied structures and other sensitive areas. If
implemented, this proposal would have the effect of rendering the vast majority of the surface area
of the state ineligible for drilling, including many of our planned future drilling locations. The second
would amend the state constitution to give local governmental authorities the ability to regulate, or to
ban, oil and gas development activities within their boundaries notwithstanding state rules to the
contrary. If implemented, this proposal could cause us to be subject to onerous, and possibly
inconsistent, regulations that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, or to outright bans on our activities
in the state. Because substantially all of our operations and

reserves are located in Colorado, the passage and implementation of either of these proposals
would likely have a materially adverse effect on our operations, reserves, financial condition and
business generally.
