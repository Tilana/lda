<p><b>  A human rights analysis of economic and other land concessions in

</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The report, submitted in accordance with resolution 18/25 of 26 September 2011 of 
the Human Rights Council, is an assessment of the human rights impact of economic land 
concessions (ELCs) and other land concessions and major development projects in 
Cambodia (generally referred to as &#8213;land concessions&#8214; throughout the report unless 
</p>
<p>otherwise specified).  It includes not only an analysis of concessions pertaining to agro-
industry (for example, rubber, sugar, acacia and cassava plantations), but also to 
concessions for mining, oil and gas, forestry, and concessions for the purposes of tourism, 
property development, and large scale infrastructure, such as hydropower dams. 
</p>
<p>During my mission, on 7 May 2012, the Prime Minister announced a Government 
initiative relating to economic land concessions, including the institution of a moratorium 
on the granting of new concessions and a review of the compliance of existing concessions 
with contractual and legal obligations of the concessionaires.  He subsequently announced a 
rapid land titling initiative relating to people living near concessions. This report takes into 
account these recent developments and seeks to build on the positive aspects of these 
initiatives. 
</p>
<p>The report analyses information that I have received from the beginning of my 
mandate in 2009 through the end of July 2012, including the domestic legal framework 
governing land rights (and law and policies related to protected areas), international 
developments related to Cambodia&#8216;s human rights obligations involving land, and the 
</p>
<p>impacts of economic and other land concessions on the enjoyment of human rights. The 
</p>

<p>cases selected reflect these submissions. The report is based on official government data 
and information, analysis, individual petitions and testimonial evidence submitted by 
individuals, communities and local and international non-governmental organizations.  The 
report also benefits from research done by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Cambodia, which is carrying out ongoing 
monitoring and advocacy related to this issue. While all my activities are carried out with 
the cooperation of the Government, it should be noted that the official documentation 
needed for a complete analysis in some areas was not forthcoming, and thus gaps in 
information exist in some places. 
</p>
<p>At the outset, it should be noted that historical circumstances, including the policies 
of the Khmer Rouge regime and the widespread destruction and dislocation left in the wake 
of Cambodia&#8216;s lengthy civil war, have led to the proliferation of land disputes that the 
</p>
<p>Government is trying to manage.  Furthermore, it should also be noted that Cambodia as a 
developing country may wish to prioritize utilization of its land and natural resources in 
order for the country to develop and become more prosperous. Nevertheless, I am of the 
view that land concessions should be granted and managed within a sound legal and policy 
framework, including with due consideration for and consultation with those who will be 
affected, and with the sustainable use of natural resources in mind. 
</p>
<p>The majority of the challenges I have identified in this report (analysed in sections 
V-VIII) derive from a failure to apply the domestic legal framework &#8211; that is, the laws, 
policies and regulations that the Government itself has developed (explained in section III).  
The granting and management of economic and other land concessions in Cambodia suffer 
from a lack of transparency and adherence to existing laws. Much of the legal framework 
on these matters is relatively well developed on paper, but the challenge is with its 
implementation in practice. 
</p>
<p>Further, a pervasive problem that I have encountered is the uneven access to 
information, which has contributed to concessions benefiting only a minority, as well as a 
proliferation of land related conflicts, which has the potential to contribute to instability. 
The Government should be rigorous and transparent in the granting and monitoring of land 
concessions (sections II and VI), especially when negotiating concession agreements with 
both foreign and national companies, avoiding conflicts of interest, and holding concession 
companies to account by exercising oversight over their activities and resolving land 
disputes.  Absence of transparency in such matters has bred suspicion of corruption at all 
levels of the Government and has fuelled resentment on the part of many Cambodian 
citizens. In spite of visiting Cambodia since 2009 and enjoying a relatively good level of 
cooperation from the Government in many areas covered under my mandate, I had 
difficulty in obtaining the necessary official information and in reaching companies holding 
economic and other land concessions. This lack of access to key information has made it 
extremely challenging to write a comprehensive report on these issues. 
</p>
<p>Cambodia, as an emerging market, risks developing an international reputation for 
insecure investment in the land sector and in general. The current climate of development is 
characterized by low transparency and uneven access to information, inadequate 
consultation, and participation which is not inclusive, and, in my view, is unsustainable and 
likely to hamper future national economic growth.  Of course, some cases of land 
concessions seem to have had positive impacts for the people of Cambodia in terms of job 
creation, stimulation of the local economy, generation of revenue to finance public services, 
and overall contribution to national growth. However, the human cost of many concessions 
has been high, and human rights should be at the heart of the approach to the granting and 
management of land concessions in order for them to have a positive impact. There are well 
documented, serious and widespread human rights violations associated with land 
concessions that need to be addressed through remediation.  Criminalization of land </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>activists and human rights defenders is particularly worrying, as freedom of expression and 
assembly is crucial to a well-functioning democratic society. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, throughout my analysis, I struggled to fully comprehend the benefits of 
many land concessions that the Government has granted.  In general, it is not clear to what 
extent the people of Cambodia have actually benefited from land concessions and I am 
concerned that, despite the Government&#8216;s commitment to fighting corruption, many 
</p>
<p>concessionaires operate behind a veil of secrecy. Benefits from land concessions, where 
they exist, need to be quantified and made clearer, and if such benefits are not evident 
policies and practices around the granting of land concessions need to be modified.  The 
impacts of land concessions should be analysed for both their short- and long-term 
consequences; indeed, benefits should be genuine and outweigh costs for the majority in 
order to be considered substantial. I am of the view that the development of Cambodia&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>land and natural resources could have a positive impact on the lives of all Cambodians if 
undertaken in a sustainable and equitable manner and within the framework of the human 
rights obligations of the Government, and it is in this constructive spirit that I present this 
report.

<p><b> I. Introduction and scope 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report, submitted in accordance with resolution 18/25 of 26 September 2011 of 
the United Nations Human Rights Council, is an assessment of the human rights impact of 
economic land concessions (ELCs) and other land concessions in Cambodia (generally 
referred to as &#8213;land concessions&#8214; throughout the report unless otherwise specified).  It 
</p>
<p>includes not only an analysis of concessions pertaining to agro-industry (for example, 
rubber, sugar, acacia and cassava plantations), but also to concessions for mining, oil and 
gas, forestry, and concessions for the purposes of tourism, property development, and large 
scale infrastructure, such as hydropower dams.   
</p>
<p>2. Since taking up my functions as Special Rapporteur in 2009, I have consistently 
received information about the human rights issues related to land concessions, including 
forced evictions, poorly planned resettlement and relocation, environmental destruction and 
unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, and threats to indigenous peoples&#8216; 
livelihood, culture and traditions, among others.  An increasing number of cases have also 
come to my attention in which individuals and communities claiming their rights to land, 
land activists, and other human rights defenders have been harassed, threatened or 
criminalized based on challenges to the granting and management of economic and other 
land concessions. I have monitored the issues throughout my mandate, and have had the 
opportunity to meet personally with various people affected by or knowledgeable of land 
concessions during my seven missions to the country.  I have raised these issues in all my 
reports to the United Nations Human Rights Council, in some of my communications to the 
Royal Government of Cambodia, and in my dialogue with governmental representatives 
during my missions to the country.   
</p>
<p>3. Owing to the severity and persistence of these challenges, and the significant work 
done by my predecessors on ELCs, I focused my seventh mission to Cambodia in May 
2012 on land concessions and present this report to the Human Rights Council as an 
addendum to my main report for 2011-2012, which focused on electoral reform. The 
objective was to have a fresh look at the human rights challenges posed by land concessions 
in light of the rapid growth in the number of concessions granted to both national and 
foreign companies and the detrimental impact of such concessions on the lives of the 
Cambodian people.  The present report draws on the two previous reports on land 
concessions by two of my predecessors, the Special Representatives of the Secretary-
General (SRSG) for human rights in Cambodia, in 2004 and 2007. However, whereas the 
previous two reports focused mainly on land concessions for agricultural purposes, this 
report covers a wide range of human rights issues related to agricultural as well as other 
types of land concessions, and some of these issues are new. I will refer to these two 
previous reports as &#8213;the 2004 SRSG Report&#8214; and &#8213;the 2007 SRSG Report&#8214; respectively 
throughout the present report. The current report includes analyses which pertain to the 
overall human rights impact of the granting and managing of economic and other land 
concessions in both urban and rural areas. However, owing to the worrying continuous 
degradation of Cambodia&#8216;s natural resources, I have decided in this report to pay special 
</p>
<p>attention to land concessions in protected areas (see Annex I &#8211; Table of land concessions in 
protected areas). 
</p>
<p>4. During my May 2012 mission, I was able to visit the provinces of Rattanakiri, Stung 
Treng and Kratie, as well as the Municipality of Phnom Penh. In each province I met with 
communities affected by land concessions, as well as with the provincial authorities. I 
endeavoured to contact the businesses to whom the relevant concessions have been granted, 
and I will continue my efforts to interact with these businesses, which are central to how 
land concessions operate and are key beneficiaries. I was also able to meet a broad range of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>civil society actors, with the Minister of Environment, the Ministry of Land Management, 
Urban Planning and Construction, diplomatic representatives and donors, and the United 
Nations Country Team. I regret that I was unable to meet with the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries, especially given that they are the pre-eminent government entity 
involved with land concessions.  Some supplementary information was submitted by the 
Ministries of Environment and Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction. 
</p>
<p>5. During my most recent mission, on 7 May 2012, the Prime Minister announced a 
Government initiative relating to economic land concessions, including the institution of a 
moratorium on the granting of new concessions and a review of the compliance of existing 
concessions with contractual and legal obligations of the concessionaires.  He subsequently 
announced a rapid land titling initiative relating to people living near concessions. This 
report takes into account these recent developments and seeks to build on the positive 
aspects of these initiatives.  The report analyses information that I have received from the 
beginning of my mandate in 2009 through the end of July 2012, including the domestic 
legal framework governing land rights (and law and policies related to protected areas), 
international developments related to Cambodia&#8216;s human rights obligations involving land, 
</p>
<p>and the impacts of economic and other land concessions on the enjoyment of human rights. 
The range of cases selected reflects these submissions. The report is based on official 
government data and information, analysis, individual petitions and testimonial evidence 
submitted by individuals, communities and local and international non-governmental 
organizations.  The report also benefits from research done by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Cambodia, which is carrying 
out ongoing monitoring and advocacy related to this issue. While all my activities are 
carried out with the cooperation of the Government, it should be noted that the official 
documentation needed for a complete analysis was not forthcoming, and gaps in 
information exist.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Monitoring land concessions during the last two decades 
</b></p>
<p>6. A land concession is a contract between the Government and another actor that gives 
specific rights to control an area of land for a fixed period of time and for the conduct of 
specific activities in that area.  For example, a concessionaire may be granted exclusive 
rights to manage, cultivate and harvest the land.  Although concessions are often granted 
for long periods of time and concessionaires may be granted exclusive rights to use the 
land, a concession does not grant full ownership rights and the land remains the property of 
the State.  Concerns about the impact of land concessions began in the 1990s when human 
rights organizations started to receive complaints about human rights violations on 
concession land.  The human rights impacts of land concessions for agro-industry have 
been the subject of research by OHCHR and of reports by several successive Special 
Representatives of the Secretary-General for human rights in Cambodia1 and, as noted, this 
report intends to draw on their work.   
</p>
<p>7. The first SRSG, Michael Kirby, visited a plantation concession in January 1996 in 
Rattanakiri province and expressed concern about the impact of agricultural concessions on 
the human rights and livelihoods of rural communities. In his subsequent report to the then 
Commission on Human Rights, he recommended that &#8213;the complaints of villages 
concerning non-consultation, the use of armed guards, the presentation for signature of an 
unexplained contract, the shooting of cows which wander onto concession areas and the 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>feared endangerment of village survival and security of traditional sites of grave, pasture 
and farming land be resolved without delay, justly and according to the law.&#8214;2 
</p>
<p>8. Michael Kirby&#8216;s successor, Thomas Hammarberg, continued to examine the human 
rights impacts of agricultural and logging concessions on indigenous peoples, and he urged 
the Government, among other things, to officially recognize their use of land, forests and 
other natural resources, and their distinct and unique identity, culture and way of living, as 
well as the role of indigenous peoples in managing and preserving forests and biological 
diversity. He recommended that &#8213;villages, lands and forests used by the Highland Peoples 
</p>
<p>be clearly mapped and preserved from any current and future commercial concession or 
similar use. Local commune forestry projects should be recognized and supported. Public 
and private projects should only take place after due consultation with the peoples affected, 
and social, environmental and cultural impact assessment studies have been carried out.&#8214;3 
At this time the legal framework for granting and developing agricultural land concessions 
was very limited and there was little in the way of regulation for these types of 
concessions.4 This changed in 2001 when the new Land Law set out the basic conditions for 
granting what are now referred to as economic land concessions, or ELCs, which are 
concessions for agro-industry.5 The provisions of the 2001 Land Law were later elaborated 
by a sub-decree specifically dealing with ELCs.6 
</p>
<p>9. By the 2000s, Thomas Hammarberg&#8216;s successor, Peter Leuprecht, studied in-depth 
the impact of the economic land concession system from a human rights perspective, which 
was the subject of a 2004 report. The report explained the history and current practice of 
granting ELCs, including the early development of the concession system, and focused on 
the impacts on the human rights and livelihoods of local communities. The aim of the 
report was to contribute to public understanding of the issues and to help bring about 
changes in policy and practice to assist Cambodia&#8216;s rural poor and future generations.  
Leuprecht, expressing shock at the situation he witnessed, assessed that the &#8213;policies are 
</p>
<p>wrong&#8230;companies have been given rights over land that are very similar to ownership, and 
</p>
<p>yet they have little or no regard for the welfare of the people; and they contribute little to 
state revenue&#8230;They are not reducing poverty in Cambodia, and they are allowing the 
</p>
<p>continued plundering of its natural resources.&#8214;7 He called for full disclosure of information 
concerning all concessions in Cambodia, including economic land concessions.  
</p>
<p>10. Subsequently, as the impact of economic land concessions and corresponding human 
right violations continued to affect more communities, Peter Leuprecht&#8216;s successor, Yash 
</p>
<p>Ghai, further examined the problem with a focus on human rights violations committed by 
land concession companies against rural communities, especially indigenous peoples. The 
result of this work, the 2007 SRSG Report, provided an update on key developments since 
the 2004 SRSG Report, including the revised legal and regulatory framework for the 
granting and management of ELCs, and implementation of this framework. In the report&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>introduction, SRSG Ghai noted that the impact of ELCs continued to mirror patterns 
documented in the 2004 SRSG Report, insofar as concessions had been detrimental to the 
livelihoods of rural communities. Communities had drawn little benefit from land 
concessions and had no effective remedy when their rights were violated. SRSG Ghai also 
underscored the recommendations of the 2004 SRSG Report, including a recommendation

<p>11. Despite these and many other calls for re-examination and reform, the Government 
has continued to grant economic and other land concessions at an alarming rate. Over the 
last few years, increasing numbers of land concessions have been granted to private 
companies, both foreign and national, for large-scale agriculture, mining, infrastructure 
development, eco-tourism, and special economic zones.8 Many of these concessions are 
granted on land inhabited by indigenous communities, including protected areas and 
forests. Although the National Strategic Development Plan Update for 2009-2013 includes 
references to some challenges related to land concessions, including the need for more 
efficient use of resources, I am particularly concerned that I have not been able to obtain 
any comprehensive assessment of the impact of land concessions on Cambodia&#8216;s 
population and natural resources undertaken by the Government.  Moreover, the revenue 
generated from these concessions is not publicly disclosed in a way that permits 
comprehensive analysis and is therefore almost impossible to track.9 
</p>
<p>12. To fill the gap left by the absence of comprehensive official data and analysis, the 
field-based work of local NGOs has increasingly focused on monitoring of economic and 
other land concessions, supported by international donor resources.  In particular, two 
leading Cambodian human rights organizations, Licadho and Adhoc, have been collecting 
data as they have monitored land conflicts over the last two decades. They have reported 
that more than two million hectares of land are currently leased as ELCs granted to more 
than 200 private companies, and just under two million hectares of land have been granted 
to mining companies for exploration of gold, iron ore, copper and other precious minerals.10 
</p>
<p>13. The lack of a public assessment by the Government on the impact of the concession 
system on local communities&#8216; human rights and livelihoods, the environment, and other 
</p>
<p>human and economic costs of the concession system, together with a general lack of 
transparency surrounding concession activity, have been the subject of increasing 
discontent and protest.  The result has been a general lack of trust by communities towards 
the authorities responsible for granting concessions, towards the local authorities and armed 
forces tasked with facilitating the implementation of concessions, and towards the 
implementing business enterprises who are often viewed as exploitative and exclusive.

<p> 10 See Adhoc, <i>The Report of Land and Housing Rights 2011</i>, March 2012, which notes that as of 2011, 
the Government granted an estimated 2,276,349 hectares of ELCs to 225 companies. In 2001 alone, 
the Government granted 751,882 hectares of land to private companies for ELCs, and mining 
companies have received concessions to explore 1.9 million hectares.  According to a Licadho map, a 
surface area of 3,936,481 hectares has been granted as mining concessions and ELCs, covering 22 
percent of Cambodia&#8216;s total surface area.  Land concessions for agro-industrial crops total 2,036,170 
hectares.  </p>

<p><b> III. National framework </b>&#8211;<b> laws and procedures 
</b></p>
<p>14. There have been a number of legislative and policy developments since the 2007 
SRSG Report that build on the relatively well-developed existing national legal framework 
for land management. Following is a summary of important legal provisions relating to the 
granting of concessions, as well as recent developments. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Land management: land classification and re-classification of state 
</b></p>
<p><b>public land</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>15. Under the Land Law of 2001, there are two categories of state land: state public land 
and state private land.  The distinction is important, as the classification of state land has an 
impact on how it may be utilized, and what type of development can be approved in a given 
area. According to Article 15 of the Land Law and the 2005 Sub-Decree on State Land 
Management, state public land has a public interest use, and includes natural resources such 
as forests, rivers, natural lakes, nature reserves protected by the law, and archaeological, 
cultural and historical patrimonies. State public land cannot be subject to sale or transfer, 
and cannot be the subject of an economic or social land concession (ELCs and SLCs, which 
are discussed more below).11 The law is less clear about whether or not other types of 
concession can be granted on state public land, and by their very nature mining and 
hydropower projects are likely to be located on state public lands such as mountains and 
rivers.  However, the law is clear that leases over state public land may not exceed 15 years, 
and any activity conducted on that land may not fundamentally alter the nature of the land 
or leave it in a state that its public interest value is lost.12 However, state private property 
may be subject to lease, sale and transfer of rights.13   
</p>
<p>16. If state public land loses its public interest value, it may become state private land, 
which can be used for other purposes, including ELCs and SLCs, and can also be subject to 
long-term leases. State public land can only become state private land through formal re-
classification in accordance with the &#8213;law on transferring of state public property to state 
private property&#8214;.14 Although the Land Law seems to require that a law be passed in order 
to govern the re-classification of state public land, it appears that this is currently being 
done in accordance with the process set out in a royal decree and sub-decree which were 
both issued in 2006.15 
</p>
<p>17. In 2005 the Sub-Decree on State Land Management was passed, which sets out the 
framework for state land identification, mapping, registration and classification, and 
includes provisions for the creation and maintenance of a state land database.16 The sub-
decree also set out the process for re-classifying land that has already been registered as 
state public or state private property. The process requires that the re-classification request 
be considered by all relevant government agencies, and be posted in public in order to

 15 A Sub-Decree (or Anukret in Khmer) is adopted by the Council of Ministers and signed by the Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister. A sub-decree generally elaborates or implements a legal process already set out in existing 
law. A sub-decree must be in strict conformity with the Constitution and conform to the law to which 
it refers.

<p>gather comments from affected people and civil society.  Any re-classification of state land 
must be done via a specific sub-decree.17 
</p>
<p>18. Less than one year later, in August 2006, a Royal Decree was issued by the King18 
which had the stated aim to &#8213;determine the principles and transitional provisions involving 
</p>
<p>transferring public properties of the state and legal public entities.&#8214;19 The Royal Decree 
requires that state public land may only be re-classified if certain conditions are met, 
principally that the land no longer serves the public interest, has lost its originally intended 
function, or is no longer used directly by the public.20 Soon after the Royal Decree was 
issued, a separate sub-decree was signed by the Prime Minister which states that any re-
classification of state public land must comply with the Royal Decree, but provides no more 
detailed procedure.21 It is not clear at this time if the Royal Decree and sub-decree of 2006 
have the effect of over-ruling the provisions for re-classification contained in the earlier 
2005 Sub-decree on State Land Management, but it should be noted that the later law 
contains much less detail and no provisions for disclosure or public comment.  
</p>
<p>19. In recent years there have been many examples of state public land being converted 
into state private land and subsequently granted to private companies for development 
purposes, discussed further below (section VI).   
</p>
<p><b> B. Laws and regulations governing land concessions  
</b></p>
<p>20. The Land Law of 2001 authorizes the granting of land concessions for either social 
or economic purposes. The Land Law also envisages &#8213;other kinds of concessions,&#8214; where 
</p>
<p>authorization is granted for use, development or exploitation. This includes mining, 22 
fishing,23 industrial development24 and port concessions, but these types of concessions do 
not fall within the scope of the Land Law.25  
</p>
<p>21. Land concessions can never be based on a de facto occupation of the land, rather 
they must be based on a specific legal document, issued by the competent authority prior to 
the occupation of the land, and must be registered with the Ministry of Land Management, 
Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC), who can issue a &#8213;certificate of long-term

agricultural- related infrastructure; and (l) other sectors for which a specific law allows for the 
granting of concessions.

</p>
<p>lease&#8214; or &#8213;certificate of economic land concession.&#8214;26 As described above, ELCs and SLCs 
can only be granted on private state land.27 
</p>
<p>22. Social land concessions can be used to grant state private land to poor landless 
families for residential or farming purposes and to provide housing for veterans of the 
armed forces. They are regulated by the Sub-Decree on Social Land Concessions. 28 
Economic land concessions are granted in order to clear land for industrial agricultural 
exploitation. The Sub-Decree on Economic Land Concessions adopted in December 2005 
regulates the procedures for the granting of concessions and provides an important advance 
in establishing the legal and regulatory framework for the granting and management of such 
concessions, including requirements to conduct public consultations and environmental and 
social impact assessments (two of five fundamental criteria, listed in section III (C) 1.3).29 
</p>
<p>23. Land concessions for economic purposes include tree plantations (such as rubber, 
palm oil, teak, eucalyptus, and coconut) and &#8213;agro-industry&#8214; (the large-scale production of 
food such as cassava, rice, corn and soybeans). 30 Under the Land Law, ELCs provide 
investors with exclusive rights to manage and harvest the land, but only create rights for use 
of the land during a fixed period of time, as set out in the concession contract.31 ELCs are 
granted in exchange for certain investments, fees and land rental.  
</p>
<p>24. ELC areas are limited by law to a maximum area of 10,000 hectares per person. The 
granting of land concessions on multiple areas in favour of one specific person or several 
legal entities controlled by the same person is prohibited (presumably to avoid 
monopolization of natural resources). The maximum duration for an ELC is 99 years.32 
Previously, provincial and municipal governments had the power to grant ELCs of 1,000 
hectares or less (per the 2005 sub-decree on ELCs), however, in 2008 this power was 
withdrawn by the central Government. ELCs may now be granted only by national 
institutions, regardless of the size of the concession.33 The Government may revoke land 
concessions if the concessionaire does not comply with the terms of the concession 
contract.34 Concessions are also subject to the Civil Code provisions relating to perpetual 
and long-term leases.35 
</p>
<p>25. A Sub-Decree was issued in 2007 to determine the principles, terms and conditions 
for security and transfer of rights granted to investors with a long-term lease or an 
economic land concession.36 The sub-decree gives concessionaires the right to transfer an 
ELC or to use it as security,37 but a concessionaire may not transfer or mortgage their rights

<p>to the ELC if it has not been developed in accordance with the original ELC contract.38 
Presumably this provision exists to prevent land speculators acquiring and trading land 
through the land concession system.  The sub-decree states that only land registered in the 
Master Land Register can be subject to a concession, unless the concession is approved by 
the Ministry of Economy and Finance together and the relevant ministers or heads of 
institutions, or provincial-municipal governors who are the trustee authorities of the land in 
question.39  It also re-asserts that a concessionaire cannot become the owner of the land.40  
</p>
<p><b> C. Update on the procedure for granting land concessions </b>&#8211;<b> the role of 
State actors  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.1. Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) is the only body 
authorized to grant ELCs. According to the Sub-Decree on Economic Land Concessions, 
the procedure for the granting of ELCs may be initiated through solicited proposals, where 
the Government seeks expressions of interest in a project, or unsolicited proposals, where 
an investor proposes a project. However, competitive solicited proposals are the prioritized 
method for granting concessions, and unsolicited proposals may only be considered in 
exceptional cases where an investor promises to provide outstanding advantages through 
the introduction of new technology, contribute to social land concessions, or provide access 
to processing or export markets.41 ELCs should be granted only when all the following 
criteria have been met:42 the land has been registered and classified as state private land; a 
land use plan has been adopted by the provincial or municipal state land management 
committee, and the proposed land use is consistent with the plan; environmental and social 
impact assessments have been completed with respect to the land use and development 
plan; there are solutions for resettlement issues, in accordance with the existing legal 
framework and procedures; there shall be no involuntary resettlement by lawful land 
holders and access to private land shall be respected; and public consultations have been 
conducted with territorial authorities and local residents relating to the concession proposal. 
</p>
<p>27. The Sub-Decree on Economic Land Concessions also created a Technical 
Secretariat located at the MAFF with a mandate to support the authorities in reviewing 
existing ELCs, including: contractual compliance, land use fees and other revenue from 
contracts; public consultation to solicit comments on concession activities within 
communes where concessions are located; request for land regularization;43 and request for 
the voluntary reduction of ELCs exceeding 10,000 hectares. The Technical Secretariat is 
also required to establish an ELC logbook.44

 43 This is the responsibility of the MLMUPC, and includes land parcel adjustments, adjudication of land 
</p>
<p>rights of the occupants of land parcels under review, and demarcation and registration of land through 
existing procedures.  See Sub-Decree<b> </b>No.146 ANK/BK on Economic Land Concessions<b>,</b> 27 
December 2005, article 42. 
</p>
<p> 44 Information was requested in writing from MAFF about the status of the logbook and the progress of 
the Technical Secretariat (including with regard to the review of existing ELCs, which ELCs exceed 
10,000 hectares, and which ELCs are smaller than 1,000 hectares) but no response was received.

</p>
<p><b> 1.2. Ministry of Environment 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Ministry of the Environment (MoE) is responsible for developing 
environmental policies and implementing environmental action plans in collaboration with 
the other relevant ministries.  It plays a key role in reviewing and advising the Government 
on the potential impact of investment projects. The ministry is also responsible for 
monitoring and investigating sources of pollution and enforcing the relevant provisions for 
punishing violations of Cambodia&#8216;s pollution laws.45 
</p>
<p>29. The MoE plays a key role in the approval of all major development projects, 
including the various types of land concessions.  Specifically, the Law on Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources Management states that all development projects, 
whether they are implemented by the state or a private entity, require an environmental 
impact assessment (EIA) to be conducted.46  The Ministry is responsible for evaluating and 
reviewing EIAs, and ensuring their implementation. This includes ensuring adequate follow 
up, monitoring, and compliance by investors with a proposed Environmental Management 
Plan (EMP) during a project&#8216;s construction, implementation, and closure. 47   The Sub-
Decree on the Environmental Impact Assessment Process includes a list of all the types of 
projects that require an EIA, which includes wood and paper production, agriculture, 
mining, hydropower, power plants, tourism and infrastructure projects.48  Other specific 
laws also confirm that an EIA must be conducted prior to a concession being approved.49 
</p>
<p>30. The MoE is also responsible for managing Cambodia&#8216;s protected areas.50  As many 
development projects have been approved in areas that are located within or adjacent to 
protected areas, this role is crucial.  As will be discussed later in this report, the MoE plays 
a central role in the process of designating areas within protected areas as sustainable use 
zones, which can open these areas for investment and development through concessions 
and other agreements. At the time of writing, it remains unclear exactly what process is 
being used to grant such concessions and who is ultimately assessing and approving them. 
A sub-decree issued by the Government in 2007 states that in cases where a long-term lease 
is approved by the Government over land that is unregistered, the contract should be signed 
by the relevant institutions who are trustees of that land, which could include the MoE 
when protected areas are concerned. However, it does not detail which authority is 
responsible for actually approving the lease, or what process should be followed.51 The 
Protected Areas Law also mandates the MoE to set up a National Committee for Conflict

institutions, or provincial-municipal governors who are the trustee authorities of the said land.&#8214; </p>

<p>31. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is mandated to assist the Government 
in guiding and administering the economy and in financial matters, including formulation 
of policy and management of investments, in order to support economic development and 
to improve the living standards of Cambodian people based on the principles of a free 
market economy and social equality. MEF also participates in the organization, 
implementation, and monitoring of the performance of economic and financial policies, 
monitors revenue from the national budget, and administers public property.53  The MEF is 
authorized to sign land concession contracts together with relevant ministers, heads of 
institutions, or provincial-municipal governors who are the trustee authorities of untitled 
land, according to certain stipulations.54 
</p>
<p><b> 1.4. Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy  
</b></p>
<p>32. The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) is tasked with, among other 
duties, issuing mining licenses. According to the 2001 Law on Management and 
Exploitation of Mineral Resources, MIME is responsible for managing and inspecting all 
mining operations for compliance with the law.55 There are six general types of mining 
licenses: Artisanal Mining Licenses, 56  Pit and Quarry Licenses, Gemstone Mining 
Licenses,57  Mineral Transforming Licenses, and Exploration and Exploitation Licenses for 
Industrial Scale Mining.58 In order to receive an Industrial Mining Licenses, the company 
must show that it is technically and financially able to implement the project. Applicants 
must also: conduct a feasibility study and complete an EIA; create a plan for protecting the 
health and safety of workers; create a plan for education, training  and employment of 
Cambodian citizens; and prepare a plan for decommissioning (or closing down) the mine 
and restoring the surrounding affected environment after the mine closes.59

 57 A Pit and Quarry License gives a company the right to mine for construction materials which may 
</p>
<p>include sand, gravel, crushed stone, laterite, cement, clay, limestone, and marble (article 11 (2) of the 
Mining Law). Permission to dredge sand from rivers and the sea is also granted through a Pit and 
Quarry License. A Gemstone License gives a company the right to mine for gems like diamonds, 
rubies, sapphires, and other gems. Both types of licenses cover exploration and exploitation, and also 
require and EIA to be conducted. 
</p>
<p> 58 For a company to mine valuable minerals, such as gold or bauxite at an industrial scale, two main 
licenses need to be obtained, the Exploration License (which gives a company the right to explore for 
minerals), and the Industrial Mining (or Exploitation) License (which gives a company the right to 
begin mining for precious minerals on an industrial scale). To apply for the Exploitation License, the 
company must first apply to the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) which is the 
responsible body to review and approve major development projects. After approval from the CDC, 
MIME will subsequently issue the license.

<p>private sector investment, dealing with investment projects within and outside of special 
economic zones, respectively. Both boards review investment applications, including for 
land concessions, and grant incentives to investment projects meeting the requirements laid 
out in the 1994 Investment Law.  The sub-decree on the functioning of the CDC states that 
all investments worth over US$50 million must be approved by the CDC, as must 
applications for exploration and exploitation of mineral and natural resources, projects with 
potential negative environmental impacts, and projects that involve infrastructure 
concessions. 62  As such, the CDC plays an important role in promoting and approving 
investments in land concessions.

<p>34. The Land Law 2001 designated the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning 
and Construction as the entity responsible for issuing land titles and managing the cadastral 
administration of all types of land, including land belonging to the State, which includes 
state private land on which land concessions may be granted. The MLMUPC is responsible 
for land regularization when there is a request from the ELC Technical Secretariat. This 
includes land parcel adjustments, adjudication of land rights of occupants of land parcels 
under review, and demarcation and registration of land through existing procedures. The 
existence of land concessions or long-term leases should be recorded by the MLMUPC and 
certificates of long term-lease or certificates of economic land concession issued.63 The 
Ministry has to date registered 18 ELCs, totalling approximately 101,000 hectares.64 </p>

<p>divides the protected areas into four distinct categories: natural parks, wildlife reserves, 
protected landscapes, and multi-purpose areas.  
</p>
<p>36. The Protected Areas Law came into force in January 2008 and defines the 
framework for the management, conservation and development of protected areas.65 The 
original four categories of protected area were expanded and now include: 66  national 
parks,67 wildlife sanctuaries,68 protected landscapes,69 multiple use areas,70 Ramsar sites,71 
biosphere reserves,72 natural heritage sites,73 and marine parks,74 which have been defined 
by previous regulations on national resource management and environmental protection.75 
</p>
<p>  
 65 Protected Areas Law, 2008, article 1. 
 66 Ibid., article 7. 
 67 Natural parks are areas reserved for nature and for scenic views, and are to be protected for scientific, 
</p>
<p>educational and entertainment purposes.  They include: Botum Sakor (Koh Kong province, 171,250 
hectares); Kirirom (Kampong Speu and Koh Kong provinces, 35,000 hectares); Bokor (Kampot 
province, 140,000 hectares); Kep (Kep province, 5,000 hectares); Ream (Kampong Som province, 
171,250 hectares); Phnom Koulen (Siem Reap province, 37,500 hectares); and Virachey (Rattanakiri 
province, 332,500 hectares). 
</p>
<p> 68 Wildlife reserves are areas preserved to protect wildlife, vegetation and ecological balance.  They 
include: Phnom Oral (Koh Kong, Pursat and Kampong Chhnang provinces, 253,750 hectares); Peam 
Krasop (Koh Kong province, 23,750 hectares); Phnom Samkos (Koh Kong province, 333,750 
hectares); Roneam Donsam (Battambang province, 178,750 hectares); Koulen Prum Tep (Siem Reap 
and Preah Vihear provinces, 402,500 hectares); Beng Per (Kampong Thom province, 242,500 
hectares); Lumphat (Rattanakiri and Mondulkiri provinces, 250,000 hectares); Phnom Prich 
(Mondulkiri and Kratie provinces, 222,500 hectares); Phnom Namlear (Mondulkiri province, 47,500 
hectares); and Snuol (Kratie province, 75,000 hectares). 
</p>
<p> 69 Protected landscape areas are to be maintained as scenic spots for leisure and tourism. They include: 
Angkor (Siem Reap province, 10,800 hectares); Bantheay Chhmar (Bantheay Meanchey province, 
81,200 hectares); and Preah Vihear (Preah Vihear province, 5,000 hectares). 
</p>
<p> 70 Multi-purpose areas are protected for the stability of water, forestry, wildlife, and fisheries resources, 
for pleasure, and for the conservation of nature with a view to assuring economic development. They 
include: Dung Peng (Koh Kong province, 27,700 hectares); Samlot (Battambang, 60,000 hectares; 
and Tonle Sap Biosphere (Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Siem Reap, Battambang and Pursat 
provinces, 316,250 hectares). 
</p>
<p> 71 As per the 1971 Ramsar Convention (Convention on Wetlands of International Importance adopted in 
Ramsar, Iran), Ramsar sites are wetlands that are considered of ecological or biological importance, 
particularly those serving as habitats for threatened migratory water birds.  For example, Tonle Sap 
and Boeung Chmar are inscribed on the list of Wetlands of International Importance (the &#8213;Ramsar 
</p>
<p>List&#8214;).  
 72 Biosphere reserves are areas representing important and not severely damaged ecosystems and 
</p>
<p>surrounded by sustainable development zones, with the allowance of limited human activity. They are 
established to: 1) conserve biodiversity, landscape, land shape and ecosystems, including genetic 
resources, plant, fish and animal species, and restore the biological environment and habitat; 2) 
support sustainable ecological, environmental, economic, social and cultural development; and 3) 
support activities, including implementation of demonstration projects, training, research, and surveys 
to monitor the environmental changes, in relation to sustainable development and conservation at 
local, national, and international levels. For example, the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve was 
designated in 1997, covering a total area of 1,481,257 hectares and consisting of three core areas 
(70,837 hectares) and a buffer zone (510,768 hectares).  
</p>
<p> 73 Natural heritage sites are areas on land and/or water territories in which there is natural or semi-
natural uniqueness that has extraordinary value, beauty or cultural importance. They are established 
to: 1) protect and maintain the sustainability of natural features because of their implicit natural 
importance, uniqueness and representation of the ecosystem; 2) provide opportunity for research, 
education, and public participation at a level that can ensure compatibility with the first point above; 
3) eliminate and prevent use and occupation that are not in line with or cause harm to the objectives

<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1

</p>
<p>37. The 2008 Protected Areas Law also introduced a new zoning system in order to 
effectively manage the conservation and development of protected areas.76 The law states 
that protected areas should be divided into four distinct zones: core zones, conservation 
zones, sustainable use zones, and community zones. No clearance or building is allowed in 
the core or conservation zones, and any development within the sustainable use or 
community zones can only take place with the approval of the Government at the request of 
the Ministry of Environment.77 Any development in these areas or in areas adjacent to 
protected areas must first be subject to an environmental and social impact assessment.78 In 
recent years a large number of sub-decrees have been issued by the Government, with the 
approval of the MoE, designating land within protected areas as sustainable use zones and 
approving development projects therein, usually for agro-industry, discussed further 
(section IV (C)). 
</p>
<p>38. The Law sets conditions for the establishment or modification of any protected area 
and states that adjustments must be implemented by a specific sub-decree, 79  but 
modification of the boundaries of each zone can only be carried out on the basis of clear 
scientific information on the ecosystem which are subject to change or are under threat, and 
this must be in compliance with the policies and strategies of the Government. 80  The 
Ministry of Environment is charged with mapping protected areas with the participation of 
the MLMUPC, local authorities and communities, and relevant agencies.81  
</p>
<p>39. Chapter 6 of the law determines the involvement and access rights of local 
communities and indigenous communities, and affirms State recognition of the secure 
access to traditional uses, local customs, beliefs and religions of local communities and 
indigenous ethnic minority groups residing within and adjacent to protected areas. The law 
tasked the Ministry of Environment with the authority to allocate land to communities 
residing within or adjacent to a protected area as community protected area.82 As of the end 
of 2011, the Ministry of Environment had set up 102 community protected areas, which 
includes 23 indigenous communities.83 
</p>
<p>  
of the establishment of the protected area; and 4) provide people who live in the natural heritage site 
(if any) with benefits at a level that can ensure compatibility with other management objectives. 
</p>
<p> 74 A marine park is a coastal area which is affected by marine tides mixed with water from mountain 
forests, including islands, covered by forests, plants, wildlife and fish of all kinds, with historical and 
cultural value.  A marine park is established to: 1) maintain and protect marine biological resources 
and functions of forests; 2) maintain and protect the quality of marine environments for the long term; 
3) maintain and protect historical sites and the value of cultural and natural privileges of the sea; 4) 
and provide opportunity for scientific research, education, recreation, and marine ecotourism. 
</p>
<p> 75 The protected areas were previously defined by the provisions of the 1996 Law on Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources Management, the Royal Decree on the Establishment and 
Designation of Protected Areas, and the Royal Decree on the Establishment and Management of 
Boeung Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve of 10 April 2001, among others.

<p><b> 1.2 Forestry Law 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Forestry Law authorizes the granting of forest concessions.  However, since 
January 2002, a moratorium on logging in forest concessions has been in place84 and the 
Prime Minister indicated in June 2012 that this will be continued.85 The Sub-Decree on the 
Management of Forest Concessions states that cancelled or revoked forest concessions must 
revert to natural forest protected areas, and cannot be converted into ELCs or awarded to 
other companies. Article 29 of the Forestry Law prohibits the harvesting of trees that yield 
high-value resin or that local communities tap to extract resin for customary use. Chapter 9 
of the law recognizes and ensures the traditional user rights of local communities to collect 
and use forest by-products. Traditional user rights include livestock grazing and the sale of 
forest by-products. Chapter 9 also enables the allocation of any part of a permanent forest 
reserve as a community forest, granting communities living inside or near the forest rights 
to manage and utilize the forest resources in a sustainable manner. As of December 2011, a 
total of 281 community forestry sites covering 244,265 hectares of forest land area in 18 
provinces were recognized by the prakas of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries.86 
</p>
<p><b> 1.3 Laws on Environment 
</b></p>
<p>41. The 1996 Law on Environmental Protection and Natural Resource Management 
requires environmental impact assessments to be carried out on all private and public 
projects and activities. 87  Concerned ministries should consult with the Ministry of 
Environment before issuing a decision or undertaking activities related to the preservation, 
development or management of natural resources. 88  The Ministry of Environment, in 
collaboration with the concerned ministries, must also carry out a study to assess the 
environmental impacts on natural resources and present recommendations to ensure that 
natural resources are preserved, developed and managed in a sustainable manner.89  
</p>
<p>42. The 1999 Sub-Decree on the Environmental Impact Assessment Process further 
specifies the procedures for an assessment which is to be undertaken on every project or 
activity of any type or size, public or private, and should involve consultations with 
affected communities.90 It empowers the Ministry of Environment to evaluate and review 
assessments and ensure their implementation through monitoring and surveillance.91  Article 
4 of the sub-decree specifies that projects can only be approved by national institutions 
following a review of findings and recommendations provided by the MoE based on the 
impact assessments. At the time of writing this report, the Ministry of Environment was in 
the process of drafting a law on environmental impact assessments, the contents of which 
</p>
<p>

<p><b> 1.4 Law on Investment 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Cambodian Law on Investment applies to all Qualified Investment Projects 
(QIP), a QIP being any project which has received a final registration certificate from the 
CDC.92 The Law streamlined the foreign investment regime and provided the framework 
for incentives (including exemption of custom duties and taxes) for direct private sector 
investment, including in agro-industry, infrastructure development, environmental 
protection, and tourism. 93   Chapter 6 specifies that the use of land is permitted to all 
investors, although land ownership is restricted to Cambodian nationals, which is in line 
with Cambodia&#8216;s Constitution and Land Law.  All investors are permitted to enter into 
unlimited, short-term and long-term leases, subject to the provisions of existing laws 
governing such leases, although the law specifies that concession holders cannot hold onto 
or transfer land concessions that are inactive. Chapter 8 of the law states that any dispute 
relating to investment should first be settled amicably through consultation between the 
concerned parties and the CDC. Should this not be possible within two months, the dispute 
should be brought by either party for conciliation before the Council, sent for arbitration or 
referred to the courts. However, this does not apply to land disputes, which should be 
resolved according to existing legal provisions contained in the Land Law and/or Civil 
Code. 
</p>
<p><b> 1.5 Laws pertaining to extractive industries 
</b></p>
<p>44. The 2001 Law on Management and Exploitation of Mineral Resources governs the 
prospecting, exploration and exploitation of mineral resources (although the law does not 
cover petroleum and gas). Mining is prohibited on &#8213;national cultural, historical and heritage 
</p>
<p>sites,&#8214; and any mining activities in &#8213;protected, reserved or restricted&#8214; areas can only be 
</p>
<p>carried out with written permission of the authority responsible for managing that area.94 
The Law also specifies requirements for addressing environmental impact and providing 
fair and just compensation to private land holders whose property is affected.95 The 2002 
Law on Forestry allows mining within Permanent Forest Estates, however, any proposed 
mining operation, in addition to following other relevant laws, must be the subject of a 
&#8213;prior study-evaluation&#8214; by the MAFF. 96   A draft mineral policy is reportedly under 
development.

 94  Law on Management and Exploitation of Mineral Resources, 2001, articles 7 and 8.   
</p>
<p> 95 Ibid., articles 7 and 25.  The Mining Law also set certain requirements for every license holder or 
subcontractor to take responsibility for the proper conduct of exploration and mining operations, 
including: the protection of the environment in accordance with the Law on Environment Protection 
and Natural Resource Management; an environmental impact assessment and study; an environmental 
management plan; a mine site restoration and rehabilitation plan and financial guarantees;  ensuring 
the protection of worker health and safety to be detailed in a mine plan program; a mine health and 
safety program containing accident prevention and reporting procedures; protecting safety of the 
public in and around mine sites to be detailed in a mine plan; educating, training and providing jobs to 
Khmer citizens to be detailed in an education, training and employment program; and utilizing as 
much as possible goods and services within the Kingdom of Cambodia (article 21).

<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>45. The oil and gas sector is currently governed by the Petroleum Regulations from 
1991 and their 1998 and 1999 amendments.97 Under the original Regulations, MIME was 
the administrative authority responsible for the management of petroleum resources. 
However, in 1998 this authority was transferred to the Cambodian National Petroleum 
Authority (CNPA), 98  which is now responsible for evaluating bids and making 
recommendations to the Government that Petroleum Agreements be granted to specific 
companies.99  There is currently no specific law covering petroleum and gas. A law is 
reportedly being drafted by the CNPA and Council for Jurists, but at the time of writing the 
draft was not publicly available and to date there has been no public review or consultation.  
In addition, there are reportedly inter-ministerial consultations on a draft policy on 
petroleum. 
</p>
<p>46. The Petroleum Regulations set out the terms for invitations to bid and the criteria for 
evaluating, negotiating and approving subsequent bids. Exploration periods are granted for 
up to 4 years, after which they may be renewed twice for a period of two years each time.100 
If exploration shows that resources can be commercially exploited, the company should 
apply for a production permit including a detailed work plan and budget for the proposed 
exploitation. No further development of operations should commence until a production 
permit is issued.  According to the Regulations, the production period lasts for 30 years, 
after which it may be extended for a further five years if the field is still commercially 
productive.101 The Regulations set out requirements for petroleum operations, including 
protections for safety, security and the environment. 102 As with all major development 
projects, a full EIA is required for all petroleum and gas operations.103 
</p>
<p><b> 1.6 Laws related to hydropower 
</b></p>
<p>47. There is currently no specific law for hydropower in Cambodia, although there are a 
number of laws with relevance to the development and running of such projects, including 
the laws related to investment, electricity, land, forests, water resources and the 
environment.  As Cambodia does not yet have the financial or technical capacities to 
design, construct and operate large-scale hydropower projects, all large-scale projects 
currently under development are reportedly under Build Operate Transfer (BOT) 
agreements of 25 years and upward, and all the existing large-scale hydropower projects 
currently operational or in development are reportedly Chinese funded and operated.104 
</p>
<p>48. The first step in developing a hydro-power project is to seek a Memorandum of 
Understanding with MIME in order to conduct and prepare a feasibility study, followed by 
steps to develop the project, which must be approved by the Council for the Development 
of Cambodia.  In addition, under the 2007 Law on Water Resource Management, all

<p>hydropower projects require a water use license.105  As with all large-scale development 
projects, all hydropower projects must be subject to an EIA prior to approval, and EIAs 
should be conducted according to the procedures set out by the Ministry of Environment.106 
</p>
<p><b> E. Land title and possession rights 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Khmer Rouge regime which ruled Cambodia between 1975 and 1979 saw the 
dissolution of all private ownership, the results of which are still being felt today. Many 
millions of Cambodians still lack documentation and the full recognition of their ownership 
rights that comes with a land title. In recognition of the absence of widespread land 
registration and titling, Chapter 4 of the Land Law recognises the possession rights of those 
people who have enjoyed peaceful, uncontested possession of their land commencing prior 
to the 2001 Land Law, but are not yet formally recognized as owners of the land. If an 
occupant can prove that they have legitimate possession rights they are entitled to request a 
land title for their land and thus have their possession converted into full ownership 
rights.107 
</p>
<p>50. The Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction, with the 
support of development partners and other authorities, has made significant progress in both 
systematic and sporadic land registration and titling programmes and has made efforts to try 
and address the situation of informal settlers through new policies and regulations. 108 
Foreign donors including the World Bank, the Government of Germany (through the 
Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#252;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ&#8212;formally GTZ and DED), 
the Government of Finland (through Finnmap), the Government of Canada (through the 
Canadian International Development Agency), as well as the Government of Denmark 
(Danida) and the European Commission, have contributed significantly to these 
programmes in both urban and rural areas through financial and technical assistance to 
support the MLMUPC and provincial authorities in a number of land policy, allocation, 
registration and titling programmes.  The key programmes include the Land Management 
and Administration Project (LMAP), a systematic and sporadic titling programme from 
2002-2009; the Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development (LASED) project, 
supporting the redistribution of land for the poor and landless through a social land 
concession pilot; and the Land Administration Sub Sector Programme (LASSP), which is 
the successor to LMAP.   
</p>
<p>51. According to the National Strategic Development Plan Update, as of 2010, a total of 
1,664,297 land titles had been issued, of which three quarters related to rural areas and one 
quarter to urban areas.  Of these, 1,070,665 titles were issued through systematic land 
titling processes and 593,645 through sporadic titling.109 As of November 2011, the land 
titling programme had delivered 1,740,839 land titles, although the programme is ongoing 
and the number is now likely higher.110 While significant progress has been made, there

collective ownership of their lands. The lands of indigenous communities include 
residential and agricultural land, and encompass both land currently cultivated and land 
reserved for shifting agriculture. Article 23 of the Land Law states that indigenous 
communities should continue to manage their communities and land according to 
traditional customs, pending the determination of their legal status. Once they are registered 
with the Ministry of Interior as legal entities, communities can apply for registration of 
collective land title.  In 2009, the Government further defined its policy on indigenous 
peoples111 and developed the procedures to implement their rights to collective land title.112 
</p>
<p>53. The adoption of the sub-decree on indigenous land registration in April 2009 set in 
motion various initiatives by the Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Rural Development, 
MLMUPC, bilateral donors, United Nations, and NGOs to assist indigenous communities 
seeking to register as legal entities and apply for collective land title.  The sub-decree sets 
out the procedure for the communal land titling of indigenous lands and includes detailed 
steps for boundary demarcation, surveying, and public display.  
</p>
<p>54. Despite the efforts of indigenous communities to register as legal entities and 
eventually apply for land title, economic land concessions continue to be granted on lands 
also claimed by communities. However, in May 2011 the Ministry of Interior and 
MLMUPC issued a welcome Inter-ministerial Circular that provides interim protective 
measures for indigenous peoples registered with the Ministry of the Interior.  The goal of 
the circular is to protect the lands of indigenous peoples who are awaiting the lengthy 
process of collective land titling to be completed.113 
</p>
<p><b> G. Brief overview of available land dispute resolution mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>55. There are five formal conflict resolution mechanisms in Cambodia for disputes 
relating to land rights: the Commune Councils, the Administrative Committees, the 
Cadastral Commission, the National Authority for Land Conflict Resolution (NALDR), and 
the court system.  The Commune Councils only &#8213;reconcile differences of opinion&#8214; among

</p>
<p>citizens of communes, but do not make decisions.114 Though not a requirement, in practice 
most cases go to the Commune Councils before they go to higher levels.  
</p>
<p>56. Administrative Committees (AC) are established in all areas that are undergoing 
systematic land registration, and are the first instance of dispute resolution in cases where 
disputes arise during the land registration process.  The ACs have no power to issue a 
decision and may only seek to assist the conflicting parties to resolve their dispute.115 If the 
AC is unable to resolve a dispute it should be forwarded to the Cadastral Commission. 
</p>
<p>57. The Land Law of 2001 requires that disputes over unregistered land be submitted for 
investigation and resolution by the Cadastral Commission, 116  which was formally 
established in May 2002 by a sub decree.117 The Cadastral Commission is responsible for 
resolving disputes over unregistered lands occurring outside of areas being adjudicated for 
systematic land registration, as well as disputes that emerge during adjudication that cannot 
be resolved by Administrative Committees.118  The Cadastral Commissions consist of the 
National Cadastral Commission, Provincial/Municipal Cadastral Commissions in all 24 
provinces and municipalities and District/Khan Cadastral Commissions in all 194 
districts/khans. The District/Khan Cadastral Commission only has authority to support 
reconciliation, and in the case where no agreement is reached, it will be referred to the 
provincial level. Previously the Provincial Cadastral Commissions only had powers to 
conciliate disputes,119 but in late 2009 they were delegated power to issue decisions in cases 
where conciliation is not possible.120  If a case can still not be resolved at the provincial 
level it should be forwarded to the National Cadastral Commission, which has the power to 
issue a decision. 121   In the case of dissatisfaction with the result, the disputants may 
complain to the court within 30 days.122 
</p>
<p>58. The Cadastral Commission has no jurisdiction over land disputes concerning 
registered land, which must be heard by the courts.  Any disputes concerning a contractual 
or inheritance dispute must also be referred to the courts, regardless of whether the land is 
registered or not.123   
</p>
<p>59. In February 2006, the National Authority on Land Dispute Resolution was set up by 
a Royal Decree.124 This institution, which was not envisaged when the Land Law was

disputes.&#8214;125 Little information is available about the functioning of this body, and it is not 
known how many cases it has received and resolved. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Recent changes in law and policy 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Prime Minister instigated a number of policy developments related to ELCs in 
the first half of 2012. In March 2012, the Council of Ministers decided that in principle, 
prior to the signing of all ELC contracts, the Ministry of Land Management should register 
state land in the Land Registry Book following the procedures in the legal framework 
already in force. According to a letter from the Council of Ministers the MLMUPC, MoE, 
MAFF and Ministry of Commerce agreed that, before signing any ELC contract, the land in 
question should be registered and entered into the Land Register, a process which takes 4-5 
months to complete.126 
</p>
<p>61. On 7 May 2012, the Prime Minister issued a directive to temporarily halt the 
granting of ELCs, which also called for a review of existing concessions.127  For existing 
ELCs, the directive instructs relevant authorities to further implement a &#8213;leopard-skin&#8214; 
policy, demarcating ELCs around land already occupied, thereby aiming to lessen the 
effects of ELCs on communal land and decrease interruptions to the livelihood of rural 
communities.  The directive also stated that ELCs would be cancelled for those companies 
that fail to comply with applicable procedures and contracts, and who conduct illegal 
logging, encroach on land outside of the ELC, and leave the land vacant for resale. On 14 
June 2012, the Prime Minister gave a speech during the launch of the 2011 mid-term 
review report on the implementation of the National Strategic Development Plan Update  
where he reinforced the intention to implement the &#8213;leopard skin&#8214; policy through a new 
land titling scheme for families living within ELC areas. 
</p>
<p>62. On 9 July 2012, the Government informed me in writing that the Prime Minister had 
instructed authorities on 14 July 2012 to expedite the issuance of land titles to 350,000 
families nationwide living within existing ELCs, forest concessions, and state land, in order 
to demarcate a total land area of 1.2 million hectares.  I was informed that the 
implementation of this new initiative was already well underway, following the recruitment 
of 1,500 youth, and that 1,100 youth had already been deployed to Battambang, Bantheay 
Meanchey, Kampong Cham, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Speu, Kampong Thom, 
Kampot, Kratie, Mondulkiri, Rattanakiri, Steung Treng and Preah Vihear provinces on 28

Government to appoint officials to the positions stated in the Royal Decree. The NALDR is a council 
of 25 high ranking officials, the majority of whom are from the Government, including 
representatives from the National Assembly, as well as government lawyers. NGOs were invited to 
nominate a representative, but declined to do so. The Authority is chaired by Deputy Prime Minister 
Sok An; vice chairs include the Minister for Land Management (H.E Im Chhun Lim), the Minister for 
Minister of National Assembly and Senate Relations and Inspectorate Affairs (H.E. Men Sam On), 
and a member of the opposition (H.E. Eng Chay Eang). The Royal Decree creating the NALDR also 
creates a general secretariat which is effectively its implementing agency.<b>

July 2012 to Oddar Meanchey, Koh Kong, Pursat and Siem Reap provinces.128 
</p>
<p>63. Following the 14 June 2012 speech, various official documents were published 
relating to the new scheme&#8216;s implementation, including the Government&#8216;s decision of 25 
</p>
<p>June 2012 to establish a committee to oversee the implementation of the directive. This 
committee is to report back to the Prime Minister in order to make requests for a decision 
on any proposal to excise land from forest concessions, ELCs, and state land, and to 
distribute the excised land to the people so that they can legally own the land.129 While the 
May 2012 ELC directive represents a significant step in the right direction in terms of land 
reform and may achieve a great deal in terms of distributing land to the rural poor, its 
implementation has raised concerns in terms of harmonization with the existing laws, 
procedures and policies on land titling and management. This is discussed in further detail 
below. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Pending draft laws and regulations 
</b></p>
<p>64. In early 2010, the MLMUPC released a draft housing policy that, among other 
safeguards, offers protections against forced eviction. At the time of the writing of this 
report the policy was still awaiting finalization by the Council for Land Policy and approval 
by the Council of Ministers.  The Ministry also released a draft sub-decree on urbanization 
at the end of 2011 and detailed input into the draft was offered by a range of interlocutors 
during a process of open consultation, but an updated draft was not in circulation at the time 
of writing. 
</p>
<p>65. In November 2011 the MAFF held a meeting on a proposed draft law on the 
management and use of agricultural land, but various stakeholders have reported a closed 
consultation process and several potentially problematic elements that could undermine the 
current legislative framework governing land, including the 2001 Land Law.  Development 
partners report that the current draft available could have serious implications for 
landholders and farming practices due to the imposition of new agricultural development 
areas. Moreover, the draft introduces criminal penalties for any person in contravention of 
the proposed system for management and use of agricultural land. It would also allow the 
transfer of land to or from economic and social land concessions, which could be 
problematic for some landholders.

Human Rights, the covenants and conventions related to human rights, women's and children's

</b></p>
<p>applicability of international human rights norms in Cambodian courts was further 
confirmed by a decision of the Constitutional Council in 2007.131 Since 2007 there have 
been a number of developments related to land concessions at the international level which 
are relevant to Cambodia&#8216;s international commitments and the development of its national 
laws, policy and practices. 
</p>
<p>67. In September 2007, Cambodia voted in favour of the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP),132 which provides an international normative 
foundation for the Government&#8216;s legal framework on the recognition and registration of 
indigenous peoples and their right to own, use and develop their traditional collective lands 
and to have traditional land tenure systems recognized. The adoption of the Declaration 
represents the culmination of decades of advocacy for indigenous peoples&#8216; rights and lays 
</p>
<p>out explicitly the rights to land, culture, livelihood and consultation.133 
</p>
<p>68. The Basic Principles and Guidelines on the right to Development-based 
Displacement and Evictions of 2007 developed by the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing provide a baseline standard related to relocation of people affected by land 
concessions. 134  The Guidelines recommend States explore all possible alternatives to 
evictions and ensure full consultation and participation of affected communities throughout 
the entire process, as well as to provide adequate compensation and restitution to those who 
are relocated or lose land.135 
</p>
<p>69. The Minimum Human Rights Principles Applicable to Large-scale Land 
Acquisitions or Leases developed by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food are also 
particularly relevant in this context.136  The main aim of the Principles is to ensure that 
negotiations leading to land acquisitions and leases comply with a number of procedural

 132 General Assembly Resolution 61/295, 13 September 2007. 
 133 The Declaration recognises the right of indigenous peoples to self-determination (art.1) &#8211; i.e. to freely 
</p>
<p>pursue their economic, social and cultural development, the right to be protected against forced 
evictions (art.10), the right to be protected against forced assimilation or destruction of their culture 
(art.10) and, interrelated, the right to maintain and protect their cultural traditions and customs 
(art.11), spiritual and religious traditions (art.12) and to exercise  their spiritual and traditional 
relationship with the land (art. 25); and more explicitly their right to land (art. 26). Articles 19 and 32 
highlight the need for States to consult with indigenous peoples and to obtain their free, prior and 
informed consent<b> </b>prior to adopting legislative or administrative measures or projects which may 
affect the enjoyment of their rights, in particular &#8213;projects affecting their lands or territories and other 
resources.&#8214; Article 29 underscores indigenous peoples&#8216; right to the conservation and protection of the 
</p>
<p>environment and the productive capacity of their lands or territories and resources. Finally, the 
Declaration also emphasizes indigenous peoples&#8216; right to obtain redress if they are deprived of their 
means of subsistence and development (art. 20, 28, 32, 40).  See also, Report of the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples,

<p>requirements, including the informed participation of local communities. They also seek to 
ensure adequate benefit-sharing and include a proviso that under no circumstances should 
such transactions be allowed to trump the human rights obligations of States. 
</p>
<p>70. In 2009, at the conclusion of its first Universal Periodic Review by the United 
Nations Human Rights Council, the Government of Cambodia accepted all 91 
recommendations made by member States. 137  Among these, several specific 
recommendations were made regarding land issues, such as the need to: implement judicial 
reform to address land issues; intensify efforts to promote fair access to land ownership and 
prevent forced evictions, if not execute a moratorium; and revise policies and practices 
related to resettlement and relocation.138 Furthermore, in 2009 the Human Rights Council in 
its resolution 12/25 on advisory services and technical assistance for Cambodia, following 
on previous resolutions, urged the Government &#8213;to enhance its efforts to resolve equitably 
and expeditiously land ownership issues in a fair and open manner, in accordance with the 
2001 Land Law, by strengthening the implementation of the law through the development 
of national guidelines to clarify relevant procedures, as well as by strengthening the 
capacity and effectiveness of relevant institutions, such as the National Authority for Land-
Dispute Resolution and cadastral committees at the national, provincial and district 
levels.&#8214;139 These sentiments were echoed in the Human Rights Council&#8216;s 2011 resolution.140 
</p>
<p>71. In its 2010 concluding observations, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination (CERD) expressed concerns &#8213;about reports of the rapid granting of 
</p>
<p>concessions of land traditionally occupied by indigenous peoples without full consideration, 
or exhaustion of procedures provided for, under the land law and relevant sub-decrees (arts. 
2 and 5)&#8214; and recommended that the Government adopt protective measures (such as 
</p>
<p>granting delays when issuing land concessions).141 The Committee also expressed concern 
over intimidation and acts of violence against indigenous peoples during forced evictions or 
land disputes affecting them, and recommended the Government provide full protection 
against physical attacks and intimidation as communities seek to exercise their rights to 
claim communal land.142

ensure that a proper balance between development and the rights of its citizens is achieved and that its 
economic development does not come at the expense of the rights of vulnerable persons and groups 
covered by the Convention. It also recommends that the State party develop appropriate protective 
measures, such as a delay in the issuance of a concession on lands inhabited by indigenous 
communities who have applied to be registered legally in order to obtain land titles until the issue of 
collective ownership titles and indigenous peoples&#8216; rights to possess, develop, control and use their 
communal lands, where at issue, has been assessed and determined, and after consultation with and 
the informed consent of the indigenous peoples.&#8214; 
</p>
<p> 142 Ibid., para. 17.  &#8213;The Committee urges the State party to provide full protection to vulnerable groups 
against physical attacks and intimidation as they seek to exercise their rights as they relate to 
communal lands. It urges the State party to bring perpetrators of such violations to justice. In its effort 
to improve the judiciary, the State party should ensure greater efficiency of the judicial system to 
ensure equal access to justice for all, including minorities and indigenous peoples, in conformity with 
the Committee&#8216;s general recommendation No. 31 (2005) on the prevention of racial discrimination in

Rights of the Child (CRC) expressed &#8213;deep concern that thousands of families and children, 
especially urban poor families, small-scale farmers and indigenous communities, continue 
to be deprived of their land as a result of land grabbing and forced evictions carried out by 
people in positions of power.&#8214;143 The Committee recommended that Cambodia &#8213;establish a

<p><b> B. International developments in the human rights responsibilities of

<p>73. Since the 2007 SRSG Report, there have been developments at the international 
level with regard to the State duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, 
including the private sector, and the responsibility of business enterprises.145 On 16 June 
2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council unanimously endorsed the Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations &#8213;Protect, 
Respect and Remedy&#8214; Framework. 146  While not a legally binding document, this 
endorsement established the Guiding Principles as the authoritative global standard for 
preventing and addressing the risk of adverse impacts on human rights linked to business 
activity.147 
</p>
<p>74. The Guiding Principles contain 31 standards148 to support the implementation of the 
United Nations &#8213;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8214; policy framework.149 They are grounded in

<p>  
 143 Committee on the Rights of the Child, Concluding Observations: Cambodia, CRC/C/KHM/CO/2, 20 
</p>
<p>June 2011, para. 61. 
 144 Ibid, para. 62, &#8213;The Committee urges the State party to establish a national moratorium on evictions 
</p>
<p>until the determination of the legality of land claims is made. The Committee also urges the State 
party to ensure that families and their children are not made homeless as a result of evictions for 
private and development activities.  The Committee further recommends that the State party fully 
implement the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
Cambodia in relation to access to land and livelihood (A/HRC/4/36 and A/HRC/7/42).&#8214; 
</p>
<p> 145 Prior to this development, the United Nations Secretary-General launched the voluntary Global 
Compact in 2000, a global platform which convenes businesses together with UN agencies, labour, 
and civil society in support of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption.  In 2005 the 
United Nations Commission on Human Rights (replaced by the Human Rights Council in 2006) 
appointed a Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on the issue of human 
rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises who was mandated to identify and 
clarify standards of corporate responsibility and accountability regarding human rights, including the 
role of States.

<p> 146 See Human Rights Council Resolution A/HRC/17/L.17/Rev.1, 15 June 2011.  The Guiding Principles

<p>recognition of States&#8216; existing obligations to respect, protect and fulfil human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. Therefore, the standards on business and human rights are directly 
relevant to Cambodia through their international legal commitments and domestic law.  The 
Guiding Principles apply to all business enterprises, both transnational and others, 
regardless of their size, sector, location, ownership and structure. Therefore, <i>all</i> businesses 
involved in land concessions in Cambodia (the host State), including business operations 
from foreign countries (the home States) bear the responsibility to protect against human 
rights violations.  
</p>
<p>75. The new United Nations Working Group on Business and Human Rights, 
established in 2011, has undertaken the promotion of the Guiding Principles, the 
endorsement of which has led to a convergence of global standards and initiatives on 
business and human rights, including the standards of the International Standardisation 
Organisation (ISO) Guidance on Corporate Responsibility, Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN 
Global Compact, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Sustainability 
Framework, among others.150 
</p>
<p>76. The 2011 IFC Policy and Performance Standards on Environmental and Social 
Sustainability acknowledges &#8213;an emerging international consensus that the private sector 
has a responsibility to respect human rights,&#8214; including trying to close the gap in protection 
against forced evictions.151 And most recently, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations

steps States should take to foster business&#8216; respect for human rights, providing a standard for 
stakeholders to monitor and assess these steps, and show how businesses can become aware and 
demonstrate to others that they respect human rights and reduce the risk of causing or contributing to 
human rights harm.  They also stipulate what both States and business enterprises should do to 
enhance access to effective remedies for those whose rights have been harmed. 
</p>
<p> 149 The &#8213;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8214; policy framework was unanimously welcomed in 2008 by the 
United Nations Human Rights Council, including (1) State duty to protect against human rights 
abuses by third parties, including business enterprises, through policies, regulation, and adjudication; 
(2) the corporate responsibility to respect human rights, which means that business enterprises should 
act with due diligence to avoid infringing on the rights of others and to address the adverse impacts of 
their activities; and (3) the need for greater access to remedy for victims of business-related abuse, 
both judicial and non-judicial. See &#8213;Protect, Respect and Remedy:&#8214; a framework for business and

</p>
<p>Rights: &#8213;There is an emerging international consensus that the private sector has a responsibility to 
respect human rights. Many corporations, whether IFC clients or not, increasingly acknowledge the 
relevance of greater integration of human rights relevant to business into their due diligence. The 
updated Sustainability Policy proposes that IFC continue to rely on the Performance Standards&#8216; broad 
coverage of human rights issues relevant to business. However, IFC also proposes to explicitly 
acknowledge the responsibility of the private sector to respect human rights and to recognize that it 
may be appropriate for clients to undertake additional due diligence in some high risk circumstances. 
Certain gaps in the current Performance Standards, such as human trafficking, forced evictions, and 
community access to cultural heritage, have been filled in the proposed Performance Standards. IFC 
has worked with Bank staff and management in developing this approach and the specific language.&#8214;  </p>

<p>(ASEAN) announced that the first thematic study by its relatively new Intergovernmental 
Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) would focus on business and human rights in a 
manner that is fully compliant with the United Nations frameworks, especially the Guiding 
Principles.152 The convergence of these standards is directly applicable to the Cambodian 
context, given the large number of business enterprises (including international and 
domestic, and those wholly or partly owned by the State) involved in land concessions.153 
</p>
<p><b> C. International standards for preventing and addressing human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact  
</b></p>
<p>77. There are a myriad of standards which set out the international legal obligations of 
States for addressing environmental and social impact. 154   There are also international 
standards related to corruption, and access to information and transparency specifically.155  
Furthermore, business enterprises are under international obligation to carry out &#8213;due 
diligence,&#8214; or to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they address their adverse 
human rights impacts.156  Not only do businesses have this responsibility, but States are 
required to protect against violations through effective policies and regulations related to 
business activities.  As noted earlier, States have the duty to protect against human rights 
abuses by third parties in their country or area of jurisdiction.  Moreover, they are required 
by international human rights obligations to exercise adequate oversight when they contract 
with or legislate for business enterprises.157 
</p>
<p>78. The process for both States and businesses should include assessing actual and 
potential human rights impacts, integrating and acting upon the findings, tracking 
responses, and communicating how impacts are addressed.158  This applies to all State and 
donor-operated projects and to all business enterprises, regardless of size (whether 
transnational corporations, conglomerates or small and medium owned enterprises), sector, 
structure, ownership or country of domicile or operation (Cambodian or foreign).  In the 
context of land concessions, it may refer directly to environmental and social impact&#8212;
carrying out assessments that involve meaningful consultation with potentially affected 
groups and other relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>79. Moreover, the assessment of impact should be a participatory process and 
development planning should be inclusive of all those potentially affected.  Both the 
International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and on Economic, Social

CERD/C/KHM/CO/8-13, para.17. 
</p>
<p> 154 In addition to the obligations enshrined in the international human rights framework, references can 
be found in international environmental law, for example the Convention on Biological Diversity, to 
which Cambodia acceded in 1995.  Article 8 covers establishing a system of protected areas and 
article 14 covers impact assessment and minimizing adverse impacts.

<p> 155 The United Nations Convention Against Corruption, to which the Royal Government of Cambodia

<p>and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) recognize the right of all individuals and peoples to &#8213;freely 
pursue their economic, social and cultural development.&#8214;  The United Nations Declaration 
on the Right to Development159 laid the foundation for participation and consultation in 
development processes, which was complemented by references in the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which upholds free, prior and informed 
consent.160  This language has been incorporated into other international standards, for 
example the 2011 update on IFC Policy and Performance Standards on Environmental and 
Social Sustainability.161 
</p>
<p>80. In addition to the international human rights obligations of States and businesses, 
there are practical, operational and logistical reasons for incorporating these requirements 
into business and development activities, and many governments have incorporated these 
standards into their national laws and policies, and companies into their standard 
operations.162 
</p>
<p><b> V. Overview of ELCs and other concessions in Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Official number of ELCs and other concessions granted (overview) 
</b></p>
<p>81. According to official statistics available for 1998, Cambodia&#8216;s total territory is 18.1 
million hectares, of which 6.5 million hectares is considered arable and up to 2.7 million 
hectares reasonably productive.163 The number of ELCs listed in the previous two SRSG 
reports were based on official information from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries, the Council for the Development of Cambodia, and other official sources, 
including local authorities. The 2004 SRSG report listed 64 ELCs that had been granted or 
for which approval had been sought in 13 provinces. Based on information provided by the 
MAFF in early 2007, from 1992 to December 2006, the Government granted 97 ELCs in 16 
provinces and municipalities. Of these nine concessions had been agreed to in principle by 
the Council of Ministers, covering an area of 64,208 hectares.  The 2007 SRSG Report 
listed 59 concessions as of 31 December 2006 (multiple concession contracts were 
cancelled from 1992 to the end of 2006), covering an area of 943,069 hectares in 15 
provinces.

<p>82. The only publicly available official data on ELCs are posted on the MAFF website, 
however, the information provided, including company profile, has not been regularly 
updated, and data regarding ELCs is incomplete. In June 2012, a table on the statistics of 
ELC companies that have signed a contract with MAFF was uploaded, listing 117 
companies with a land surface of 1,181,522 hectares from January 1996 to 6 June 2012.164 
The table lists 24 companies that signed an ELC contract with MAFF in 2011, 15 
companies in 2010, 18 companies in 2009, 15 companies in 2008, 5 companies in 2007, 17 
companies in 2006, 8 companies in 2005, 2 companies in 2004, 6 companies from 2000 to 
2001, and 7 companies from 1996 to 1999. The table listed four companies that signed an 
ELC contract with MAFF in 2012, one of which signed the contract after the 7 May 2012 
ELC directive to halt the granting of economic land concessions.165  According to sub-
decrees published in the Council of Minister&#8216;s Royal Gazette, a further five concessions 
</p>
<p>were granted to private companies on 7 June 2012, all of which are located in protected 
areas.166 Given the irregularity of the official data available, a reliable tally is not possible. 
</p>
<p>83. Although the data on ELCs contained in the MAFF website was updated in June 
2012, the list does not include a considerable number of agricultural concessions that are 
known to exist, in some cases for several years. Many of these developments include 
concessions that have been granted within protected areas and for which sub-decrees 
designate areas as sustainable use zones for agricultural investment. It is possible that these 
concessions were granted by authorities other than MAFF, and this is why they are not 
included in the MAFF list of ELCs, but it is of considerable concern that these projects are 
not cohesively documented. 
</p>
<p>84. Regarding the granting of social land concessions, the Ministry of Land 
Management, Urban Planning and Construction reports having distributed land to both 
civilians and veterans of the armed forces. For example, in recent years, in addition to land 
given as gifts, social land concessions have been distributed to 50 civilian households in 
Kampot province, 288 in Oddar Meanchey province, 174 in Svey Reang province, and 225 
in Kampong Cham province. In cooperation with development partners, many additional 
households received land according to the Ministry, including 2,285 households in Kratie, 
Kampong Cham, and Kampong Thom provinces (with support from GIZ); 510 households 
in Battambang province (with support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency, 
JICA) and another 405 households in Battambang province (with support from NGO 
Habitat for Humanity); 510 households in Kampong Speu province (with support from 
NGO Life With Dignity) and 893 households in Kampong Chhnang province (with support 
from NGO Life with Dignity). In the form of state land regularization in forest areas, 
11,828 hectares of land have been distributed to 3,790 households in Kratie province, 6,257 
hectares to 4,239 households in Bantheay Meanchey province, 4,929 hectares to 2,153

<p>households in Kampong Cham province, 222 hectares to 270 households in Oddar

Battambang province. According to the Ministry, the total distribution of land for poor 
civilians in all forms is 194,820 hectares for 30,588 households, including 3,965 houses.167 
The Ministry also reported on the process for granting land concessions to veterans, 
soldiers with disabilities and families of fallen soldiers. 
</p>
<p>85. Cambodia&#8216;s extractive industries (including mining, oil and gas) and energy sector 
are currently undergoing expansion. The mining sector currently includes operations for 
small-scale extraction and production of materials, especially those related to the 
construction industry, for example gravel, limestone, and sand, as well as exploration for 
bauxite and gold.  According to the local organization Development and Partnership in 
Action (DPA) and the Extractive Industries Social and Environmental Impact (EISEI) 
Network, 167 mining companies had received mining exploration licenses as of May 
2010.168 As for petroleum, Cambodia is currently in the exploration phase, and the website 
of the Cambodia National Petroleum Authority lists the onshore and offshore operations 
currently under investigation.169 
</p>
<p>86. As regards hydropower, at present there are three dams operational in Cambodia: 
Kirirom I, Kampong Speu province, with a capacity of 12MW, Ochum II, Rattanakiri 
province (1MW), and the recently opened Kamchay hydropower dam in Kampot 
(193MW).  There is reportedly a further five large-scale hydropower projects under 
development, including the Kirirom III (18MW), Lower Russei Chrum (338MW), Stung 
Tatay (246MW), all in Koh Kong province, and the Stung Atay (120MW) in Pursat 
province. Additionally, at least nine other projects are subject to agreements to undertake 
feasibility studies.  There is reportedly one coal-fired plant under development.170 
</p>
<p><b> B. Access to information and documents 
</b></p>
<p>87. As discussed earlier, despite recent efforts by MAFF to update its website, data on 
ELCs remains incomplete, including some company details, name and nationality of 
director, but not shareholders and affiliates.171  Moreover, the information provided does 
not include concessions of 1,000 hectares or below. As mentioned above, it appears that 
some concessions or long-term leases over state land have been granted or approved by 
other ministries, such as MEF and MoE, but full data on these types of concession have not 
been made publicly available. Access to the information on those land concessions and 
companies has only been obtained through exhaustive reviews of the sub-decrees published 
in the Council of Minister&#8216;s Official Gazette, and there is no easily accessible or searchable

decisions to reclassify certain areas of land as private state land or designate land within 
protected areas as sustainable use zones in order to facilitate and legitimize development 
therein. The lack of transparency and information surrounding land concessions granted 
within protected areas under the administration of the Ministry of Environment is of serious 
concern, and it is not clear whether the legal and procedural requirements for 
reclassification of state public land and the granting of concessions have been completed 
before concession activity begins. 
</p>
<p>88. Despite the dearth of publicly available information, the Government has pledged in 
its National Strategic Development Plan Update to &#8213;equitable and fair public participation 
in all matters through democratic and peaceful means to ensure that the free will and 
informed choices of the majority are adopted and implemented while at the same time 
protecting the rights and welfare of the minority.&#8214; 173  Indeed, a core element of the

<p>89. As one of the main objectives of this report is to promote transparency and to 
provide a balanced analysis that incorporates the appropriate ministries&#8216; perspective and

 175 Specifically, I requested updated information on the status and profile of all ELCs granted up until 
</p>
<p>April 2012 in Cambodia and the businesses involved, given that this information is not readily 
available on the website of the Ministry.  I requested data on the size and use of concessions; 
contracts and details of ownership; maps and geo-referencing data; and information required to grant 
concessions, such as the classification and registration of land, environmental and social impact 
assessments, and records of public consultations, as well as details regarding resolutions to land 
conflict associated with ELCs. I also requested information on the progress of an Economic Land 
Concession Logbook, and the work of the Technical Secretariat on ELCs.  Finally, I also requested 
information on efforts the Ministry is making to protect the environment and foster sustainable 
development practices when granting economic and other land concessions. 
</p>
<p> 176 Specifically, I requested information on the role of the Ministry in the process of granting economic 
and other land concessions, in particular regarding the registration of land concessions in accordance 
with article 53 of the 2001 Land Law.  Most significantly, I was interested in: information on the 
systematic mapping, classification and registration of state public and private land in Cambodia; the 
creation and maintenance of a state land database; and the allocation, management and 
reclassification of state land in accordance with the Sub-Decree on State Land Management of 2005.  
In addition, I requested information on the activities of the Cadastral Commission and the progress 
the Commission has had so far in its mission to resolve land conflicts relating to unregistered land on 
which people claim possession rights (i.e. disputes occurring outside adjudication areas, and the 
disputes within adjudication areas that cannot be resolved by the Administrative Commission), as 
well as information about social land concessions.  Finally, I requested information on efforts the 
Ministry was making to protect the environment and foster sustainable development practices in the 
context of economic and other land concessions. </p>

<p>and the Ministry of Environment.177  I regret that I received no response from MAFF.178  
Useful information was provided by the MoE during my meeting with the Minister in May 
2012, however, the information was incomplete and no additional information has been 
received subsequently. On 12 June 2012, I received a response from MLMUPC on land 
registration and social land concessions. 
</p>
<p>90. Currently the most accessible publicly available information on economic and other 
land concessions and the business enterprises involved, although also missing data, are non-
governmentally run open data sources and web portals, such as the Open Data Cambodia 
Project (Open Development Cambodia) and the Sithi Project of the Cambodian Centre for 
Human Rights, in addition to thorough research and monitoring by non-governmental 
development, environmental and human rights organizations.179  Mapping of concessions in 
Cambodia through global positioning system (GPS) data has advanced considerably since 
the 2007 SRSG Report. Licadho, amongst others, has contributed significantly in terms of 
mapping of concessions nationally. In June 2012, the Open Development Cambodia 
website listed a total number of 320 ELCs in 21 provinces including Phnom Penh, granted 
to foreign and local companies,  87 mining concessions (mainly for exploration) in 19 
provinces, and 23 special economic zones in 8 provinces. 180  The Sithi Project has 
publicized a land conflicts map organized by province, which documents 223 cases publicly 
reported from 2007-2011, including ownership disputes, land grabs and land evictions, but 
does not disaggregate the cases related to economic and other land concessions.181 
</p>
<p>91. The implementation of the ELC directive of May 2012 on land titling for landless 
communities is also problematic in terms of access to information.  Without first providing 
clear details on the new policy&#8216;s implementation to relevant ministries, communities, local

<p>  
 177 Specifically, I requested information on any concessions that may have been granted within protected 
</p>
<p>areas and information on the status and profile of all the business enterprises that have received land 
concessions in protected areas through April 2012.  I requested information on the purpose of the land 
concessions, size and use of concessions; contracts and details of ownership; maps and geo-
referencing data; and information required to grant concessions (classification and registration of 
land, environmental and social impact assessments, and records of public consultations).  Regarding 
the status of protected areas, I requested information on progress made since the adoption of the 2008 
Protected Areas Law, including: establishment and modification of protected areas and the sub-decree 
that defines these areas; the status of zoning or modification of the zone boundary; the national 
strategic and activity plan for protected area management; the involvement and access rights of local 
communities and indigenous people communities as provided under Chapter 6 of the law; setting up

<p>authorities, provincial authorities, owners of concession companies, donors involved in the 
land sector, or non-governmental organizations and community networks, a large group of 
youth was recruited and deployed in late June 2012 to demarcate land.  Various policy 
documents and instructions were issued and publicized only after the demarcation had 
begun.182  These documents, however, did not make it clear which concessions would be 
targeted for titling according to the &#8213;leopard skin policy.&#8214;  Despite the plan to demarcate 
land for titling within ELCs, many concessionaires were reportedly unaware that the land 
they were using would be part of the new scheme until the youth arrived on the property. 
</p>
<p>92. The Council of Ministers issued a letter on 26 June 2012 to the Ministry of Land 
Management, Urban Planning and Construction, informing them of the implementation of 
the May 2012 ELC directive.183 On 4 July 2012, the Council for Land Policy issued a 
further instruction to the head of the Committee for State Land Management in all 
provinces regarding the implementation of the directive concerning indigenous land, areas 
with evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forests, and dense forests, as well as national defence 
bases and cultural heritage sites.184 On 20 July 2012, the Council for Land Policy issued a 
further instruction on the identification of landholders and the issuance of initial certificates 
of ownership in the implementation of the directive.185 Indeed, the progressive nature of the 
instructions and announcements issued in the aftermath of the deployment of youth to 
demarcate suggests a lack of comprehensive planning and harmonization with the existing 
legal framework and land titling system. 
</p>
<p>  
 182 The initiative is reportedly financed by the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and 
</p>
<p>Construction, and subsidized by the Prime Minister&#8216;s personal funds, according to an announcement 
</p>
<p>during a 14 June 2012 speech. 
 183 Letter of the Council of Ministers. No.666 Sor.Cho.Nor, 26 June 2012, informed the Minister of 
</p>
<p>MLMUPC of the Government&#8216;s decision to conduct expedited land registration in areas targeted for 
</p>
<p>the implementation of PM&#8216;s Directive 01. The letter stated that the targeted areas include lands that 
have been excised from forest concessions, economic land concessions, land administered by the 
Ministry of Environment, and state land where there is an order to reclaim it by the 
provincial/municipal authority. Land ownership is to be granted to land holders who claim land not 
exceeding five hectares in such areas through two stages, first to grant preliminary land title, and 
second to be issued with the definite land title. For lands exceeding five hectares, only the portion that 
has been cultivated with crops shall be granted land ownership, and the uncultivated portion shall be 
registered as state private land and then granted to the holder in the form of small-scale economic 
land concessions for a period of 99 years. Those who have received land through the Government&#8216;s 
social land concession programme will be issued a certificate during this transitional period.

Effective Management of Economic Land Concessions in Areas of Indigenous Communities, 
Evergreen Forest, Semi-Evergreen Forest, Dense Forest, and in Areas of National Defence Bases and 
Historical and Cultural Heritage Sites, signed by Senior Minister of the MLMUPC. The Instruction 
provides for indigenous peoples who choose to live individually without entering as a member of an 
indigenous community to have private ownership on the land parcel that they have occupied and 
cultivated, and requires that the provincial Committee of State Land Management shall submit a 
proposal for reclassification if the land in question is state public land. It also instructs that in the 
process of land identification, if there are citizens claiming and/or requesting for pieces of land 
situated in areas of evergreen forests, semi-evergreen forests, dense forest, national defence bases and 
historical and cultural heritage sites, such claims and demands shall not be considered.

</p>
<p><b> C. Number of ELCs and other concessions granted within protected areas 
</b></p>
<p><b>and on the land of indigenous peoples  
</b></p>
<p>93. Many concessions have been granted within protected areas over the past few years. 
The Government granted land concessions to at least 109 companies in 16 out of the 23 
protected areas established by the 1993 Royal Decree, most of them sub-decrees signed for 
agro-industry and eco-tourism purposes (see Annex I &#8211; Table on land concessions granted 
within protected areas). The Ministry of Environment affirmed that some land concessions 
have been granted in protected areas under the Ministry&#8216;s administration and management, 
but only in the buffer areas of the protected areas (or in sustainable use zones) in order to 
prevent the further destruction of the forest and natural resources in the core and 
conservation zones. According to information provided by the MoE on the total land 
surface exploited in natural protected areas, 2011 data shows that out of the total protected 
land surface area of 3,143,763 hectares, there are 322,113 hectares used for rubber 
plantations; 172,731 hectares used for other agro-industrial crops; 38,831 hectares used for 
mining exploration; 4,593 hectares used for hydro-power dams; and 89,359 hectares used 
for eco-tourism.186  This totals 627,627 hectares, or just under 20 percent of Cambodia&#8216;s 
total protected areas. 
</p>
<p>94. As the Ministry of Environment and MAFF did not provide the detailed official 
information requested, it is not possible to confirm the current exact number of land 
concessions and other development projects in protected areas.  According to a report 
released in March 2012 by NGO Adhoc, in 2011 the Government had issued 123 sub-
decrees to grant land concessions to private companies with a land area of 751,882 
hectares; most of the land was excised from protected areas, including wildlife sanctuaries 
and national parks.187 Concessions granted to private companies covered more than 500,000 
hectares within protected areas. 
</p>
<p>95. Many concessions have been granted on indigenous peoples&#8216; land, despite 
protections under the 2001 Land Law and April 2009 sub-decree on indigenous land 
registration. The 2007 SRSG Report listed at least 25 ELCs known to affect indigenous 
land in Kampong Thom, Kratie, Mondulkiri, Oddar Meanchey, Rattanakiri and Stung 
Treng provinces, as well as concessions for other purposes on indigenous land in Kampong 
Speu (Oral district), Mondulkiri (Bousra commune), Pursat and Preah Vihear provinces. At 
the time of reporting, at least 98 land concessions were granted on indigenous peoples&#8216; land 
(see Annex II &#8211; Table on land concessions granted in areas inhabited and traditionally used 
by indigenous communities). 
</p>
<p><b> VI. The law and the practice: concessions and compliance with 
legal requirements and procedures 
</b></p>
<p>96. Given the relatively well-developed legal and policy framework governing the 
granting and management of economic land concessions, as outlined in section III, it is 
difficult to reconcile the current practice.  The promotion of private sector investment 
appears to have taken precedent over compliance with the requirements of the law, 
resulting in the granting of large tracts of land in protected areas, on the land of indigenous 
peoples, and in primary forest areas.  Moreover, there is a lack of transparency, oversight, 
and public monitoring and reporting in relation to concessions granted. As mining,

</b></p>
<p>hydropower projects, and other types of concessions are less numerous and comprehensive 
data is more difficult to obtain, this section of the report focuses for the most part on the 
legal compliance of ELCs. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Size and ownership 
</b></p>
<p>97. There is evidence that suggests concessionaires have been allowed to circumvent the 
10,000 hectare per person limit on concessions established in article 59 of the 2001 Land 
Law by obtaining separate but contiguous concessions and using them for the same purpose 
(see maps in Annex V). 188  In some cases, the same company has registered adjacent 
concessions separately, but they are listed using the name of a family member or affiliate 
(who would be categorized as a legal entity controlled by the same person). While the 
majority of concessions granted since the promulgation of the 2001 Land Law do not 
exceed the 10,000 hectare limit, the 2007 SRSG Report cited nine ELCs that do. 189 
According to the most recent MAFF list, no ELCs exceeding 10,000 hectares have been 
granted since the 2007 SRSG Report. 
</p>
<p>98. Nevertheless, although difficult to track, there are several possible new violations.  
For example, two concessions approved by the Government in February 2010 for a sugar 
cane plantation were granted to Cambodian Senator Oknha Ly Yong Phat and his wife, 
Mrs. Kim Heang, in Kampong Speu province. The concessions were granted to the Phnom 
Penh Sugar Company (8,506 hectares) and Kampong Speu Sugar Company (8,245 
hectares).190 In addition, three concessions were granted in January 2008 for a sugar cane 
plantation in Oddar Meanchey province to three companies associated with Senator Ly 
Yong Phat: Angkor Sugar (6,523 hectares), the Tonle Sugar Cane Company (6,618 
hectares) and the Cane and Sugar Valley Company (6,595 hectares). All three companies

communities widely believe the project to be connected to Senator Ly Yong Phat.191 
</p>
<p>99. In Preah Vihear province, ELCs were granted on 8 November 2011 in neighbouring 
Chheb, Chey Sen, and Tbeng Meanchey districts for acacia and sugar cane production to 
five affiliated companies:  Heng Non (Cambodia) International Company, Ltd. (6,488 
hectares), Heng You (Cambodia) International Company, Ltd. (8,959 hectares), Heng Roi 
(Cambodia) International Company, Ltd. (9,119 hectares), Lan Feng (Cambodia) 
International Company, Ltd. (9,015 hectares), and Roi Feng (Cambodia) International 
Company, Ltd. (8,841 hectares).192 
</p>
<p>100. In Mondulkiri province, neighbouring ELCs were granted in September 2011 in 
Royor commune of Koh Nhek district for a rubber plantation to four affiliated companies: 
Pacific Grand Joint-Stock Company (9,656 hectares), Pacific Pearl Joint-Stock Company 
Ltd. (9,614 hectares), Pacific Lotus Joint-Stock Company (9,014 hectares), and Pacific 
Pride Joint-Stock Company (9,773 hectares).193 
</p>
<p><b> B. Review, oversight and cancellation 
</b></p>
<p>101. Another phenomenon is the illicit use or non-exploitation of land after a land 
concession has been granted. Chapter 2 of the National Strategic Development Plan Update 
states that &#8213;land concentration and landless people are on a rising trend, adversely 
</p>
<p>impacting on the equity and efficiency of land use.  On the other hand, large areas under 
economic land concessions have not been utilized efficiently as targeted, needing strict 
government measures to tackle them.&#8214;194 While some in the Government are aware of and 
have made efforts to combat this problem, resulting in the cancellation of land concession 
contracts in some cases, there has been irregular oversight over the use of land granted 
through concessions, with inadequate management and monitoring.   
</p>
<p>102. The 2007 SRSG Report stated that in December 2005 MAFF advised that ten active 
concessionaires had been reviewed, and that, apart from the cancellations of some 
concessions, it was not clear whether a general review of existing concessions had 
commenced. The largest concessions, including the Pheapimex concession in Pursat and 
Kampong Chhnang provinces and the Green Sea concession covering 100,852 hectares in 
Stung Treng province, had not been reduced. More current yet still outdated information 
found on the MAFF website reports that from May to June 2009, MAFF organized five 
working groups tasked with reviewing and evaluating all existing ELCs. This resulted in 
the cancellation of five ELCs.195

</p>
<p> 192 These five companies signed a contract on the same date (8 November 2011), according to the June 
2012 MAFF list.  According to the Ministry of Commerce website, these companies are registered at 
the same address in Cambodia and China, although with different directors&#8216; names. 
</p>
<p> 193 According to MAFF, all companies signed a contract on 9 September 2011, and according to the 
Ministry of Commerce website, these companies are registered at the same address in Cambodia and 
at different addresses in Vietnam. 
</p>
<p> 194 National Strategic Development Plan Update, page 10. 
 195 According to the overview of ELCs on the MAFF website, up to April 2010, nine economic land 
</p>
<p>concessions covering an area of more than 10,000 hectares were subject to negotiations to reduce the 
area to 10,000 hectares. Between May and June 2009, MAFF established five working groups to 
review and evaluate all economic land concession companies in 16 provinces.  In July 2009, the

<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>103. More recently, according to a MAFF report, the Ministry set up a mixed working 
group including the Technical Secretariat of ELCs to undertake a countrywide review and 
evaluation of concessions in January 2011.196 The findings resulted in a proposal by MAFF 
to the Prime Minister to cancel the ELC contracts of 12 companies due to their inactivity 
and non-compliance with their contractual obligations and master plan, including allowing 
illegal logging and land encroachment within the granted areas.197 The review also found 
that 51 companies had implemented their activities according to their contract agreements 
and master plans and 75 companies were given a warning or advised to correct 
irregularities.198  
</p>
<p>104. According to MAFF statistics from 8 June 2012, the largest ELC holder, Pheapimex 
Company owned by Oknha Lao Meng Khin continued to hold the same land area of 
315,028 hectares, while Green Sea Company owned by Cambodian Senator Oknha Mong 
Reththy in Stung Treng province was still listed as holding a land area of either 100,852 
hectares or &#8213;approximately&#8214; 70,000 hectares, but the current size is unclear.199  In addition, 
two affiliated companies, First Bio-Tech Agricultural (Cambodia) and World Tristar 
Entertainment (Cambodia) in Chhouk district, Kampot province, as well as Heng Brother 
and Heng Heap companies, both in Rattanakiri province, all supposedly had their  contracts 
cancelled but nevertheless were listed among the MAFF&#8216;s current ELC statistics of 8 June 
</p>
<p>2012.   
</p>
<p>105. Although the Government has made efforts to address the problem of inactive or 
improperly developed concessions, the statistics reveal that the review, oversight and 
cancellation of land concession contracts that have been conducted so far has not been 
consistent.  The 7 May 2012 directive on ELCs expressly aims to address this challenge. 
</p>
<p>  
working groups submitted reports to MAFF, after which MAFF has evaluated and issued guidance to 
38 companies that were progressing slowly or late to start activities within the concession. MAFF also 
requested that the Government cancel a number of concessions, which resulted in the eventual 
cancellation of five ELCs with a land area equal to 40,171 hectares.

</p>
<p>For companies already granted the use of land under an ELC, but failing to comply with 
applicable procedures and contracts, the Government has pledged to withdraw the ELC and 
place the land under direct control of the State.  Although no public study has surfaced, as 
at the time of writing this report, there is information that ad hoc review efforts are 
underway at the provincial level, as well as some media reports that some concessions have 
been cancelled through the implementation of the directive. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Compliance with the framework for conservation of protected areas 
</b></p>
<p><b>and forests  
</b></p>
<p>106. Under the 2008 Protected Areas Law, the Ministry of Environment is authorized to 
establish or modify protected areas according to specific criteria and following careful 
review of access to natural resources and land use. Boundary alteration or re-classifying 
protected areas must be done by sub-decree.200 At the time of writing, information that the 
Ministry of Environment had established or formally modified any protected areas had not 
been made publicly available, but increased numbers of land concessions, including ELCs, 
mining exploration licences, and large scale development projects have been granted within 
protected areas. 
</p>
<p>107. However, it has been observed that in practice, the systematic zoning for most 
protected areas is often not formally determined prior to a parcel of land being considered 
for a concession or development project.  Rather, it appears that in many cases the zoning 
within protected areas is being decided upon the granting of land concessions or 
development projects.  In some cases the process to designate an area as a sustainable use 
zone was decided only after a private company proposed a land concession or development 
project to the relevant government ministry, which then requested the Ministry of 
Environment to proceed with the necessary documentation to designate the status of the 
land as a sustainable use zone, and to reclassify the designated sustainable use zones as 
private state land. An example is the concession granted to Jing Zhong Ri Company within 
Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary (see Annex IV for further analysis). 
</p>
<p>108. Most of the Government sub-decrees which serve to designate proposed areas for 
concessions within protected areas only state that &#8213;land has been determined as a 
</p>
<p>sustainable use zone,&#8214; but do not mention the type of zone of the land area prior to this (See 
</p>
<p>Annex I). It is therefore not clear if core or conservation zones are being reclassified, or if 
the areas in question were not previously demarcated according to the protected areas 
zoning system. 
</p>
<p>109. Although there is little information available to the public on the zoning of protected 
areas, it is thought that very few core zones and conservation zones have been formally 
demarcated. As noted earlier in the report, the law prohibits clearance or building in the 
core or conservation zones, and any development within the sustainable use or community 
zones can only take place with the appropriate approval from the Government at the request 
of the Ministry of Environment. Any development in these areas or in areas adjacent to 
protected areas must first be subject to an environmental and social impact assessment. 
While there is a need for further clarification from the Ministry of Environment regarding 
systematic zoning, it has been reported that many concessions are active in the central parts 
</p>
<p>  
 200 Royal Decree of 1 November 1993 on the Protection of Natural Areas, article 3, allowed for the 
</p>
<p>modification of the boundaries of protected areas provided this was &#8213;on the basis of scientific 
information involved in the conservation of ecology and the maintenance of the existing landscape in 
the Kingdom of Cambodia.&#8214; The 2008 Protected Areas Law, articles 8 and 13, also allows boundary 
alterations following full assessment of a proposal to modify the boundary. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>43 
</b></p>
<p>of protected areas where there is primary forest. For example, Licadho has published data 
stating that 22 percent of the Boeung Per Wildlife Sanctuary has been covered by rubber 
plantations.201 
</p>
<p>110. The Ministry of Environment, which was very cooperative during my May 2012 
visit, explained to me the Government&#8216;s policy in granting concessions in protected areas&#8216; 
sustainable use zones, including hydropower dams, eco-tourism projects, mining 
exploration and agro-industrial crop production, as necessary to set up a protected frontier 
to prevent further encroachment on the forest land within protected areas, in particular core 
zones and the conservation zones. The Ministry also maintains that it implements the 
&#8213;leopard skin policy,&#8214; which aims to avoid affecting community land. 
</p>
<p>111. Due to these practices, there is concern that sub-decrees are being used 
opportunistically as a means for the Government to designate land within protected areas 
and grant it to concession companies.  Upon review of sub-decrees published in the Royal 
Gazette, it appears that they are used on a regular basis to designate parcels of land as 
sustainable use zones within protected areas with no information provided as to whether 
full prior assessments and consultations have been conducted.    
</p>
<p>112. Moreover, as the name of the company is often mentioned in the sub-decree (often 
with reference to prior written correspondence), a reasonable observer would conclude that 
an arrangement has already been made with a prospective company to move forward with 
development in that area. In a number of instances, some weeks or months after an initial 
sub-decree, a further sub-decree is issued which classifies the assigned sustainable use zone 
land as private state land, thereby ensuring its eligibility to be granted as an economic or 
other type of land concession. This raises the question as to whether it is fully in 
compliance with the existing legal framework for the Government to reclassify state public 
land without going through the National Assembly. 
</p>
<p>113. A further example is provided in the commercial development zone and resort 
project being developed in Koh Kong province by Union Development Group (Annex III).  
Before the Government signed a long-term lease of 99 years to grant 36,000 hectares to the 
company within Botum Sakor National Park, a Royal Decree was executed on 9 April 2008 
to amend the Royal Decree of 1 November 1993, which recognized this area as a protected 
national park.  The new Royal Decree excised 36,000 hectares from Botum Sakor National 
Park&#8216;s 171,250 hectares and reclassified the excised area as state private land.  This allowed 
the Government to sign the lease with the company in May 2008, without passing though 
the National Assembly.  It will be recalled that under the Land Law, state public land can 
only be reclassified as state private land through declassification by a law passed by the 
National Assembly.202 
</p>
<p><b> D. Public consultations and environmental and social impact assessments  
</b></p>
<p>114. As described in detail in section III, under the Cambodian legal framework essential 
pre-conditions for granting land concessions are public consultations and environmental 
and social impact assessments.  Assessments are to be undertaken and reviewed, with the 
findings shared before the granting of concessions. 
</p>
<p>115. As mentioned in the 2007 SRSG Report, in most cases, there is little evidence that 
adequate public consultations (entailing good faith efforts to engage with all affected and to 
reach mutually agreed upon solutions) have been conducted prior to the granting of many

<p>concessions.  In contrast, decisions affecting the land on which communities live are often 
made without their involvement.  Similarly, in most cases, genuine environmental and 
social impact assessments have generally not been undertaken before the granting of land 
for investment, or have been undertaken in some cases but not publicized or shared with 
affected communities.   
</p>
<p>116. Concessions that have been granted since 2007 seem to reflect this trend. The latest 
list of ELCs provided on MAFF&#8216;s website shows that impact assessments were done on 
</p>
<p>three of 117 concessions granted, following official approval of the companies&#8216; investment 
(<i>after</i> the company has already signed a contract with MAFF). 203  This leaves unclear 
whether any assessment on ELCs granted by MAFF between 2006 and 2012 have been 
conducted, and, if so, whether the results of an assessment had been approved by the 
concerned Ministry before the companies started their activity.  
</p>
<p>117. According to the National Strategic Development Plan Update, in 2008 the Ministry 
of Environment reviewed and provided recommendations on environmental and social 
impact assessment reports for 37 public and private projects, a small fraction of the total 
number of concessions granted. Only 15 reports in the agricultural, industrial, energy, 
tourism and infrastructure sectors have been endorsed and none are publicly available. The 
Ministry of Environment also signed agreements with 61 investors on environmental 
protection, yet there is not information available on their implementation.204 
</p>
<p><b> E. Compliance with the legal protections for the land of indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples 
</b></p>
<p>118. The 2001 Land Law enshrines the rights of indigenous peoples to land, and the 
adoption of the sub-decree on indigenous land registration in April 2009 set in motion 
various initiatives by the Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Rural Development, 
MLMUPC, bilateral donors, United Nations, and NGOs to assist indigenous communities 
to register as legal entities and apply for collective land titles. A pilot project was launched 
in 2009 to secure the collective land title of three indigenous communities in Rattanakiri 
and Mondulkiri provinces.  In December 2011, these communities received the first 
collective land titles in Cambodia, a milestone achievement.205 
</p>

on 15 March 2006 for 10,000 hectares and 9,583 hectares, respectively.  The former company had 
their EIA approved through a letter of 16 January 2007 and the latter on 31 January 2007.  Tong Min 
Group Engineering in Kratie district, Kratie province signed an ELC contract with MAFF on 8 
December 2008 for 7,465 hectares and has already undertaken an EIA, but it has yet to be approved.

land titles on 1,454 hectares of land; 2) La L'eun Kraen village, Ou Chum commune, Ou Chum

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>119. At the time of writing, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), 60 
indigenous communities in four provinces (Mondulkiri, Rattanakiri, Kratie, and Kampong 
Speu) have been recognized by the Ministry of Rural Development as indigenous peoples 
based on self-identification, 43 indigenous communities have been recognized as legal 
entities by the Ministry of Interior, and at least 24 indigenous communities have developed 
their internal rules or are in the process of submitting applications for collective land title to 
the MLMUPC.206 
</p>
<p>120. Although these numbers represent positive steps for the protection of the land, 
culture, language and traditions of these communities, there are many more indigenous 
peoples across 15 provinces which are in need of support for the protection of their 
traditionally occupied lands in the face of unregulated development.  The granting of 
concessions on indigenous peoples&#8216; land affects the cohesiveness of the community and, 
therefore their ability to apply for communal land title, in turn affecting their livelihood and 
ability to gather food and forest products and to practice their cultural rights. One example 
is the rubber plantation company of Jing Zhong Ri Cambodia on Tumpoun indigenous land 
in Lumpat district, Rattanakiri province which I have visited (See Annex IV). 
</p>
<p>121. Moreover, despite relatively robust laws and policies at the national level, this 
process is entirely dependent on external donor aid and uneven political will applied on a 
case by case basis.  It also requires the availability of field-based civil society organizations 
in the provinces for implementation. According to information on ongoing projects 
provided by the ILO, which coordinates the initiatives, while areas with high populations of 
indigenous peoples such as Mondulkiri, Rattanakiri and Preah Vihear provinces have 
received the most attention and bilateral and multilateral financial assistance from GIZ, 
Danida, CIDA, OHCHR, as well as civil society organizations with EU funding, the 
initiatives are slow to expand to other provinces due to limited capacity and resources.207 
</p>
<p>122. There are reportedly many challenges with the procedural requirements for 
registering an indigenous community as a legal entity and applying for collective land title, 
which is lengthy and over-burdened by bureaucratic processes.  While the relevant policy 
envisages a process &#8213;simple in both administrative and technical aspects,&#8214;208 in practice, 
there are currently 11 steps for legal registration and application for title. This includes 
various procedures involving national, provincial and local authorities in the formal 
recognition of communities as being indigenous based on self-identification and official 
appraisal, and development of community by-laws and registration as legal entities. This is 
followed by the development of internal rules and land demarcation and mapping and the 
public display of results.  On the other hand, a positive aspect of the process is that the 
procedures are taking place with the participation of a range of stakeholders and with the 
full involvement of communities, and this is to be praised. 
</p>
<p>123. Given the lengthy procedure for registration of indigenous land, the May 2011 Inter-
ministerial Circular, which provides interim protective measures for indigenous peoples 
registered with the Ministry of the Interior, is a welcome development.  In effect, it should 
have halted the granting of land concessions on land traditionally occupied by indigenous 
peoples.  For example, the Phnong peoples from at least two villages in Keo Seima district, 
Mondulkiri province were granted protection by the Mondulkiri provincial governor in 
2011 and 2012 while undergoing their application for collective land title. Though the

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>requirement for the recognition of indigenous peoples by the Ministry of Interior pertains to 
only the communities who have benefited from development partner assistance, even so 
currently 35 communities are eligible.  The designation, however, requires supplying 
elaborate maps of the proposed communal land to the MLMUPC, and the absence of the 
detailed maps is grounds for rejection. It also depends on the will of the respective 
provincial governor.  Only a handful of communities have been granted this protection in 
practice. 
</p>
<p>124. In addition, there is one unfortunate loophole to the Circular, which in practice has 
further served to ensure its broad non-implementation.  Interim protective measures exclude 
plots that the Government has agreed <i>in principle</i> for investment or development prior to 
the Circular coming into effect in May 2011 (according to the Circular, to avoid any impact 
on legal private and public ownership of lands that have been legally occupied and agreed 
in accordance with existing legal provisions).  Given the irregular granting of land 
concessions and successful efforts to circumvent the legal framework, the Circular has had 
minimal impact.   
</p>
<p>125. As regards the ongoing support from donors and civil society organizations to assist 
indigenous communities to organize, many of these initiatives are at risk of being derailed, 
if not entirely abandoned, due to inconsistent practices associated with the new scheme for 
land titling, per the 7 May 2012 ELC directive.  
</p>
<p>126. A subsequent instruction was issued on 4 July 2012 by the Council for Land Policy 
clarifying that any ongoing process would be honoured.209 A further instruction issued on 
26 July 2012 directs provincial authorities not to demarcate the communal land of 
indigenous peoples as part of the titling scheme. 210 Nevertheless, indigenous peoples &#8211; 
many of whom are not aware of their rights to communal land &#8211; are in some cases 
reportedly being encouraged to accept private land by local officials involved in the new 
scheme. Indeed, while all individuals including indigenous people have the right to private 
land, per article 5 of the Land Law (and have the right to part of the communal land upon 
leaving the community, per article 27), the current issue is the lack of full information to 
make informed decisions.   For those communities not already organized, informed of their 
rights to communal land title, and receiving assistance from NGOs, donors and 
provincial/local authorities to apply for it, the new titling scheme may outpace ongoing 
indigenous land registration programmes.  Parcelling land traditionally used by indigenous 
peoples into separate pieces of private land could undermine the creation and maintenance 
of communal lands (which are crucial to protecting collective land areas such as burial 
grounds and spiritual forests), and may possibly instigate the selling of indigenous land into 
small plots.

<p><b> VII. The benefits and negative impacts of land concessions

exploiting its natural resources for the purposes of national development.  As regards ELCs

</b></p>
<p>specifically, the National Strategic Development Plan Update places priority on improving 
agricultural productivity and diversification.211  Power generated by Cambodia&#8216;s proposed 
hydropower projects will not only generate energy but revenue, and the power will be used 
for domestic consumption and is also likely be exported. There are economic and social 
benefits that land concessions have brought to Cambodia, such as job creation (and 
therefore a more dynamic local market), tax revenue generated and new roads and other 
upgrades in infrastructure.  Some land concession companies participate in conservation 
and environmental training programmes.  Associated benefits for communities in 
concession areas include health posts and schools.   
</p>
<p>128. However, no comprehensive evidence-based report has been officially published 
about the benefits of land concessions. The amount of new employment and physical 
investment can often be well below expectations.  Moreover, there is no available evidence 
that revenue generated from land concessions has been used by the Government in 
concession areas for social and economic development, such as in the health and education 
sectors or in infrastructure development. Likewise it is difficult to assess if concessions 
have contributed to alleviating poverty. On the contrary, the Government continues to be 
heavily dependent on foreign aid.  Data and analysis on revenue generated from land 
concessions and the attendant benefits for the population is an area which needs to be 
developed further.  In contrast, the negative impacts have been well documented. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Overall human rights impacts 
</b></p>
<p>129. Regrettably, the human rights impact of concessions, especially economic land 
concessions, continues along the same trends that were documented in the 2004 SRSG and 
2007 SRSG reports. The impacts are numerous and many of them I have seen for myself 
during my missions to Cambodia:  the destruction of the environment due to bulldozing, 
clearing of land and planting of non-native crops and trees; the lack of consultation with 
local communities, contributing to their marginalization and conflicts with companies and 
local authorities; the undermining of efforts to register indigenous peoples as legal entities 
so that they can preserve their culture, language and traditional agricultural practices, and 
apply for collective land title; encroachment on farm land and areas of cultural and spiritual 
significance; the loss of traditional livelihoods and the perpetuation of a gross income 
disparity (rural poor as compared with wealthy concessionaires and those benefiting 
financially from the concessions); lack of access to clean water and sanitation; forced 
evictions, displacement and relocation of people from their homes and farm lands, creating 
difficulties with finding or sustaining employment/ income-generation and access to basic 
services; sub-standard labour conditions; militarization of land concessions, contributing to 
intimidation and violence by armed security guards, sometimes members of Royal 
Cambodian Armed Forces and other times privately employed; and lack of effective 
remedy or recourse for affected communities. Some of these issues are discussed in greater 
depth below. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b> B. The costs of instability and poor regulation 
</b></p>
<p>130. The overwhelming conclusion drawn from petitions, letters, studies, peaceful 
protests, violent demonstrations, legal complaints, land dispute statistics212 and my own 
direct observations, is that land concessions are only benefiting a minority.  The current 
climate of investment in Cambodia is characterized by a lack of transparency, whereby 
there is no complete official list of land concessions and business enterprises&#8216; operations, 
</p>
<p>and impact assessments are either not undertaken, not publicly available, or undertaken 
after a concession has been granted or a company has already started operations.  
Furthermore, it is often unclear who is benefiting financially from land used for urban 
development, economic and other land concessions, and large scale development projects.  
</p>
<p>131. This situation serves as fertile ground for business enterprises to be able to avoid 
human rights &#8213;due diligence,&#8214; or preventing and addressing their human rights impact.  The 
unfortunate result of a lack of transparency and participatory decision-making involving 
communities which live on or near the land granted for a concession are often unsustainable 
use of natural resources and persistent protests and demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>132. Indeed, perhaps the greatest impact that the irregular granting and mismanagement 
of economic and other land concessions has on the country is to its stability.  While many 
demonstrations are peaceful and can be viewed as a positive contribution to a vibrant 
society, trends in protests and violent land disputes indicate an increasingly desperate and 
unhappy population, and communities who have lost faith in their government to exercise 
appropriate oversight and monitoring over the appropriation of its land and resources.  
Furthermore, businesses without proper legal and procedural safeguards in place run 
significant risks which could affect their reputations, legal status, and profits, and in turn 
could hamper Cambodia&#8216;s economic growth.   
</p>
<p>133. There can be a cost benefit to inclusive development planning and preventing 
conflict.213 The Government should not assume that they are helping businesses by not 
holding them to account. On the contrary, businesses that do not respect human rights or 
offer effective remedies when they contribute to adverse impacts run an increasing risk of 
facing human rights litigation, disruption in operations due to conflicts, or negative 
publicity by being associated with abuses. These circumstances can affect profit and 
threaten the sustainability of the business, and lower rates of investment translate into 
decreased tax revenue for the Government. 
</p>
<p>134. Since taking up my mandate in 2009, I have received countless reports of protests by 
local communities who demonstrate specifically against the activities of concession 
companies.  Many companies seem to operate in almost complete secrecy, and it is 
impossible to trace their operations because they do not maintain an office which is 
contactable. Even those which are contactable have not responded to my letters asking for 
information from their side.  Engagement with some foreign-owned businesses willing to 
communicate reveal that many concessionaires do not see their role in Cambodia as 
necessitating consultation or much involvement with communities, preferring rather to use 
local authorities and armed forces as intermediaries to handle issues of compensation and 
</p>
<p>  
 212 According to NGO Forum, 2010 data shows that out of 282 land dispute cases, 14 percent or 39 cases 
</p>
<p>were rooted in development projects, especially in the granting of ELCs.  NGO Forum<i>, Statistical 
Analysis on ELCs</i>, 2010. 
</p>
<p> 213 See, for example, Rachel Davis and David M. Franks, &#8213;The Costs of Conflict Associated with Local 
Communities in the Extractive Industry,&#8214; First International Seminar on Social Responsibility in 
Mining, Santiago, Chile, October 2011. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>relocation.  The result is a mistrust of company employees, and an ever growing sentiment 
against foreign-owned businesses. 
</p>
<p>135. There are also often operational delays which are caused by disputes.  For example, 
regarding the ongoing dispute between the Municipality of Phnom Penh, Shukaku, Inc. 
(with Inner Mongolia Erdos Hungjun Investment Company, Ltd.) and the Boeung Kak 
Lake communities, as of the writing of this report, apart from the filling of the lake, no 
development had taken place since the 2007 lease was granted five years ago.  This is 
undoubtedly related to the persistent disputes, contributing to delayed returns on investment 
and an embarrassment for the Municipality. There are certainly other examples of delays 
due to inadequate planning and consultation, resulting in decreased revenue and 
reputational costs for companies and authorities. The financial and operational costs of land 
disputes in Cambodia deserve further examination and analysis. 
</p>
<p>136. In addition, there is an even more damaging reputational risk that an emerging 
market such as Cambodia is vulnerable to in terms of diverted investment, as international 
companies seek more stable and predictable business environments due to the perceived 
&#8213;social risks.&#8214;  Indeed, violence related to land disputes in Cambodia is well-documented. 
Access to online videos of incidents of shooting and forced evictions has increased since 
the 2007 SRSG Report, as the use of social media and the ability to record incidents and 
promptly display them on the internet has developed.214  According to the CEO of an ELC 
in Cambodia, &#8213;unlike traditional business risks, where high risk results in a higher required 
rate of return, social risk tends to be a bipolar event, wherein a company will simply deem a 
market too risky to consider investment, even at high rates of financial returns.  Investment 
and operations in emerging markets carry higher reputational risks to firms and brands.&#8214;215 
</p>
<p>137. Further, the unpredictable granting of land concessions where projects are underway 
by civil society organizations, community based groups and international donors is 
hampering prospects for development and prosperity.  Some organizations report disruption 
to long-standing activities related to livelihood and food security, for example, as well as 
registration of indigenous land.  Owing to this climate of poor cooperation with the 
Government, some donors are reportedly considering diverting their funds away from 
Cambodia. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Forced eviction and relocation 
</b></p>
<p>138. As land concessions are granted, the communities living on the land are often 
subjected to forced eviction, involuntary resettlement or relocation which is poorly planned, 
if it is planned at all. Eviction and relocation, whether forcible or not, can often increase 
poverty and cause limited access to income generation and debt; lack of access to water, 
sanitation, electricity, health services and education; physical and mental health problems; 
</p>
<p>  
 214 See for example the use of force documented in the violent evictions of the Borei Keila community 
</p>
<p>(social land concession) and the Boeung Kak Lake community (real estate development), filmed by 
Radio Free Asia and non-governmental eviction monitors and posted on YouTube (described in 
further detail in section VII(C)).  Also note the case related to the TTY Company (economic land 
concession) on 18 January 2012 when armed security guards for TTY Company opened fire on a 
group of villagers who had gathered to prevent clearing of their farmland by company excavators in 
Kratie's Snuol district.  See the video at Licadho, &#8213;Military Shoot Land Protesters in Northeastern

<p>challenges to realizing civil and political rights (e.g. voting, access to remedy); social 
stigmatization and disruption to communities and family cohesiveness. Policies, procedures 
and safeguards which prevent forced eviction are either lacking or not enforced, 
compensation schemes either mismanaged or inadequate, and relocation efforts are seldom 
adequately planned with sufficient resources and foresight. 
</p>
<p>139. Domestic law and international law restrict displacement and relocation, and they 
provide guidance if relocation is not avoidable. 216  However, forced eviction and 
resettlement of local communities due to land concessions or large-scale development and 
infrastructure projects have often been conducted without due process of law and safeguard 
for the rights to land and housing of the resident population.  In some cases, use of force 
has been employed to carry out the eviction or relocation, at the behest of both domestic 
and foreign companies. Furthermore, it is often unclear who is financing evictions.    
</p>
<p>140. The case that has garnered the most attention both locally and internationally in 
recent years is the development of Boeung Kak Lake in Phnom Penh, where the 
Municipality of Phnom Penh granted a long-term 99 year lease over 133 hectares to 
Shukaku Inc. in association with Inner Mongolia Erdos Hungjun Investment Company for a 
real estate development project.217 Shukaku is directed by Cambodian Senator Lao Meng 
Khin, who also directs the Pheapimex Group and Wuzhishan LS Group.218 The project has 
affected over 4,000 families, most of whom were forcibly evicted, relocated involuntarily, 
or who accepted sub-standard compensation under duress.  In August 2011 a sub-decree 
was issued to adjust the size of the Boeung Kak Lake Development,219 which provided land 
title to communities living on a 12.44 hectare stretch of land, a positive development in this 
long-standing dispute. Nevertheless, this was not as inclusive as it should have been, and 
some families were subsequently evicted and continue to protest the eviction and 
relocation.  For example, a violent eviction took place on 17 September 2011 on a strip of 
land bordering the lake which was excluded from this 12.44 hectare area.220

 216 The Cambodian Constitution (article 44), the 2001 Land Law (articles 4 and 5) and the 2010 Law on 
</p>
<p>Expropriation (articles 1-7) limit the expropriation of land and manage its terms.  Land/property 
expropriation can only occur in the public interest, with the requirement that fair and just 
compensation be paid in advance. For international standards, see Basic Principles and Guidelines on

of Commerce, 24 May 2004, Oknha Lao Meng Khin is listed as one of the directors of Wuzhishan LS 
Group. 
</p>
<p> 219 Sub-decree 183 of 11 August 2011. 
 220 On 16 September 2011 in Village 22, Boeung Kak Lake, Phnom Penh, five houses (eight families in 
</p>
<p>total) excluded from the 12.44 hectare area were demolished by bulldozer.  Negotiations for 
compensation had not yet been concluded.  The eviction was carried out by about one hundred police 
officers, who beat a protester.  The eviction and beating was captured on video.  See, Licadho, Video:

<p>141. Two other cases recently brought to my attention where thousands of families are 
being relocated due to land concessions are the infrastructure development project of the 
Union Development Group in Koh Kong province and the proposed Lower Sesan 2 
hydropower dam221 in Sesan district, Stung Treng province, 1.5 kilometres upstream of the 
confluence of the Srepok and Sesan rivers. The concession of Union Development Group 
has already displaced more than 1,000 families from their old villages, and the remaining 
families are under threat of relocation (see also Annex III).  According to environmental 
impact assessments, the proposed Lower Sesan 2 hydropower dam would affect 4,785 
people (1,059 households) from seven villages in four communes due to the creation of the 
reservoir, and six relocation sites have been proposed for those who will be displaced by 
the reservoir and construction.222 The government data projects a slightly lower impact &#8211;
with 4,620 people affected&#8211; and foresees flooding over 34,307 hectares.223  Potentially 
affected communities with whom I had a direct interaction reported that they were not 
adequately consulted about the impact of the project and the relocation plan, though they 
did know that the dam will go ahead and they will be relocated somewhere 10 kilometres 
away from their current village. 
</p>
<p>142. Another worrying eviction and relocation concerns the Borei Keila community, a 
social land concession in Phnom Penh.224  An eviction on 3 January 2012 involved the use 
of force and poorly planned resettlement resulting in an urgent humanitarian situation.225 
Following the destruction of the homes carried out with a reported excessive use of force, 
the evicted communities were taken to resettlement sites a significant distance from the city 
</p>
<p>  
 221 The dam project was approved in January 2011, with construction projected to begin in 2012 and 
</p>
<p>completed by 2016. The dam is projected to be operational by 2017. The capacity of the dam is 400 
megawatts, 75 metres high, and up to 6 km long; the size of reservoir is over 340 km2. The estimated 
cost is US$816 million and power will be generated for Cambodia and for export to Vietnam. See 
Mark Grimsditch, <i>3S Rivers Under Threat:</i> <i>Understanding New Threats and Challenges from 
Hydropower Development to Biodiversity and Community Rights in the 3S Rivers Basin</i>, 3S Rivers 
Protection Network and International Rivers, April 2012. 
</p>
<p> 222 Ibid, pp. 28-29. The EIA conducted by Key Consultants Cambodia (KCC) states that many of the 
proposed resettlement areas are already located in approved forest/land concession areas which will 
likely be subject to considerable disturbance now and in the future. According to notes prepared by 
KCC, of the total area proposed for resettlement, over 4,000 hectares is located within the boundaries 
of forest concessions and reserved land. The reservoir will flood more than 1,200 hectares of 
agricultural land, which is 24 percent of the agricultural land in Sesan district, and although this will 
be replaced by land in the resettlement areas, it is acknowledged that this will require forest clearance.  
</p>
<p> 223 Ibid., p. 31. In June 2011, the Government clarified that the dam will flood 34,307 ha, the area of 
which includes 83 ha of residential land, 910 ha of rice farm land, 307 ha of fields, 17,806 ha of state 
forest land, 10,564 ha of land granted to private firms as land concessions, and 4,638 ha of river/lake 
areas. The project will impact 4,620 people, and the relocation areas will apparently be provided with 
electricity supply, and improved livelihoods compared to their previous location.  
</p>
<p> 224 In early 2003, a land-sharing arrangement was proposed for Borei Keila, which allowed the Phanimex 
Company to develop part of the area for commercial purposes while providing housing to residents on 
the remaining land. The contract obliged Phanimex to build 10 apartment buildings for 1,776 
residents on two hectares of land, in return for obtaining ownership of an additional 2.6 hectares for 
commercial development. After constructing only eight buildings, in April 2010 Phanimex reneged 
on the agreement with the approval of the Government, which left approximately 384 Borei Keila 
families excluded from the original plan.  They continued to live informally and under threat of 
eviction on the site, while seeking intervention and assistance from the Government agencies.   
</p>
<p> 225 During the incident more than 200 mixed forces (armed police, gendarmerie, and Khan authorities) 
demolished villagers&#8216; homes and moved them to a resettlement site.  The eviction was captured on 
</p>
<p>video.  See Licadho, &#8213;Borei Keila: broken promises in Cambodia,&#8214; 3 January 2012, http://licadho-
cambodia.org/video.php?perm=28.   Over 100 families who have refused to relocate are reportedly 
still living in squalor at or around the original site. </p>

</p>
<p>centre that were not adequately prepared for the arrival of the families.  Lack of potable 
water (besides two wells), sanitation services, and inadequate housing have been reported at 
Srah Por Village and Tuol Sambo Village.  The eviction and resettlement has resulted in the 
further impoverishment of the families.   
</p>
<p>143. The significant efforts by foreign donors to support the MLMUPC and other 
authorities in systematic and sporadic titling programmes was aimed at securing tenure and 
in the long-term preventing evictions.  Nevertheless, there have been criticisms about the 
efficacy of these programmes due to the number of households excluded.  For example, 
regarding the Land Management and Administration Program, civil society organizations 
monitoring the titling scheme claim that despite significant successes in some areas, LMAP 
did not improve tenure security for segments of the population that are most vulnerable to 
displacement, as many areas of sought-after land, including that of indigenous peoples, 
have been systematically excluded from the programme.226  They point out that a key factor 
in the design of LMAP is that areas &#8213;likely to be disputed&#8214; and areas of &#8213;unclear status&#8214; 
would not be targeted by the titling system which has in practice resulted in a lack of access 
to the titling system for households and communities that lie in the path of planned 
developments (especially in Phnom Penh) or on land concessions, or whose lands have 
been targeted by well-connected individuals or companies.227 
</p>
<p>144. Similar concerns are expressed about the sporadic titling programme, which allows 
households with possession rights to apply for title on an ad hoc basis.  The sporadic titling 
programme is reportedly plagued by corruption and is often inaccessible due to the 
substantial official and informal fees required.  Consequently, there has been concern that 
households and communities that have legitimate claims to land are &#8213;routinely and 
arbitrarily denied access to land titling and dispute resolution mechanisms,&#8214; undermining 
</p>
<p>land titling programmes&#8216; aim of reducing poverty and promoting tenure security.228 
</p>
<p>145. Significant gaps left by the systematic and sporadic titling programmes, 229  the 
proliferation of granting of land concessions on unregistered or disputed land, and the 
inaccessibility of the majority of households to dispute resolution procedures (non-judicial 
and judicial) has perpetuated a climate where evictions persist. Forced evictions are 
frequently justified by the Government&#8216;s claims that those evicted lack documentation or 
title, are illegally occupying land or &#8213;squatting,&#8214; or only recently arrived to the land in 
</p>
<p>question (labelled &#8213;newcomers&#8214; or &#8213;opportunistic&#8214;). Indeed, although progress has been 
</p>
<p>made in issuing land titles in recent years, Cambodia&#8216;s historical legacy means that for 
</p>
<p>many the lack of documentation and land title persists. Internal migration has complicated 
the process of verifying who is eligible for land title and compensating those communities 
truly affected or displaced by concession activity.  Nevertheless, the continuance of 
evictions, many of them violent, is not justified by these complexities.

</b></p>
<p> <b>53 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Environmental destruction and impacts on livelihood 
</b></p>
<p>146. Environmental destruction is a pervasive problem in Cambodia, and not limited to 
land concession areas.  The designation of protected areas was initiated to combat this 
problem, especially given that forest areas are recognized for their biological diversity and 
as a key component in climate change mitigation strategies.  In the development of agro-
industry, however, the most immediate and observable environmental impact is 
deforestation of large tracts of land due to the clearing of primary forest for the planting of 
rubber, sugar, acacia, cassava and cashew plantations, for example.  
</p>
<p>147. There is severe impact on the biodiversity of forest areas.  Primary tropical 
rainforest provides a range of ecosystem services, which all change with deforestation.  
Cleared areas do not offer the same habitat opportunities as primary forest and represent a 
crucial degradation of habitat conditions for wildlife species.  For example, the Prey Lang 
forest (the largest primary lowland dry evergreen forest remaining in Cambodia) is now 
considered endangered. Prey Lang&#8216;s biodiversity values are reportedly exceptionally high 
with more than 20 endangered plant species and as many as 27 endangered animal 
species.230 
</p>
<p>148. Illicit logging continues, due to the granting of land concessions but also due to 
changing migration patterns, despite legislation and efforts by the Government, community 
patrol groups and development partners to monitor and regulate it.231 In Prey Lang, new 
roads have damaged areas of the forest, and the roads are also facilitating an influx of 
illegal loggers and migrants who are illegally cutting timber, clearing forest, and poaching. 
High value trees, mostly endangered species such as various species of rosewood, have 
disappeared from some areas.   
</p>
<p>149. Even specific programmes to combat logging by promoting carbon credit schemes, 
like the UN-sponsored Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation 
(REDD), are challenged by logging on areas designated for conservation.  Part of the 
problem is related to the militarization of community forest areas, whereby the increase of 
military bases necessitates the clearing of land for the building of new structures, which in 
some cases has also intensified illicit logging by rogue soldiers and civilians, many of them 
armed and intimidating to community patrol groups. 
</p>
<p>150. The development of large hydropower dams are still in a nascent phase, but it is 
clear that they will have considerable impacts on the environment.  As with other land 
concessions, the EIA process in practice has not been adequate to deal with proposals for 
and building of large scale dams. Based on initial assessments it is clear that many large 
hydropower projects will flood expansive areas of land, impacting agricultural and 
residential land, and many of the proposed sites are in vulnerable forested areas with rich 
biodiversity and sensitive ecosystems. Impacts on fish migrations and access to forest 
products threaten to harm the livelihoods of local communities.  Indeed, the Government of 
Cambodia has called for the suspension of the development of the proposed mainstream 
Xayaburi dam in Laos due to its potential impact on the Mekong river system.232 
</p>
<p>151. Flooding is also a major concern in urban areas, such as in Phnom Penh where poor 
urban planning, reckless property development, and an inadequate sewage system has 
</p>
<p>  
 230 Prey Lang, &#8213;The Threat,&#8214; http://preylang.com/threats/. 
 231 There have also been allegations that an international development partner with long-standing work in 
</p>
<p>Cambodia is complicit in widespread illicit logging in the Central Cardamom Protected Forest.  See 
David Boyle and May Tittihara, &#8213;Blind Eye to Forest&#8216;s Plight,&#8214; Phnom Penh Post, 26 March 2012.

</p>
<p>contributed to poor drainage.  For example, following the approval of the real estate 
development project of Shukaku Inc. in 2007 (which later became a joint venture with 
Erdos Hongjun Property Development Company, Ltd.), in order to develop Boeung Kak 
Lake into a high-end residential, commercial and tourism complex<i>, </i>the company, with the 
cooperation of the Municipality of Phnom Penh, began filling the lake with sand in August 
2008.  This has impacted on drainage and has caused serious flooding in the surrounding 
villages, with homes submerged in muddy water and sewage, and resulted in many families 
being forced to move because their homes became uninhabitable.  The high level of still 
water after heavy rains also poses a public health concern and can contribute to the spread 
of water borne illnesses, malaria and dengue fever. 
</p>
<p>152. One associated benefit of land concessions has been the building of roads by foreign 
concessionaires, which has facilitated travel, especially in some remote areas.  However, 
the building of roads has often entailed the clearing of land and the felling of trees.  Further, 
the use of such infrastructure has not been equitable, as many communities living on or 
near concessions report being denied access to roads within land concessions and forced to 
take alternative routes. 
</p>
<p>153. Concerns about the loss of forest cover due to the encroachment of concession areas 
in protected forests, and the resulting loss of access to forest products by communities is of 
continuing concern. The 2007 SRSG Report cited the encroachment of concessions upon 
forested areas and the resulting loss of access to non-timber forest products in relation to 
over 22 concessions in eight provinces. Since 2007, many more concessions have been 
granted to private companies in areas where local communities have traditionally used and 
collected non-timber forest products. For example, CRCK Rubber Development (6,155 
hectares), PNT (7,900 hectares), and Thy Nga Development and Investment (6,060 hectare) 
have been granted concessions to develop rubber plantations within Prey Lang and have 
reportedly cleared land where indigenous peoples previously tapped resin trees for 
customary use. Consequently, concession-affected communities are struggling to earn a 
livelihood and collect enough food. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Issues surrounding access to water 
</b></p>
<p>154. There is growing concern in recent years among concession-affected communities, 
environmentalists, governmental representatives, human rights advocates and other 
development partners related to access to a sufficient amount of safe drinking water for 
personal and domestic uses (defined as water for drinking, personal sanitation, washing of 
clothes, food preparation, and personal and household hygiene).233 This is related to both 
water shortage and water contamination, and there is a concern that these issues will be the 
subject of increased conflict in and around land concessions granted in protected areas, on 
indigenous peoples&#8216; land, and in areas of primary forest being used for agro-industrial 
crops, mining, hydropower dams and for other large scale development projects.  
</p>
<p>155. The 2001 Land Law states that land concessions may not violate transportation 
ways, including waterways and water reserves, used by people in their daily lives.234 The 
2007 SRSG Report noted a number of concessions that have blocked paths and roads used 
by villagers to access forested areas and waterways. This violation has continued since, and 
</p>
<p>  
 233 The right to water, defined as the right of everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable and physically 
</p>
<p>accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses was set out in November 2002 by the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in General Comment No. 15. 
</p>
<p> 234 Land Law, 2001, article 58. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>55 
</b></p>
<p>there is a growing fear among affected communities of the current and future shortage of 
water and water pollution caused by the activities of the concessions.   
</p>
<p>156. Documented water concerns on ELCs include on the sugar plantations of Koh Kong 
Plantation Company and Koh Kong Sugar Company in Sre Ambel and Botum Sakor 
districts, Koh Kong province.235 For example, on the Koh Kong Sugar Plantation, affected 
communities claim chemical waste from the plantation has poisoned local water sources 
and killed fish, which is the main source of protein for surrounding communities, and 
residents have responded by filing legal complaints.  Additional concerns regarding water 
shortages have been expressed in relation to the activities of Union Development Group in 
Koh Kong&#8216;s Botum Sakor National Park and on the sugar plantations of the Phnom Penh 
Sugar Company and Kampong Speu Sugar Company. 
</p>
<p>157. In addition, in January 2010, on a 9,985 hectare concession belonging to HLH 
Group and located in the Phnom Oral Wildlife Sanctuary, Oral District, Kampong Speu, 
producing and processing genetically modified corn, the company diverted water to 
construct its irrigation system.  This area is home to all of Cambodia&#8216;s remaining 
</p>
<p>indigenous Suy villages. The Suy population claims that HLH has continued diverting 
water by filling in local streams, which has caused farms to flood. Following protests by the 
community, HLH modified its practices, but many of the Suy people have stopped using 
some water for fear that chemical run-offs from HLH&#8216;s farm have contaminated the water, 
evidenced by the fact that the water has turned various colours. They have also reported 
that some livestock have sickened and died, which they believe is related to the 
contaminated water. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Security concerns: deployment of State armed forces and private 
</b></p>
<p><b>security guards  
</b></p>
<p>158. The deployment of state armed personnel to protect the interests of concession 
companies has been reported in many cases. Upon commencing operations, companies 
have often employed State military and/or private security officers to guard the area, many 
of whom exert intimidation among the local communities, and some of whom are 
responsible for violence against communities, extortion or blocking of roads through check 
points.   
</p>
<p>159. In an increasing number of cases, armed personnel have used live fire in 
confrontation with villagers who protest against the activities of concession companies 
from encroaching upon their farmland, forests or areas of cultural or spiritual significance. 
A number of cases involving the use of live ammunition have been recorded, some of 
which have resulted in death or serious injury including: in Kratie province, TTY 
Company; in Rattanakiri province, Jing Zhong Ri Company and Heng Brother Rubber 
Company; in Kampong Speu province, Phnom Penh Sugar and Kampong Speu Sugar 
companies; in Bantheay Meanchey and Oddar Meanchey provinces, Cheat Akphiwat 
Company; and in Battambang province, Mean Sambath Company.236  In addition, mixed 
armed forces including gendarmerie were used in Mondulkiri province in May 2012 against 
villagers whom authorities claimed to have grabbed land belonging to rubber companies 
Pacific Grand Joint-Stock Company and Pacific Pearl Joint-Stock Company. In the case of 
concessions in Oddar Meanchey province, the Angkor Sugar, Tonle Sugar Cane and Cane

</p>
<p>and Sugar Valley companies employed the services of Battalion 42 to set up road blocks 
and aid in the burning and bulldozing of the village. 
</p>
<p>160. There have also been some recent high profile cases of shooting resulting in death,  
for example, the shooting on 26 April 2012 of the outspoken environmental activist and 
human rights defender, Mr. Chhut Wutty, while gathering evidence of illegal logging in the 
Central Cardamom Forest in Koh Kong province, and the shooting of a 14 year old girl 
during a forced eviction and crack down on an alleged &#8213;secessionist movement&#8214; on 16 May 
</p>
<p>2012 in Broma village, Chhlong district, Kratie province.  
</p>
<p>161. In addition, as mentioned earlier, concession companies have also hired armed 
forces and security guards to set up check points and restrict the use of roads.  For example, 
in the last year guards employed by the Union Development Group in Koh Kong province 
have prohibited entry into two villages inside the 36,000 hectare concession area in Botum 
Sakor National Park to communities and representatives of civil society organizations. In 
addition, although a civilian activity, the implementation of the new land titling scheme 
implemented following the 7 May 2012 directive on ELCs has been conducted by youth 
wearing military fatigues commonly worn by the armed forces (without the armed forces 
insignia), and military transport vehicles have been provided to those recruited to measure 
land. According to reports from communities in rural areas, this has reportedly fostered 
confusion and given the impression that the youth hired to demarcate land form part of an 
arm of the military.  In some cases, intimidation has been reported. There have also been 
concerns that the youth received only limited training &#8211; only two days in some cases. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Impact on indigenous peoples  
</b></p>
<p>162. Land concessions and large scale development projects have had a devastating 
impact on non-indigenous and indigenous communities alike, but the indigenous 
communities, whose rights to collective ownership of land are protected under domestic 
law and international law, are particularly vulnerable.  The encroachment of their land is 
undermining the ability of indigenous communities to register their collective ownership of 
traditional lands, and enforce their rights to collective land title under the 2001 Land Law.  
</p>
<p>163. While indigenous peoples are reported to inhabit 15 provinces, two-thirds of the 
indigenous population of Cambodia is found in the north-eastern provinces of Rattanakiri 
and Mondulkiri, forming the majority of the population in both provinces. There are already 
many cases where concessions are being developed directly on indigenous land and 
oftentimes where there is little land or no land left for the indigenous community to 
register.237  The development of agro-industry is threatening the traditional agricultural 
</p>
<p>  
 237 For instance, in the case of the Phnong indigenous community in the Bousra commune of Mondulkiri 
</p>
<p>province affected by the ELCs associated with Socfin-KCD (Luxembourg-Cambodia) and Dak Lak 
Rubber Company . See FIDH report, section 3.3.2.  Also, in Rattanakiri, according to a report 
focusing on the concessions in Ta Veng district (Krong Buk company) and Andong Meas district 
(Heng Brother, C.R.D. and Veasna Investment at the Western side of the river, and Hong An Ou Ya 
Dav and 7 Makara Paris on the Eastern side of the river), Chan communities report that the farmland 
of 47 families is inside the concession area, Ka Nat Thum communities report 30, and Nhang 
communities report 16 affected families. Dal Veal Leng communities state that large parts of their 
land is situated in the 1,900 ha concession in their area. Villagers from In village report that the 
demarcated concession area covers most of their farmland and forest, including multi-crop land used 
for growing rice, vegetables and their old cashew nut plants.  See Andrea Bues, <i>Increasing Pressure 
for Land </i>&#8211;<i> Implications for Rural Livelihoods in Developing Countries: The Case of Cambodia</i>, 
October 2011, available from

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>57 
</b></p>
<p>systems of indigenous peoples, and therefore their food security.  New farming techniques 
have been introduced on indigenous land, without the consultation of the communities who 
are most familiar with the areas.  While often offered jobs on the new plantations&#8212;indeed 
there is often a shortage of labour in remote areas&#8212;many indigenous communities have 
reportedly not adapted to this new way of farming, are not able to communicate in Khmer 
or the language of the foreign company, and local tensions related to the expropriation of 
land and management of the plantations have arisen.  Labour conditions are not well-
monitored and are reportedly below domestic and international standards. 
</p>
<p>164. As mentioned earlier, the granting of economic land and other concessions has also 
undermined the work of development partners, not only those working to assist the 
communities to register and gain collective titles, but also many development organizations 
and NGOs who have been trying to help improve the livelihoods of rural communities and 
indigenous peoples.238 
</p>
<p><b> H. Impact on areas of cultural and spiritual significance 
</b></p>
<p>165. The 2004 SRSG Report described the importance of land for rural Cambodia, as it is 
the foundation for social and cultural organization and livelihood,239 and the 2007 SRSG 
Report raised concerns over the encroachment of traditional or spiritual land, which affects 
both indigenous and non-indigenous communities.  Specifically, the 2007 SRSG Report 
notes the impact the Wuzhishan concession in Mondulkiri province has had on the 
traditional lands of the Phnong indigenous communities, the impact of the eco-tourism 
concession granted to New Cosmos Development (Cambodia) on the traditional land and 
areas of cultural and spiritual importance of the Suy indigenous community in Oral district 
of Kampong Speu province, and the restriction of monks in the organization of their 
traditional ceremonies due to the activities of the Pheapimex in Pursat province.240 These 
concessions are still active (except the New Cosmos Development concession in Oral, 
which has since ceased operations).   
</p>
<p>166. In May 2011 a concession was granted to Yeejia Tourism Development (Cambodia) 
Company for agro-tourism and a hot springs eco-tourism project on Suy indigenous land in 
Oral district, Kampong Speu, which overlaps with the New Cosmos Development 
concession.241 The hot springs are of cultural and spiritual significance for the Suy. An 
October 2011 report of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) documents 
destruction of the spirit forests and burial grounds of the Phnong indigenous peoples in 
Bousra by Khmer-run bulldozers sub-contracted by Socfin-KCD (a joint venture between 
Luxembourg-registered Socfinasia and Cambodian Khao Chuly Development for a rubber 
plantation concession).242  The Jin Zhong Ri company in Rattanakiri province has also 
cleared some parts of the spirit forest of the Tumpoun indigenous community in Lumphat 
district. The company stopped their activity only after several protests by the affected 
indigenous community.

<p>167. In addition, the concession granted to Cheat Apiwath Company of 6,000 hectares 
within the protected Bantheay Chhmar Natural Landscape also covers six temple 
mounds,243 and it has affected and encroached upon the farmland belonging to more than 
900 families in five villages in Bantheay Chhmar commune, Thmar Puok district, Bantheay 
Meanchey province and three villages in Ampil commune, Bantheay Ampil district, Oddar 
Meanchey province. Two among the six temple mounds, Don Moeung and Anlong Prich, 
have already been bulldozed despite protests by local communities. The Don Moeung 
temple mound is where the local communities go to pray for peace, prosperity and rainfall 
in their village every year, in particular during the Khmer New Year.   
</p>
<p><b> I. Impact on women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>168. The granting of land concessions has particularly impacted women and girls, for 
example, in areas related to labour, livelihoods, security, and family structure and roles.  
Concessions contribute to the reduction of land and forest for inhabitants, causing shifts in 
opportunities for livelihood, and changes in labour and migration patterns. The lack of 
resources has exposed communities to problems with food security, and many communities 
have been forced to leave their area in search of work or food.  For example, in Kratie, 
where the majority of ELCs have been granted, men have reportedly moved to other 
provinces in search of forest products no longer available in their area. Women have 
reportedly moved to nearby areas, as well as travelled outside of Cambodia to work as 
labourers in plantations or as domestic workers.244  Often labour opportunities as plantation 
workers will only be taken up by male communities due to cultural reasons, which could 
lead to a further marginalisation of women, who are generally more prone to poverty and 
undernourishment. 
</p>
<p>169. For both Khmer and indigenous women and girls in remote rural areas, the new 
presence of &#8213;outsiders&#8214; (Khmer not from the area and foreigners working for the 
</p>
<p>concession companies), additional concerns are related to safety, in terms of potential 
robbery, theft and physical violence including rape. This is especially important for women 
who traditionally go to the forest to collect food and non-timber forest products.  Some 
women have reported now moving in groups. Security concerns also pertain to women who 
have been evicted and relocated in new environments, often far from the city leading to the 
frequent absence of husbands and relatives who have returned to the city centre to work. 
</p>
<p>170. Women and the elderly, as well as children, are often on the frontlines at protests. 
Women involved in the Boeung Kak Lake dispute have been especially active. 245  
Previously, it was assumed by communities that women and children are less likely to be 
targeted by authorities and they are therefore the leaders in demonstrations, but there have 
been increased cases of violence against women in the context of protests, and of arbitrary 
detention of female protesters.  In recent months, women have taken increasingly drastic 
public actions in defence of the use of force by gendarmerie. In one incident in March 
2012, women representatives of the Boeung Kak Lake community bared their breasts

<p>publicly, ostensibly to avoid apprehension by the police, demonstrating unprecedented 
desperation.246 
</p>
<p>171. Women activists involved in land disputes report harassment and intimidation to 
themselves and their families, which has taken a toll on their family relations and 
psychological welfare.  Many women report feelings of hopelessness and depression, 
suicidal feelings, and have experienced divorce and separation related to their land disputes 
and involvements in land claims.  
</p>
<p>172. Women continue to suffer disproportionately in the eviction and relocation process, 
as they are responsible both for generating income and also taking care of the family and 
home.247 Where there are problems with access to basic services at resettlement sites, such 
as water and sanitation, women and children are often disproportionately affected because 
they spend more time at the sites. In the case of urban land concessions resulting in 
eviction, women have lost jobs and sources of livelihood, in some cases reportedly more so 
than men, especially if relocated far from the city centre. The same work at the relocation 
site often does not enable them to maintain the equivalent standard of living as in high-
density urban areas. With loss of income and the difficulties linked to relocation, drinking 
alcohol is reportedly more prevalent, which is related to increased domestic tensions and 
violence in many cases.  Unplanned parenthood at resettlement sites is reportedly 
widespread due to lack of access to family planning services. 
</p>
<p>173. Women also face difficulties in terms of property registration and land title, reducing 
their security of tenure and making them more vulnerable to land concessions granted on 
the land they inhabit.  Of the total land titles issued as of June 2010, about 70 percent are 
reportedly shared properties of couples, 20 percent are owned by women, five percent are 
owned by men, and another five percent are owned by monasteries. 248   Efforts are 
reportedly underway with the cooperation of the MLMUPC to improve registration of 
women as property owners, which can be impacted by low levels of official registration of 
marriage.249 Although more individual titles are registered in the name of women, women 
who are joint title holders report having issues with property rights in cases of separation, 
abandonment, domestic violence, multiple marriages and divorce. 250  In any of these 
scenarios, women with low incomes (and their children) are in particularly precarious 
situations with regards to property rights. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Impact on children 
</b></p>
<p>174. The overwhelming impact on children is related to the deteriorated livelihoods 
associated with land tenure insecurity, environmental destruction and land encroachment,

</p>
<p>and forced eviction and resettlement.  These challenges affect their access to basic services, 
such as health and adequate water and sanitation, as well as their educational opportunities. 
In cases of relocation, children have at times dropped out of school or families had to 
separate to keep children near the eviction site to finish the school year. In some cases, 
families also have had to pay informal fees to transfer their children between schools, and 
the daily informal fees requested by teachers have put an extra burden on families&#8216; limited 
</p>
<p>income. 
</p>
<p>175. There are also issues regarding child labour.  For example, one study found that 
children have at times been pulled out of school in order to work and raise money for their 
struggling families due to the impacts caused by land concessions.251 As with impacts on 
women and girls described above, the need to earn a livelihood can cause a breakdown in 
the family structure as parents leave to find work, which may also increase incidents of 
domestic violence.  Unplanned parenthood has resulted in many families having children 
they cannot afford to feed or send to school.  Overall, the impacts of displacement and 
relocation can be very traumatic for children. 
</p>
<p>176. Some concession companies have engaged in ad hoc and voluntary initiatives which 
fit broadly under a corporate social responsibility framework and which can have a positive 
effect on children&#8216;s welfare, such as setting up health posts and school rooms in remote 
</p>
<p>rural areas.  For example, Socfin-KCD has invested in social projects, renovating the two 
primary schools in Bousra which offer education in Khmer (but not in the local language, 
Phnong), paying teachers&#8216; salaries and contributing to school infrastructure and 
</p>
<p>materials.252  Grandis Timber, Ltd. in Kampong Speu province has set up an infirmary for 
labourers and a childcare centre for their children. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Access to an effective remedy 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Availability and accessibility of existing non-judicial mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>177. As described above, there are several non-judicial and quasi-judicial mechanisms for 
dispute resolution, including the various levels of the cadastral system.  However, the time-
consuming administrative and procedural burden, financial costs associated with submitting 
a complaint (there are not official fees, as with courts, but transportation, lost wages, and 
seeking legal assistance, are costly for individuals), and a lack of faith in the system 
amounts to these mechanisms being used inconsistently. Complainants report that decisions 
by such bodies are inconsistent, irregular and subject to political interference. 
</p>
<p>178. There have been some efforts to reduce the number of cases pending.  The 
MLMUPC reports that from 2003 to April 2012, the cadastral system resolved land 
disputes covering 3,608 hectares (related to 10,881 households), and has attempted to 
address the backlog of land dispute cases with mobile teams, which have addressed 4,623 
cases during that period. 253  The Ministry also reports having conducted training for 
cadastral and commune officials and civil society partners on the 2001 Land Law and 
procedures for land dispute resolution and reconciliation. Nevertheless, the new land titling 
scheme on economic land concessions, forestry concessions and state land is avoiding

</p>
<p>Lim, to Surya Subedi, 23 May 2012.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>61 
</b></p>
<p>demarcation of any land that is currently disputed, thereby not addressing the crux of the 
problem. Although no land can be registered if ownership is contested, avoiding these areas 
means that disputes continue, and invariably the weaker party loses out. 
</p>
<p>179. Cambodia has no independent national human rights institution, although there is an 
inter-ministerial committee charged with coordinating human rights activities for the 
Government, the Cambodia Human Rights Committee.  The Committee&#8216;s mandate to 
</p>
<p>monitor and investigate individual and group complaints of human rights violations, 
including those related to land concessions, is still pending.254 Its capacity is limited, and, 
while the Committee reviews cases, it does not often investigate cases of land disputes at 
the field level. Field-based case analysis in cooperation with governmental authorities and 
legal aid organizations on land disputes has been targeted as an area for further 
development.255 
</p>
<p>180. As an alternative, complainants often seek the help of individuals, for example local 
and provincial authorities (such as commune chiefs and district chiefs), <i>Oknha</i> (or tycoons) 
and other well-connected people, and government authorities who they view as influential.  
Communities frequently make public pleas to the King and the Prime Minister and his wife 
for a resolution to their dispute, including submitting petitions and demonstrating in front of 
the Royal Palace, National Assembly, Senate, Council of Ministers, and the Prime 
Minister&#8216;s private residence.  Following the exhaustion of other methods with no or 
</p>
<p>unsatisfactory response, there has also been a trend to participate in traditional ceremonies 
and prayers.  Many affected people also submit individual or group petitions to me or come 
to see me during my visits to the country asking me to intervene. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Use of judicial system and criminalization of individuals claiming their 
</b></p>
<p><b>land/ land activists 
</b></p>
<p>181. The judicial system was the subject of my 2010 report to the United Nations Human 
Rights Council, and I emphasized some of the main challenges related to the independence 
of the judiciary and the lack of capacity to handle the case load, particularly with regard to 
land disputes.  I noted that although the Constitution of Cambodia provides for the 
separation of powers between the three main organs of the State, in practice the distinction 
between these organs is blurred and the executive branch dominates the judiciary, whether 
by providing resources to the judiciary or in making appointments to various judicial 
positions or by other means. 256  This remains a key challenge for the country in 
implementing the rule of law and in promoting and protecting people&#8216;s rights. Given the 
interest that the Government has in the granting and management of economic and other 
land concessions, the judiciary is significantly hampered to adjudicate land disputes.  In 
addition, when pitted against powerful landholding individuals or companies, communities 
report feeling marginalized due to bribery and political interference, resulting in a complete 
lack of faith in the system. 
</p>
<p>182. The judiciary has also increasingly been used to criminalize individuals and 
communities exercising their right to claim their land. Human rights defenders are similarly 
targeted, in violation of the rights to freedom of expression and assembly.  In a number of 
</p>
<p>  
 254 A sub-decree outlining their mandate is still pending, and at present most of their activities are related 
</p>
<p>to capacity building on general human rights at the provincial level. 
 255 Note that the President of the Cambodia Human Rights Committee suggested in a June 2010 meeting 
</p>
<p>to form an ad hoc informal group to examine outstanding land disputes.  See A/HRC/15/46, para. 32. 
 256 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, A/HRC/15/46, 
</p>

</b></p>

</p>
<p>cases, criminal charges have been filed against community members and other individuals 
who were suspected of involvement in complaining against land concessions. NGO Adhoc 
reports 427 cases in 2011 against communities involved in land conflicts, up from 319 in 
</p><p>2010. Among these individuals are human rights defenders or activists, National Assembly 
representatives, journalists, lawyers, Sangkat/Commune members, and deputy village 
chiefs.257  In its public annual report relating to activities from June 2011 to June 2012, 
OHCHR noted a case load of 182 people who were questioned by the court for land-related 
claims (some incidents pertained to long-standing land dispute cases), mostly on charges of 
disinformation, obstruction of public officials with aggravated circumstances, illegal 
possession of unmovable property (land) belonging to a public legal entity (the State), 
destruction of property, and encroachment on forest land.  In some cases, the charges 
remain pending in the court and cases are continuously re-activated, while in others people 
were detained.258 
</p>
<p>183. For example, during my May 2012 visit to Svay Chreah commune, Snoul district, 
Kratie province, I learned that four community members affected by the ELCs of Dau 
Thieng (Cambodia) Rubber Development Company and Dau Thieng (Kratie) Rubber 
Development Company were summoned to the Kratie provincial court in September 2011.  
They were called for questioning related to intentional damages committed on 28 April 
2011, the date the community members blocked the road to protest the bulldozing of their 
farmland.259 
</p>
<p>184. In relation to the chronic land dispute between the Boeung Kak Lake community 
and Shukaku Inc., the Phnom Penh Court of First Instance, during a hearing of just three 
and a half hours on 24 May 2012, found 13 women from the Boeung Kak Lake community 
who had been arrested on 22 May 2012 at a peaceful gathering guilty of obstruction of 
public officials with aggravating circumstances and illegal possession of unmovable 
property belonging to a public legal entity.260 They were sentenced to imprisonment for two 
and half years, which was later reduced on 27 June 2012 by the Court of Appeal to one 
month and three days (the time they had already spent in detention). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Climate for civil society and community action 
</b></p>
<p>185. Owing to an uneven application of the relatively well-developed legal framework 
governing land rights, political interference, and inadequate access to remedies, 
communities are becoming increasingly frustrated and disillusioned by formal judicial and 
administrative processes. Demonstrations and protests by affected communities in the 
capital and provinces are increasing and have become more violent. Concession-affected 
communities have become increasingly vocal about their complaints, filing petitions and 
seeking judicial redress at the provincial and national levels, organizing demonstrations in 
provincial capital cities and in Phnom Penh, forming road blocks and sometimes engaging 
in violence.  For example, owing to the large number of land concessions granted in Snuol

and Dau Thieng (Kratie) Rubber Development Co., Ltd. received a land concession of 6,592 hectares. 
These land concessions has been granted for rubber plantation investment, and the land was 
determined as state private land through sub-decree, 30 December 2010. 
</p>
<p> 260  Under article 504 of the Criminal Code and under articles 34 and 259 of the 2001 Land Law. Two 
other activists were also arrested in relation to this case. </p>

<p>district, Kratie province, there have been ongoing protests, especially along national road 
76A.261 There have also been a number of protests related to various sugar plantations in 
Koh Kong province. 
</p>
<p>186. In the last year, there seems to be an increase of mobilized indigenous communities 
protesting against business activity.  For example, the Prey Lang forest movement has been 
campaigning to protect remaining dense forest, which is the source of food for thousands of 
inhabitants living in several provinces (Preah Vihear, Kampong Thom, Kratie, and Stung 
Treng). Their efforts include community forest patrols, travelling by foot or motorbike 
across vast and remote areas in order to expose and prevent further illegal logging activity. 
They are also engaged in awareness raising in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, including 
through organizing peaceful marches, blessing ceremonies (for example, at Preah Ang 
Dorng Keu, opposite the Royal Palace), demonstrations, and distributing leaflets to raise 
awareness about the threats to the forest&#8216;s natural resources and the communities&#8216; 
</p>
<p>livelihoods.  In another example, in February 2012, the Tompoun indigenous community in 
the Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary took company workers hostage for several hours in protest 
at the clearing of their farmland (see Annex IV).  
</p>
<p>187. The response of the authorities, in some cases, has been a crackdown on peaceful 
demonstrations, community activism and civil society education initiatives.  In addition  to 
the disruption of non-violent gatherings, demonstrations, ceremonies, and other awareness 
raising and outreach activities, in violation of the rights to freedom of expression and 
assembly, a very disturbing trend has been the interruption and closure of civil society 
workshops and community meetings, at times with the threat of the use of violence.262  
These meetings and workshops often entail much-needed education on Cambodia&#8216;s 
domestic legal framework governing land rights, and information on how to file legal 
claims for land titles.  They often involve collaboration with national, local and provincial 
authorities, and, fill a gap in capacity building not being provided by the Government. 
Moreover, non-governmental organizations have been instructed by the Government not to 
intervene in the implementation of the new land titling scheme on economic land 
concessions, forestry concessions and state land. Harassment and intimidation of 
individuals involved have been widely reported. The absence of civil society organizations 
has left many communities, families and individuals unaware of their rights, especially if 
they are involved in ongoing land disputes or had previously submitted related complaints 
with judicial or administrative mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Operational level grievance mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>188. The proliferation of displays of discontent around the country related to land 
disputes points to inadequate consultation and negotiation with those affected.  Ultimately, 
early and inclusive consultation can address many tensions before they escalate, and can 
contribute to preventing disputes.  The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights promote the use of &#8213;operational-level&#8214; grievance mechanisms to facilitate 
addressing disputes early and directly.263 Such mechanisms are typically administered by 
</p>
<p>  
 261  A selection of news archives on protests related to land disputes in Snuol district are available at 
</p>
<p>http://www.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/tag/snuol-district/.

</p>
<p>Daily, &#8213;Police Clamp Down on Land Rights Meeting,&#8214; 28 July 2012. 
263 See Guiding Principle 31 for a list of effectiveness criteria for non-judicial grievance mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>According to Guiding Principle 21, in order to ensure their effectiveness, operational level grievance 
mechanisms should be legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, a 
source for continuous learning and based on engagement and dialogue. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1

</p>
<p>business enterprises alone or with the collaboration of local authorities and civil society 
organizations.  They should be accessible to individuals and communities who may be 
adversely impacted by business activities, and should foster trust from the stakeholder 
groups for whose use they are intended.264 Special care should be taken to address language 
barriers (especially with the extent of foreign-owned concessions and given that some 
indigenous peoples do not routinely communicate in Khmer).  
</p>
<p>189. Some concession companies have set up procedures to deal with local level disputes 
and complaints, which can be an effective way of directly clarifying misunderstandings and 
incorrect information and addressing tensions before they escalate. For example, Grandis 
Timber Ltd. reports having mapped land occupied by communities at the commencement of 
the concession activities and employed a community relations manager to deal with land 
and labour disputes.265  However, if set up only late in the dispute, such measures may lose 
their effectiveness, especially as mistrust may have already developed. For example, a 
Tripartite Committee was set up in late 2009 by Socfin-KCD in Bousra commune, 
Mondulkiri province. The initiative, which in principle is to be welcomed, has been 
criticized for being an ineffective communication channel to address grievances that had 
long existed and tensions that had already escalated.266 
</p>
<p>190. In addition, local efforts at dialogue that do not directly involve company 
representatives may hamper their potential success. Several foreign companies report 
relying on the local authorities, often with the presence of armed forces, to negotiate 
compensation and resettlement.  The presence of armed forces during negotiations can be 
intimidating for communities, and extortion by local authorities and armed forces has been 
reported.  The poor handling of negotiations can lead to mistrust from communities who see 
foreign companies as exploitative and unwilling to engage, for example Union 
Development Group in Koh Kong province, among many others. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Availability and accessibility of international grievance procedures 
</b></p>
<p>191. In recent years, there have been cases of NGO-led complaints on behalf of 
communities with international State-based grievance mechanisms, including the United 
Nations human rights treaty-bodies and special procedures. 267   No regional grievance 
mechanism for individual or group human rights complaints exists as part of ASEAN, as 
the ASEAN Inter-governmental Commission on Human Rights does not have an explicit 
mandate to examine individual complaints of human rights violations268 and its rules of 
procedure have not been solidified in this respect.

submitted to the treaty bodies are confidential.  Individual and group complaints submitted to the 
United Nations special procedures mechanisms are made publicly available in the annual 
communications reports should the independent experts/special rapporteurs intervene in writing.  For 
example, there have been multiple communications written and made publicly available regarding the 
indigenous peoples living in the Prey Lang forest, on the legal framework governing indigenous 
peoples, and on the Boeung Kak Lake and Borei Keila disputes, among others.   See

</b></p>
<p>192. There is limited knowledge among NGOs and communities in Cambodia about how 
to access and engage with the complaint procedures which specifically monitor business 
activity. This is an area for additional development. Complaints alleging irresponsible 
business practices can be made public concerning any kind of company in any country.269 
Some of the multilateral institutions (e.g. the World Bank, European Commission, the IFC, 
and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development270) have institutional 
grievance procedures for cases that involve projects they fund, but the options are limited. 
In the absence of formalized mechanisms in the region,271 communities have attempted to 
reach diplomatic missions and international organizations in Phnom Penh, such as the 
Delegation of the European Union and the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as foreign embassies, submitting petitions and 
staging demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>193. Nevertheless, there have been some notable examples of international advocacy with 
formalized procedures.  Following a complaint in August 2009 prepared by the Centre on 
Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) on behalf of some 4,250 families facing forced 
eviction from their homes around Boeung Kak Lake, the World Bank Inspection Panel 
found that the Bank had breached its operational policies by failing to properly design and 
supervise the Cambodia Land Management and Administration Project.  The Inspection 
Panel found that these failures contributed to the forced eviction of Boeung Kak residents, 
who were unfairly denied the right to register their land ownership through LMAP before 
the Government leased the area to a private developer, ultimately leading to their 
involuntary resettlement and forced eviction.272  Following these findings, the World Bank 
reportedly attempted to remedy the breaches under LMAP, but the Government ended its 
project under the loan agreement.  The World Bank subsequently suspended funding for all 
new projects in Cambodia (still in force as of the writing of this report).273

<p> 270  In the 2000 review process of the OECD Council, governments committed to setting up national 
contact points (NCPs) to promote the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises to handle 
enquiries and complaints (known as &#8213;specific instances&#8214;), and act as forums for discussion in all 
matters relating to the Guidelines. Governments have flexibility in the exact form of their national 
contact point and how it operates.  No national contact point exists for Cambodia, but there are 
contact points for countries whose registered companies operate in Cambodia (for example, France, 
Republic of Korea, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Japan, United States of America, United Kingdom, 
among others). For more information, see BASES Wiki, OECD national contact points general 
information, http://baseswiki.org/en/OECD_National_Contact_Points,_General_Information.

<p> 271  Note that the Asian Development Bank Accountability Mechanism exists but would only be 
applicable to complaints associated with land concessions in Cambodia if the allegations pertained to 
an ADB-assisted project.  The mechanism excludes complaints not related to ADB actions or 
omissions.  See http://www.adb.org/site/accountability-mechanism/main.

<p>194. In addition, as part of the Cambodian Clean Sugar Campaign, there has been a 
complaint lodged with the European Commission for Trade regarding the human rights 
implications of its Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative, a European preferential trade 
scheme that allows Cambodia-based firms to export sugar and other goods to the EU 
without import duties and with a guaranteed minimum price. Among the beneficiaries of 
these trade preferences are companies implicated in land-grabbing and other human rights 
abuses. The complaint reportedly involved an appeal to the European Trade Commission to 
take action pursuant to its obligation under Article 17 of the Generalized System of 
Preferences regulation,274 requesting a thorough investigation of the alleged human rights 
abuses associated with the industry and, if appropriate, suspension of EBA benefits. 
Preferential treatment may be withdrawn temporarily for a number of reasons, including 
&#8213;the serious and systematic violation&#8214; of human rights set out in the core United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights and labour conventions, such as the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Such 
a decision is made by the Commission on the basis of the conclusions of &#8213;the relevant 
</p>
<p>monitoring bodies.&#8214;275 
</p>
<p>195. There has also been use of accredited national human rights institutions (NHRI) 
abroad,276 albeit limited, to file complaints of human rights violations which have taken 
place in Cambodia.  For example, the Community Legal Education Centre of Cambodia 
(CLEC) filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand 
(NHRC) on 6 January 2010 regarding a long-running dispute between residents of Chikor 
Leu commune&#8216;s villages of Trapeang Kandal, Chhouk and Chikor, Sre Ambel District in 
</p>
<p>Koh Kong province, against Khon Kaen Sugar Industry (a Thai company), which is the 
majority shareholder of Koh Kong Sugar Industry (KKS,) and Koh Kong Sugar Plantation 
(KKP,).277  The complaint alleges that KSL, through Cambodian subsidiaries KKP and 
KKS, obtained land concessions in Koh Kong Province in violation of Cambodian law. The 
complainants based their claim for jurisdiction of the NHRC on KSL&#8216;s ownership of KKP 
</p>
<p>and KKS, its control over operations in Cambodia, and its duty to respect human rights 
wherever it operates. Representing a success in transboundary human rights promotion and 
protection, the Thai NHRC accepted the complaint and recently issued preliminary 
findings.278 This is a landmark case for international advocacy in Cambodia, and the use of 
NHRIs could be explored further for land concession cases.

</b></p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>196.<b> At the outset, it should be noted that historical circumstances, including the 
policies of the Khmer Rouge regime and the widespread destruction and dislocation 
</b></p>
<p>left in the wake of Cambodia&#8217;s lengthy civil war, have led <b>to the proliferation of land 
</b></p>
<p><b>disputes that the Government is trying to manage.  Further, it should also be noted 
</b></p>
<p><b>that Cambodia as a developing country may wish to prioritize utilization of its land 
</b></p>
<p><b>and natural resources in order for the country to develop and become more 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosperous. Nevertheless, I am of the view that land concessions should be granted 
</b></p>
<p><b>and managed within a sound legal and policy framework, including with due 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration for and consultation with those who will be affected, and with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable use of natural resources in mind.  
</b></p>
<p>197.<b> The majority of the challenges I have identified in this report (analysed in 
sections V-VIII) derive from a failure to apply the domestic legal framework </b>&#8211;<b> that is, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the laws, policies and regulations that the Government itself has developed (explained 
</b></p>
<p><b>in section III).  The granting and management of economic and other land concessions 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Cambodia suffer from a lack of transparency and adherence to existing laws. Much 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the legal framework on these matters is relatively well developed on paper, but the 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenge is with its implementation in practice. 
</b></p>
<p>198.<b> Further, a pervasive problem that I have encountered is the uneven access to 
information, which has contributed to concessions benefiting only a minority, and a 
</b></p>
<p><b>proliferation of land related conflicts, which has the potential to contribute to 
</b></p>
<p><b>instability. The Government should be rigorous and transparent in the granting and 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring of land concessions (sections II and VI), especially when negotiating 
</b></p>
<p><b>concession agreements with both foreign and national companies, avoiding conflicts of 
</b></p>
<p><b>interest, holding concession companies to account by exercising oversight over their 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities, and resolving land disputes.  Absence of transparency in such matters has 
</b></p>
<p><b>bred suspicion of corruption at all levels of the Government and has fuelled 
</b></p>
<p><b>resentment on the part of many Cambodian citizens. In spite of visiting Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p><b>since 2009 and enjoying a relatively good level of cooperation from the Government in 
</b></p>
<p><b>many areas covered under my mandate, I had difficulty in obtaining the necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>official information and in reaching companies holding economic and other land 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessions. This lack of access to key information has made it extremely challenging 
</b></p>
<p><b>to write a comprehensive report on these issues. 
</b></p>
<p>199.<b> Cambodia, as an emerging market, risks developing an international 
reputation for insecure investment in the land sector and in general. The current 
</b></p>
<p><b>development context is characterized by low transparency and uneven access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>information, inadequate consultation and participation which is not inclusive, and, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>my view, is unsustainable and likely to hamper future national economic growth.  Of 
</b></p>
<p><b>course, some cases of land concessions seem to have had positive impacts for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>people of Cambodia in terms of job creation, stimulation of the local economy, 
</b></p>
<p><b>generation of revenue to finance public services, and an overall contribution to 
</b></p>
<p><b>national growth. However, the human cost of many concessions has been high, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights should be at the heart of the approach to the granting and management 
</b></p>
<p><b>of land concessions in order for them to have a positive impact. There are well 
</b></p>
<p><b>documented serious and widespread human rights violations associated with land 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessions that need to be addressed and remedied.  Criminalization of land activists 
</b></p>
<p><b>and human rights defenders is particularly worrying, as freedom of expression and 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly is crucial to a well-functioning democratic society.   
</b></p>
<p>200.<b> Moreover, throughout my analysis, I have struggled to fully comprehend the 
benefits of many land concessions that the Government has granted.  In general, it is </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>68</b> 
</p>
<p><b>not clear to what extent the people of Cambodia have actually benefited from land 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessions. </b>I am concerned that, despite the Government&#8217;s commit<b>ment to fighting 
</b></p>
<p><b>corruption, many concessionaires operate behind a veil of secrecy. Benefits from land 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessions, where they exist, need to be quantified and made clearer. If such benefits 
</b></p>
<p><b>are not evident, policies and practices around the granting of land concessions need to 
</b></p>
<p><b>be modified.  The impacts of land concessions should be analysed for both their short- 
</b></p>
<p><b>and long-term consequences; indeed, benefits should be genuine and outweigh costs 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the majority in order to be considered substantial.  I am of the view that the 
</b></p>
<p>development of Cambodia&#8217;s land and natural resources could have a positive impact 
</p>
<p><b>on the lives of all Cambodians if undertaken in a sustainable and equitable manner 
</b></p>
<p><b>and within the framework of the human rights obligations of the Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cambodia. It is in this constructive spirit that I present these recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Access to information and transparency 
</b></p>
<p>201.<b> The Government of Cambodia should make information on land investment, 
land deals and bidding processes, review of proposals for land concessions (and 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision-making criteria for acceptance or denial of the proposal) and future plans 
</b></p>
<p><b>(including on commencement of concession activity)  available and publicly accessible, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including via public display at the provincial level and on official governmental web 
</b></p>
<p><b>sites.   
</b></p>
<p>202.<b> The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries should update and 
complete its list of active economic land concessions and forest concessions with full 
</b></p>
<p><b>information, including the progress of the operations, and make it publicly available 
</b></p>
<p><b>in a timely manner.  The list should include full company profiles, information on 
</b></p>
<p><b>leadership, shareholders</b>, parent company, and contact details of companies&#8217; local 
</p>
<p><b>offices (including offices in the home State, where applicable), concession fees paid, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and revenue generated from the concession. This information should be available in 
</b></p>
<p><b>both English and Khmer. 
</b></p>
<p>203.<b> The Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction should 
make available information on the systematic mapping, classification and registration 
</b></p>
<p><b>of state public and state private land and create and maintain a state land database.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Information on the allocation, management and reclassification of state land should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>made available in accordance with the Sub-Decree on State Land Management of 
</b></p>
<p><b>2005. The Ministry of Economy and Finance should cooperate in this process and 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute information regarding re-classification of state properties. 
</b></p>
<p>204.<b> The Ministry of Environment should make publicly available an updated and 
current list of all protected areas, including national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, 
</b></p>
<p><b>protected landscapes, multiple use areas, Ramsar sites, biosphere reserves, natural 
</b></p>
<p><b>heritage sites, and marine parks, which includes complete information on size, 
</b></p>
<p><b>boundary, zone and use of such areas, and the decision making process for modifying 
</b></p>
<p><b>or re-classifying protected areas. 
</b></p>
<p>205.<b> The process of re-classifying land as state private land and designating 
protected areas as sustainable use zones should be conducted in an atmosphere of 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparency and openness by all concerned actors, including the Ministry of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Environment and Ministry of Economy and Finance. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>69 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Granting of land concessions </b>&#8211;<b> consultation and oversight 
</b></p>
<p>206.<b> A more coordinated and inclusive system to the granting of land concessions 
should be considered by the Government and applied by governing authorities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including taking into account national and provincial level planning processes.  The 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach should be participatory, and the development processes inclusive, in line 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the National Strategic Development Plan Update (2009-2013). 
</b></p>
<p>207.<b> All relevant government bodies and business enterprises should adhere to the 
legal requirements for public consultation, for example under the 2005 Sub-Decree on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Economic Land Concessions.  Such consultations should be meaningful, inclusive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible to affected people. Communities on land to be affected by the granting of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>land concession should be consulted at the earliest stage on the land use plan and 
</b></p>
<p><b>included in the decision-making process.  Due consideration should be given to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>current livelihood activities of the community and all efforts made to avoid their 
</b></p>
<p><b>disruption.  Standards of free, prior and informed consent should be rigorously 
</b></p>
<p><b>applied when consulting with all indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>208.<b> Greater scrutiny of the history and background of business enterprises and 
</b>their investment proposals&#8217; viability should be implemented by the relevant 
</p>
<p><b>authorities in order to screen investors before granting a land concession.  The review 
</b></p>
<p><b>of business proposals should be conducted in a transparent manner, balancing 
</b></p>
<p><b>businesses desire for confidentiality of sensitive company data with the need for public 
</b></p>
<p><b>oversight. This includes making information available on the bidding process and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>timeline agreed upon for concession activities. 
</b></p>
<p>209.<b> The re-classification of state public land to state private land should follow the 
procedures set out in the Constitution and under the 2001 Land Law, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures requiring adoption of legislation by the National Assembly. Until such a 
</b></p>
<p><b>law is passed, any re-classification that does occur should be done in an open and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent manner, with full consideration of the potential impacts of re-classifying a 
</b></p>
<p><b>given area, and with proper consultation with the relevant technical agencies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected people.  
</b></p>
<p>210.<b> The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and other concerned 
institutions should ensure that a competitive bidding process for the granting of land 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessions is more rigorously and transparently applied, for example per the 2005 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sub-Decree on Economic Land Concessions. 
</b></p>
<p>211.<b> The ELC directive (7 May 2012) establishing a moratorium on the granting of 
new economic land concessions is welcome, but should be fully implemented and 
</b></p>
<p><b>maintained until a full review of the concession system is in place. Concessions that 
</b></p>
<p><b>are found to be exploitative, inactive, or otherwise violating the conditions of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>concession agreement should be cancelled, as per the relevant laws.  The review of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>current concessions, including the work of the Technical Secretariat on ELCs, should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be made publicly available in a timely manner. Upon review, details of those 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessions that have been cancelled through this process or were previously 
</b></p>
<p><b>cancelled should be made publicly available, including information of how the 
</b></p>
<p><b>cancelled land concessions will be managed. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Granting of land concessions </b>&#8211;<b> environmental and social protection 
</b></p>
<p>212.<b> All efforts should be enhanced by the Government to implement the multiple 
laws, policies and regulations that require environmental and social impact 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessment to be carried out <i>before</i> the granting of a land concession, including the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>70</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1996 Law on Environmental Protection and Natural Resource Management, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>findings made public. 
</b></p>
<p>213.<b> The rules and procedures regarding the modification and classification of land 
in protected areas, especially sustainable use zones, should be adhered to (including by 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertaking a scientific study, provided for under the 2008 Protected Areas Law). 
</b></p>
<p><b>The results of the assessments and procedures related to modification and 
</b></p>
<p><b>classification should be made publicly available. 
</b></p>
<p>214.<b> The conditions outlined for granting land concessions in protected areas, per 
the 2008 Protected Areas Law, should be strictly adhered to.  Further, a rigorous 
</b></p>
<p><b>review of concessions granted in protected areas should be undertaken, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cancellations implemented in a timely manner. It should also be made clear what legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>grounds institutions other than the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
</b></p>
<p><b>have for granting concessions and other long-term leases for development on state 
</b></p>
<p><b>land. 
</b></p>
<p>215.<b> The lands traditionally occupied and used by indigenous peoples should be 
mapped and demarcated in an expedited manner.  No land concessions should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>granted on or near the land of indigenous peoples until <i>after</i> the processes for 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognition and registration and application for communal land title are completed. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The 2011 Inter-ministerial Circular on interim protective measures should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>rigorously applied for those communities recognized by the Ministry of Rural 
</b></p>
<p><b>Development and the Ministry of the Interior, and the process of communal land title 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be expedited to avoid further disputes. 
</b></p>
<p>216.<b> Due consideration should be given to proposals by concessionaires with 
enhanced legal and regulatory requirements attached to their investments (such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>third party certification schemes and rigorous codes of conduct) which incorporate 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards of environmental and social sustainability. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Land concession activity 
</b></p>
<p>217.<b> Companies of all sizes, structures and modes of operation, both domestic and 
foreign, and whether wholly or partly owned by the State, should address their human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights impact by practicing due diligence, including implementing measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>identify, prevent, and mitigate adverse human rights consequences and account for 
</b></p>
<p><b>their business activities. 
</b></p>
<p>218.<b> In the case of foreign-owned companies, the home States should ensure that 
representatives of private business enterprises under their jurisdiction do not 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute to adverse human rights impacts by regular monitoring and oversight. 
</b></p>
<p>219.<b> Evictions and resettlement should only be used as a last resort, and a 
moratorium on forced evictions should be in place in relation to all concession activity.  
</b></p>
<p><b>In the case of past abuses, all efforts should be made to ensure remediation. When due 
</b></p>
<p><b>process has been followed and eviction has been deemed to be legal and in the public 
</b></p>
<p><b>interest, affected families should be consulted on how and when the relocation will 
</b></p>
<p><b>occur and all efforts made to ensure it is carried out under conditions that adhere to 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards related to adequate housing and fair and just 
</b></p>
<p><b>compensation. Additional efforts should be made to re-establish livelihood 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunities.  
</b></p>
<p>220.<b> The Royal Cambodian Armed Forces should not be used to protect private 
interests, and should not be deployed or employed by concession companies, with or 
</b></p>
<p><b>without the sanction of the Government.  Police, gendarmerie and other relevant </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>71 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities should refrain from using excessive force against concession-affected 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities and protesters. 
</b></p>
<p>221.<b> The Government should ensure that concession companies do not use or 
encourage private security guards to engage or use force against concession-affected 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities and protesters.  
</b></p>
<p>222.<b> Concession companies should take all measures to avoid environmental 
destruction in their operations, including preventing water contamination, soil 
</b></p>
<p><b>deterioration, and unnecessary clearing of land or illicit logging.  They should ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that access to infrastructure, such as new roads on their concessions, is accessible to 
</b></p>
<p><b>all surrounding communities and should refrain from blocking transportation within 
</b></p>
<p><b>the boundaries of the concession. 
</b></p>
<p>223.<b> All efforts should be made by authorities authorized to approve concessions to 
prevent activities on areas of cultural and spiritual significance, as well as to address 
</b></p>
<p><b>(through remediation) adverse impacts that have already occurred. Relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>government ministries, such as the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts, may intervene 
</b></p>
<p><b>to address the impacts.  
</b></p>
<p>224.<b> Concession companies </b>&#8211;<b> with use of revenue from concession activity </b>&#8211;<b> should 
increase their contributions to the local communities, including by providing social 
</b></p>
<p><b>benefits such as health services, educational opportunities and environmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection measures. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Monitoring, research and analysis 
</b></p>
<p>225.<b> The Ministry of Economy and Finance and other relevant stakeholders should 
seek to gather data and conduct analysis on revenue generated from land concessions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the attendant benefits to the population, such as jobs created by land concession 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies and contributions to the local market arising from increased income, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>part of an evidence-based quantitative study into the concession system. This should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be made publicly available.   
</b></p>
<p>226.<b> The livelihoods and income generation opportunities of families affected by 
concessions should be examined and made part of a quantitative and qualitative 
</b></p>
<p><b>study, with solutions proposed to address negative financial impacts at the household 
</b></p>
<p><b>and community level. 
</b></p>
<p>227.<b> Researchers should further examine inadequate planning and consultation 
which are contributing to disputes related to land concessions with the aim of 
</b></p>
<p><b>quantifying (in financial terms) the losses of revenue at the national level. 
</b></p>
<p>228.<b> Greater monitoring of land use should be undertaken, and cancellation of land 
concessions implemented in a timely manner and, where appropriate, land made 
</b></p>
<p><b>available for other uses.  Cancelled land concessions should be listed by company or 
</b></p>
<p>province and made publicly available on the relevant ministries&#8217; websites, along with 
</p>
<p><b>reasons for the cancellation. 
</b></p>
<p>229.<b> In the case where a land concession has been granted on the land traditionally 
occupied and used by indigenous peoples, restitution should be provided and the land 
</b></p>
<p><b>reinstated where possible, with the opportunity for the communities to register as 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal entities and apply for communal land title. 
</b></p>
<p>230.<b> After concessions have been granted and become operational, monitoring

</b></p>
<p><b>72</b> 
</p>
<p><b>of concessionaires evaluated on a regular basis in order to ensure that poor practices 
</b></p>
<p><b>can be remedied and violations addressed. 
</b></p>
<p>231.<b> The Government should undertake a review of the breach of the 10,000 hectare 
per person limit on land concessions and the practice of granting contiguous plots of 
</b></p>
<p><b>land to affiliates or family members of concessionaires.  The Government should re-
</b></p>
<p><b>assert and enforce the legal restriction contained in the 2001 Land Law that 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessions totalling over 10,000 hectares may not be granted to the same person, or 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal entities effectively under the control of the same person. Where applicable, land 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessions in violation of this provision should be cancelled.  
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Dispute resolution 
</b></p>
<p>232.<b> Given the seemingly intractable status of long-standing land disputes and the 
proliferation of new disputes, efforts should be made to enhance effective and 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimate operational level grievance mechanisms, involving communities and their 
</b></p>
<p><b>representatives (communities may decide whether civil society organizations should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be involved) at the early stages of the granting of a land concession and including 
</b></p>
<p><b>them in the planning process. 
</b></p>
<p>233.<b> Company representatives should be fully present and engaged in local level 
dispute resolution mechanisms, so as to reduce anti-business sentiment and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourage the investment community to directly address their social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>environmental impact.  Specific efforts should be made to address language barriers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially with regard to foreign-owned companies and when indigenous communities 
</b></p>
<p><b>are involved.  As a general rule, the armed forces should not be present during local 
</b></p>
<p><b>level negotiations. Armed forces and governing authorities (including provincial and 
</b></p>
<p><b>commune officials), as well as communities, should avoid violence. 
</b></p>
<p>234.<b> All efforts should be made to bolster the administrative capacity of the 
cadastral dispute resolution mechanisms and the judiciary to improve the accessibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>of communities to remedies related to land disputes.  The capacity and independence 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the judiciary should be enhanced so that it can command the respect and trust of its 
</b></p>
<p><b>constituents.  The court system should not be used as a mechanism to criminalize land 
</b></p>
<p><b>activists, individuals making claims for their land, human rights defenders and local 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>235.<b> All efforts should be employed to monitor land dispute cases in the cadastral 
dispute resolution mechanisms and the judiciary for instances of conflicts of interest, 
</b></p>
<p><b>political interference or corruption involving concession companies.  Administrative 
</b></p>
<p><b>or judicial officials making decisions based on personal motivation should be barred 
</b></p>
<p><b>from any role in adjudication. 
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Review by human rights bodies and other international complaint 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>236.<b> The use of international grievance procedures and mechanisms, as well as 
national human rights institutions abroad, should be further explored by civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>actors in order to bring complaints of alleged human rights abuses of foreign owned 
</b></p>
<p><b>or operated business enterprises implicated in human rights violations in Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p><b>(whether the businesses are majority or minority shareholders). The possible role of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the ASEAN Inter-Governmental Commission on Human Rights may be further 
</b></p>
<p><b>examined. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>73 
</b></p>
<p>237.<b> The Cambodian Human Rights Committee could enhance its capacity to 
monitor, investigate, and report on human rights violations in the context of land 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessions.  The reports should include recommendations to relevant State 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions and business enterprises and should be made public. 
</b></p>
<p>238.<b> In order to enable the further examination of the human rights impact of 
economic and other land concessions, the Government should extend a standing 
</b></p>
<p><b>invitation to the United Nations special procedures mechanisms, or at least invite 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant mandate holders who may be able to provide detailed analysis. Particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant would be the Special Rapporteur on indigenous peoples, the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>on business and human rights, and the Special Rapporteurs on the right to food, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate housing, to education, on extreme poverty, to safe drinking water and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanitation, and on cultural rights.   
</b></p>
<p>239.<b> Considering the proliferation of abuses related to freedom of expression and 
assembly in the context of land conflicts, additional consideration should be given by 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights bodies, including the United Nations special procedures and treaty 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies, to further explore and document the criminalization of land activists, 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals claiming their rights to land and other human rights defenders working in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the land sector, with a view to providing added support and protection.  
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Land rights advocacy and education   
</b></p>
<p>240.<b> Given the increasing violations of the rights to freedom of expression and 
assembly, the Government should take measures to further implement the Law on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Peaceful Demonstration, including disseminating and training on its implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>guide. The Ministry of Interior should continue to provide guidance and raise 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness amongst provincial and municipal level authorities, including law 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement officials, on how to apply the Law on Peaceful Demonstrations in a 
</b></p>
<p>manner consistent with Cambodia&#8217;s international human rights obliga<b>tions.  
</b></p>
<p>241.<b> The Government at both national and provincials should ensure that civil 
society organizations, communities and community-based networks are free to engage 
</b></p>
<p><b>in activities related to land rights education, regardless of simultaneous events related 
</b></p>
<p><b>to, for example, preparation for and follow up to elections, land titling procedures, 
</b></p>
<p>and political parties&#8217; activities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>242.<b> The Government should engage in supporting communities to be better 
informed of their rights under the domestic legal framework governing land and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights system.  This includes how to submit legal complaints and 
</b></p>
<p><b>appeals.

<p><b>Annex III 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Union Development Group Company, Ltd.  
Botum Sakor National Park, Koh Kong province 
</b></p>
<p><b>I. Concessions granted in Botum Sakor National Park 
</b></p>
<p>The 171,250 hectare Botum Sakor National Park in Koh Kong Province was established by 
Royal Decree in 1993285 and classified as a natural park (an area reserved for nature and 
scenic views, which is to be protected for scientific, educational and entertainment 
purposes).  It was later designated as a protected area under the 2008 Protected Areas Law 
(see section III (D) 1.1).   Nevertheless, since that time, the Government has granted land 
concessions within the national park to at least nine private companies for the planting of 
agro-industrial crops (for example, acacia, palm oil, and rubber), as well as for eco-tourism, 
commercial developments, water reservoirs, and hydropower dams.286  The concessions 
have been granted through the issuance of sub-decrees to reclassify protected areas into 
sustainable use zones, which raises issues with compliance with the legal framework for the 
conservation of protected areas (see analysis in sections IV-VI).   
</p>
<p>On 9 May 2008, the Royal Government, represented by the Minister of Environment, 
signed a long-term lease contract of 99 years with Union Development Group Company, 
Ltd. for the construction of a commercial development zone and resort to attract tourists 
and further investment over <b>36,000 hectares</b> in the Kiri Sakor and Botum Sakor districts. 
The contract was signed by the Minister for Environment, approved by the Minister of 
Economy and Finance, and witnessed by the Minister of Commerce.287  This land covers a 
large portion of the coast in Kiri Sakor and Botum Sakor districts, including areas that are 
critical for the conservation and protection of the environment, as well as 12 villages in five 
communes. 
</p>
<p>On 9 April 2008, one month prior to the signing of the lease contract, the King signed a Royal 
Decree288 to amend the 1993 Royal Decree to excise the 36,000 hectares from Botum Sakor 
National Park&#8216;s total area of 171,250 hectares, and to reclassify the 36,000 hectares as state 
private land, thereby making it eligible to be granted as a long-term land concession. That same 
month the Government issued another sub-decree289 to reclassify the excised 36,000 hectares 
from Botum Sakor National Park as private state land. In addition, in August 2011, the 
Government issued a sub-decree to reclassify an additional 9,100 hectares as a sustainable use 
</p>
<p>  
 285  Royal Decree NS/RKT on the Establishment and Designation of Protected Areas, of 1 November 
</p>
<p>1993. 
 286  The companies include: 1) Sinomexim Investment Co., Ltd (4,280 hectares); 2) Union Development 
</p>
<p>Group Co., Ltd (9,100 hectares); 3) Union Development Group Co., Ltd (36,000 hectares); 4)

<p>zone and granted a second land concession to Union Development Group Company, Ltd. to 
develop a water reservoir and power plant.290  
</p>
<p><b>II. The company and the lease contract 
</b></p>
<p>Under the contract, Union Development Group is authorized to develop infrastructure that 
would support the tourism sector, including casinos, condominiums, apartments, and 
resorts. The company is authorized to clear forest area while undertaking its development, 
per the master plan, but is liable to pay royalties should it log trees with any economic 
value.<b>   
</b></p>
<p>The lease contract makes reference to a number of sub-decrees291 and laws governing the 
granting of land concessions,292 as well as a number of decisions from meetings with the 
Council for Development of Cambodia (CDC), including the intent to apply the &#8213;leopard 
</p>
<p>skin policy&#8214; in order to avoid development on land already inhabited by communities. The 
terms of the 99 year contract allow for it to be extended for another term293 and the contract 
allows the company to sub-contract, transfer rights (in whole or in part) and elements of the 
development project, or sell facilities to a third person. The contract also allows the 
Government to sell the leased land in whole or in part, with priority given to the company 
or the company&#8216;s sub-contractor.   
</p>
<p>As with any large scale project, an environmental and social impact assessment was 
required, and should have included participation of affected communities (see sections III 
(D) 1.1 and 1.3 &#8211; Law on Protected Areas and Laws on Environmental Protection and 
associated sub-decrees) and while an assessment was reportedly undertaken, there appears 
to have been no community consultation nor is it available for public review.   
</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the concession was to implement the &#8213;leopard skin policy,&#8214; disruption 
</p>
<p>to the existing villages was envisioned and, according to the lease contract, the Royal 
Government of Cambodia is responsible for the administrative functions associated with 
relocation and compensation, in cooperation with Union Development Group, who is 
responsible for the costs of compensation and for the building of the relocation site. In the 
case that a resolution to relocate certain villagers or legal land possessors from some areas 
was not found, activity in these areas is to be suspended.

<p><b>III. Communities living in the concession area 
</b></p>
<p>The villages affected by the project have been in existence for generations. The community 
members are a mix of families who settled in the area before the Sihanouk regime in the 
1960s, who relocated during or after the Khmer Rouge regime, and who arrived in the 
1980s (after the fall of the Khmer Rouge). More families moved there later following 
private purchase of land plots. The Government formally recognized these villages in the 
1990s following the end of the civil war.  According to the district officials involved in the 
assessment of the occupied land, the project could affect 1,163 families inhabiting 
residential land and tending to orchards in Kiri Sakor&#8216;s three communes (Koh Sdach, Phji 
Meas, and Prek Khsach), and in Botum Sakor&#8216;s two communes (Thmar Sar and Tanou). 
</p>
<p>The affected communities were reportedly not consulted about the project and its potential 
impacts, but had noticed company representatives and governmental officials travelling 
throughout their communes and measuring land before the signing of the contract in 2008. 
The communities were reportedly officially informed of the project, including a promise for 
compensation, for the first time during a visit in November 2009 to Kiri Sakor district by 
officials of the Ministry of the Environment, Royal Cambodia Armed Forces, the Koh 
Kong provincial government and representatives of Union Development Group.  
</p>
<p><b>IV. Implementation of the project </b>&#8211;<b> compensation and relocation 
</b></p>
<p>In total, 1,163 families, and at least one primary school and three Buddhist pagodas will 
need to be relocated.  Despite a decision to implement the &#8213;leopard skin policy,&#8214; which 
would minimize the need for relocation and interruptions to livelihood, this plan was 
reportedly abandoned and a counter decision was implemented to relocate communities 
away from the coastal areas, many of whom depend on access to the Gulf of Thailand for 
their food and income. Officials of the Government and representatives of Union 
Development Group affirmed that the &#8213;leopard skin policy&#8214; would not be implemented for 
reasons linked to water and sanitation; that is, it was claimed that this policy was not viable 
because the communities living on the coast pollute the water, and to allow them to remain 
in their current villages would negatively affect the company&#8216;s investment.  
</p>
<p>Discussions at the Ministry of Environment on relocation and compensation reportedly 
began in early- to mid-2009 and the Minister laid out options for communities in a letter to 
the Prime Minister on 27 May 2009, depending on the status of the land and the level of 
documentation households possessed.294  Possibilities for compensation included: payment 
(reportedly between USD 250 and USD 8,000 per hectare of farmland); a single family 
house on the relocation site to be built about 20 kilometers from the coast; and the 
allocation of residential and/or farming land. The four categories of compensation consisted 
of nine possible cases.295 Category one (two cases)296 are those households who have land 
</p>
<p>  
 294 Ministry of Environment Letter No. 1529, dated 27 May 2009. 
 295  The Ministry of Environment&#8216;s letter, No.496, dated 20 October 2009, informed the Provincial 
</p>
<p>Governor of Koh Kong province about the decision on the compensation policy and standard: 
<b>Standard A</b>: a maximum financial compensation of USD 8,000 per hectare for the farm land or 
orchard; <b>Standard B</b>: a home &#8211; 1) the company shall prepare a new location within the leased land 
area when the company has to remove any structures as required, but upon an agreement from the 
people; 2) the company shall provide adequate compensation or rebuild a house that complies with 
the standard of the house before it was removed; and 3) the newly established site shall be equipped 
with adequate infrastructure; <b>Standard C</b>: 75 percent financial compensation of Standard A for 
people considered local, and 50 percent of Standard A for those considered outsiders (a maximum of 
USD 6,000 per hectare); <b>Standard D</b>: a home (same as Standard B).  </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>122</b>  
</p>
<p>title issued before 1 November 1993; Category two (two cases)297 are those households 
who have land title issued after 1 November 1993; Category three (three cases) are those 
households considered to be &#8213;local&#8214; who have no land title but have occupied or used land; 
</p>
<p>and Category four (two cases) are those households who have no land title, but who have 
some documents certified by the village chief and commune chief. 
</p>
<p>An inter-ministerial working group reportedly set up an office at the Kiri Sakor district 
office and at the Thamsar commune office in Botum Sakor district from 10 August 2009 to 
10 October 2009 and invited affected households to bring supporting documents 
(identification, family books, and documents related to land transactions, sale or title) for 
review by the compensation committee. Compensation was reportedly to have been 
negotiated after the registration of existing land, starting with the land of communities 
located in Prek Smach village, Koh Sdach commune, Kiri Sakor district (678 hectares). 
</p>
<p>Subsequently, communities were reportedly informed that they were on state land and 
therefore were obliged to move. Negotiations for compensation packages reportedly took 
place in 2010 and approximately 1,000 families relocated during 2011. Some families 
resisted relocation and continue to do so, and some of the villagers reported that they 
accepted the compensation under pressure or threat, or lack of information or alternatives. 
Some other villagers voluntarily took the offer of compensation due to the small size of 
their original plot of land.  
</p>
<p><b>V. Relocation conditions 
</b></p>
<p>The relocation site is spread over 4,000 hectares of land located outside the investment 
project of Union Development Group, deep inside the Botum Sakor National Park and a 
significant distance from the coast. According to district officials, the Government issued a 
sub-decree to excise 4,000 hectares from the park for this purpose. Presumably this will 
lead to further environmental impacts as forest will need to be cleared for the relocation 
sites, and an influx of people will no doubt increase incidents of forest clearing, poaching 
and environmental pollution in this sensitive area. Despite the approximately 1,000 families 
who had relocated, due to the significant distance from the coast, many families who 
accepted compensation do not regularly stay at the relocation site due to a scarcity of 
options for income generation.  Many whose livelihoods depended on fishing have returned 
to their old villages to either stay with their former fellow community members who 
resisted relocation or have set up a temporary shelter in order to go fishing.  
</p>
<p>  
 296 Case 1: For those who have land title issued before 1 November 1993, and have used the land 
</p>
<p>(housing or farmland), whether they are considered local or outsiders, the compensation for their 
farmland and/or orchard is Standard A, and for housing is Standard B. The committee will not 
compensate the land size claimed by the people who are not specified in the land title.  Case 2: For 
those who have land title issued before 1 November 1993, but have not used the land, whether they 
are local people or outsiders, the standard compensation is 25 percent of Standard A (which is USD 
2,000 per hectare). Land claimed that is more than the size specified in the land title will not be 
considered for compensation. 
</p>
<p> 297 Case 3: For those who have land title issued after 1 November 1993, and have exploited the land 
either by having a house on the land or having farmed the land, whether they are considered local 
people or outsiders, the standard compensation is Standard C for farmland and orchard, and Standard 
D for residential property. Case 4: For those who have land titles issued after 1 November 1993, but 
have not exploited the land, whether they are considered local people or outsiders, the compensation 
is 25 percent of Standard A (which is USD 2,000 per hectare of farmland). Any land claimed that is 
more than the size specified in the land title will not be compensated. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>123 
</b></p>
<p>While compensation packages differ, in general, relocated families have been offered 
residential land of 50 meters by 100 meters, a constructed wooden house of 6.5 meters by 
7.5 meters, plus a plot of farmland of two hectares. The offered farmland is forested land, in 
some cases adjacent to the residential land, but as of late December 2011, most of the 
relocated families reported not having received the promised two hectares of farmland. 
</p>
<p>Regarding infrastructure, as of February 2012, Union Development Group had cleared the 
land for a road across the resettlement site, had built one school, and provided six wells.  
The company reportedly hired armed security personnel (private and gendarmerie) and 
established and maintained a check-point to restrict travel to some villages (for example, 
Peam Kay village and Prek Smach village) where there are villagers who resisted 
relocation. Representatives of non-governmental organizations have reportedly been denied 
use of this road and access to certain areas of the park.  The company cited traffic accidents 
and concerns about the security of company property as the need for these restrictions, but 
following negative media attention of the case in early 2012 the monitoring at the 
checkpoints has reportedly relaxed. 
</p>
<p><b>VI. Demonstrations and discord 
</b></p>
<p>Many affected communities have protested since 2010 to express their opposition to the 
relocation. In May 2010, around 200 families came to Phnom Penh to submit a complaint 
and to call on the Prime Minister to intervene in the land dispute and to address the 
inadequate compensation packages. The latest protest was the blocking of National Road 
48 on 6 December 2011 for eight hours by relocated families who were calling for the 
authorities and the company to keep their promise to allocate two hectares of farm land to 
those who accepted to move to the relocation site.  
</p>
<p>As of February 2012, more than 100 families continued to resist relocation and the offered 
compensation and were continuing to live in their villages, including in Koh Sdach 
commune (Peam Kay village and Prek Smach village), Phji Meas commune (Tany village, 
Kien Kralanh village, and Phji Meas village), Thmar Sar commune (Chamlorng Kor 
village), and Prek Khsach commune (Samroang Keo village and Yeay Sen village).  
</p>
<p>Villagers resisting relocation have continued their efforts in the hope that the Government 
will not relocate them, but their efforts have not borne fruit, or have been deliberately 
thwarted. On 28 February 2012 some communities held a press conference in cooperation 
with Phnom Penh-based non-governmental organizations to make their grievances heard. In 
March 2012 some community members traveled to Phnom Penh to participate in the 
ASEAN People&#8216;s Forum meeting and submit a complaint to the Embassy of the People&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of China and were briefly detained at the Police Commissariat of Phnom Penh on 
31 March 2012 and escorted back to their villages.  
</p>
<p>With the new directive on ELCs of 7 May 2012, some households assumed that those who 
had not accepted relocation would be eligible for titling as part of the broad implementation 
of the &#8213;leopard skin policy,&#8214; (see section III (H)). However, it was reported that the youth 
</p>
<p>deployed to the area were under orders not to demarcate the land slated for use by Union 
Development Group.  
</p>
<p>As of the writing of this report, the dispute among more than 100 families with Union 
Development Group remained unresolved, while the construction continued as planned.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>Annex IV 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Jing Zhong Ri Cambodia Company, Ltd economic land 
concession on Tumpuon indigenous land, Lumphat district, 
Ratanakiri province 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The Tumpuon indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>The Tumpuon indigenous communities in Seda commune (more than 500 families from the 
villages of Samoth Leu, Samoth Kroam, Thmei and Tatoat), Lumphat district, Ratanakiri 
province have been affected by economic land concessions granted to Jing Zhong Ri 
Cambodia Co., Ltd. and other companies. Situated within the Lamphat Wildlife 
Sanctuary,298 the community members from these villages have relied on rice farming, 
resin tree tapping, gathering of forest products, and cattle-raising for their livelihoods. As 
part of their culture and tradition, they practice slash and burn agriculture and maintain 
spirit forests and burial grounds.  
</p>
<p>Like many other indigenous peoples in Cambodia, in order to protect their community land, 
the Tumpuon communities are in the process of applying for collective land title with the 
support of the Government and development partners (see section III (F)). Following self-
identification, Tumpuon indigenous people from Samoth Leu, Samoth Kroam Thmei and 
Tatoat villages were recognized by the Ministry of Rural Development in May 2010. At the 
time of writing this report, the Ministry of Interior had accepted their application and 
recognized them as a legal entity, allowing them to proceed with the steps necessary to 
establish internal rules and demarcate their land.   These processes are significant, as they 
provide official recognition of the traditions, culture and spiritual practice of the Tumpuon, 
as well as their right to develop their land. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Economic land concessions in Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary  
</b></p>
<p>The Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary was established and classified as a wildlife sanctuary by 
Royal Decree.299  The sanctuary covers a land area of 250,000 hectares in Ratanakiri and 
Mondulkiri provinces. During the period from March 2011 to June 2012, the Government 
signed at least six sub-decrees that designate various areas of land within Lumphat Wildlife 
Sanctuary as sustainable use zones in order to grant the land to private companies for the 
development of agro-industrial crops. The companies concerned are: 1) Daun Penh Agrico 
Co. Ltd (8,825 hectares); 2) Mkod Pich Development Agro-Industry (1,950 hectares); 3) 
Hoang Anh Lumphat Co. Ltd (9,173 hectares); 4) Hoang Ang Andong Meas Co. Ltd (9,470 
hectares); 5) Roath Sokhon Incorporation (9,000 hectares); and 6) Jing Zhong Ri Cambodia 
Co. Ltd (9,224 hectares). After these sub decrees, the Government issued additional sub-
</p>
<p>  
 298 Lumphat wildlife sanctuary was recognized as one of the protected areas under the 1993 Royal 
</p>
<p>Decree of 1 November 1993 on the Protection of Natural Areas. It is under the administration of the 
Ministry of Environment. 
</p>
<p> 299 The Royal Decree of 1993 states that wildlife sanctuaries are natural areas preserved in order to 
protect wildlife, vegetation and ecological balance. The Law on Protected Areas of 2008 explained in 
broader terms that wildlife sanctuaries are &#8213;areas in land and/or water territories, which require active 
</p>
<p>interventions for management purposes to ensure maintenance of habitats and/or to meet necessary 
conditions for any species of animals or plants.&#8214;  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/63/Add.1/Rev.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>125 
</b></p>
<p>decrees to reclassify the designated sustainable use zone land as private state land. The 
granting of these land concessions raises issues with compliance with the legal framework 
for the conservation of protected areas (see analysis in sections V (C) and VI).  
</p>
<p>Jing Zhong Ri Cambodia Co. Ltd received approval from the Council of Ministers in May 
2011 authorizing investment and development of agro-industrial and rubber plantations 
within the sanctuary for a period of 70 years.300 The authorization required the preparation 
of a master plan under the auspices of the Ministry of Environment, and stipulated that care 
should be taken to avoid affecting legal residential and farmland, as well as forest areas and 
waterways. Just 18 days after the Council of Ministers letter was signed, the Government 
issued a sub-decree to designate the land as a sustainable use zone and to grant it to Jing 
Zhong Ri.301  Seven weeks after this sub-decree was issued, the Government issued another 
sub-decree to reclassify the designated sustainable use zone as state private land for 
development by the Jing Zhong Ri Company.302 
</p>
<p>During my visit to Ratanakiri, I was informed by a provincial official that an environmental 
impact assessment was conducted prior to the commencement of the activities of Jing 
Zhong Ri, but it was not publicly shared. A consultation with affected communities prior to 
the commencement of activities was reportedly lacking or not comprehensive (contrary to 
the legal framework, see section VI (D)).  Some Tumpuon peoples were reportedly only 
aware of the concession granted when Jing Zhong Ri arrived in their locality in November 
2011 with plans to commence development of a rubber plantation on the land they 
traditionally inhabited and cultivated (both farmland and spirit forest).  It would seem that 
the granting of the land concession to Jing Zhong Ri was in direct contravention of the 
rights afforded to indigenous peoples in the 2001 Land Law and undermines the processes 
set out in the 2009 sub-decree on indigenous land registration (see sections VI (E) and VII 
(G) and (H)).  My efforts to contact company representatives have been to no avail. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Action by the Tumpuon indigenous community 
</b></p>
<p>Following the letter of authorization from the Ministry of Environment to convert the land, 
Jing Zhong Ri submitted a letter to the Ratanakiri Provincial Governor on 8 December 
2011 requesting permission to start implementing their plans for development of the land, 
including in the use of heavy machinery. On 13 December 2011 the Director of the 
Ratanakiri Environment Department authorized the use of machinery; however, ostensibly 
to avoid encroachment on the Tumpuon peoples&#8216; land, he wrote a letter to prevent the 
</p>
<p>bulldozing of land along the boundary of the concession until the land had been 
demarcated.  Nevertheless, activity commenced, causing tensions between some affected 
communities, local authorities and the company&#8216;s representatives.  
</p>
<p>On 25 December 2011, a group of Tumpuon people from the affected villages went to the 
Jing Zhong Ri site to attempt to stop the company from clearing the forest and building a 
</p>
<p>  
 300 Letter, from the Deputy Prime Minister and as Minister of the Council of Ministers to the Minister of 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Environment, 12 May 2011. The letter made reference to a letter dated 4 May 2011 
from the Ministry of Environment including an annotation of the Prime Minister from 12 May 2011, 
stating that the Government agreed with the Ministry of Environment&#8216;s proposal to authorize Jing 
</p>
<p>Zhong Ri Co., Ltd. to go ahead with its investment. 
 301 Sub-Decree 98, 30 May 2011(point 1) to designate the land as sustainable use zone within Lumphat 
</p>
<p>Wildlife Sanctuary, and to grant it to Jing Zhong Ri Co. Ltd. 
 302 Sub-decree 162, 22 July 2011, referring to sub-decree 98, 30 May 2011, to reclassify the designated

</p>
<p>ditch which would mark the concession boundary. On 9 February 2012, villagers tried to 
stop the company from clearing their spirit forest (two hectares had reportedly already been 
cleared by this time), and a group of 100 protesters were thwarted by security guards 
associated with the company (one shot was fired). The community members became angry, 
attacked a tractor and held four company staff members at the commune office.  It was 
reportedly only at this point that the Ratanakiri Governor and other relevant authorities 
came to the commune office to meet the affected families and negotiate the release of the 
company staff members, and promised to find a solution. Following this incident, and in 
response to the community&#8216;s highly publicized move, various officials and villagers were 
</p>
<p>questioned about who was responsible for the protest.  
</p>
<p>Subsequently, the affected community members were informed that Jing Zhong Ri and 
other companies operating in the area would not affect their farmland but would develop 
the surrounding land in the implementation of a &#8213;leopard skin policy.&#8214; Since the February 
</p>
<p>2012 incident and as of the writing of this report, the company had suspended its activity.  
It was reported to me that the company had told the villagers that it would resume their 
activity after the commune elections in June 2012. Despite this suspension, the Tumpuon 
peoples have not been granted interim protective measures while they proceed with the 
application of their collective land title (see section VI (E)) and it is unclear when further 
development of the land will resume.
