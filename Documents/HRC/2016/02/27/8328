<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.  On 1 June 2011, at its seventeenth session, the Human Rights Council, pursuant to 
its decision 16/116, held a panel discussion on the issue of the human rights of victims of 
terrorism, taking into account, inter alia, the recommendations of the Symposium on 
Supporting Victims of Terrorism, convened by the Secretary-General on 9 September 2008, 
in New York. In its decision, the Council requested the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to liaise with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism and all concerned 
parties and stakeholders, including relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, with a 
view to ensuring their participation in the panel discussion. 
</p>
<p>2.  The panel discussion was aimed at enhancing the understanding of issues regarding 
the human rights of victims of terrorism and offered an opportunity to exchange 
information on relevant efforts made at the international, regional and national levels, and 
to share good practices with a view to increasing the capacity of States to respond to the 
needs for protection of the rights of victims of terrorism and their families, while taking 
into account their international human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>3.  The panel discussion was moderated by the President of the Human Rights Council 
and opened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The panellists 
were the Political Affairs Officer at the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, 
Department of Political Affairs, Anne Wu; the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Martin 
Scheinin; the President of the Foundation for Victims of Terrorism of Spain, Maite 
Pagazaurtund&#250;a; Rianne M. Letschert, Professor at the International Victimology Institute 
in Tilbourg (Netherlands); the Chief of the Specialized Terrorism Prevention Unit of the 
Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Mauro 
Miedico; and former Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences and current member of the Committee on the Prevention of Torture of the 
Council of Europe, Yakin Ert&#252;rk. The present summary was prepared by OHCHR, as 
requested by the Council in decision 16/116. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights and contributions of panellists 
</b></p>
<p>4.  In her opening statement, the High Commissioner stressed that the Global Counter-
Terrorism Strategy, adopted by the General Assembly in 2006,1 recognized the need to 
promote and protect the rights of victims of terrorism. She emphasized that the Symposium 
on Supporting Victims of Terrorism convened by the Secretary-General in 2008 offered a 
first occasion for victims of terrorism from around the world to discuss their loss and 
suggest ways of addressing their needs. The High Commissioner welcomed the fact that the 
Human Rights Council had requested that the panel discussion seek to build on the 
recommendations of the Symposium, and pointed out that it was an opportunity for States 
to share good practices and experience relating to national legislation and policies in 
responding to the multiple challenges involved when protecting the human rights of victims 
of terrorism. She highlighted the fact that terrorist acts caused a high number of direct and 
indirect victims who required immediate assistance and long-term medical and psycho-
social support, as well as financial aid. As a point of departure for designing policies and 
</p>
<p>  
 1 General Assembly resolution 60/288, annex. </p>


<p>mechanisms to support victims, she referred to the importance of the right to effective 
remedies and reparation for the harm suffered by them, as embodied in international human 
rights standards, including the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of 
Crime and Abuse of Power2 and the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a 
Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights 
Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law.3 The High Commissioner 
emphasized that victims of terrorist acts should be provided with information, in a timely, 
truthful and transparent manner, about the facts and circumstances of the terrorist act and 
any ensuing investigations and judicial proceedings. The victims should be given the 
opportunity to effectively participate in judicial proceedings and other mechanisms with the 
appropriate protection against intimidation, retaliation and arbitrary interference with their 
right to privacy; victims should also be provided with equal access to justice and 
appropriate assistance throughout the legal proceedings. Concluding her presentation, the 
High Commissioner called upon States to put in place comprehensive policies and 
mechanisms to prevent further terrorist attacks, emphasizing that such measures should 
address effectively human rights violations, including discrimination, enhance respect for 
the rule of law and tackle the underlying causes of terrorism, such as the obstacles to the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>5.  In her presentation, the Political Affairs Officer at the Counter-Terrorism 
Implementation Task Force pointed out that the panel discussion was an opportunity to 
recall the international community&#8217;s unanimous condemnation of terrorism and to pay 
</p>
<p>tribute to victims of terrorism. She referred to the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, 
which offered a strategic framework, policy guidance and a plan of action for collective 
counter-terrorism efforts at all levels. She emphasized that the Strategy gave special 
importance to the promotion and protection of human rights, including the human rights of 
victims of terrorism. The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force had been 
established to coordinate system-wide activities to assist States in implementing the 
Strategy. She emphasized that supporting the victims of terrorism remained one of the 
priorities of the Task Force, as the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy calls to build 
international solidarity with victims of terrorism. She referred to the importance of the 
recommendations of the Symposium on Supporting Victims of Terrorism, and the recent 
initiatives of the Task Force in preparing a compendium of best practices for supporting 
victims of terrorist crimes and related offences, and in organizing a media training 
programme for victims of terrorism to give them a stronger voice. She concluded her 
presentation by recalling that terrorism was a challenge to human rights and pointed to the 
important role of States in countering it. 
</p>
<p>6.  The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Mr. Scheinin, emphasized the 
importance of a victim&#8217;s perspective in a comprehensive and holistic approach to his 
</p>
<p>mandate. He pointed to the responsibility of States in implementing human rights and 
called for the creation of mechanisms for the effective implementation of human rights 
obligations, including with respect to non-State actors. The Special Rapporteur referred to 
his country visits and stated that there was no contradiction between defending the human 
rights of victims of terrorism and the human rights of persons affected by counter-terrorism 
measures. It appeared that those Governments ignorant of the human rights violations 
resulting from their counter-terrorism measures are often also ignorant about the human 
rights of victims of terrorism. The Special Rapporteur referred to his report submitted to the 
Human Rights Council (A/HRC/16/51) on 10 areas of best practice in countering terrorism, 
</p>
<p>  
 2 General Assembly resolution 40/34, annex. 
 3 General Assembly, 60/147, annex. </p>


<p>in particular practice 6, which stipulates that &#8220;damage to natural and legal persons and their 
property resulting from an act of terrorism or acts committed in the name of countering 
terrorism shall be compensated through funds from the State budget, in accordance with 
international human rights law.&#8221; The practice further provides that &#8220;natural persons who 
have suffered physical or other damage or have suffered violations of their human rights as 
a result of an act of terrorism or acts committed in the name of countering terrorism shall be 
provided with additional legal, medical, psychological and other assistance required for 
their social rehabilitation through funds from the State budget.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur 
emphasized that the work undertaken in the field of remedies for gross violations of human 
rights was applicable and presented best practices in relation to the promotion of the human 
rights of victims of terrorism, and referred in particular to the Basic Principles and 
Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of 
International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian 
Law. Furthermore, he discussed his country visits to Turkey and Peru, where he found 
valuable examples for effective collective and individual reparation programmes addressing 
the needs of both the victims of terrorism and the victims of abusive counter-terrorism 
measures by State authorities. The Special Rapporteur concluded his presentation by 
emphasizing that the strategy to bring together victims of terrorism and victims of counter-
terrorism measures would help build bridges across political, geographical, religious and 
ethnic lines to achieve effective and sustainable results in combatting terrorism.  
</p>
<p>7.  The President of the Foundation for Victims of Terrorism of Spain, Ms. 
Pagazaurtund&#250;a, stated that counter-terrorism policies must scrupulously respect the rule of 
law. She emphasized that victims of terrorism and the analysis of their human rights were 
not considered a priority. As a consequence, she called upon the Human Rights Council, 
supported by OHCHR, to establish the necessary mechanisms to address this shortcoming. 
She referred to the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which states that 
&#8220;the acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations are 
activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>Ms. Pagazaurtund&#250;a called for the adoption of provisions at the international level 
establishing a legal status for victims of terrorism, encompassing a catalogue of human 
rights and obligations for States regarding the provision of reparation, access to justice, the 
prohibition of impunity and victims&#8217; participation in judicial proceedings. Such a step was 
</p>
<p>necessary to avoid discrimination of the victims of terrorism vis-&#224;-vis other categories of 
victims. Highlighting the need for the United Nations and Member States to increase their 
efforts in the protection of the human rights of victims of terrorism, she called upon the 
Council to continue its work to developing new standards in that field. The Foundation for 
Victims of Terrorism would support a resolution of the Council to ensure that the issue of 
the human rights of victims of terrorism is considered by United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and procedures. In particular, she called for the establishment of a special 
procedures mandate to examine the consequences of terrorist acts, the methods and 
practices of the strategies of terrorist groups and the situation of the human rights of victims 
of terrorism. In addition, she suggested that the international community fully recognize a 
universal right to be free of terrorists and terrorist acts of all kinds, and requested States to 
assess national practices that lead to impunity for terrorist acts and create obstacles for 
victims of terrorism to obtain reparation.  
</p>
<p>8.  Professor Letschert pointed out that, while the issue of terrorism had been on the 
international agenda for years, less attention had been paid to the rights of the victims of 
terrorism. She referred to specific instruments that included provisions on the rights of 
victims of terrorism, such as the 2002 Framework Decision on combating terrorism of the 
European Union, the legislative initiative recently adopted by the European Commission 
aiming at the strengthening of victims&#8217; rights, and the Council of Europe Guidelines on the 
</p>
<p>Protection of Victims of Terrorist Acts, adopted in 2005. She introduced the work of a </p>


<p>consortium of research groups that had been requested by the European Commission in 
2008 to conduct a study on the needs of victims of terrorism with the aim of identifying 
possible reasons for the adoption of a specific recommendation relating to the rights of 
victims of terrorism. The outcome of the analysis showed that the legal position of victims 
of terrorism was largely identical to that of victims of violent crimes, but that additional 
complexities may arise in implementing general victims&#8217; rights in the context of 
</p>
<p>victimization by terrorist acts. The study demonstrated, for example, that the need for 
compensation might not be different in kind when comparing victims of terrorism and 
victims of crime. The assessment did not, however, rule out the possibility that the need 
might be different in degree, for example regarding its urgency. As a result of the study, a 
draft European Union recommendation for assistance to victims of acts of terrorism had 
been prepared, in which a more extensive approach was suggested to include, inter alia, 
provisions relating to psycho-social assistance, access to justice, compensation, information 
strategies and access for victims of terrorism to restorative justice practices and procedures. 
In addition, the draft recommendation called upon States to consider public inquiries in 
order to give full and public disclosure of the background and circumstances of the terrorist 
act, in addition to launching effective and independent criminal investigations. The draft 
recommendation also envisaged that States should consider additional reparative measures, 
such as commemorations and tributes to the victims or proper reburial of the bodies, in 
addition to financial compensation.  
</p>
<p>9.  The Chief of the Specialized Terrorism Prevention Unit of the Terrorism Prevention 
Branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Mr. Miedico, referred to General 
Assembly resolution 64/168, in which the Assembly urged relevant United Nations bodies, 
including the Office, within its mandate related to the prevention and suppression of 
terrorism, to step up its efforts to provide, upon request, technical assistance for building 
the capacity of Member States in the development and implementation of programmes of 
assistance and support for victims of terrorism. To implement the resolution, the Office was 
developing a publication to give special recognition to support for victims as a key 
component of a successful domestic criminal justice system. Mr. Miedico noted the 
importance of collecting best practices to support victims of terrorism, including legislative 
measures and operational modalities. In this regard, he referred to the relevant human rights 
of victims of terrorism<b>,</b> such as the rights to recognition and information, participation in 
criminal proceedings, protection of security and privacy, compensation and assistance. Two 
expert meetings formed the basis of the publication, which was meant to serve as training 
material to build the capacity of criminal justice officials in their response to terrorism and 
as a tool to assist Member States in the development of their national programmes of 
assistance and support for victims of terrorism. Among the main issues dealt with by the 
forthcoming publication, Mr. Miedico referred to an analysis of international and regional 
standards on countering terrorism, the growing recognition of the role of victims in criminal 
proceedings, the importance of sharing knowledge on national criminal justice provisions 
and practices relating to support for victims, and the relevance of tailor-made assistance 
within the criminal justice response in support for victims.  
</p>
<p>10.  Ms. Ert&#252;rk pointed to the importance of a broad understanding of the term 
&#8220;victimhood&#8221;. She stated that the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
</p>
<p>women contributed to this approach when it placed the right-holder at the centre of the 
analysis. Ms. Ert&#252;rk emphasized that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and 
Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) had significantly expanded the consideration of 
gender issues and allowed for a closer look at the relationship between, and the intersection 
of the issues of terrorism and gender. In this connection, she expressed appreciation for the 
gender perspective related to countering terrorism as elaborated by the Special Rapporteur </p>


<p>on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism in 
his report submitted to the General Assembly in 2009.4 She also recalled that the country 
visits she carried out as Special Rapporteur on violence against women demonstrated that, 
in situations affected by terrorism or armed conflict, women are often caught between being 
targeted by terrorist groups and the State&#8217;s counter-terrorism measures, which may fail to 
prevent, investigate, prosecute or punish these acts. Ms. Ert&#252;rk referred to counter-terrorism 
measures that use gender stereotypes as a proxy for profiling on the basis of race, national 
or ethnic origin or religion. In this regard, she mentioned the practice of some countries of 
arbitrarily detaining women using headscarves or regarding them as suspects of terrorist 
acts. She pointed to the parallel danger of women rights being instrumentalized in 
environments affected by terrorism. She concluded her presentation by referring to the 
growing and comprehensive international framework on gender issues and women&#8217;s human 
rights, including the creation of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
Empowerment of Women and the Convention on preventing and combating violence 
against women and domestic violence adopted in 2011 by Member States of the Council of 
Europe. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of the discussion 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Need for a strengthened focus on the human rights of victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>terrorism  
</b></p>
<p>11.  Many delegations condemned the acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its 
forms and manifestations. Several Member States recalled that, for years, international 
discourse focused on the perpetrators of terrorist acts and the human rights of victims of 
abusive counter-terrorism measures. In this connection, many delegations welcomed the 
fact that the panel discussion was specifically dedicated to the issue of human rights of 
victims of terrorism. Several delegations stated that terrorist acts infringed on a number of 
human rights, while some of them added that this was regardless of whether such acts were 
committed by State or non-State actors.  
</p>
<p>12. In accordance with the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, delegations pointed out 
that terrorism was a global phenomenon that could not and should not be associated with 
any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group. In this context, some delegations 
recalled that addressing the root causes of terrorism was a key issue, pointing to the 
particular relevance of preventive measures. Delegations also emphasized the importance of 
strengthening international cooperation to protect the human rights of victims of terrorism 
and recalled the provisions of relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, the 
Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council. In particular, they pointed 
to the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy that recognized the need to promote and protect 
the rights of victims of terrorism.  
</p>
<p>13. Member States expressed support for the work accomplished to date, in particular 
the efforts made by the Working Group on Supporting and Highlighting Victims of 
Terrorism of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force. In this regard, delegations 
emphasized the specific role of victims and the important contribution of civil society to 
help to address the conditions conducive to terrorism by sensitizing society, building 
community resilience to terrorism and bringing alleged perpetrators to justice. Delegations 
also acknowledged the work undertaken by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
</p>
<p>  
 4 A/64/211. </p>


<p>in developing programmes and providing Member States with technical legal and related 
assistance concerning specialized thematic areas, including terrorism, supporting victims of 
terrorism and building the capacity of criminal justice systems of Member States to bring 
perpetrators of terrorist acts to justice.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional and domestic practices for the protection of the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>of victims of terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>14.  During the panel discussion, many delegations emphasized that reparation to victims 
of terrorism was a fundamental aspect of protecting and promoting their human rights, and 
referred to practices at the regional and national levels.  
</p>
<p>15. At the regional level, the Guidelines on the Protection of Victims of Terrorist Acts, 
adopted by the Council of Europe in 2005, recognized the suffering endured by victims and 
called for national and international solidarity and support. The Guidelines were further 
endorsed by the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, the 
first binding instrument in Europe to address the issue of the prevention of terrorism and to 
contain a binding provision for States on protection, compensation and support for victims 
of terrorism. Pointing to the challenge to enforce the standards in all its Member States, it 
was highlighted that the Council of Europe had recently established a follow-up mechanism 
on the implementation of the Convention. Furthermore, it was stressed that the Council of 
Europe paid special attention to the right to recognition, the right to support and aid and the 
right to reparation, while advocating for the protection of the human rights of victims of 
terrorism.  
</p>
<p>16.  The protection of victims in criminal proceedings was addressed in a number of 
European Union legislative instruments. It was noted that the Framework Decision on 
combating terrorism adopted by the Council of the European Union in 2002 represented an 
addition to the existing &#8220;general regime&#8221; on victims. It stipulated that &#8220;victims of terrorist 
offences are vulnerable, and therefore specific measures are necessary with regard to 
them.&#8221; The Decision also provided that &#8220;each Member State shall, if necessary, take all 
measures possible to ensure appropriate assistance for victims&#8217; families.&#8221; Under the 
Framework, actions in support of victims include emergency assistance, continuing 
assistance and support to victim involvement, investigation and prosecution, access to 
justice, compensation and other reparative measures, restorative justice, protection of the 
private and family life, protection of dignity and security, the provision of information to 
victims and the public, and specific training for persons responsible for assisting victims. 
Moreover, the relevance of support for community-based initiatives, including the 
formation of groups of victims or relatives to stimulate mutual assistance, empower them 
and strengthen solidarity in society, was underlined. In this connection, reference was made 
to the Network of Associations of Victims of Terrorism, established by the European 
Commission, and its work to enhance transnational cooperation among associations of 
victims of terrorism and to increase the representation of victims&#8217; interests at the European 
Union level.  
</p>
<p>17. In the light of the call of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy upon Member 
States to put in place &#8220;on a voluntary basis, national systems of assistance that would 
promote the needs of victims of terrorism and their families and facilitate normalization of 
their lives&#8221;, delegations shared their experience at the domestic level. 
</p>
<p>18. The representative of Turkey referred to the Law on the Compensation of Damages 
that Occurred due to Terror and the Fight against Terrorism (2004), which lays down the 
&#8220;principles and procedures for compensation of material damages suffered by persons due 
to terrorist acts or activities undertaken during the fight against terror.&#8221; Damages </p>


<p>compensated include those resulting from injury, physical disability and death and the 
expenses made for medical treatment and funerals, damage to movable and immovable 
property, agricultural damage, and material damage resulting from the inability of persons 
to have access to their assets because of the activities carried out in the context of the fight 
against terrorism. The representative pointed out that a total of 51 compensation 
commissions had been set up, and that 75 per cent of applications submitted up until 
November 2010 had been processed; in 60 per cent of cases, compensation had been 
granted. 
</p>
<p>19. In connection with the Law on Justice and Peace (2005), Colombia pointed to the 
work of the National Commission for Reparation and Reconciliation, which aimed to 
provide access to justice and truth, and reparation for victims of terrorism, without 
distinction on the basis of gender, age or ethnic group. In addition, the representative of 
Colombia referred to the recently adopted Victims and Land Restitution Act (2010) , which 
would be applied for a period of 10 years and could provide reparation to some 350 
families per day, or 1 million families per decade. It was noted that the Act regarded as 
victims those who had individually or collectively suffered harm from events occurring 
after 1 January 1985, as a consequence of violations of international humanitarian law, or 
grave and manifest violations of international human rights law occurring in the context of 
armed internal conflict.  
</p>
<p>20. The approach taken by Morocco to the human rights of victims of terrorism and 
their families focused on three main areas: prevention, assistance and sensitization. The 
preventive work includes adherence to all relevant international instruments and the 
Government&#8217;s engagement in related matters at the international, regional and subregional 
levels. With regard to assistance, the support of authorities for victims of terrorism in the 
social, administrative, legal, medical, psychological and financial domains was highlighted. 
A third component was a global strategy focusing on the promotion of human rights, 
economic and social development, education and promotion of tolerance, as well as raising 
public awareness. .   
</p>
<p>21. The representative of France, recalling the important role played by victims and civil 
society in addressing matters relating to the human rights of victims of terrorism and the 
fight against terrorism, referred to the establishment of a compensation fund and specific 
measures that guarantee access to justice and treatment for victims of terrorism.  
</p>
<p>22. In Algeria, the protection of victims of terrorism was addressed by Presidential 
decrees no. 06-93 of 28 February 2006, on the compensation of victims of the national 
tragedy, and no. 06-94 of 28 February 2006, on State assistance to impoverished families 
affected by the involvement of one of their relatives in terrorism. In order to implement 
these provisions, a national compensation fund and a national solidarity fund had been 
established to finance compensations paid to, other forms of reparation for and 
rehabilitation of victims. 
</p>
<p>23. In Peru, a series of measures aimed at acknowledging victims, ensuring restitution of 
their rights and providing for financial and moral reparations had been adopted. It was 
noted that the comprehensive plan for reparations contained a broad definition of the term 
&#8220;victim&#8221;, allowing reparation not only for those who had been direct victims of terrorist 
attacks but also for others who became vulnerable or had their rights violated as a result of 
counter-terrorism measures. In this connection, Peru shared the view of the Special 
Rapporteur about the need to elaborate programmes of reparation that provide justice to 
victims of terrorism as well as to the victims of counter-terrorism measures, and their 
families. With regard to the reparation of victims of terrorism and their families, the 
implementation of the collective reparations programme for communities affected by 
violence was highlighted. When pointing to challenges encountered in relation to the </p>


<p>provision of individual reparations, Peru mentioned the difficulty in locating victims and 
verifying their identity in order to register them. 
</p>
<p>24. According to Israeli legislation, notably the Benefits for Victims of Hostilities Law 
(5730-1970) and the Invalids/Compensation and Rehabilitation Law (5719-1959), victims 
of hostilities and their families were entitled to monetary remuneration and various benefits 
designed to assist and support them in their recovery. In addition, a new protocol had been 
established for anxiety victims, which provides for immediate care to prevent the 
development of chronic symptoms and which separates reparation from care provision.  
</p>
<p>25. In Indonesia, national legislation provided not only for the protection of victims of 
terrorism, but also of witnesses of terrorist acts. In this respect, the delegation pointed to 
Law no. 13 on Witnesses and Victims Protection (2006) and Government Regulation no. 44 
on Compensation, Restitution and Assistance to Witnesses and Victims (2008).  
</p>
<p>26. In Switzerland, the Federal Law on Assistance to Victims of Crimes (1991) had 
come in to force in 1993 together with the European Convention on the Compensation of 
Victims of Violent Crimes (1983). Assistance was given to all persons who had been victim 
of a crime resulting from a direct attack on their  physical, psychological or sexual integrity, 
and their family members. As the domestic legislation makes no distinction between 
different categories of victims of crimes, these provisions applied equally to victims of 
terrorism and to their families.  
</p>
<p>27. The Federal Law on counteraction against terrorism of the Russian Federation 
together with a series of regulations provided for compensation for damages incurred by 
physical or legal persons as a result of terrorist acts and for social rehabilitation of victims 
thereof. The main objective was the reintegration of victims into society. Medical, 
psychological and legal support was provided free of charge. In addition, victims had the 
right to professional retraining and assistance in finding employment, at the expense of the 
State. Housing was also provided by the State to those who had lost their homes as a result 
of terrorist acts.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Proposals to enhance the protection of the human rights of victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>terrorism  
</b></p>
<p>28. Several States and non-governmental organizations supported the idea of a 
compilation of good practices to strengthen the human rights protection of victims of 
terrorism. One delegation referred in particular to reparation, compensation, protection of 
dignity, security, privacy, assistance in criminal proceedings and the rights to justice, truth 
and memory as areas in which the sharing of good practices was specifically needed. 
</p>
<p>29. There was also a need for more practical and concrete measures to be taken, 
especially with regard to compensation-related measures. In this connection, the importance 
of the creation of a voluntary fund to assist victims of terrorism was underlined by non-
governmental organizations. Furthermore, it was emphasized that support at national level 
should take various forms and go beyond reparation; reference was also made to the 
importance of  material, legal and psychological assistance.  
</p>
<p>30. Some States and non-governmental organizations recommended broadening the 
scope of the current mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism to include the issue of 
the human rights of victims of terrorism. One State called for the establishment of a 
separate mandate on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of victims of terrorism. It also suggested that the Human Rights Council adopt, at 
an upcoming session, a catalogue of the human rights of victims of terrorism. One non-</p>


<p>governmental organization proposed that specific legal status be granted to victims of 
terrorism. 
</p>
<p>31. The importance of awareness-raising and remembrance initiatives was highlighted 
throughout the panel discussion. Every year, the European Union commemorates on 11 
March the European Day on Remembrance of Victims of Terrorism. One delegation 
suggested that 19 August be proclaimed the International Day of Remembrance of and 
Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism.5 In addition, the International Conference on Victims 
of Terrorism, held on 16 and 17 June 2011 in San Sebastian, Spain, and the seventh 
International Congress on Victims of Terrorism, held from 15 to 17 September 2011 in 
Paris, were mentioned as opportunities to assemble associations with the objective of 
sensitizing the population and raising awareness. One non-governmental organization 
expressed its intention to campaign for greater recognition, respect and fulfilment of the 
human rights of victims of terrorism in the coming years.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Comments and replies by the panellists 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Political Affairs Officer at the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force 
pointed out that States could contribute to awareness-raising of the human rights of victims 
of terrorism by taking part in the series of regional workshops organized by the Counter-
Terrorism Implementation Task Force and organizing media campaigns on the experiences, 
needs and concerns of victims of terrorism, as recommended at the Symposium on 
Supporting Victims of Terrorism and confirmed by the workshop on Compensating 
Victims of Terrorism, held in Syracuse, United States of America, in 2010. Ms. Wu added 
that the Working Group on Supporting and Highlighting Victims of Terrorism of the Task 
Force was planning to partner the Centre on Global Counter-Terrorism Cooperation and the 
Global Survivors Network in a series of projects, starting with a media training programme 
for victims of terrorism.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur suggested that the Human Rights Council request the 
mandate of Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism to prepare a thematic report on the issue 
of the human rights of victims of terrorism. Mr. Scheinin pointed out that greater support 
was needed in general from the Council to ensure that the recommendations of special 
procedures mandate holders were implemented, adding that, instead of creating new 
mandates, the Council should empower existing ones and strengthen them with follow-up 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>34. The President of the Foundation for Victims of Terrorism of Spain referred to the 
complex nature human rights violations resulting from terrorist acts and pointed out that the 
damage caused by terrorists was both public and private. Ms. Pagazaurtund&#250;a emphasized 
that Terrorist acts left behind not only private but also public mourning; it was therefore the 
responsibility of the entire democratic society to stand up to terrorism and face its effects. 
She concluded by referring to the work undertaken in Spain by different organizations to 
propose to different United Nations mechanisms to move forward and defend the human 
rights of victims, a process in which victims could play a crucial role. </p>
<p>35. Professor Letschert acknowledged and welcomed the requests of States and non-
governmental organizations for concrete recommendations regarding the follow-up. She 
pointed out that setting up a voluntary fund at the international level would be a concrete

<p>step towards addressing the needs of victims of terrorism and urged States to take necessary 
measures in this regard.  
</p>
<p>36. The Chief of the Specialized Terrorism Prevention Unit of the Terrorism Prevention 
Branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime welcomed the proposal of 
participants to receive specific guidance and to collect good practices, and referred to the 
Office&#8217;s collection of legislative and operational modalities in the field of criminal justice 
and in supporting victims of terrorism. As an example of a good practice, Mr. Miedico  
referred to the right to information, which had been addressed in the case of terrorist 
incidents with a large number of victims through the creation of a webpage for victims of 
those acts so that they could obtain information about the status of relevant criminal 
proceedings.  
</p>
<p>37. The member of the Committee on the Prevention of Torture of the Council of 
Europe and former Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences pointed to the necessary distinction between random victimization and 
targeted victimization by terrorist acts, which required different strategies with regard to the 
protection of victims. Ms. Ert&#252;rk endorsed the call of the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism for greater support by the Human Rights Council in relation to the 
implementation of recommendations made by special procedures mandate holders, rather 
than creating new mandates. 
</p>

enlightening and had raise the awareness of participants of the fact that, in the determined
