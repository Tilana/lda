meetings presented their reports. 
</p>
<p><b>Report of the mini-plenary meeting of the countries of Central America and the 
Spanish-speaking Caribbean 
</b></p>
<p>24. The mini-plenary meeting of the countries of Central America and the Spanish-speaking 
Caribbean submitted the following text: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. <i>We recognize</i> that efforts to combat racism, xenophobia and all forms of 
discrimination are a necessary and unavoidable prerequisite for the construction of 
governance, sustainable development, social justice, democracy and peace in our region.  
Nevertheless, we continue to observe persistent inequalities in the Americas and 
non-compliance with certain obligations in the promotion and protection of equality at 
the national, regional and international levels.  Therefore, <i>we</i> <i>reaffirm</i> our commitment to 
the documents adopted in Santiago and Durban, understanding that these are ineluctable 
commitments by States, regional and international bodies and civil society; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>We urge</i> the States of the region to promote, in the discussions of the 
General Assembly, the adoption of a process of monitoring and evaluation of the Durban 
agreements, comparable to that used for other World Conferences of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>We call upon</i> the States of the region to support the early adoption of the 
Inter-American Convention against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination and 
Intolerance of the Organization of American States (OAS).  Likewise, <i>we call upon</i> 
States to support the adoption and entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities; 
</p>
<p>4. Similarly, <i>we call upon</i> States that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the 
Diversity of Cultural Expressions and other international human rights instruments that 
promote equality and non-discrimination.  In addition, <i>we invite</i> States that are parties to 
international human rights instruments to implement international legal norms effectively 
within their countries; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>5. <i>We call upon</i> the General Assembly to adopt the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and <i>urge</i> the early, successful conclusion of 
negotiations on the OAS draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>We appeal</i> to the States of the region that have not yet acceded to the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination to do so as a matter 
of urgency, with a view to its universal ratification, and also to make the declaration 
provided for in article 14 of the Convention; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>We urge</i> the organs and programmes of the United Nations, multilateral 
development agencies and OAS to pay priority and permanent attention to efforts to 
combat racism and all forms of discrimination, particularly discrimination against 
women.  <i>We request</i> these agencies to mainstream gender and race in all their activities; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>We ask</i> States to support the mandate of the Special Rapporteurship on the Rights 
of Persons of African Descent and on Racial Discrimination of the OAS Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights and of the mechanisms and organs related to efforts to 
combat discrimination and racism of the United Nations Human Rights Council, in 
particular the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
peoples, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, the Working Group of 
Experts on People of African Descent, the Independent Eminent Experts Group to follow 
up the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the Independent Expert on 
minority issues; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>We recommend</i> that States, in cooperation with international organizations 
working on this issue, develop a racial equality index for the region that would permit the 
analysis of current forms of racism and discrimination to be standardized and regulated 
and facilitate their quantification; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>We recommend also</i> that States, in cooperation with the relevant international 
agencies, conduct censuses and collect, compile, analyse and publicize statistics and data 
disaggregated by race and ethnicity, taking into account socio-economic indicators such 
as health, infant and maternal mortality, life expectancy, literacy rate, education, 
employment, housing, land ownership, water, sanitation, energy and communications 
services, poverty and average disposable income.  Available quantitative data will 
facilitate objective, informed decision-making processes and the design, implementation 
and evaluation of public policies, plans and programmes against discrimination, at the 
same time respecting human rights and diversity and promoting the participation of the 
populations concerned in the development of methodologies and instruments; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>We request</i> States and the United Nations to adapt the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs) to the Durban and Santiago Commitments.  <i>We consider</i> it necessary to 
continue the pursuit of gender and ethnic equality as an essential precondition for 
attaining the MDGs and overcoming poverty in our region.  <i>We believe</i> also that the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>MDGs can serve as benchmarks for measuring the progress made in the political, 
economic and social development of peoples of African descent and indigenous peoples 
in the region.  To this end, it will be necessary to adopt specific goals for the reduction of 
socio-economic inequalities. 
</p>
<p>12. <i>We call upon</i> States and international and multilateral development agencies to 
allocate and increase technical and financial support to national bodies for the promotion 
of social equity and civil society organizations committed to racial equality in order to 
implement the Santiago and Durban agreements.  This support must also promote the 
strengthening and leadership of people of African descent, indigenous peoples and the 
Roma, with special attention to women and young people; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>We ask</i> States and international agencies to mainstream a gender perspective in all 
their plans, projects and programmes against racism and for racial equality; 
14. <i>We request</i> States and international agencies to pay particular attention to victims 
of racism who suffer multiple or aggravated discrimination on other related grounds, such 
as sex, age, migrant status, language, disability, religion, sexual orientation and identity, 
political or other opinions, social origin, economic situation, nationality, birth or any 
other condition.  <i>We declare</i> that recognition of diversity must enable the differences and 
specificities of groups and peoples suffering from discrimination to be valued.  <i>We 
recommend </i>that international agencies establish specific departments within their 
structures to address issues of gender and race; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>We express our solidarity</i> with the people of Haiti and <i>request</i> that the search for 
solutions be given priority on international and regional agendas; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>We recognize</i> that the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, transgender and 
transvestite community are often victims of human rights violations and experience 
various forms of discrimination and stigmatization.  <i>We reaffirm</i> our condemnation of 
such practices.  <i>We also recognize</i> that the situation of some victims of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance is further aggravated by reason of 
their sexual orientation; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>We urge</i> States to analyse and reformulate their existing education systems in 
order to reflect the multiracial, multi-ethnic, multicultural and pluralist nature of our 
region.  <i>We ask</i> also that educational curricula, courses and programmes recognize our 
diversity, reclaim our indigenous and African heritage, mention and recognize the 
valuable contributions made by indigenous people, peoples of African descent and 
migrants to our history and include the history of indigenous peoples as a topic in social 
science courses; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>We reaffirm</i> our commitment to eradicating illiteracy in our region, considering 
this to be a crucial goal; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>We request</i> Ministries of Education, the media and cultural bodies to take specific 
measures to combat racism and racist and xenophobic stereotypes; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>20. <i>We recommend</i> that the United Nations convene a regional or international 
conference on racism and the media; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>We recognize</i> the right of our communities and peoples to land, territories and 
resources that they possess through traditional ownership or another traditional form of 
occupation or use, in addition to those that they have acquired in any other manner.  
<i>We also recognize</i> the right of our communities and peoples to preserve and protect the 
environment and the productive capacity of their land, and the importance of territorial 
integrity; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>We recommend</i> that States implement specific policies and actions aimed at 
guaranteeing the active political participation of peoples of African descent, indigenous 
peoples and their representatives in the various decision-making spheres.  Furthermore, 
<i>we encourage </i>the implementation of electoral reform to guarantee the full participation 
of these groups.  In addition, <i>we call</i> for power structures to be examined in order to 
identify exclusionary practices and for political parties to be urged to incorporate 
measures against racism and discrimination.  In this connection, <i>we recognize</i> the 
importance of the Black Parliament of the Americas for attaining this goal; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>We ask </i>States, international organizations and multilateral development agencies 
to give priority to efforts to combat poverty, paying particular attention to peoples of 
African descent, indigenous peoples and women.  <i>We reaffirm</i> that we cannot tackle the 
challenges of poverty and development without addressing racism and discrimination and 
its role in reproducing relations of inequality; 
</p>
<p>24. <i>We urge </i>States, international organizations and civil society to increase social 
investment in children and youth as a strategy for combating poverty, bearing in mind the 
historically disadvantaged situation of children of African descent and indigenous 
children.  <i>We encourage</i> the promotion of actions to combat discrimination against young 
people and the adoption of measures designed to enable them to participate effectively in 
decision-making processes; 
</p>
<p>25. <i>We recognize</i> that poverty, lack of access to education, unemployment and social 
breakdown all too often lead to isolation, marginalization and violence.  <i>We ask</i> States to 
pay special attention to young people of African descent and indigenous youth living in 
marginalized neighbourhoods of the region&#8217;s big cities, who are particularly affected by 
urban violence, by tackling juvenile delinquency, violence and small-scale trading in 
illicit drugs and weapons from a social and human rights perspective centred on 
strengthening social capital and building the capacities of young people of African 
descent and indigenous youth; 
</p>
<p>26. <i>We urge</i> States to punish and combat violence perpetrated by State security 
forces, which disproportionately affects indigenous adolescents and young people and 
those of African descent; 
</p>
<p>27. <i>We ask</i> States to pay attention to the impact of drug trafficking on our 
communities, particularly on young people; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>28. <i>We request</i> States to carry out an in-depth evaluation of the concept of affirmative 
action and to review the procedures for establishing national bodies that work to combat 
racism and discrimination, in order to measure their capacity for impact and intervention 
and their fiscal fitness.  <i>We also request</i> States to publicize the experiences of national 
bodies working against racism and discrimination; 
</p>
<p>29. <i>We urge</i> States to eradicate practices of barring entry on grounds of race or 
ethnicity to private places that are open to the public; 
</p>
<p>30. <i>We request</i> States to adopt without delay policies allowing full access to health 
care without discrimination; 
</p>
<p>31. <i>We ask</i> States to guarantee and recognize the traditional health-related knowledge 
of indigenous peoples and peoples of African descent.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Report of the mini-plenary meeting of the Southern Cone countries 
</b></p>
<p>25. The mini-plenary meeting of the Southern Cone countries submitted the following text: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. <i>We recognize</i> that racism is part of the structure of social relations and that it 
generates racial inequalities, thereby reproducing patterns of concentration of wealth and 
power in historically privileged groups; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>We ask</i> States to include the issue of racial equality and efforts to combat 
discrimination in their intergovernmental discussions at the bilateral, regional and 
international levels and with donor countries and institutions; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>We urge</i> States to ensure respect for the human rights of migrants, particularly 
undocumented migrants, who are forced to migrate owing to economic, social and 
political imbalances linked to the globalization process; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>We invite</i> States to establish and implement comprehensive, intersectoral policies 
for combating violence that provide comprehensive protection for indigenous, 
Afro-descendant and gypsy adolescents and young people, as well as migrants, women 
and members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, transvestite and transgender 
community; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>We urge</i> States to draw up policies without delay for reducing cases of lethal 
violence against Afro-descendant and indigenous adolescents and young people, the 
majority of which are committed by State security forces, and to combat impunity for 
such crimes; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>We urge</i> States to ensure the right of every indigenous and Afro-descendant child 
and adolescent living in Latin America and the Caribbean, of whom there are millions, to 
survival and development, to learn how to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS, to grow 
up without violence and to be the absolute priority.  This must be done by means of 
participatory models that promote self-esteem and a positive self-image and value ethnic 
and racial diversity, thereby reducing the historical consequences and intergenerational 
transmission of racism and discrimination; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. <i>We call upon</i> States, television networks and other mass media, both public and 
private, to work towards an agreement in applying a multiracial aesthetic standard and in 
producing programmes aimed at promoting the self-esteem of non-white ethnic and racial 
groups; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>We appeal</i> to States to develop and implement affirmative action policies in order 
to:  (a) provide equal access to quality higher education establishments for indigenous 
and Afro-descendant students and also ensure that they stay on and successfully complete 
their courses; and (b) foster equality of opportunity in access to employment.  
Affirmative action policies will have to be adopted wherever necessary and wherever 
discriminatory practices are observed; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>We request</i> international cooperation and development agencies and States to 
ensure that programmes to combat social exclusion and poverty give priority to 
indigenous groups and those of African descent; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>We urge</i> States to promote effective measures for preventing and combating the 
crime of trafficking in persons and to develop assistance and protection programmes for 
victims; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>We encourage</i> States and civil society to promote exchanges of knowledge and 
experience on traditional communities of African origin; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>We call upon</i> States to establish and strengthen national institutions for the 
promotion of racial equality and the promotion and protection of the human rights of 
victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination and 
intolerance, particularly people of African descent, indigenous peoples, gypsies and 
migrants, and to provide them with sufficient resources to ensure effective action.  Such 
institutions must work with civil society participation; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>We request</i> States to incorporate environmental issues into their health and 
education systems and to view environmental issues, access to drinking water and the 
right to a healthy environment in the context of health indicators; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>We call upon</i> States, international agencies, private enterprise and civil society to 
avoid any environmental discrimination occurring as a result of their work, with serious 
consequences for future generations.  <i>We also call upon</i> all these actors to reflect on the 
fact that the vulnerable groups in the different regions who suffer from social 
discrimination obviously also suffer from environmental discrimination and racism; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>We encourage</i> States, particularly governmental bodies working on this issue, to 
coordinate their action, share their experiences on good practices and adopt a regional 
approach to international agencies and donor agencies and countries; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>We call upon</i> States to incorporate the International Convention on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families into their national 
legislation and practice, as one of the basic instruments for combating racism and 
discrimination; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. <i>We also call upon</i> States to design specific programmes to give greater visibility 
and recognition to traditional peoples, particularly the Roma, indigenous and Quilombola 
peoples, with a view to safeguarding their material and non-material property; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>We encourage</i> resident representatives of the United Nations and directors of 
specialized agencies in the region to promote incorporation of the issue at the country 
team level; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>We encourage</i> financial and development institutions and bilateral and 
multilateral international organizations (Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank, 
United Nations and others), within the scope of their mandates, to adopt efforts to combat 
racism as the cornerstone of their activities, projects, policies and programmes.&#8221;

<p><b>Report of the mini-plenary meeting of the countries of the Andean region 
</b></p>
<p>26. The mini-plenary meeting of the countries of the Andean region submitted the following 
text: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. <i>We recognize</i> the importance of strengthening the formulation of public policies 
and programmes designed to promote equality, with the broad and democratic 
participation of the different peoples and communities; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>We call upon</i> States to publicize the issues of equality, non-discrimination, 
diversity and interculturalism throughout the State system; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>We note</i> that there is an imbalance between the recognition and the application of 
policies to promote the rights of indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>We note with concern</i> the discrimination affecting migrants, who are subject to 
exploitative labour conditions, and inhabitants of isolated rural areas and border areas; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>We reject</i> emphatically the failure to recognize the human rights of people who 
have become migrants, internally displaced persons or refugees as a result of a variety of 
problems; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>We consider it necessary</i> to study and analyse the new forms and manifestations 
of discrimination and racism; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>We register</i> our frustration with States&#8217; failure to fulfil the commitments that they 
made in Durban and Santiago; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>We stress</i> the heightened impact of discrimination in conflict areas.  <i>We note with 
alarm </i>that violations of human rights and humanitarian law in these areas affect 
indigenous and Afro-descendant young people more severely; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>We ask </i>States, through their Ministries of Health, to accord due importance to 
maternal and infant mortality and sexual and reproductive health and to incorporate these 
issues as priorities in their health agendas; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>10. <i>We consider it necessary </i>to include the problem of domestic and sexual violence 
in the analysis and study of gender discrimination; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>We ask </i>States to guarantee recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to land 
ownership and to incorporate mechanisms that ensure free and informed prior 
consultation on the use and exploitation of their resources; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>We urge </i>States to promote and strengthen the full participation of people of 
African descent, indigenous people and the general public, through broad-based dialogue 
mechanisms, in formulating and implementing policies, plans and programmes that 
promote equality and non-discrimination; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>We request </i>States and international agencies working on the issue to provide 
financial support to regional initiatives for the adoption and implementation of action 
plans against racism and discrimination, particularly involving the Andean Community of 
Nations and the Andean Development Corporation; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>We stress </i>the obligation to establish, guarantee and promote effective access to 
justice systems on a basis of equality and non-discrimination.  In addition, <i>we consider it 
essential</i> to eliminate racial preconceptions in judicial proceedings, ensuring effective 
access to the administration of justice that, for ethnic groups and other groups suffering 
from discrimination, includes appropriate legal defence and appeal mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>We urge </i>States to incorporate into judicial proceedings an anti-racism perspective 
that excludes the use of racial profiling and characterizes racism as an offence; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>We request </i>States to establish mechanisms that guarantee access to justice for 
victims of racism and discrimination; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>We call upon </i>States to commit themselves more wholeheartedly to the 
United Nations mechanisms working against discrimination and racism; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>We also call upon</i> the United Nations to consider possible ways of facilitating 
access by its mechanisms and instruments to victims of racism, discrimination, 
xenophobia and other forms of intolerance.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Report of the mini-plenary meeting for the countries of North America and the 
English-speaking Caribbean 
</b></p>
<p>27. The mini-plenary meeting for the countries of North America and the English-speaking 
Caribbean submitted the following text: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;1.<i> We consider</i> it crucial that the United Nations system retake into consideration the 
agreements reached in Durban and in other related international summits and 
conferences.  Similar attention must also be paid to this issue by the Organization of 
American States and subregional multilateral organs;  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 2<i>. We recommend</i> that States that have adopted the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action should be accountable for its effective implementation.  In this 
regard efforts should be made to include States that were not involved in this process;  
</p>
<p> 3<i>. We consider</i> it essential to look to immigration and related deportation questions 
from a human rights perspective;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>We invite </i>Governments and civil society to reflect on the demilitarization of 
borders in the region for the promotion of human rights and peace;  
</p>
<p> 5<i>. We encourage</i> States to promote the adoption of policies and programmes to 
counter gender discrimination concerning access to labour, credit and to promote equal 
chances and opportunities for education and development;  
</p>
<p> 6<i>. We call upon</i> States to address inequality in the legal justice system for people of 
African descent, indigenous people and migrants;  
</p>
<p> 7<i>. We note with concern</i> that racism in some education systems adversely affects the 
life chances of Afro-descendent students and black people.  It results in social and 
economic marginalization, severe poverty, social exclusion, frustration and anger.  We 
further note that racism can show up in the following forms: 
</p>
<p> (a) &#8216;Safe School&#8217; laws, which cause a very high percentage of 
Afro-descendent students to be suspended or expelled from school;  
</p>
<p> (b) Dropping out of school before completing their education, and its adverse 
effect on their life chances;  
</p>
<p> (c) A smaller percentage of Afro-descendants going on to post-secondary 
education and training compared to other ethnic and racial groups;  
</p>
<p> (d) Youth who cannot effectively compete in the high-tech employment sector 
along with other racial and ethnic groups;  
</p>
<p> (e) Much higher unemployment rates among Afro-descendants; 
</p>
<p> (f) Due to the higher unemployment rates, Afro-descendent youths tend to get 
involved in antisocial behaviour, which bring them into conflict with law enforcement 
authorities;  
</p>
<p> (g) Afro-descendent youths tend to be criminalized in the justice system more 
than other racial groups.   
</p>
<p> 8. Therefore, <i>we consider</i> that there is a need to ensure equal access to quality 
education at all levels as well as equal access to employment opportunities;  
</p>
<p> 9<i>. We consider</i> that these development initiatives must be supported by social 
programmes that include post-traumatic syndrome treatment following systemic racism 
and antisocial behaviour and natural disasters (for example, hurricanes Katrina/Ivan);  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 10.<i> We urge </i>States to develop effective disaster-management programmes;  
</p>
<p> 11.<i> We urge</i> States to adopt state-of-the-art technology to support the detection of 
natural disasters and training programmes for disaster preparedness and protection of the 
environment;  
</p>
<p> 12.<i> We recommend</i> to States that the structure of the major group consultation process 
on sustainable development include people of African descent, people with disabilities 
and older persons in their societies; <b> 
</b></p>
<p> 13.<i> We encourage</i> States to use the Millennium Development Goals as a reference to 
measure the political, economic, and social development of Afro-descendent and 
indigenous peoples, that live in both developing and developed countries and other 
segments;  
</p>
<p> 14<i>. We urge</i> States as well as development and financial organizations to take into 
account racism as one of the main obstacles in achieving sustainable development and in 
attaining the Millennium Development Goals;  
</p>
<p> 15.<i> We invite</i> all concerned actors to continue the dialogue and thinking with regard 
to redress and providing reparations for Afro-descendants regarding the slave trade;  
</p>
<p> 16.<i> We encourage</i> States to consider the establishment of a Permanent Forum of 
Afro-descendants within the United Nations, using the same model as the existing 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Populations;  
</p>
<p> 17.<i> We urge</i> States and the United Nations to encourage the full participation of 
Afro-descendants in major United Nations conferences and meetings;  
</p>
<p> 18.<i> We invite</i> the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as well as international 
financial institutions to support the initiative for Afro-descendants in the Caribbean to 
eliminate poverty, and strengthen the trade links with interregional trade to ensure 
economic benefits for sustainable development;  
</p>
<p> 19. <i>We urge </i>States<i>, </i>the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as well as 
international financial institutions to ensure equal access to quality health care to reduce 
chronic diseases that lead to poor quality of life;  
</p>
<p> 20. <i>We</i> <i>encourage</i> States to support proactive programmes for lifestyle change and 
active risk management to reduce HIV/AIDS;  </p>
<p> 21. <i>We request</i> the United Nations to establish a deadline for countries that are not 
submitting Human Development Reports;  
</p>
<p> 22. <i>We urge</i> States to adopt appropriate legal framework and action plans to ensure 
implementation of the recommendations adopted at this conference;  
</p>
<p> 23. <i>We</i> <i>recommend</i> that the United Nations integrate the outcome of the Durban 
Conference in all its relevant world conferences and programmes.&#8221; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Conclusions of the Conference 
</b></p>
<p>28. At the fifth plenary meeting, held on 28 July 2006, the Chairperson of the Regional 
Conference presented the following conclusions: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. The Regional Conference was an opportunity for States and members of civil 
society of the hemisphere, six years after the Santiago Preparatory Conference (held 
in 2000), to evaluate progress and challenges in implementing the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action.  We must recognize that the present moment is characterized 
by the adoption of specific decisions for introducing effective public policies in the fight 
against all forms of discrimination on grounds of race, colour, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual 
orientation, language, religion, political or any other opinions, national or social origin, 
economic situation, migrant, refugee or displaced person status, birth, status as a carrier 
of a stigmatized communicable disease, genetic characteristic, deficiency, incapacitating 
psychological suffering or any other social condition; 
</p>
<p>2. During the Regional Conference, <i>we recognize</i> that this is a good time to compile 
and share good practices in the region.  The peoples of the Americas unanimously view 
their multi-ethnic, multicultural composition as positive and as contributing to human 
coexistence, the promotion of human rights, the building of cultures of peace and mutual 
respect, and the consolidation of democratic political systems; 
</p>
<p>3. In the Regional Conference, <i>we reaffirm</i> the premise that the international system 
for the protection of human rights was created and operates according to the principles of 
equality and non-discrimination.  <i>We</i> <i>recall</i> that the latter are one of the guiding 
principles of the United Nations and that article 1 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights establishes that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and 
rights.  In addition, <i>we reaffirm</i> the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>We observe</i> that in recent years, faced with the alarming problems of racism and 
discrimination, we have been able to raise awareness of these problems and have 
achieved significant results at the global level.  Many international human rights 
instruments have been promulgated and adopted to fight discrimination.  In addition, 
<i>we recognize</i> the legislative and constitutional progress made at national level in the 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, people of African descent and migrants in 
the region; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>We welcome</i> the fact that the principal international forums and organizations are 
paying greater attention to this issue.  In 2001, the adoption of the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action promoted new United Nations mechanisms for evaluating 
progress and challenges in combating racism and racial discrimination.  <i>We welcome</i> the 
establishment of the following mechanisms:  the Working Group of Experts on People of 
African Descent, the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action; the Independent Eminent Experts 
Group to follow up the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action; and the Permanent  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Forum on Indigenous Issues.  Moreover, in June of this year the recently created 
Human Rights Council adopted the text of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, on which the General Assembly will vote at the end of the year.  
The Conference registered its support for the adoption of the text of the Declaration by 
the General Assembly; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>We welcome</i> with satisfaction the adoption of specific, comprehensive 
instruments that are the result of mature debate and the rejection of discrimination in all 
its forms.  This is evidenced by the entry into force of the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in 
July 2003; the creation in February 2005 of the Special Rapporteurship on the Rights of 
Persons of African Descent and on Racial Discrimination of the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights; the adoption by the OAS General Assembly in June 2006 
of a resolution permitting negotiation of the preliminary draft Inter-American Convention 
against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination and Intolerance, a Brazilian initiative 
that received broad support at the time; and the latest negotiations in the United Nations 
General Assembly on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which 
will protect, promote and guarantee the rights, fundamental freedoms and dignity of 
persons with disabilities and whose early entry into force we particularly call on States to 
support. 
</p>
<p>7. <i>We stress</i> that the inclusion of issues relating to efforts to combat racism and to 
the promotion and protection of human rights and racial equality in the governmental 
structures of countries of the region demonstrates the growing consensus on the linkage 
between participatory, inclusive democracy and efforts to combat racism and 
discrimination.  Argentina, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil, 
Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, 
Peru, the United States of America and Uruguay have established bodies to address this 
issue.  Such bodies are fundamental to efforts to combat racism, strengthen democratic 
governance and prevent conflicts.  It was suggested that the Governments of the region 
should establish a programme of action for the strengthening of governmental institutions 
that will permit effective, ongoing promotion of racial equality and exchanges with civil 
society; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>We note</i> the expansion of discussions on possible monitoring mechanisms at the 
national level, the construction of indicators for monitoring the impact of public policies 
for combating racism and discrimination and the incorporation of a gender perspective in 
the analysis and design of such policies; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>We recommend</i> the development of methodologies for monitoring the outcome of 
public plans, programmes and policies to promote equality and diversity and combat 
racism and discrimination.  Governments and international agencies will have to consider 
generating reliable statistical data disaggregated by race, sex, geographical region and 
socio-economic variables to permit proper monitoring of public policies to promote racial 
equality and combat racism; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>10. <i>We welcome</i> the proposal to strengthen and coordinate United Nations 
mechanisms for monitoring the action taken by Governments of the region to comply 
with the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>We observe</i> that racism and racial discrimination remain evident in access to 
health, education, housing, employment and the administration of justice in the countries 
of the Americas.  <i>We recommend</i> that those countries adopt human rights training 
programmes with an anti-racism and anti-discrimination approach for public servants, 
including those working in the administration of justice, especially security service, 
prison and police personnel.  In designing training programmes, the pernicious effects of 
discrimination in public spaces, particularly with respect to the application of the law and 
the administration of justice for indigenous and Afro-descendant young people will have 
to be taken into account; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>We believe</i> that other issues also requiring preventive action are intolerant racist 
and xenophobic political platforms, which make it difficult, for example, to enact 
punitive legislation against racism and discrimination, the repudiation of affirmative 
action policies and the identification between ethnic or racial origin and a situation of 
poverty.  To avoid such misunderstandings, educational campaigns against discrimination 
and intolerance must be promoted; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>We consider</i> it necessary to promote effective application of the international 
human rights instruments ratified by the States of the region by means of specific actions.  
<i>We highlight</i> the suggestion that development policies should be drawn up for border 
areas, particularly where indigenous, Afro-descendant and gypsy populations are affected 
by migration and internal displacement; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>We recommend that</i> the Millennium Development Goals adopted by the 
General Assembly should incorporate the spirit of the documents adopted in Durban and 
Santiago, taking into account the interrelationship between obstacles to human 
development and the situation of vulnerable groups in the region; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>We reaffirm</i> that poverty is often closely linked to racism and discrimination and 
that these practices aggravate conditions of poverty, marginalization and social exclusion.  
<i>We consider</i> that the factors that lead to poverty among people of African descent and 
indigenous peoples are mainly structural and that discrimination is apparent in lack of 
equal opportunity and in disadvantages in access to basic services, education, labour 
markets, loans and technology.  Moreover, <i>we observe</i> that these groups have 
traditionally been excluded from the political process and that racial and ethnic 
prejudices tend to aggravate this situation.  In this connection, <i>we recognize</i> what is 
known as the &#8220;right to positive discrimination&#8221; and <i>stress</i> the need to adopt and 
implement affirmative action policies in order to make amends for historical injustices, 
remedy structural disadvantages and socio-racial discrimination and create diversified 
and proportionally representative groups in power structures; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. To this end <i>we encourage</i> the decisive progress made in the proposal to develop 
multicultural and intercultural policies in the education, health and communication 
spheres and in power structures that address, above all, the different needs and specific 
problems of women, persons with disabilities, older persons, children and indigenous and 
Afro-descendant young people in the region; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>We stress</i> the need to provide access to legal means for guaranteeing recognition 
and observance of the legitimate right of victims of human rights violations to seek 
redress for the material and non-material harm suffered; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>We recognize</i> also the need to give indigenous people, migrants and people of 
African descent greater visibility in the mass media; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>We welcome</i> the important role played by civil society in monitoring the activities 
of governmental institutions working for equality and non-discrimination, in order to 
contribute to and obtain more effective and transparent action in promoting diversity in 
the region; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>We urge</i> international agencies and bodies to continue to offer support to regional 
initiatives for the review and appraisal of the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, 
in 2001, and the recently created Human Rights Council to put the proposal for such a 
review into effect as soon as possible; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>We welcome</i> the proposal to conduct subsequent consultations between State and 
civil society representatives, with United Nations support, on issues directly linked to the 
Regional Conference of the Americas; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>We confirm</i> our broad support for the proposal to establish mechanisms for the 
promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous, migrant, Afro-descendant and 
gypsy children and adolescents in the Americas; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>We note</i> with satisfaction the progress made in the region as described by 
government representatives and <i>recommend</i> the strengthening and coordination of 
national institutions that promote equality and non-discrimination.  These institutions 
promote actions aimed at overcoming the remaining obstacles that are preventing the full 
integration of vulnerable groups in the societies of the Americas; 
</p>
<p>24. In addition, <i>we identify</i> new, innovative projects, thereby fulfilling an essential 
function of interactive dialogue among the principal protagonists of efforts to combat 
racism and discrimination in the region; 
</p>
<p>25. <i>We call upon </i>States to act on the recommendations that have been adopted, 
thereby strengthening specific actions and increasing available resources for combating 
discrimination and promoting equality; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. <i>We reiterate</i> the spirit of renewed political will and of commitment to the 
promotion of human rights and to equality, justice and the dignity of the human person.  
<i>We pay</i> well-deserved tribute to the memory of victims of colonialism and transatlantic 
slavery and all victims of racism, discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance throughout 
the world.  May this memory be for each vulnerable group a source of inexhaustible 
energy for the continuing struggles against new forms of xenophobia, racism and 
discrimination and contemporary forms of slavery; 
</p>
<p>27. <i>We celebrate</i> the fact that the Regional Conference has brought together those 
active in the struggle against racial discrimination, racism, xenophobia and related 
intolerance in the region in order to give renewed impetus to the consensuses already 
reached and to strengthen the promotion of diversity, equality, peace and democracy in 
the Americas.  <i>We declare</i> that we will achieve all this through solidarity, cooperation, 
dialogue, inclusion and respect for human rights.&#8221; </p>
