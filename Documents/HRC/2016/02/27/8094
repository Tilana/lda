<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The special rapporteurs, representatives, independent experts and chairpersons of 
working groups of the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights and the 
Human Rights Council have held annual meetings since 1994. The Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 
1993, underlined the importance of preserving and strengthening the system of special 
procedures and specified that the procedures and mechanisms should be enabled to 
harmonize and rationalize their work through periodic meetings.1 
</p>
<p>2. During the annual meeting, mandate holders exchanged views with the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the President of the Human Rights 
Council. Meetings were held with a number of stakeholders, including representatives of 
States, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, non-governmental 
organizations and national human rights institutions. Human rights mainstreaming was 
among the principal thematic issues discussed.  
</p>
<p><b> II.  Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>3. The meeting was opened by the Chairperson of the eighteenth annual meeting and 
Chairperson of the Coordination Committee of special procedures, Farida Shaheed. She 
welcomed the recently appointed mandate holders, and expressed appreciation to the 
outgoing mandate holders for their contributions.  
</p>
<p>4. The participants were welcomed by the Chief of the Special Procedures Branch, who 
provided an update on recent developments in the special procedures system. Since the end 
of June 2011, four thematic mandates had been established by the Human Rights Council: 
the Working Group on transnational corporations and other business enterprises (replacing 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue); the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence; the 
Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order; and 
the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to the enjoyment of 
a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment. New country mandates were created 
to address the situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and the Syrian Arab Republic.2 In sum, there are 46 
mandates, including six five member working groups, bringing the number of mandate 
holders to 69.  
</p>
<p>5. In 2011, special procedures carried out 82 visits, while the number of States 
issuing a standing invitation for visits rose to 90, from 80 in 2010. During the past 
year, special procedures sent 604 communications, 75 per cent jointly, to States 
regarding concerns over specific individuals and situations. Unfortunately, the 
response rate by States remains low, at around 35 per cent.  
</p>
<p>6. Mandate holders were informed that, in 2011, the Office of the High Commissioner 
(OHCHR) adopted an internal gender policy, which included recognition of the long-
standing commitment of special procedures to integrate women&#8217;s rights and equality issues 
into their work. In almost all its resolutions relating to mandates, the Human Rights Council 
requested integration of gender aspects, and many special procedures had examined how 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/CONF.157/24 (Part I), part II, para. 95. 
 2 For the latter, the Special Rapporteur will commence his mandate when that of the commission of 
</p>
<p>inquiry on the situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic has ended. </p>


<p>issues falling within their mandates have a differential impact on the enjoyment by women 
of their human rights. OHCHR is analysing the work of mandate holders in this area in 
order to provide them with updated information. 
</p>
<p>7. Attention was drawn to the OHCHR Management Plan 2012 and the annual report 
for 2011. One of the six thematic strategies of OHCHR focuses specifically on 
strengthening human rights mechanisms, including the special procedures, while their work 
has also contributed to the development of the other thematic strategies of the Management 
Plan. Examples of special procedures activities and results included in these reports were 
highlighted. 
</p>
<p>8. The participants elected the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in 
Haiti, Michel Forst, Chairperson of the meeting and the Coordination Committee. The 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, was 
elected Rapporteur and member of the Coordination Committee. The Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of internally displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of migrants, Fran&#231;ois Cr&#233;peau, and a member of the Working Group 
on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, 
Puvan J. Selvanathan, were endorsed as members of the Committee. Farida Shaheed, as 
former Chairperson, will remain an <i>ex officio</i> member for the coming year.  
</p>
<p>9. The provisional agenda of the meeting was adopted as revised. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Activities of the Coordination Committee 
</b></p>
<p>10. The former Chairperson of the Coordination Committee briefed participants on the 
activities of the Committee in 2011/12, noting that it had focused on strengthening 
engagement with various stakeholders, including the Human Rights Council, States and 
regional human rights systems. Emphasis had also been placed on identifying situations and 
cross-cutting issues of common concern to mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>11. Pursuant to the standing invitation to mandate holders to participate in special 
sessions of the Human Rights Council, the outcome of a discussion between the President 
of the Council and the Coordination Committee Chairperson in November 2008, 
arrangements were made to facilitate contributions of special procedures at special sessions. 
Mandate holders presented statements on behalf of all special procedures at the special 
sessions on the situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic, which were held on 
22 August and 2 December 2011, and 1 June 2012. The Chairperson also presented a 
statement on behalf of all special procedures during the high-level panel discussion on 
mainstreaming human rights, convened during the nineteenth session of the Council. 
</p>
<p>12. The Chairperson and the Rapporteur met with the President of the Human Rights 
Council twice to discuss the interaction of mandate holders with the Council and exchange 
views on issues of mutual concern. The Chairperson met with representatives of various 
regional groups of States to strengthen dialogue between special procedures and States. 
Cooperation with the African regional system for human rights was strengthened. The 
Chairperson, together with eight other mandate holders, including two Coordination 
Committee members, participated in a dialogue between special procedures of the Council 
and of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in Addis Ababa on 17 and 
18 January 2012, organized by OHCHR in cooperation with the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the African Union Commission. A working group of the 
special procedures of the United Nations and the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights was established. </p>


<p>13. No complaints of alleged misconduct of mandate holders were brought to the 
attention of the Coordination Committee, and no communications were submitted to the 
Committee under its Internal Advisory Procedure in 2011/12. The Committee remained 
ready to address situations considered to be of concern to the system as a whole 
proactively, with due regard for the responsibility of individual mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>14. OHCHR organized two induction sessions for new mandate holders, in October 
2011 and May 2012, during which members of the Coordination Committee briefed 
participants on the Committee and participated as resource persons. With regard to follow-
up to issues discussed at the eighteenth annual meeting, mandate holders now had access to 
individual generic e-mails, information-sharing had been facilitated through the 
establishment of an extranet and several administrative issues had been resolved. The 
consolidated communications report submitted to the Human Rights Council at each of its 
sessions since September 2011 was noted as particularly positive. The strengthening of 
coordination, notably with regard to country visits and priority issues across mandates, 
remained a principal objective for the coming year, as did raising the visibility of the 
system of special procedures and mainstreaming human rights. Informal interaction 
between the Committee and the President of the Council and regional groups should be 
continued. 
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Exchange of views with the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>15. The High Commissioner observed that the continued expansion of the special 
procedures system through the creation of new mandates bore testimony to the relevance of 
their work and their key position in the human rights machinery. She highlighted the 
valuable role played by special procedures in providing early warning and advocating for 
the prevention of human rights violations, as shown by their participation, facilitated by the 
Coordination Committee, through public statements at the special sessions of the Human 
Rights Council on the Syrian Arab Republic and the many communications and public 
statements on other situations. She also commended the special procedures for drawing 
attention to systemic issues affecting the international community, such as the challenges to 
sustainable development, the financial crises and globalization. 
</p>
<p>16. The High Commissioner emphasized how she consistently addressed cooperation 
with special procedures and follow-up to their recommendations in her interaction with 
States, reminding them of their commitments to issue invitations, facilitate country visits, 
respond to communications and protect those cooperating with special procedures from 
reprisals. She was pleased that, at the annual meeting, time had been dedicated to the 
discussion of human rights mainstreaming, given that working closely with United Nations 
entities heightened the impact of recommendations and improved follow-up with 
authorities on their implementation.. She encouraged mandate holders to develop such 
partnerships further, and pointed out that OHCHR would continue to promote special 
procedures across the United Nations system. OHCHR currently had 58 field presences; 
wherever colleagues were present at the national level, they would always provide full 
support. The work of special procedures reinforced and complemented the work of 
OHCHR in the field, and played a valuable role in raising the profile of specific issues and 
situations. 
</p>
<p>17. The High Commissioner stated that regional human rights organizations were key 
partners and welcomed the strengthened cooperation of mandate holders with the special 
rapporteurs of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, seen in the road 
map adopted at the joint meeting held in Addis Ababa in January 2012. The 
implementation of the decision to prepare a consolidated communications report ha d </p>


<p>been positive, and although initially some States had expressed concern with regard 
to the report, none had been expressed since the report had been submitted to the 
Council at its nineteenth session. The High Commissioner deeply regretted the fact that 
reprisals continued against persons who had interacted with human rights 
mechanisms, and noted that, at recent Council sessions, the issue had attracted special 
attention. She, together with the President of the Council and several special rapporteurs, 
had condemned such acts. She stressed that she would continue to do her utmost to ensure 
that States respected their obligation to protect those who cooperate with human rights 
mechanisms, and that any suspected act of intimidation or reprisals were responded to 
vigorously and perpetrators held to account. 
</p>
<p>18. The mandate holders congratulated the High Commissioner on the extension of her 
mandate and expressed appreciation for the support provided by her Office, with several 
noting that continuity in staffing was important. It was observed that the visibility of special 
procedures had to be raised and that follow-up remained an area that required 
strengthening. Various mandate holders gave examples of their fruitful collaboration with 
OHCHR field offices in country visits, while a few suggested that this was an area that 
could be strengthened. The point was also made that there was potential for OHCHR to 
engage with the business sector, particularly transnational business corporations. The 
mandate holders pointed to the important role OHCHR played in the promotion of human 
rights mainstreaming in the United Nations system, and suggested that it would be useful to 
document the experience that special procedures had with United Nations country teams. 
With regard to the universal periodic review, some mandate holders observed that it would 
be useful for mandate holders who had recently visited countries under review to be present 
and participate in the review of those countries. On documentation issues, mandate holders 
expressed concern at the lack of available translations of their reports in official languages 
and editing practices concerning reports submitted to the General Assembly. Challenges in 
combining family life, particularly where mandate holders were parents of infants or young 
children with exercising a special procedures mandate, were noted, and it was suggested 
that relevant guidelines could be developed. The High Commissioner reaffirmed her 
commitment to continue to ensure financial support for special procedures, but observed 
that the current economic situation was unfavourable and that this had also affected the 
Office. She pledged her support with regard to of the issues concerning documentation and 
translation. 
</p>
<p><b> V.  Human Rights Council and the special procedures system 
</b></p>
<p>19. The participants exchanged views with the President of the Human Rights Council, 
Laura Dupuy Lasserre, Permanent Representative of Uruguay to the United Nations Office 
at Geneva, the Chief of the Human Rights Council Branch of OHCHR and the Chief of the 
Universal Periodic Review Section of OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>20. The Chief of the Human Rights Council Branch underlined the recent positive 
developments in the Human Rights Council with regard to the participation of civil society 
and national human rights institutions, interaction with special procedures, joint and cross-
regional initiatives by States and the new modalities that the Human Rights Council had 
devised to address thematic and country situations in a timely manner. He noted that the 
Council had created several new mandates, assigned new tasks to OHCHR, and convened 
numerous panel discussions on topical areas. The impact of Council activities on the 
workload and resources of OHCHR was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>21. The Chief of the Universal Periodic Review Section referred to the opportunities for 
cooperation with the universal periodic review. He emphasized the mutually reinforcing 
nature of special procedures and the review mechanism, and its capacity to raise awareness </p>


<p>of special procedures mandates and create an environment for dialogue with States and 
other actors. Noting that 31 of the 90 standing invitations to special procedures were linked 
to the universal periodic review, he stated that the input of special procedures was essential 
at the various stages of the review process, including the compilation of information, 
follow-up with States on implementation of recommendations and assessment of 
implementation. The participants appreciated the opportunities of the universal periodic 
review, but expressed some reservations, including that the review might overshadow other 
human rights mechanisms and undermine special procedures recommendations. Ways to 
strengthen the participation of special procedures in the review process, for example, 
through the attendance of country-specific mandate holders at the sessions of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review where those countries were being reviewed or 
where a thematic mandate holder had conducted a recent visit to the State under review or 
through mandate holders highlighting important concerns to be reflected in the compilation 
report, were suggested. Participants also stressed that lessons learned from the first cycle 
should be compiled.  
</p>
<p>22. The President of the Human Rights Council pointed to the achievements of, and the 
challenges confronting, the Council. She indicated that the Council had taken measures to 
facilitate interaction with national human rights institutions, including by providing for 
participation by means of video messages, a practice that would be introduced for non-
governmental organizations. Cases of reprisal against human rights defenders following 
interaction with the Council, the special procedures and other human rights mechanisms 
had been reported. She and the Council Members had taken a strong stance against such 
actions. The participants praised the President for her response and agreed that more should 
be done to ensure that those cooperating with the United Nations in the field of human 
rights do not face intimidation and reprisals, including by further operationalizing the 
mandate of the Council and its mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>23. The President stated that human rights mainstreaming was an area where the Human 
Rights Council, with the help of special procedures, could be more proactive. She would 
propose that the high-level panel on mainstreaming to be convened at the twenty-second 
session of the Council focus on mainstreaming human rights in humanitarian contexts. 
Cooperating with other United Nations entities and United Nations country teams in 
thematic and country-related issues was considered essential. She also suggested that 
further measures should be taken to increase the visibility of special procedures on the 
ground. The President encouraged the special procedures to integrate technical cooperation 
aspects as they fulfilled their mandates, and observed that other United Nations entities 
could play a valuable role by supporting the implementation of special procedures 
recommendations. Follow-up to the recommendations made by special procedures and at 
the universal periodic review required strengthening; cooperation with regional 
mechanisms was a way to exchange information and ensure follow-up to special procedures 
recommendations. The President referred to the second cycle of the review and encouraged 
mandate holders to consider the calendar of scheduled reviews when planning country 
visits. 
</p>
<p>24. It was noted that interaction and coordination with inter-governmental bodies based 
at Headquarters, such as the General Assembly and the Security Council, could be 
improved, with participants highlighting recent examples of human rights issues being 
taken up by those bodies. As the third pillar of the United Nations, alongside peace and 
security, and development, human rights should be mainstreamed in these bodies. The 
prevention and early warning role of special procedures was discussed, as were ways to 
ensure that information on human rights concerns, particularly those on the ground, was 
available in a timely manner and duly considered. Special procedures should continue to 
address sensitive human rights issues in order to move debate forward on those areas. The </p>


<p>President underlined her desire to strengthen interaction with the Coordination Committee, 
her support for its role and willingness to defend the independence of mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>25. The participants expressed appreciation for the opportunities given to special 
procedures to engage with the Human Rights Council, for example, during special sessions 
and panel discussions, but pointed out that the quality of interactive dialogues could be 
improved perhaps by revisiting the practice of clustering the interactive dialogues of several 
special procedures, building on lessons learned in relation to the time management 
initiatives introduced in the context of universal periodic review and Council panel 
discussions. Mandate holders discussed ways of improving their interaction with the 
Council, such as through informal meetings with States and side events, where more time 
would be available for interaction. The joint initiatives of special procedures were useful to 
maximize impact, ensure coherence and increase awareness of human rights issues. It was 
noted that joint statements, including to the Council, joint reports and visits posed 
challenges, but were nonetheless valuable. The specificity of country mandates was 
highlighted, while cooperation between country and thematic mandates was considered to 
be a good way to ensure complementarity and mutual reinforcement among mandates.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Thematic issues and working methods 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights mainstreaming 
</b></p>
<p>26. The participants exchanged views with the United Nations Resident Coordinator in 
Malaysia, Kamal Malhotra, the Human Rights Policy Adviser of the United Nations 
Development Operations Coordination Office, United Nations Development Group, and 
representatives of the International Labour Organization, OHCHR, the United Nations 
Development Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme, the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF) and the World Health Organization, all members of the United Nations 
Development Group Human Rights Mainstreaming Mechanism.  
</p>
<p>27. It was pointed out that the United Nations Development Group Human Rights 
Mechanism was established in 2009 at the request of the Secretary-General in order to 
institutionalize the mainstreaming of human rights in the development work of the United 
Nations. Made up of 19 United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and chaired by 
OHCHR, with a rotating vice-chairperson (currently UNICEF), the Mechanism aims to 
strengthen the coordination of United Nations responses to requests from Member States 
for support in their efforts to fulfil international human rights commitments. Its objectives 
are to strengthen system-wide coherence and collaboration, and provide support for resident 
coordinators, regional Development Group teams, United Nations country teams and 
national partners to mainstream human rights. One priority in developing a coherent, 
system-wide approach to strengthening national human rights protection systems is to 
support the engagement of country teams with human rights mechanisms. Feedback from 
the country teams on their experience of working with special procedures highlights the 
contributions of mandate holders to support for the normative work of the United Nations, 
follow-up at the national level, public awareness-raising and strengthening of local civil 
society, while raising sensitive human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>28. It was noted that resident coordinators and United Nations country teams could 
engage with special procedures in all aspects of their mandates, including in the preparation 
and execution of, and follow-up to, country visits and work on thematic issues. In these 
contexts, the different mandates of special procedures and the country teams should be 
borne in mind. </p>


<p>29. The participants strongly agreed that there was a need to enhance human rights 
mainstreaming within the United Nations system, particularly through cooperation among 
special procedures, United Nations country teams and entities at Headquarters. Current 
cooperation was welcome; it was emphasized, however, that for cooperation to be 
successful, early consultation, coordination and exchange of information were essential. 
Country visits of special procedures were valuable opportunities to contribute to the 
promotion of human rights, raise awareness of human rights issues, strengthen advocacy 
and support civil society. Country teams played an important role in promoting follow-up 
to and implementation of the recommendations made by special procedures, with country 
visit reports being frequently used by the teams for programming and further discussion 
with States and civil society. Cooperation on thematic issues of common interest between 
special procedures and United Nations entities at Headquarters has also proved useful. 
United Nations agencies considered the joint statement on the United Nations Conference 
on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) by mandate holders to be a very positive 
contribution. Significant challenges remained, including the need to raise awareness of the 
role of special procedures in United Nations entities and include special procedures in the 
process of mainstreaming through appropriate use of their expertise. This could take the 
form of, inter alia, participation in seminars or webinars, devising indicators and evaluation 
methods, or suggesting concrete projects for technical cooperation. The engagement of 
United Nations country teams in human rights mainstreaming varied significantly, often 
owing to limited capacity and insufficient knowledge of the special procedures system. The 
importance of the leadership role played by resident coordinators in this context and the 
need to ensure that the country teams mainstream human rights were highlighted. With 
regard to country visits, it was essential to consider their timing, sequencing and 
preparation. The participants also referred to the importance of prioritizing the security of 
persons who met with special procedures and strengthening ways to protect them against 
reprisals.  
</p>
<p>30. United Nations country teams were urged to use the expertise of special procedures 
on thematic issues, including by exploring the possibility of organizing seminars on the 
special procedures system, if possible with mandate holders present in the country. 
Building on the positive experiences to date, special procedures and United Nations entities 
at Headquarters should strengthen their cooperation on thematic issues of common interest, 
thus benefiting from their comparative advantage. Updating and strengthening training and 
guidance tools for country teams with input from the special procedures in the process was 
recommended, as was improving information-sharing among special procedures, country 
teams and entities at Headquarters. The importance of taking real practical steps and 
ensuring knowledge management of experiences, including lessons learned and good 
practices, was underlined, as was the use of modern technology to build capacity.  
</p>
<p>31. The continued documentation of forms of cooperation among special procedures, 
United Nations country teams and entities at Headquarters was regarded as essential for 
drawing lessons and identifying good practices. Special procedures were considered to have 
important insights to contribute, and it was agreed that a note would be prepared at the 
session in consultation with the Coordination Committee and circulated to all resident 
coordinators. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Enhancing follow-up, coordination and information-sharing 
</b></p>
<p>32. The mandate holders discussed various modalities of follow-up on implementation 
of their recommendations; these included the circulation of questionnaires to States and 
other stakeholders, the provision of technical assistance and collaboration and follow-up 
reports based on follow-up visits, and the collection of updated information from the 
concerned State and others. Examples were provided of follow-up events organized by </p>


<p>human rights field presences to promote dissemination and bring together relevant 
stakeholders. Proposals aimed at creating more institutionalized and systematic follow-up 
included the establishment of a dedicated unit in the Special Procedures Branch to 
document follow-up efforts in order to create an institutional memory of best practices. It 
was observed that dialogue between States and mandate holders should be enhanced and 
that the preparation of follow-up reports was currently hampered by a lack of 
responsiveness from States. The point was made that follow-up was not the exclusive 
preserve of mandate holders and that national mechanisms for follow-up and assessment of 
the implementation rate of recommendations should be established. Non-governmental 
organizations, national human rights institutions and United Nations agencies were invited 
to contribute to such processes.  
</p>
<p>33. Noting that follow-up in the United Nations system was generally weak, mandate 
holders discussed the lack of time and resources in that area. It was noted that mandate 
holders could strengthen their cooperation with human rights treaty bodies and the 
universal periodic review, and build on each other&#8217;s recommendations, observations and 
conclusions. Better coordination across mechanisms would facilitate engagement with 
United Nations country teams and enhance their ability to follow up on recommendations. 
Several mandate holders referred to the importance of communications and the need to 
have a more systematic approach to this crucial area of work. Ways to make these a more 
powerful tool, including through follow-up, were also discussed. 
</p>
<p>34. The mandate holders were briefed on the outcome of a study on the protection 
impact of United Nations human rights field presences, <i>Influence on the Ground</i>,3 prepared 
over a two-year period, highlighting country-specific case studies and based on inputs from 
nearly 400 respondents, including State actors, human rights staff and civil society 
organizations. The study indicated that protection is best advanced through a multifaceted 
strategy, including monitoring through presence, advocacy, diplomacy and technical 
cooperation. Maintaining a dialogue with the State is crucial, as is the capacity-building of 
local civil society. The cooperation of human rights monitors with authorities has a 
significant dissuasive effect and prevents violations, particularly where the presence on the 
ground was considered credible and legitimate. Examples of strategic collaboration 
between special procedures and field presences were identified. The visits and 
communications of special procedures provide a &#8220;louder voice&#8221; when highlighting 
concerns, which is particularly valuable for smaller field presences. It is important for 
special procedures to visit rural areas and communities, engage with local civil society 
actors and thoroughly consider how mission reports may be of use for a variety of 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>35. The mandate holders welcomed the study and noted that the protection of witnesses 
and sources must always be a priority concern. The national staff members of United 
Nations human rights field presences may be at more risk than international staff. Some 
mandate holders observed that there was a need for capacity-building with regard to human 
rights mechanisms, including special procedures, among field staff. The mandate holders 
recognized the crucial role that field presences play in promoting follow-up, and that the 
special procedures and field presences had distinct independent roles. Maintaining this 
distinction and the independence of mandate holders was essential and would help to avoid 
politically delicate situations for United Nations personnel in the field. They also pointed to 
the complementary roles of OHCHR field presences, other parts of the United Nations on 
the ground and local civil society in addressing human rights issues.

<p>36. The attention of mandate holders was drawn to the tools to enhance information-
sharing, including the upgraded Universal Human Rights Index database; the annual 
calendar of the human rights mechanisms, developed jointly by the Human Rights Treaty 
Division, the Special Procedures Branch and the Human Rights Council Branch, integrating 
information on activities relating to special procedures, the Human Rights Council, the 
treaty bodies and the universal periodic review; and the special procedures extranet. The 
point was made that basic documents were sometimes not translated into all languages of 
the United Nations, and that rules limiting the word count of documents might compromise 
the work of mandate holders. Suggestions for improvement were made, in particular in 
relation to the OHCHR website, and the development of further tools was recommended. 
</p>
<p>37. Some mandate holders reiterated serious concerns raised on previous occasions 
about United Nations editorial policies and practices, especially with regard to reports 
submitted to the General Assembly, which sometimes resulted in substantive changes to 
reports, especially in sensitive areas, without consultation with the relevant mandate holder. 
The point was also made that mandate holders who worked in more than one official 
language of the United Nations should have the possibility of giving input into the language 
versions of their reports, as problems similar to those relating to editing had arisen. 
Strategies to address these issues were proposed. 
</p>
<p><b> VII.  Consultations with stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. States 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Chairperson noted that mandate holders continuously sought to strengthen 
cooperation and dialogue with States, and that maintaining a constructive dialogue 
enhanced the common goal of improving human rights protection at the national level. 
States welcomed the opportunity for interaction and expressed support for the work and 
independence of human rights mandate holders. Several States recalled that it was 
important for special procedures to be guided by independence, non-selectivity and 
impartiality, and that they carry out their mandate in accordance with the Code of Conduct. 
Other States pointed to the crucial role of special procedures. Several States raised the issue 
of the funding of special procedures, while some suggested that this support should be 
provided solely through the regular budget of the United Nations or unearmarked 
contributions to OHCHR. Transparency in this area was essential to avoid any perception 
of lack of independence.  
</p>
<p>39. Several States enquired whether standing invitations were honoured in practice and 
whether information was available on the number of requests addressed to countries that 
had issued standing invitations yet denied access. States also raised the need to increase 
coordination among mandate holders prior to making visit requests. Several mandate 
holders pointed out that their requests for a visit frequently remain unanswered, and that 
this compromised their ability to coordinate and plan work, and use their limited resources 
effectively. It was also observed that, in recent instances, acceptance by the State of a visit 
had sometimes been received very late, which created significant obstacles to the conduct 
of the mission. 
</p>
<p>40. Several States expressed appreciation for the visits made by special procedures that 
they had recently hosted. Questions were raised about the consistency of working methods 
and methodology in the area of follow-up. The mandate holders pointed out that they 
wished to strengthen modalities to sustain follow-up after visits, and also raised the 
importance of internal coordination across Government entities, given that the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs does not always adequately involve other relevant ministries and </p>


<p>departments. States raised questions about the utility of questionnaires. The mandate 
holders responded that questionnaires gave them important information on follow-up, and 
encouraged States to respond in order to ensure that global perspectives are given on 
thematic studies. States encouraged mandate holders to assist in the identification of best 
practices in order to assist in the development of legislation in specific thematic areas, such 
as freedom of expression. Some States asked about the criteria used to decide whether a 
communication would be sent and the verification process. In response, the mandate 
holders indicated that they seek to verify through other sources. They also called on States 
to be more responsive to communications, as currently only 35 per cent received responses, 
with many of these being limited to narrow legal issues. It was noted that, in some cases, 
communications concerned life and death situations, the resolution of which depended on 
the reaction of the State. 
</p>
<p>41. Several States noted the recently enhanced cooperation with the African human 
rights system as a positive development. A representative of the Council of Europe 
expressed keen interest in strengthening regional collaboration, indicating that coordination 
and information-sharing between special procedures and the human rights mechanisms of 
the Council, notably the Commissioner for Human Rights, would be beneficial for the 
planning and conduct of country visits in Europe, as well as normative thematic work, for 
example with regard to business and human rights and the rights of elderly. 
</p>
<p>42. The mandate holders underlined the obligation of States to protect sources and 
witnesses who had interacted with them against reprisal and intimidation. Instances where 
States had sought access to confidential information about the identity of persons who had 
met with mandate holders during country visits were noted. While the mandate holders 
welcomed the political support of States, reflected in the increase of mandates, they also 
called on States to ensure that additional financial resources were made available to provide 
adequate support for the special procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>43. The exchange of views between the special procedures mandate holders and 
representatives of the special procedures of the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights provided an overview of the progress made in the implementation of the 
road map agreed upon at the dialogue held between the special procedures of the Human 
Rights Council and those of the African Commission on 17 and 18 January 2012 in Addis 
Ababa. The representatives the joint working group established to advance and monitor the 
implementation of the Addis Ababa road map briefed the meeting on its highlights and 
provided information on the action taken after the dialogue between the two mechanisms, 
including the appointment of focal points within the respective secretariats and an increase 
in regular exchanges of information, such as notes forecasting the relevant activities of both 
systems; regular mailing of the special procedures bulletin to the African Commission; 
participation in each other&#8217;s sessions or annual meetings; the preparation of a comparative 
</p>
<p>note between the two special procedures systems; reciprocal follow-up to the 
recommendations of each mechanism; and peer-to-peer learning.  
</p>
<p>44. The mandate holders from both systems stressed the importance and relevance of the 
road map, which provides a structured framework for further cooperation, and expressed 
strong support for it, particularly as they considered that, by acting together, their impact 
was stronger. They highlighted past instances of successful cooperation, in particular the 
joint visit of the special rapporteurs on the situation of human rights defenders to Togo in 
2007; the joint statements of the special rapporteurs on freedom of expression; and the 
common activities of the mandates on torture and on internally displaced persons. Some </p>


<p>mandate holders highlighted the fact that the road map had triggered discussions on a 
number of initiatives, including the arrangement of seminars on issues of common interest.  
</p>
<p>45. Reference was made to the importance of recognizing the complementarity of the 
two systems. The need to systematically follow up on recommendations made by the 
special procedures of each system was emphasized. The special procedures of the African 
Commission underlined the value they could add to the work of the special procedures of 
the Human Rights Council, especially in terms of local knowledge and expertise. The 
information from the African Commission was considered to be vital for the universal 
periodic review, and the recommendations made by special procedures of the United 
Nations could be sent to the Commission for promotion and inclusion in discussions of the 
periodic reports submitted by States. The need to enhance cooperation in communications 
was also discussed, although the details and modalities for this would require further 
discussion, particularly as the time frame for the public disclosure of communications in the 
African system was shorter than that of the special procedures of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>46. Noting the significant progress that had already been made in the implementation of 
the road map, the mandate holders highlighted the importance of strengthening cooperation 
on thematic areas of common interest, including forced disappearances, arbitrary detention, 
education, indigenous peoples, internally displaced persons, slavery, summary executions, 
discrimination against women, children&#8217;s rights, and trafficking in persons. It was noted 
that the African Commission would celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary at its fifty-second 
session, and that this was an opportunity for further collaboration between United Nations 
and African special procedures. Relevant country mandate holders also expressed interest 
in exploring further ways of cooperation with the African Commission within the 
framework of the road map. The mandate holders of the African Commission noted the 
need for further support for its secretariat in order for the partnership to be maintained. 
</p>
<p>47. The mandate holders agreed to continue to exchange information and thanked the 
secretariats for the documents provided, including the forecast of activities of both systems. 
They decided to continue to work towards the identification of joint activities to be 
undertaken and resolved to review the road map at the next dialogue between mandate 
holders of the Human Rights Council and the African Commission, to be held in 2013, 
subject to the availability of resources. Encouraged by the progress made in implementation 
of the road map, the mandate holders expressed an interest in the development of modalities 
to strengthen their collaboration with other regional human rights systems. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Civil society and non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>48. Opening the exchange of views with civil society organizations and non-
governmental organizations, the Chairperson raised the question of how special procedures 
could strengthen cooperation and communication with civil society organizations. The 
Chairperson noted that threats and acts of reprisal against civil society organizations that 
cooperate with mandate holders or other parts of the United Nations system were serious 
concerns.  
</p>
<p>49. The representatives of civil society organizations expressed their appreciation for the 
work of the mandate holders and encouraged them to dedicate more time to meeting with 
civil society, suggesting that they should meet earlier during the annual meeting in the 
future. They suggested that enhanced cooperation by States was required, as low response 
rates to communications and negative responses by States to requests for visits, including 
those that had issued standing invitations, were matters of concern. They encouraged the 
mandate holders to include information on cooperation with States in their annual reports. 
To address lack of cooperation by States, the mandate holders could send joint reminders, 
issue press releases or made direct reference to this at Council sessions. Civil society </p>


<p>organizations suggested a &#8220;cooperation audit&#8221; to assess the cooperation that special 
procedures enjoyed with States, stressing that a standing invitation was not the end goal and 
that, in fact, many standing invitations have no practical effect.  
</p>
<p>50. The consolidated communications reports presented to the Human Rights Council at 
each session were commended, because they improved transparency and access to 
information. The special procedures were urged to organize the report by State rather than 
chronologically in order to make it more user-friendly. Civil society organizations also 
urged the mandate holders to maintain the practice of formulating observations on 
communications, preferably including these in the communications report itself. They 
expressed concern at the lack of information provided on action taken in response to their 
submissions and noted that sources often do not receive a confirmation of receipt.. Civil 
society representatives also regretted the fact that urgent appeals sent by non-governmental 
organizations were not always treated with urgency. The mandate holders noted that they 
receive a large number of requests for individual action, but did not have the capacity to 
follow up on all of them. They supported certain suggestions, such as developing modalities 
to acknowledge receipt of communications and organizing the communications report by 
country. The mandate holders pointed out that they had been able to follow up on their 
communications and country visits through non-governmental organizations, and that their 
collaboration with regional organizations was also facilitated by civil society. 
</p>
<p>51. The organizations expressed gratitude for the commitment of mandate holders to 
confront cases of reprisal, and encouraged them to speak up, in consultation with the 
victims and families of victims. It was suggested that the Manual of Operations of the 
Special Procedures be revised to include a section on reprisals, while mandate holders 
stated that mechanisms for protection against reprisal were crucial as reprisal should be 
dealt with more systematically by the Human Rights Council, which should react 
automatically and immediately in this context. The contribution of the special procedures to 
highlighting specific and sensitive human rights issues, including sexual orientation and 
gender identity, was acknowledged. The organizations drew attention to the upcoming 
high-level debate on the rule of law to be convened by the General Assembly in the latter 
half of 2012, and encouraged the mandate holders to make collective and individual 
contributions to it. The Chairperson indicated that mandate holders would prepare a joint 
statement in the lead-up to the high-level debate. 
</p>
<p>52. Mandate holders made clear that non-governmental organizations had an important 
role to play in providing ideas on the focus of thematic reports, and asked for suggestions to 
give their reports more visibility. The mandate holders also requested feedback on the 
implementation of their recommendations at the country level. The civil society 
organizations encouraged the special procedures to be more present in the context of the 
universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p>53. The mandate holders expressed their appreciation to civil society organizations for 
their work. The Chairperson suggested the establishment of a coordination mechanism, 
comprising three members of the Coordination Committee and three representatives of civil 
society organizations, which would meet throughout the year, with its first meeting being 
convened on the margins of the twentieth session of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> D. National human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>54. The mandate holders engaged in dialogue with Chairperson of the Scottish Human 
Rights Commission and of the European Group of National Human Rights Institutions, 
Allan Miller, the Chairperson of the South African Commission and the Network of 
African National Human Rights Institutions, Lawrence Mushwana, and Katherina Rose of 
the International Secretariat of the International Coordinating Committee of National </p>


<p>Human Rights Institutions. Representatives of national human rights institutions pointed 
out that their organizations play a bridging role between State actors and non-governmental 
organizations, and between the international community and the situation on the ground. 
The special procedures and national human rights institutions were considered to be natural, 
complementary partners, because the constant presence of the latter allowed for support 
before, during and after the visits of special procedures, and with regard to communications 
and follow-up. Practical steps could be taken to strengthen cooperation between mandate 
holders and national human rights institutions. Within the International Coordinating 
Committee, the process of accreditation of national human rights institutions had been 
strengthened, with the accreditation status of institutions now being subject to review every 
four years. The views of non-governmental organizations were taken into account in the 
accreditation process, and special procedures could also play a valuable role in 
strengthening the independence of such institutions.  
</p>
<p>55. It was suggested that the Manual of Special Procedures should be improved by 
adding guidance on working with national human rights institutions; that future induction 
sessions for new mandate holders include additional information on interaction with such 
institutions; and a document on best practices in cooperation between national human rights 
institutions and special procedures be compiled.  
</p>
<p>56. The mandate holders stated that, during their country visits, they systematically meet 
with national human rights institutions, but their experience was mixed, particularly since 
the institutions enjoyed varying degrees of independence, regardless of their accreditation 
level. The representatives of national human rights institutions noted that universal periodic 
degree recommendations routinely called on States to establish category A institutions. The 
representative of the International Coordinating Committee noted that the human rights of 
women and trafficking had an increasingly high profile in the work of the committee, which 
now had access to the Commission on the Status of Women, and that the level at which 
gender was integrated into the work of a national human rights institution was also taken 
into account in the accreditation process. 
</p>
<p>57. The mandate holders requested information on how their priority issues could be 
included in the agenda of the annual meeting of the International Coordinating Committee. 
The role of national human rights institutions with regard to communications was also 
raised, and it was suggested that a methodology, including templates, could be developed, 
especially in follow-up. The mandate holders and representatives of national human rights 
institutions agreed to follow up on the issues raised during their interaction in greater depth.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> The mandate holders expressed their appreciation to the Special Procedures 
Branch of OHCHR for organizing the nineteenth annual meeting and for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>documents provided. They suggested that the twentieth annual meeting could 
</b></p>
<p><b>concentrate on working methods, including development of a more systematic 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach to communications, and follow-up methodologies. The coordination of 
</b></p>
<p><b>country visits, the development of outreach tools to strengthen the visibility of 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate holders, and policy issues with regard to sources of support for mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>holders were also considered areas warranting in-depth discussion. </b></p>
