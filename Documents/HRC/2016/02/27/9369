</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and 
impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination was established in 2005, 
pursuant to resolution 2005/2 of the Commission on Human Rights and assumed by the 
Human Rights Council, which replaced the previous mandate of the Special Rapporteur 
established in 1987. 
</p>
<p>2. In 2007, the Working Group was composed of the following experts: Ms. Najat Al-Hajjaji 
(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Ms. Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez (Colombia), Mr. Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez 
del Prado (Spain), Mr. Alexander Nikitin (Russian Federation) and Ms. Shaista Shameem (Fiji). 
Mr. Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado was elected Chairperson-Rapporteur in February 2007, a 
position that rotates on an annual basis. 
</p>
<p>3. For the purpose of this report, and while recognizing the definitional challenges, the 
Working Group refers to private military and private security companies (PMSCs) as including 
private companies which perform all types of security assistance, training, provision and 
consulting services, i.e. ranging from unarmed logistical support, armed security guards, and 
those involved in defensive or offensive military and/or security-related activities, particularly in 
armed conflict areas and/or post-conflict situations. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES OF THE WORKING GROUP 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Second session of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Working Group on the use of mercenaries held its second session at the 
United Nations Office at Geneva from 19 to 23 February 2007. It elected Mr. Jos&#233; Luis Gomez 
del Prado as its Chairperson-Rapporteur for the coming year. During the session, the Working 
Group held consultations with Member States, United Nations agencies and organs, including 
different divisions and branches of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), regional and other intergovernmental organizations, 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and an association of PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>5. A representative of ICRC continued dialogue with the Working Group on approaches of 
international humanitarian law, including the definition of mercenaries and the responsibilities of 
States with respect to PMSCs and their employees. The ICRC representative noted that few 
PMSC employees are regular combatants and members of armed forces, and they are thus 
civilians and lose protection under international humanitarian law when taking direct part in 
hostilities. 
</p>
<p>6. A consultation was held with ILO, and its representative informed the Working Group of 
relevant ILO legal instruments and mechanisms which could be useful to consider when 
identifying principles relating to PMSCs, including ILO Convention No. 181 on Private 
Employment Agencies and its accompanying recommendation No. 188. </p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p>7. Among consultations with a number of other institutions and NGOs, the Working Group 
held a dialogue with researchers from the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed 
Forces (DCAF), and was informed about regulatory efforts of outsourcing military functions and 
comparative research on experiences in the United States of America and South Africa, and its 
effects on situations such as in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Business and Human Rights Resource 
Centre (BHRRC) presented information regarding PMSCs and impact of their activities on 
human rights, and has created a thematic section on this issue on the BHRRC website.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group held a consultation with the International Peace Operations 
Association (IPOA), a trade association representing some 30 PMSCs. The representative noted 
the self-regulatory sets of voluntary codes of conduct developed within the industry, which in 
general would support also further regulation to bring certainty and protection to serious firms. 
The Working Group emphasized the need for licensing, regulating and monitoring of PMSCs at 
the national level and for PMSCs to operate in a legal framework consistent with human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>9. The Working Group considered a number of country situations. Following its 
deliberations, the Working Group decided to send letters of request, or renewed requests, to 
visit Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Ghana, Iraq, 
Papua New Guinea, South Africa, United States of America and Zimbabwe. As to regulatory 
initiatives and in order to address newer forms of mercenarism and activities of PMSCs, the 
Working Group agreed in the short term to foster the ratification/accession of Member States to 
the existing International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries and in the longer-term, to seek support for a process towards an additional protocol 
to the Convention. On 23 February 2007, the Working Group issued a press release upon 
concluding its second session.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Field missions 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Working Group visited Peru, Fiji and Chile during 2007, and expresses its 
appreciation for these invitations. While the comprehensive reports of the missions are reflected 
in the addendums to this annual report, this section provides an overview of the main findings. 
</p>
<p>11. A delegation of the Working Group, composed of the Chairperson-Rapporteur and one 
member, visited Peru from 29 January to 2 February 2007.<b>3</b> The Working Group recommended,

<b>3
</b>  This report will be issued as an addendum to the present one. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>inter alia, that in the process of bringing Peru&#8217;s legislation into line with the International 
Convention, Peru adopt the broadest possible interpretation in order to typify at the domestic 
level not only the traditional offence of acting as a mercenary but also mercenary-related 
activities, taking into account the emergent trends of the activities of private military and security 
companies operating domestically and/or abroad. 
</p>
<p>12. A delegation of the Working Group, composed of the Chairperson-Rapporteur and one 
member, visited Fiji from 14 to 18 May 2007.<b>4</b> The Working Group recommended, inter alia, the 
accession of Fiji to the International Convention and the development of accompanying national 
legislation, the establishment of a system of regulation, licensing, control and monitoring of 
private military and security companies in order to provide effective oversight, and the adoption 
of measures to address issues of reintegration and post-traumatic stress disorders for individuals 
returning from security work abroad. 
</p>
<p>13. A delegation of the Working Group, composed of the Chairperson-Rapporteur and one 
member, visited Chile from 9 to 13 July 2007.<b>5</b> The Working Group recommended, inter alia, the 
penalization and legislation at the national level with a view to adopting the broadest possible 
criteria of the offence of mercenarism, the swift conclusions of the investigations in the military 
courts and urgent measures be taken to safeguard the rights of Chilean nationals still working in 
Iraq. 
</p>
<p>14. The Working Group intends to undertake visits to a variety of countries relevant to 
different aspects of its mandate, including States that hire PMSCs, States on whose territory 
PMSCs operate, and States where PMSCs are incorporated and registered, in terms of 
recruitment, use, financing and training of employees and employers of PMSCs and their 
subsidiaries and corporate structures. It reiterates its appreciation to the Member States which 
have invited it and contributed, thus, to enabling the fulfilment of its mandate. It welcomes 
indications from other States of forthcoming invitations, and renews its appeal for invitations 
from Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Iraq, 
Papua New Guinea, South Africa, United States of America and Zimbabwe.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Communications 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Working Group has increasingly received information from Governments, NGOs and 
individuals concerning situations involving mercenaries, mercenary-related activities and private 
military and security companies. During the year under review, communications have been
</p>
<p>

</b>  Idem. 
</p>
<p><b>5

</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  By letter of 19 April 2007, the Government of Iraq stated that &#8220;the security situation in Iraq 
</p>
<p>would not allow the working group to do their work in an effective manner&#8221;. </p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p>sent to Australia, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Iraq, Peru, and the United States of America. 
These communications and summaries of responses received from Governments are reflected in 
an addendum to the present report. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Chairperson-Rapporteur presented the Working Group&#8217;s annual report to the 
Human Rights Council on 21 March 2007 (A/HRC/4/42 and Add.1 and 2) and the Working 
Group&#8217;s annual report to the General Assembly on 8 November 2007 (A/62/302). In 
presenting the report to the General Assembly, the Chairperson-Rapporteur reiterated the 
significance of the increasing phenomenon of outsourcing by States of core military and security 
functions to private companies, and expressed the concern that some PMSCs were committing 
human rights violations with de facto impunity whilst operating in armed conflicts. The 
Chairperson-Rapporteur stated that such situations are often associated with the creation by 
transnational companies of satellite subsidiaries with legal personality in one country, providing 
services in another and recruiting personnel from third countries. 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group sent a questionnaire to all Member States in April 2007. A survey of 
the responses received was included in the 2007 report of the Working Group to the 
General Assembly. Since this survey, the Working Group has received further responses and it 
invites submissions from remaining Governments with a view to providing a comprehensive and 
comparative analysis in a forthcoming annual report of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>18. As part of its consultations with regional and other intergovernmental organizations, and to 
study also regional standards and developments, the Working Group sent, in May 2007, a 
questionnaire concerning its mandate and activities. A summary of responses received was 
included in the 2007 report of the Working Group to the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>19. In the course of 2007, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group has consulted 
with delegates of over 40 Permanent Missions to the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p>20. The Chairperson-Rapporteur and one member of the Working Group participated in 
the 14th annual meeting of mandate-holders in Geneva from 18 to 22 June 2007. During this 
visit, the Chairperson-Rapporteur held other consultations, which included participation in a 
meeting hosted on 19 June 2007 by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>21. Furthermore, the Chairperson-Rapporteur and members undertook activities including 
consultations with stakeholders and participation in workshops and university lectures in their 
respective regions. The Chairperson-Rapporteur and Ms. Benavides de P&#233;rez participated in the 
following activities: 
</p>
<p>

the Advancement of International Human Rights Law on 12 September 2007 at the 
United Nations Office in Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b>III. THEMATIC ISSUES:  THE STATE AS PRINCIPAL 
HOLDER OF THE USE OF FORCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Privatization of warfare and security 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Working Group observes that in the last 20 years there has been, primarily in 
Western European and North American countries and particularly in the United States and the 
United Kingdom, a significant increase in private military and security companies which provide 
its services in zones of low-intensity armed conflict and post-conflict situation such as 
Afghanistan, the Balkans, Iraq, Colombia, Somalia and the Sudan. Parallel to this privatization 
of warfare at the international level, there has also been increased demand for private security 
and protection of property at the domestic level all over the world.<b>10</b>

Security Governance</i>, A. Bryden, M. Caparini (eds.), DCAF, 2006. </p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p>24. The globalization of the world economy and the shifting from centralized government to 
diffused &#8220;governance&#8221;<b>11</b> or &#8220;ungovernance&#8221;,<b>12</b> together with the downsizing of regular armed 
forces of States, which have had important reductions in the public sector both in developed and 
developing countries<b>13</b> are some of the causes behind the rapid development of the privatization 
of violence. In many of today&#8217;s &#8220;failed states&#8221;, the globalization of the economy, together with 
the bottom-up privatization of violence, in which non-State actors such as paramilitaries and 
warlords control natural resources, has had destructive effects because of the attempts by foreign 
actors to link their wealth (oil, gas, diamonds, timber and precious metals) to the world market 
and to control their national economy.<b>14</b> Classical inter-State wars with clear front lines have 
almost disappeared. Instead, we witness low-intensity armed conflicts; a widespread use of light 
weapons; and the privatization of military functions and asymmetry of the parties in the 
conflict.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>25. The outsourcing of a number of basic functions which traditionally were carried out by 
national armies or police forces, known as the top-down privatization, has blurred the borderlines 
between the public services of the State and the private commercial sector creating a dangerous 
&#8220;grey zone&#8221;. In zones of armed conflict the employees of transnational private military and 
security companies, contracted as civilians but armed as military personnel, operate in these 
&#8220;grey zones&#8221; with uncertainties as to whether their status is that of a combatant or of a civilian. 
As has been synthesized by one analyst, the development of private military and security 
companies has produced a new type of security guards and private soldiers who operate in war 
zones and high-risk insecurity areas under murky legal restraints.<b>16</b> These new modalities have 
replaced to a certain extent the use of traditional individual mercenaries. 
</p>
<p>26. Private military and security companies fill the vacuum mainly left in three types of 
unstable situations: (i) in zones of low-intensity armed conflict (the new asymmetrical wars) 
where the armies are not fully deployed or in post-conflict situations with a high level of 
insecurity; (ii) in armed conflicts when international organizations do not intervene; and (iii) in 
troubled areas in developing countries where there is no presence of the State and extractive

 <p> 
</p>
<p>transnational corporations operate.<b>17</b> An emerging trend in Latin America but also in other 
regions of the world indicates situations of private security companies protecting transnational 
extractive corporations whose employees are often involved in suppressing the legitimate social 
protest of communities and human rights and environmental organizations of the areas where 
these corporations operate. Furthermore, in exchange for providing security services to some 
African Governments, PMSCs have in some cases received concessions for the exploitation of 
natural resources.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>27. PMSCs are at present rarely held accountable by effective oversight mechanisms at 
parliamentary levels, whether in the States that contracts them or in the countries where they 
operate. It also appears that PMSCs determine and influence the demand for security services. 
As regards their involvement in institution-building in post-conflict situations their services raise 
questions regarding sustainability and their actual contribution in ending low-intensity conflicts. 
Outsourcing military and security functions has an inherent danger in ensuring State control over 
the use of force.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>28. The distinction between humanitarian non-profitable organizations and corporations 
working for pecuniary gain<b>20</b> is also being blurred by PMSCs. In conflict or post-conflict areas, 
such as Afghanistan and Iraq, where PMSCs sometimes provide security details and protection 
work to humanitarian NGOs, it has become difficult for the population as well as government 
officials to distinguish one from another. Humanitarian and aid-type assistance risk becoming 
associated with an intervening force and PMSCs which may be perceived as biased. PMSCs 
do not hesitate to utilize the aims of humanitarian non-profit organizations to advertise their 
activities. One of such companies recurrently puts an ad in the <i>Journal of International Peace 
Operations</i> (IPOA)<b>21</b> in relation with its activities in Afghanistan, Somalia, Congo, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, the Sudan and Iraq displaying a picture of an individual feeding a malnourished 
baby with the following message &#8220;<i>Through selfless commitment and compassion for all people, 
</i></p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  In the privatization of warfare and the utilization of private security companies to protect 
</p>
<p>multinational extractive corporations one can find elements of bygone historical periods, 
the use of force by non-State actors. J.E. Thompson,<i> Mercenaries, Pirates and Sovereigns: 
State-building and Extraterritorial Violence in Early Modern Europe</i>, Princeton University 
Press, 1994. In such situations, multinational corporations contract private security companies 
whose employees are often found involved in social conflicts with the local populations.

questions regarding the way they operate in these various situations as well as to the need for 
regulatory mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The PMSC industry 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Working Group notes that the PMSC industry currently provides in the international 
market a broad spectrum of services such as building and site security, convoy and transport 
security, close individual security, advisory and training of local forces, air support, logistical 
support, prison security, propaganda tactics, intelligence, covert operations and surveillance. 
These tasks were traditionally fulfilled by the national armed forces and the police.<b> </b>PMSCs<b> </b>also 
provide armed protection for transnational corporations in unstable regions.<b> </b>Their services are 
used by Governments and NGOs, transnational corporations, humanitarian organizations, the

<p>30. The PMSC industry is transnational in nature and is growing very rapidly, particularly 
since the recent conflict situations in Afghanistan and Iraq, with an aggregated estimate of 
contracts between US$ 20 billion and US$ 100 billion annually. Although the industry has 
developed worldwide, highly professional companies from the United States of America and the 
United Kingdom would be responsible for more than 70 per cent of the services in the world 
market.<b>22</b> Some PMSCs are listed on stock markets and generate profits for their investors. Most 
of these corporations engage in their executive board structures former military personnel of high 
rank, or senior officers of the civil or the intelligence services, a phenomenon many scholars 
describe as the &#8220;revolving door syndrome&#8221;.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>31. In Iraq, the number of &#8220;private contractors&#8221; fulfilling a number of military and 
quasi-military tasks varies according to different sources and the manner they are counted, 
ranging between 20,000 and 100,000 persons working for PMSCs. Most estimates agree to a 
figure between 20,000<b>24</b> and nearly 50,000 foreign armed &#8220;private contractors&#8221;.<b>25</b> According to 
the Private Security Company Association of Iraq there would be some 70,000 persons providing 
armed protection, out of which 14,000 would be unregistered Iraqis and 20,000 unregistered 
foreigners.<b>26</b> Other semi-official estimates give the following figures: 3,000 to 5,000

Bulgaria, Colombia, Chile, El Salvador, Fiji, Honduras, Nepal, Peru, the Philippines, Romania, 
Russian Federation, Ukraine and others, as well as 25,000 to 30,000 Iraqi host-country 
nationals.<b>27</b> According to a United States Government Accountability Office report there would 
be more than 100,000 contractors of which 48,000 working as private soldiers. The &#8220;human 
insecurity&#8221; in Iraq presents a threat to the international security.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>32. The Working Group has received reliable information indicating the existence in 
Afghanistan of some 2,000 to 3,000 Afghans fulfilling military functions in assistance of 
United States military forces pursuit of terrorists since 2001.<b>29</b> In addition, the Working 
Group received estimations of some 4,000 to 6,000 expatriates from the United States of 
America, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, some 1,500 to 
2,000 third country nationals from Nepal, Fiji, Singapore, the Philippines and Nigeria, and 
some 15,000 to 20,000 Afghan nationals performing private security functions in Afghanistan.<b>30</b> PMSCs in Afghanistan are using the three hierarchical model, as in Iraq. PMSCs in Afghanistan 
might have played a significant role in alienating the population against &#8220;foreigners&#8221;.<b>31</b> There 
appears to remain developments towards a national regulation of the industry in Afghanistan, 
while in the meanwhile there is limited information available to the national authorities or 
coalition forces concerning the figures of PMSCs, their employees, office locations and areas of 
operations, weapons, ammunitions and vehicles. 
</p>
<p>33. A number of the contracts for Afghanistan and Iraq outsourced by United States 
government departments to PMSCs are in their turn subcontracted to other companies registered 
in the United States or abroad. Many of them are private employment agencies (and some of 
them &#8220;ghost&#8221; companies, which may have never been legally registered) entrusted with the

<p>selection of former military and police personnel from third countries. The same pattern of 
employing third-country nationals has also been used by the Government of the United States 
and a PMSC, Dyncorp, to implement the &#8220;Plan Colombia&#8221; in a manner which has allegedly in 
effect bypassed limitations imposed by the United States Congress.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>34. One of the major PMSCs providing military and security services in armed conflicts or 
post-conflict zones is Blackwater, a PMSC based in the United States. It is estimated to have 
some 2,300 private soldiers in nine countries and a database of more than 20,000 former military 
personnel ready for deployment and engagement on a short notice anywhere in the world. Its 
division in the Barbados, Blackwater&#8217;s Greystone Ltd., employs third-country nationals from 
countries such as Chile, Nepal, El Salvador, Honduras and others at salaries which are lower 
than those recruited in the United States.<b>33</b> Behind the humanitarian fa&#231;ade, one of the main 
objectives of the corporation, as indicated by its founder, Erik Prince, would be to obtain for his 
own private military force a substantial piece of the current United Nations peacekeeping 
US$ 6-10 billion budget.<b>34</b> Blackwater has been involved since the very first days of the 
occupation in Iraq and its convoys have been ambushed, its helicopters brought down, and it had 
30 casualties including in a high-profile incident in Fallujah.<b>35</b> In August 2006, the Federal Court 
of Appeals of North Carolina decided that it was competent in the lawsuit brought by the 
families of the four &#8220;guards&#8221; against Blackwater for not having provided them with adequate 
protection.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group has been informed that major PMSCs based in the United States and 
operating in Afghanistan and Iraq include Blackwater, DynCorp, MPRI, Ronco, Triple Canopy 
and Vinell Corporation. Among the main British-based PMSCs are Aegis Defence Services, 
which obtained a contract from the United States Government to coordinate the other security 
companies operating in Iraq; ArmorGroup, Control Risks Group, Enrinys, Global Risk Group,

<p>Ronin Concepts and Saladin.<b>37</b> There would also be companies from South Africa, Israel, the 
Balkans, the European Union, Canada,<b>38</b> Eastern Europe and Switzerland<b>39</b> which would operate 
in zones of armed conflict or troubled areas. 
</p>
<p>36. A number of these PMSCs are members of the International Peace Organization 
Association (IPOA), a non-profit trade association which promotes the activities and image of its 
member firms. The British Association of Private Security Companies (BAPSC), was launched 
to promote the interests and regulate the activities of United Kingdom firms that provide armed 
defensive security services in countries outside the United Kingdom.<b>40</b> According to its 
chairperson,<b>41</b> the services the 23 members of the Association provide to Iraq are probably the 
largest export of the United Kingdom to that country. 
</p>
<p>37. Self-regulation is promoted by both IPOA and BAPSC, which have both adopted a 
voluntary code of conduct integrating some human rights and international humanitarian norms. 
However, the Working Group considers that there are obvious limitations of self-regulatory 
initiatives and accountability merely to stockholders, if these measures are to the exclusion of 
external oversight and enforcement mechanisms to monitor the activities of those companies or 
that of their employees. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Recruitment, working conditions and compensation of 
&#8220;private security guards&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Working Group is concerned that private contractors perform military and 
quasi-military tasks in situations of conflict. PMSC employees often find themselves working in 
a situation of armed conflict where they are constantly exposed to &#8220;great risk and immediate 
danger&#8221; in a &#8220;hostile environment&#8221; including but not limited to &#8220;the threats inherent in a war 
situation&#8221;.<b>42</b> Recruited by PMSC these individuals often operate in a grey area with limited 
oversight or army control. Most of them are neither nationals of one of the parties to the conflict 
nor residents of the country in conflict. Although they were not specifically recruited to take part 
in hostilities, their contracts did not specify either that they would receive military training and

</p>
<p>would be militarily armed. Recruited in their respective countries from all over the world as 
&#8220;private security guards&#8221; to provide protection, most of them have in fact taken part in an 
internal low-intensity armed conflict. These third-countries nationals are not members of the 
armed forces of a party to the conflict and they have not been officially sent by their respective 
States.<b>43</b> Many individuals interviewed by the Working Group on its missions have been 
essentially motivated by private gain. These are all characteristics of the mercenary-related 
activities and modalities of the conflicts of the twenty-first century. 
</p>
<p>39. The Working Group has received information about deceptive recruitment and exploitation 
of nationals from developing countries to work for these PMSC in situations of violence and 
armed conflict such as Iraq. The Working Group is increasingly concerned at the effects of such 
exploitation and the resulting challenges in terms of compensation and jurisdictional 
uncertainties. When contractors sign their contracts they commonly waive a number of rights, 
including their right to seek legal recourse against the subsidiary company which has selected 
and contracted them, or the company which employs them &#8220;including even where loss, damage, 
personal injury or death is caused or contributed to any manner by the company&#8221;.<b>44</b> There is also 
the example of thousands of Fijians who were lured into paying fees for prospective security 
work abroad which did not materialize. 
</p>
<p>40. In other instances, the contracts were signed under fraudulent conditions in order to avoid 
domestic jurisdictions, either immediately upon departure or upon arrival in the country of 
destination. Once performing security work in Iraq, many Chileans, Fijians, Hondurans and 
Peruvians have experienced contractual irregularities and poor working conditions, including 
excessive working hours, partial or full non-payment of salaries, ill-treatment and the neglect of 
basic needs such as access to medical services.<b>45</b> In some instances, the insurance policies were 
faked or could only be enforced in the United States. There have also been reports of insurance 
brokers only paying immediately 30 per cent of the claims, and the rest not until an 
administrative tribunal compels them. In other cases where the guards had been injured they

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>43
</b>  This could exclude United States, British and Iraqi employees of PMSCs but not the Chileans, 
</p>
<p>Colombians, Fijians, Filipinos, Hondurans, Nepali, Peruvians and others.  
<b>44
</b></p>
<p>  The Working Group has observed similar or related clauses in employment contracts for 
Chileans by the company Neskovin, registered in Uruguay and recruiting for the company 
Blackwater in the United States of America, and Global Guards, registered in Panama and 
recruiting for the company Triple Canopy in the United States. Similar practices have involved 
contracts for Peruvians by the company Defion, recruiting for Triple Canopy, and Hondurans 
contracted by the company Your Solutions also recruiting for Triple Canopy. 
<b>45
</b></p>
<p>  Most contractors do not provide health care for their employees, and care is not authorized at 
military facilities except when life is at stake. However, some routine health care has been 
provided to private contractors. W. Pincus, &#8220;Army Examines Possibility of Private Medical 
Contractor&#8221;, <i>Washington Post</i>, 3 September 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>were pressured to continue to fulfil their work duties even with the help of crutches. If injured or 
killed, the claims presented by these private security guards or their families are often denied, or 
they find difficulties to obtain health care or compensation. A number of Peruvians injured in 
Iraq, for example, are still waiting for the compensation they had been promised.<b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>41. In Iraq, PMSCs appears to have filled a gap,<b>47</b> particularly because of the reluctance of 
contributing sufficient regular troops, and because engaging &#8220;private guards&#8221; has less political 
consequences and offer States considerable political distance.<b>48</b> This army of private security 
guards constitutes the second largest force in Iraq after that of the United States Army. In order 
to maximize profit PMSC and their affiliates have stimulated the demand of former military 
personnel and ex-policemen of developing countries by advertising attractive salaries for jobs in 
zones of armed conflict such as Iraq. This demand has been easily fuelled in countries with 
unemployment and/or underemployment, a migratory population ready to perform security 
work abroad, and largely unmonitored activities of private security companies. The majority of 
third-country nationals have accepted jobs as &#8220;private security guards&#8221; for socio-economic 
reasons such as unemployment, debts or to provide a better education to their children, and other 
opportunities. 
</p>
<p>42. In Iraq, the casualties among private security guards constitute also the largest number 
after that of the United States Army. As of August 2007, over 1,000 private contractors would 
have died since 2003, according to figures of the United States Department of Labor, and 
more than 12,000 injured.<b>49</b> Added to the military toll, the human cost (over 3,670 deaths and 
some 30,000 injured) of the United States war effort would be nearly 25 per cent higher.<b>50</b> 
Among 414 private security guards&#8217; casualties<b>51</b> there were the deaths of citizens from the

<p>  Also victims of the collateral damages of the conflict are truck drivers and many labourers

Private contractors are increasingly the targets of insurgents. The United States Army Corps of 
Engineers has registered a substantial increase in the attacks on supply convoys carrying supplies 
into and around Iraq (14.7 per cent in 2007 compared to 5.5 per cent in 2005 for the same period 
of time).<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>43. However, their exact numbers, precise tasks and the accurate number of casualties remain 
unknown.<b>54</b> The figures of 100,000 private contractors working in Iraq on United States 
contracts, given by the United States Central Command, would include neither subcontractors 
nor contractors working for other clients.<b>55</b> The ratio of private contractors in Iraq could be thus 
almost of one for every single United States military personnel. It should be also pointed out that 
as a result of the situation and the increasing demand for protection, contractors in Iraq may 
allocate some 25 per cent of their budget to private security. In the competition among PMSCs 
by offering the lowest prices to obtain contracts in Iraq, protective measures for their employees 
would have been neglected. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Lack of accountability 
</b></p>
<p>44. These new emerging non-State entities transcend the power of Governments and are 
eroding the traditional concept of sovereignty and the monopoly of the use of force. PMSCs the 
main aim of which is profit-making do not provide a sound basis for long-term stability. Without 
accountability and oversight, PMSCs have often reinforced the potential for conflict as has been 
the case in the Balkans,<b>56</b> Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The 
proliferation of PMSC activities &#8220;fuels the ungovernance of political violence and undermines, 
or makes more difficult the establishment of, the state monopoly on legitimate violence&#8221;.<b>57</b>

<p>45. In Iraq, by Order 17 issued by the Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority 
on 27 June 2004, contractors are immune from prosecution.<b>58</b> Something similar occurs in 
Colombia where any of the abuses which may be committed by United States military personnel 
and private contractors working under Plan Colombia can neither be investigated nor judged.<b>59</b> 
Furthermore, following an agreement between Colombia and the United States of America 
in 2003, the Government of Colombia would not be able to submit to the jurisdiction of the 
International Criminal Court United States armed forces personnel and private contractors 
working for transnational private security companies who have committed crimes against 
humanity.<b>60</b> 
</p>
<p>46. The Working Group has reported the alleged involvement in human rights abuses in the 
prison of Abu Ghraib in Iraq of employees of two PMSCs who have never been subject to 
external investigations nor legally sanctioned, despite assurances given by the Government of the 
United States of America.<b>61</b> The Working Group also notes reports of erratic behaviour of some 
PMSCs employees in Iraq with mottos such as: &#8220;what happens here today, stays with us 
today&#8221;.<b>62</b> It has also been alleged that &#8220;private security guards&#8221; would also detain Iraqis without 
authorization.<b>63</b> According to Iraqi officials and information from the United Nations Assistance 
Mission in Iraq (UNAMI),<b>64</b> on 16 September 2007, in al-Nusur Square in the neighbourhood of 
Mansour in Baghdad, security contractors protecting a United States State Department convoy, 
which was allegedly attacked, opened fire on civilians killing at least 11 persons, with alleged 
use of security company helicopters firing into the streets, resulting in civilian casualties and 
injuries. The security firm Blackwater claimed that its personnel came under attack by &#8220;armed 
enemies&#8221; and fired back in self-defence. Iraqi authorities and witnesses claim the security

PMSCs operating in the country and the freezing of the activities of Blackwater in Iraq.<b>65</b> 
</p>
<p>47. The preliminary results of a peace research institute study on how PMSCs are perceived by 
the local population in Afghanistan (and Angola), indicate that employees of PMSCs may 
contribute to insecurity by perpetuating a &#8220;culture of war&#8221;, and raise concerns as to the lack of 
transparency blurring responsibility and accountability of PMSCs and their employees. The local 
population in Afghanistan also appears to consider that PMSCs are diverting needed funds for 
reconstruction to pay private security companies, which thus paradoxically may in effect prevent 
the stabilization of peace in the country.<b>66</b> It notes that among the PMSC contractors there are 
South Africans now training and providing support to the Iraqi police who served earlier in the 
South African police and army during the former apartheid regime, some of whom have 
committed crimes against humanity.<b>67</b> 
</p>
<p>48. There are differing accounts as to whether commercialization of PMSCs brings more 
efficiency,<b>68</b> but the privatization of the use of force without accountability and oversight leads 
inexorably to impunity. Outsourcing, contracting and hiring PMSCs may be attempts to evade 
direct legal responsibilities, and in some cases, as for the United States of America, an element 
of its foreign policy. The Working Group considers that security is a universal human right for 
all and considers that States relinquish their responsibilities when security becomes a privilege 
only available to those who can afford it.<b>69</b>  
</p>
<p>49. The international community should be concerned about the impacts of the activities of 
PMSCs affecting matters of peace and the enjoyment of human rights in low-intensity armed 
conflicts and post-conflict situations, since the conduct of PMSCs is rather governed by profit 
interests than by compliance with international norms. According to some commentators,

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the current situation in Iraq is creating an economy based on privatized war and reconstruction 
efforts.<b>70</b> It is the primary responsibility of States under international and domestic law for public 
security, law and order, and the Working Group emphasizes that States cannot abandon their 
international responsibilities to non-State actors by outsourcing certain tasks. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Transnational issues 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Working Group noted that the provision of military and security services by 
transnational companies in conflict or post-conflict situations raises important issues regarding 
transparency, control of the means of violence and accountability. It poses political, legal and 
human rights questions to the international community. 
</p>
<p>51. In monitoring the manifestations and emerging trends of mercenaries and 
mercenary-related activities in different parts of the world as well as the effects of the 
activities of PMSCs on the enjoyment of human rights, the Working Group has identified 
transnational issues relating to: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>The status of the international private security guards in war zones.</b> Former 
military personnel and policemen from all parts of the world are recruited to provide 
&#8220;passive or static security&#8221; in Afghanistan and Iraq. They are trained and equipped 
militarily. Attacked by the insurgency, they find themselves in low-intensity conflicts 
without a clear front line,<b>71</b> where it is impossible to distinguish between offensive and 
defensive operations. They are neither civilians nor combatants, would undermine the 
Geneva Conventions by operating in a grey area, and may be easily assimilated to 
mercenaries or irregular fighters;<b>72</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Blurring the areas between non-profit humanitarian organizations and PMSCs 
working for pecuniary gain.</b> Many of the PMSCs present themselves as organizations 
working for humanitarian and peace-building objectives when in fact there could be 
commercial interests in prolonged conflicts;<b>73</b> 
</p>
<p>

<b>72
</b></p>
<p>  For ICRC, a small number of PMSC employees operating in armed conflict or post-conflict 
situations could be considered as combatants, some as mercenaries and the majority would be 
civilians who would lose protection under international humanitarian law when taking direct part 
in hostilities. See Emmanuela-Chiara Gillard, &#8220;Business goes to war: private military/security 
companies and international humanitarian law&#8221;, IRRC, vol. 88, No. 863, September 2006. 
<b>73
</b></p>
<p>  The new low-intensity wars may last decades with no end in sight, H. Munkler, supra. </p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>A labyrinth of contractual and insurance layers.</b> Transnational PMSCs, their national 
subsidiaries, subcontracted companies or private employment agencies select, recruit 
and train former military and policemen as &#8220;security guards&#8221; from all over the world to 
be sent to zones of low-intensity conflict. PMSCs having obtained a contract from the 
United States State Department or the Department of Defense generally subcontract to 
another company which in turn may subcontract to another one or contract a private 
employment agency in a given country establishing thus a number of contractual layers 
which is difficult to disentangle. In general, the individual engaged signs a contract with 
a company which is not registered in his country and which he discovers once he arrives 
in the zone of armed conflict. To this labyrinth there is the additional complexity of 
layers of insurance brokers and insurance companies to obtain a compensation for an 
injury or the death of a private contractor. Often, private security companies registered 
in the United States do not make the contract under the United States Defense Base Act 
with an insurance broker as they are under obligation to. It has also been reported that 
insurance brokers would only pay immediately 30 per cent of the claims and the rest of 
the claims not until an administrative tribunal compels them; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Enforcement and jurisdiction of the contracts</b>. The individuals signing their contracts 
with PMSCs renounce important rights such as the jurisdiction of their national courts. 
The contracts are governed by the laws of a given state in the United States of America 
or elsewhere. In addition, the individual accepts a declaration renouncing some of his 
legal rights. These individuals are recruited as &#8220;security guards&#8221;, but thereafter they 
received military training and are engaged in an armed conflict. Contracts are signed 
either immediately upon departure or upon arrival in the country of destination; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Training of the private security guards. </b>In some cases training of the private security 
guards has been made in military premises in the country the individuals have been 
recruited or in the premises of the PMSC in the United States. In general, however, 
military training has been conducted in other countries in order to avoid legal 
complaints from the authorities of the country from where the individuals have been 
recruited. Jordan, Afghanistan and Iraq seem to be the places where such military 
training has been carried out, but also a number of Chileans were trained in Honduras;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Human rights violations and lack of accountability</b>. PMSCs are often operating 
outside government control and with limited effective oversight from State organs. 
When involved in crimes or human rights violations, these private security guards have 
often not been sanctioned or brought before a court of justice, as exemplified by the 
involvement of contractors in the torture scandal in Abu Ghraib and shootings against 
civilians in Iraq.<b>74</b> As observed in many incidents, PMSC employees can use excessive

<p>force and shoot indiscriminately resulting in civilian casualties.<b>75</b> The Working Group 
has also received information of cases where PMSC employees have used forbidden 
arms or used experimental ammunition prohibited by international law.<b>76</b> Often, they 
circulate without identification and drive in unidentified sport utility vehicles (SUVs) 
with tinted glasses and no plates, behaving similarly to the infamous death squads. In 
Afghanistan and Iraq, the staff of PMSCs &#8220;is extremely difficult to identify&#8221;<b>77</b>. Local 
populations do not have the means to file a complaint with the authorities or the 
contracting State. In Iraq, for instance, the United States Army does not accept to 
receive complaints for abuses which may have been committed by employees of 
PMSCs. In a number of cases, these private security companies sacrifice the safety of 
their employees to cut costs and obtain more profits;<b>78</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Responsibilities of the States which outsource military functions. Indirect 
implication of other States</b>. States may contract these companies in attempts to avoid 
direct legal responsibilities. Complaints which have been brought to the attention of 
Governments appear to be redirected to the private company itself. It also leads to States 
having its citizens involved in armed conflicts for which the Government has never 
been consulted, but the behaviour of the companies or the nationals employed by them 
may nonetheless damage the international image of the States concerned. As pointed out 
by the Human Rights Committee, States have the responsibility to take appropriate 
measures or exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate and redress the harm

</b>  On 16 September 2007, according to UNAMI in the neighbourhood of Mansour in Baghdad, 
</p>
<p>security contractors protecting a US State Department convoy which was attacked opened fire on 
civilians killing at least 11 persons, with security company helicopters firing into the streets 
resulting in civilian casualties and injuries. 
<b>76
</b></p>
<p>  The information on the use of forbidden ammunitions was provided to the Working Group 
by a former military who had been employed as &#8220;security guard&#8221; in Iraq by a PMSC. There are 
reports of use of armour piercing-limited penetration (APLPs) ammunitions, which are 
blended metal bullets which go through steel and anti-bulletproof vests and that instead of 
passing through a human body they shatter creating untreatable wounds. Ibid, Scahill, p. 78. 
In March 2007, the United States military barred the Crescent Security Company from bases 
in Iraq after it was found with weapons prohibited for private security companies.

<p>caused by acts of PMSCs or their staff that impair human rights.<b>79</b> States which contract 
PMSCs to export their activities abroad have to respect their international legal 
obligations, which cannot be eluded by outsourcing some of its functions; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Frontier conflicts</b>. The use of PMSCs for aerial fumigation of herbicides which may 
endanger the health of populations living in areas of a country bordering with another, 
such as under Plan Colombia, may create serious diplomatic incidents. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. STATUS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION 
AGAINST THE RECRUITMENT, USE, FINANCING 
AND TRAINING OF MERCENARIES 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Working Group continues to promote universal accession to the International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries as the only 
global instrument dedicated to addressing mercenaries and mercenary-related activities. During 
the year under review, the Working Group welcomes that the Governments of Cuba and Peru 
have deposited their instruments of accession with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 
It notes there are now 30 States parties to the Convention: Azerbaijan, Barbados, Belarus, 
Belgium, Cameroon, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Georgia, Guinea, Italy, Liberia, 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Moldova, New Zealand, Peru, Qatar, 
Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Suriname, Togo, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uruguay and 
Uzbekistan.<b>80</b> The Working Group notes and welcomes indications of treaty action towards 
acceding to the International Convention by Algeria, Bangladesh, Armenia, Ecuador, 
El Salvador, Ghana, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco, Sudan, 
Tunisia, Venezuela and Yemen. The Working Group reiterates its availability to advise on and 
support these processes. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  FUTURE ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p>53. During 2008, the Working Group will continue to promote the widest ratification/accession 
of States to the International Convention. It will also pursue its consultations with the delegations 
of Armenia, Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, 
Iraq, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, United States of America and Zimbabwe with a view to 
obtain invitations to carry out country visits. 
</p>
<p>54. The Working Group will hold a governmental consultation with representatives of the 
Latin American and Caribbean States in Panama City, hosted by the OHCHR Regional Office 
for Central America and the Caribbean. The aim of this consultation is to gather a regional

<p>perspective of the current practices of private military and security companies recruiting 
personnel to be deployed in armed conflict and to review steps taken by States to regulate and 
monitor the activities of PMSCs. It will also attempt to develop regulatory options and best 
practices aimed at ensuring that PMSC activities are in conformity with international human 
rights standards. 
</p>
<p>55. This informative consultation will be used as a first step in view of the proposal 
recommended by the Working Group to convene a high-level round table to discuss the 
fundamental role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the use of force. The Working Group 
intends, if the necessary resources are available, to conduct two additional governmental 
consultations during 2008 and two more in 2009, similar to the one to be held for the 
Latin American and Caribbean Region in Panama, in order to present to the high-level 
round table of States, to be convened under the auspices of the United Nations, a global 
perception of the emerging issues, manifestations and trends regarding mercenary-related 
activities and their impact on human rights which will contain the regional views of the States of 
the five regions. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>In the course of 2006 and 2007, the Working Group has monitored the activities of 
private companies offering military assistance, consultancy and security services at the 
international level. It has conducted field missions to Chile, Ecuador, Fiji, Honduras and 
Peru which have permitted it to identify how PMSCs recruit, train, use or finance 
former military personnel and ex-policemen to operate in armed conflict or highly 
dangerous post-conflict situations. It has also studied emerging issues, manifestations and 
trends regarding mercenaries or mercenary-related activities and their impact on human 
rights. On the basis of this information, it is of the opinion that many of such 
manifestations are new modalities of mercenary-related activities. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The proliferation of PMSCs in the world is a direct consequence of the outsourcing 
and privatization by member States of many military and security functions. A large 
number of these companies are the supply side for contracts granted by the Department of 
Defense or the State Department of the United States of America in connection with 
low-intensity armed conflicts or post-conflict situations such as in Afghanistan, Colombia 
and Iraq. To implement their contracts and at the same time make the most lucrative 
profits, some of these transnational companies, through subsidiaries or hiring companies, 
create, stimulate and fuel the demand in developing countries. Former military personnel 
and ex-policemen are recruited as &#8220;security guards&#8221;, but once in low-intensity armed 
conflicts or post-conflict situations, they become in fact private soldiers militarily armed. 
Provisions in national legislations granting immunity to PMSC personnel can easily 
become de facto impunity, with these private soldiers being only accountable to the 
company employing them. Some Governments appear to consider these individuals as</b></p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p><b>neither civilians nor combatants, though heavily armed; these individuals are the new 
modalities of mercenarism. They might also be easily associated with the unclear concept of 
&#8220;irregular combatants&#8221;. They often encounter contractual irregularities, poor working 
conditions, failures in obtaining basic needs and problems to obtain financial compensation 
for injuries received.81 
</b>58. <b>The Working Group is concerned at the low state of ratifications and accessions of 
the International Convention (30 States parties), a major tool available at the international 
level which promotes the control of States in the outsourcing of functions regarding the use 
of force. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The Working Group is also concerned at the lack of regulations at the regional and 
national levels regarding private military and security companies which often operate 
without effective oversight and accountability. Weak or insufficient domestic legislation, 
regulation and control of PMSCs encourage these transnational companies to seek to 
recruit former military personnel and ex-policemen from other countries as &#8220;security 
guards&#8221; in low-intensity armed conflicts. Because of the difficulty of war-torn States to 
regulate and control PMSCs, a significant part of the responsibility falls on States from 
where these transnational companies export military and security services to regulate and 
control these companies. The Working Group is also concerned that in spite of drawing the 
attention of the Governments, including in some of the countries in which it has conducted 
field missions, the recruiting of former militaries and ex-policemen by PMSCs for 
employment as &#8220;security guards&#8221; in zones of armed conflict such as Iraq seems to continue. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>To this end, the Working Group makes the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Calls upon all States that have not yet done so to consider taking necessary action 
to accede to or ratify the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, 
Financing and Training of Mercenaries and incorporate relevant legal norms into 
their national legislation. Within this context, the Working Group considers that a 
model law could be elaborated with a view to facilitating accession of those States 
which wish to become party to the Convention, by indicating steps to be taken in 
order to adapt international norms into domestic legislation; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Recommends regional and other intergovernmental organizations, in particular 
the European Union and the Organization of American States, to elaborate a 
common system to regulate private military and security companies exporting 
their services abroad; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Encourages States to incorporate relevant international legislation on these issues, 
as well as relevant regional legislation where such regional frameworks exist 
(e.g. African Union, Economic Community of West African States, Commonwealth 
of Independent States), into national law;

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Recommends that, in order to ensure that the military assistance, consultancy and 
security services offered by private companies at the international level neither 
impede the enjoyment of nor violate human rights, Governments of States from 
which these private companies export such services should adopt legislation and 
set up regulatory mechanisms to control and monitor their activities, including a 
system of registering and licensing which would authorize these companies to 
operate and allow them to be sanctioned when the norms are not respected; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Recommends that States outsourcing activities relating to military assistance, 
consultancy and security services to private military and security companies 
should demand the authorization of States from which former military 
personnel and policemen are recruited by such companies to work in armed 
conflict or post-conflict situations before the recruitment takes place; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Urges Governments of States from which private military and security companies 
export military assistance, consultancy and security services to avoid granting 
immunity to these companies and their personnel; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Encourages Governments which import the military assistance, consultancy and 
security services provided by private companies to establish regulatory 
mechanisms for the registering and licensing of these companies in order to ensure 
that imported services provided by these private companies neither impede the 
enjoyment of human rights nor violate human rights in the recipient country; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Encourages Governments, when establishing such regulatory systems of 
registration and licensing of PMSCs and individuals working for them, to include 
defining minimum requirements for obligatory transparency and accountability of 
firms, background screening and vetting of PMSC personnel, ensure adequate 
training of PMSC personnel on international human rights and international 
humanitarian law, as well as rules of engagement consistent with applicable law 
and international standards, and to establish effective complaint and monitoring 
systems including parliamentary oversight. Such regulatory systems should 
include thresholds of permissible activities, and States should impose a specific ban 
on PMSCs intervening in internal or international armed conflicts or actions 
aimed at destabilizing constitutional regimes; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Encourages States from which former military personnel and ex-policemen are 
being recruited by private security companies to be deployed to low-intensity zones 
of armed conflict or post-conflict situations to take the necessary measures to avoid 
such mercenary recruitment and to issue public statements and apply policies 
aimed at discouraging such practices; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Recommends that United Nations departments, offices, organizations, 
programmes and funds establish an effective selection and vetting system and 
guidelines containing relevant criteria aimed at regulating and monitoring the 
activities of private security/military companies working under their respective 
authorities. They should also ensure that the guidelines comply with human rights 
standards and international humanitarian law; </b></p>

 <p>  
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Recommends that regional governmental consultations followed by a high-level 
round table be convened under the auspices of the United Nations, to discuss the 
fundamental question of the role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the use 
of force. Such meetings will facilitate a critical understanding of responsibilities of 
the different actors, including PMSCs, in the current context and their respective 
obligations in reaching a common understanding as to which additional 
regulations and controls are needed at the international level; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>The Working Group recommends that in order to fulfil the complex mandate and 
challenges given to it under resolution 2005/2 of the Commission on Human Rights 
and assumed by the Human Rights Council, as well as by General Assembly 
resolution 61/151, it be allowed to hold three sessions per year, two in Geneva and 
one in New York;
