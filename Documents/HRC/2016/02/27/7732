<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 19/20 on the role of good governance in the promotion and 
protection of human rights, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare and present to the Human Rights Council, at its 
twenty-fourth session, a comprehensive report outlining the role of the public service as an 
essential component of good governance, including a compilation of best practices based on 
information received from Member States of the United Nations, national human rights 
institutions (NHRIs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). At its twenty-fourth 
session, the Council was informed that, in accordance with the calendar of thematic 
resolutions of the Council, the report would be submitted to the Council at its twenty-fifth 
session. 
</p>
<p>2. The Council invited the relevant stakeholders to provide information on &#8220;good 
practices and their views regarding the organization, training and education of the public 
service in the promotion and protection of and respect for human rights&#8221;. The submissions 
were to include views on &#8220;impartiality, accountability and transparency and the highest 
standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, as well as activities developed to assist 
and support the public service&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>3. Submissions were received from 35 Member States, 4 intergovernmental 
organizations, 1 NGO, 2 NHRIs and 1 observer to the United Nations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and definition of concepts relating to good 
governance and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Defining the role of public service as a component of good governance 
and its linkage with human rights 
</b></p>
<p>4. The definition of good governance has evolved over time and has shifted from 
governance priorities aimed at increasing economic efficiency and growth to those 
governance policies and institutions that best promote greater freedom, genuine 
participation, sustainable human development and human rights. The international 
community has, directly or indirectly, established the interconnection between good 
governance, human rights and sustainable development in a number of declarations and 
other global conference documents. In making the link between good governance and 
human rights, Human Rights Council resolution 7/11 recognizes that transparent, 
responsible, accountable and participatory government that is responsive to the needs and 
aspirations of the people, including women and members of vulnerable and marginalized 
groups, is the foundation on which good governance rests. It also recognizes that such a 
foundation is an indispensable condition for the full realization of human rights, including 
the right to development.1  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The concept of good governance was earlier dealt with by the former Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>in a number of resolutions between 2000 and 2005. In its resolution 2000/64, the Commission 
identified the key attributes of good governance as transparency, responsibility, accountability, 
participation and responsiveness to the needs and aspirations of the people. The resolution also 
expressly linked good governance to an enabling environment conducive to the enjoyment of human 
rights and to promoting growth and sustainable human development. </p>


<p>5. There is no universally recognized definition of &#8220;public service&#8221;. Public service is 
often broadly bracketed with public administration and public sector governance. 
According to the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP), &#8220;Public administration 
refers to: (1) The <i>aggregate machinery</i> &#8230; funded by the state budget and in charge of the 
management and direction of the affairs of the executive government, and its interaction 
with other stakeholders in the state, society and external environment; (2) The <i>management</i> 
and implementation of the whole set of government activities dealing with the 
implementation of laws, regulations and decisions of the government and the management 
related to the provision of public services.&#8221;2 Closely linked with this is the notion of public 
sector governance which, according to the Definition of basic concepts and terminologies in 
governance and public administration (E/C.16/2006/4), &#8220;has been defined as regimes of 
laws, rules, judicial decisions and administrative practices that constrain, prescribe, and 
enable the provision of publicly supported goods and services&#8221; (para. 26).  
6. While definitions vary, this report focuses specifically on those aspects of public 
administration and public sector governance that relate to delivery of and equitable access 
to public service, transparency in budgets and public finance, responsiveness to the views 
of the people, their participation in decisions that concern them and enhanced 
accountability. 
</p>
<p>7. Various themes that fall within the rubric of good governance are inextricably linked 
with the promotion and protection of human rights. Four prominent themes are: (a) 
strengthening democratic institutions; (b) improving service delivery; (c) the rule of law; 
and (d) combating corruption.3 Notably, &#8220;in the realm of <i>delivering State services to the 
public</i>, good governance reforms advance human rights when they improve the State&#8217;s 
capacity to fulfil its responsibility to provide public goods which are essential for the 
protection of a number of human rights, such as the right to education, health and food.&#8221;4  
</p>
<p><b> B. Good governance and human rights: complementarity 
and convergence? 
</b></p>
<p>8. The relationship between good governance and human rights is a complex one, 
given the different origins and usage of the concepts. In earlier connotations, the good 
governance concept had a technocratic bias which was aimed at creating the best possible 
conditions for economic development.  
</p>
<p>9. A seminar on good governance practices for the promotion of human rights, jointly 
organized in 2004 by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) and UNDP, concluded that that there is a mutually reinforcing 
relationship between good governance and human rights (E/CN.4/2005/97, p. 2). &#8220;Human 
rights principles provide a set of values to guide the work of Governments and other 
political and social actors &#8230; Moreover, human rights principles inform the content of good 
governance efforts: they may inform the development of legislative frameworks, policies, 
programmes, budgetary allocations and other measures. However, without good 
governance, human rights cannot be respected and protected in a sustainable manner. The 
implementation of human rights relies on a conducive and enabling environment. This

<p>includes appropriate legal frameworks and institutions as well as political, managerial and 
administrative processes responsible for responding to the rights and needs of the 
population.&#8221;5 Moreover, &#8220;governance is central for effective policy formulation and 
implementation, including for the integrated delivery of essential services, such as 
education, water, sanitation and health.&#8221;6 
</p>
<p>10. In resolution 19/20, the Human Rights Council outlines the following good 
governance principles: accountability, transparency, integrity, non-discrimination, 
participation, equality, efficiency and competency. Many of these principles overlap as 
human rights principles, though it is essential that when the two concepts are linked, good 
governance should ideally be defined and guided by existing normative interpretations of 
these human rights principles and human rights standards more broadly. This general 
approach of using human rights as a guide can also apply to good governance principles 
such as integrity, which is not a human rights principle per se, but in the context of good 
governance, integrity is a key element that completes the notion of accountability and 
transparency. 
</p>
<p><b> III. How can a human rights-based approach contribute 
to improving public service? 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General added value of a human rights-based approach  
to public service 
</b></p>
<p>11. &#8220;States are responsible for delivering a variety of services to their populations, 
including education, health and social welfare services. The provision of these services is 
essential to the protection of human rights such as the right to housing, health, education 
and food.&#8221;7 The role of the public sector as service provider or regulator of the private 
provision of services is crucial for the realization of all human rights, particularly social and 
economic rights. Certain services, such as policing or administering justice, focus directly 
on the protection of individual freedoms and others, such as education, health and food, 
have a markedly social character which is essential for building the human capital 
necessary for sustainable development and the realization of economic and social rights. 
</p>
<p>12. A human rights-based approach to public services is integral to the design, delivery, 
implementation and monitoring of all public service provision. Firstly, the normative 
human rights framework provides an important legal yardstick for measuring how well 
public service is designed and delivered and whether the benefits reach rights-holders. The 
human rights framework empowers rights-holders and requires States as duty bearers to act 
in conformity with their human rights obligations. Secondly, human rights principles can 
contribute to guiding and improving public service, complementing existing value systems 
such as public service ethos and other good governance principles such as efficiency, 
competency and integrity. This approach also leads to improved public service outcomes 
and better quality of public service. Thirdly, public service providers should not 
underestimate the financial or reputational costs of violating human rights and the resulting 
loss of public trust, low morale and poor public perception. Fourthly, a human rights-based

<p>approach also protects against discrimination and tests whether existing public service 
systems protect the rights of persons who are vulnerable and marginalized or whose access 
is hampered by poverty, disability or other forms of exclusion.  
</p>
<p>13. Public authorities often handle complaints with human rights implications across a 
wide range of public services, but what is missing is an awareness and consideration of 
these implications.<b> </b>A human rights-based approach can be used more broadly to inform 
policymaking by public officials and development specialists, enabling them to take 
decisions that are in line with the international human rights obligations of the State.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Applying human rights principles to public service 
</b></p>
<p>14. In order to follow a human rights-based approach, key human rights principles must 
be applied to decision-making regarding public service and in all aspects of public service. 
</p>
<p>15. As indicated in the Definition of basic concepts and terminologies in governance 
and public administration (E/C.16/2006/4), accountability entails holding elected or 
appointed officials charged with a public mandate responsible and answerable for their 
actions, activities and decisions (para. 48). Social accountability is of particular importance 
in the arena of public services. In a recent report, OHCHR and the Center for Economic and 
Social Rights pointed out that &#8220;&#8216;Social accountability&#8217; is used to refer to a broad range of 
activities in which individuals and CSOs [civil society organizations] act directly or 
indirectly to mobilize demand for accountability &#8230; They frequently employ participatory 
techniques of data collection and lobbying for transparent access to the information needed 
to evaluate budgets, monitor public expenditure and delivery of public services, create 
citizen and community score cards, run social audits, etc. Aided by new information and 
communication technologies, CSOs and social movements have been creative in inventing 
new techniques of social accountability. These include community mapping through crowd-
coursing or use of global positioning systems to display and analyse information about 
service delivery.&#8221;8 Citizen engagement is a core element of social accountability, and has 
the potential to empower citizens and elevate the voices of the most vulnerable. The report 
of the twelfth session of the Committee of Experts on Public Administration underscores 
several issues that are important for citizen engagement, including the culture of public 
service and the need to promote the highest standards of public service (E/2013/44-
E/C.16/2013/6, para. 34). 
16. Also linked with accountability is the existence of accessible and effective remedies 
for violations of rights. Avenues through which individuals can complain can include 
NHRIs, public service internal appeals processes and legal action through national courts. 
Relevant bodies must be vested with the power to order reparations and to have their 
decisions enforced; decisions should be transparent, and knowledge of them should be 
disseminated widely, as a lack of awareness of these processes can hinder the effective 
realization of human rights and lead to a failure to prevent abuses. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>17. The act of whistle-blowing also plays an important role in ensuring accountability 
for human rights violations. If people who expose illegal conduct or misconduct in public 
service administration are not protected by law, they are less likely to disclose information 
that might be of significant public interest. Provisions on whistle-blowing should include 
the existence of reporting mechanisms and legal protection for the whistle-blower.

</i></p>

<p>18. Transparency ensures unfettered access to timely and reliable information on 
decisions and performance. Various United Nations mechanisms have stressed the need for 
transparency for those responsible, inter alia, for administering social assistance payments,9 
the extractive industries10 and security and criminal justice sectors,11 as well as with regard 
to the privatization or contracting out of services.12  
</p>
<p>19. During the recent twelfth session of the Committee of Experts on Public 
Administration, &#8220;the right to access information was underscored for its role in promoting 
transparency. Governments should not only recognize the right of access to information but 
engage in the proactive disclosure and elimination of requirements to provide prior proof of 
interest &#8230; The judiciary must be capable of enforcing these rights and/or responsible 
institutions could be charged with guaranteeing implementation&#8221; (E/2013/44-
E/C.16/2013/6, para. 56). In his 2013 report, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression points out that &#8220;the right to 
access information is one of the central components of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, as established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 19), the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 19 (2)) and regional human rights 
treaties&#8221; (A/68/362, para. 2). He also lists some of the core principles that are crucial to 
guaranteeing the right to information, including maximum disclosure, obligation to publish, 
promotion of open government, limited scope of exceptions, processes to facilitate access, 
limited costs, open meetings and the fact that disclosure takes precedence over laws that are 
inconsistent with the right to information (A/68/362, para. 76). 
</p><p>20. The principles of non-discrimination and participation underpin the perennial theme 
of equality in international human rights law. Non-discrimination means that no individual 
or group should be treated adversely due to race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or 
any other defining characteristic.13 Setting standards for recruitment purposes, for example, 
dictating that certain academic achievements must be met by applicants, is not 
discriminatory as it seeks to maintain a high level of professionalism in the delivery of 
services. In addition, temporary special measures such as the implementation of quotas for 
the employment of women or for persons with disabilities are not deemed to be 
discriminatory, so long as the measures are reasonable and not permanent.14 
</p>
<p>21. The participation of individuals or groups representing individuals engenders joint 
decision-making and ownership by the recipients of public services.15 This is reflected in 
article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 3 of the 
Declaration on the Right to Development, which places emphasis on free, active and 
meaningful participation of everyone, including by extension, participation in public 
service provision and decision-making. Obstacles to effective participation can include 
language barriers, geographical remoteness of communities, poverty, lack of access to basic 
services, as well as inefficiency on the part of public administration, and corruption. In

<p>promoting human rights principles and good governance in the context of public services, 
information and communications technologies can be an effective tool to foster greater 
participation.16 21. As the Committee of Experts on Public Administration noted at its 
twelfth session, &#8220;it is undeniable that a framework enabled by information and 
communications technologies is essential for public administration, particularly for the 
effective delivery of public services&#8221; (E/2013/44-E/C.16/2013/6, para. 78).<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Legal framework of human rights in public service  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Which human rights obligations inform public service? 
</b></p>
<p>22. The legal framework of human rights in the context of public service can be briefly 
summarized as follows: States have core human rights obligations under human rights 
treaties and pertinent national laws, which are applicable to all public services. These 
include both positive and negative obligations, and the obligations to guarantee non-
discrimination and ensure equality. If rights are violated in the context of public service 
provision, accountability must be ensured and in particular, remedies must be provided. 
</p>
<p>23. Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the importance 
of a participatory government and article 28 states that everyone is entitled to a social and 
international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration can be fully 
realized.  
</p>
<p>24. Article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires States 
parties to respect and ensure the rights recognized in the Covenant and to take the necessary 
steps to give effect to those rights.  
</p>
<p>25. According to article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, each State party undertakes to take steps, individually and through 
international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full 
realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, including 
particularly the adoption of legislative measures. In its general comment No. 3 (1990) on 
the nature of States parties&#8217; obligations, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights pointed out that &#8220;other measures which may also be considered &#8216;appropriate&#8217; for the 
purposes of article 2 (1) include, but are not limited to, administrative, financial, 
educational and social measures&#8221; (para. 7). These measures can be interpreted to include 
the delivery of public services.  
</p>
<p>26. In its general comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food, the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stated that good governance is essential to the 
realization of all human rights, including the elimination of poverty and ensuring a 
satisfactory livelihood for all (para. 23). Moreover, &#8220;on the part of states &#8230; this requires 
capable public sector institutions, including effective legislative, electoral, regulatory and 
anti-corruption institutions and an independent judiciary. It also requires oversight over 
other responsible actors such as the private sector. On the other hand &#8230; rights-holders need 
to be empowered to participate in decision-making processes and to hold to account those 
who are responsible for formulating policies and delivering services&#8221;.17 States should also 
not take steps which may lead to retrogression and minimum core obligations must be met.  
</p>

<p>Consultation report, 2013, sect. 4.2.3. 
 
</p>
<p>17
  Ibid., sect. 4.1.1. </p>


<p>27. The obligations to ensure equality and non-discrimination are recognized in article 2 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and are encountered in many United Nations 
human rights instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(arts. 2 and 26), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 2 
(2)), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 2), the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (art. 7) 
and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (art. 5). In terms of public 
services, this means that States have an immediate obligation to ensure that deliberate, 
targeted measures are put into place to secure substantive equality and that all individuals 
have an equal opportunity to enjoy their right to access public services. 
</p><p>28. States should also provide an effective remedy to individuals when their rights are 
violated, and provide a fair and effective judicial or administrative mechanism for the 
determination of individual rights or the violation thereof. Article 2 (3) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights refers to the right to &#8220;an effective remedy&#8221;, and 
paragraph 5 of general comment No. 3 (1990) of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights and paragraphs 3 and 9 of its general comment No. 9 (1998) on the 
domestic application of the Covenant refer to the need to provide judicial or other effective 
remedies.  
</p>
<p>29. Specific treaties also include obligations that are relevant to public service. 
According to article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
&#8220;&#8216;reasonable accommodation&#8217; means necessary and appropriate modification and 
adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular 
case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with 
others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221;. Interpreting the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has addressed the issue of 
governments&#8217; capacity to coordinate policies for the benefit of the child and the issue of 
decentralization of services and policymaking. It has also addressed corruption as a major 
obstacle to the achievement of the objectives of the Convention.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Substantive human rights standards relevant to public services 
</b></p>
<p>30. Human rights standards require States to provide access to services, including 
education, health, housing, food and water and sanitation. States are primarily responsible 
for enforcing human rights standards, but their accountability extends to all levels of 
government as well as other institutions to which States devolve authority. 
</p>
<p>31. Article 25 (c) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides 
for the right to equal access to public service and article 25 (a) enshrines the right to take 
part in the conduct of public affairs. In addition, other provisions of the Covenant, together 
with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention against Torture, 
suggest that public services may be relevant in the promotion and protection of a number of 
other civil and political rights, including the rights to life, liberty and security, a fair trial, 
freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of peaceful 
assembly, freedom of association, the rights to vote and to birth registration, as well as the 
prohibition against torture and other forms of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>32. In the context of public services, a range of economic, social and cultural rights are 
clearly implicated. This includes economic rights such as freedom from forced labour, the 
right to favourable working conditions as well as equal pay for work of equal value. Social 
rights include the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to health, the right to 
water and sanitation, the right to food, the right to housing, and the right to education. 
Cultural rights<b> </b>include the right to take part in cultural life and to enjoy the benefits of 
scientific progress and its applications. </p>


<p>33. The human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically 
accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses.18 The Special Rapporteur 
on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation has also set out a post-2015 agenda 
with targets that include everyone having water, sanitation and hygiene at home.19 In order 
for States to be able to realize this human right, they should allocate funding for the 
effective dissemination and sanitization of water through their respective geographical 
jurisdictions, and ensure that effective monitoring of services takes place.  
</p><p>34. The right to health embraces a wide range of socioeconomic factors that promote a 
healthy life. It extends to food and nutrition, housing, access to safe and potable water and 
adequate sanitation, safe and healthy working conditions as well as a healthy 
environment.20 The availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health-related 
services should be facilitated and controlled by States. This duty extends to a variety of 
health-related services ranging from controlling the spread of infectious diseases to 
ensuring maternal health and adequate facilities for children. On the issue of health systems 
and financing, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health has stated that States should 
ensure adequate, equitable and sustainable financing for health.21  
</p>
<p>35. The right to education is both a human right in itself and an indispensable means of 
realizing other human rights.22 Whether education is provided publically or privately, States 
should adopt a human rights approach to ensure that it is of an adequate standard and does 
not exclude any child on the basis of race, religion, geographical location or any other 
defining characteristic. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, has 
stated that, in addition to legislative measures, administrative, judicial, economic, social 
and educational steps must also be taken to ensure adequate housing provision.23  
</p>
<p>37. Distribution of food across all geographical areas needs to be monitored by States, 
as well as ensuring that water and sanitation facilities reach everyone and are maintained at 
a healthy standard. In addition, States need to consider carefully whether the privatization 
of certain basic services such as water and food would impede access by remote groups of 
people or those living in extreme poverty. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food has 
stressed that States must facilitate economic access to adequate food.24 The rights and needs 
of all communities should be met; even people living in remote geographical locations 
should, for example, be guaranteed the provision of education and potable water.

<p><b> 3. Vulnerable and marginalized groups 
</b></p>
<p>38. When considering how public services facilitate the realization of human rights, 
States must bear in mind that there are demographic groups in every society that may be 
disadvantaged in their access to public services, namely women, children, migrants, persons 
with disabilities, indigenous persons and older persons.25 States need to ensure that the 
human rights of these groups are not undermined and that they receive adequate public 
services.  
</p>
<p>39. The universal periodic reviews have included several recommendations to States<b> </b>to<b> 
</b>intensify measures to fully realize the rights of indigenous peoples, in particular their 
representation in civil service and public institutions.26 
</p>
<p>40. The participation of women and the effective provision of services to them should 
also be considered when administering the delivery of public services. It follows that States 
should also monitor the implementation of those services for quality control purposes on an 
ongoing basis.  
</p>
<p>41. Poverty acts as a major barrier in relation to public services. For those individuals 
living in poverty, it is imperative that access to services is ensured, using multiple delivery 
channels to ensure the most effective outreach towards and saturation of the relevant 
beneficiary groups.27 The right to social security is of central importance in guaranteeing 
human dignity, particularly for those in situations of extreme poverty.28 To ensure that 
poverty is not a barrier to receiving adequate public services, measures need to be put in 
place, such as participatory and pro-poor budgeting, which focus more directly on citizens 
in budget formulation, implementation, monitoring and control.29  
</p>
<p><b> D. Public services at the international level 
</b></p>
<p>42. International, regional and subregional organizations have grown rapidly in strength 
and number in recent years. In today&#8217;s globalized community, they are working with States 
on an increasingly collaborative basis to improve public service administration, especially 
in conflict, post-conflict and disaster situations. 
</p>
<p>43. The achievement of the Millennium Development Goals as a global development 
agenda is inextricably linked with the provision of effective public services. Many of the 
Millennium Development Goals, such as achieving universal primary education, aim to 
improve the delivery of public services. Given the impending target date for the 
Millennium Development Goals &#8212; 2015 &#8212; attention is now being focused on post-2015 
development, not only within the United Nations,30 but also across States. The Report of the

<p>High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda31 proposes 
universal goals and national targets, global accountability and assistance for countries to 
implement national plans. In articulating the post-2015 development agenda at the 
intergovernmental level, it will be important to ensure that the delivery and monitoring of 
public services using a human rights-based approach feature prominently in indicators and 
targets for measuring achievement, including global partnerships for development, in order 
to ensure reliable and consistent financing of development and in turn, the provision of 
public services. 
</p>
<p>44. The United Nations works at both the regional and global levels, focusing on 
thematic and country- and region-specific issues. The following bodies work extensively on 
public service provision issues: UNDP, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC), the Division for Public Administration and Development Management, the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Entity for Gender 
Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women).  
</p><p>45. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides policy advice and financing to 
members in economic difficulties and works with developing nations to help them achieve 
macroeconomic stability and reduce poverty. As the world economy struggles to restore 
growth and jobs after the recent economic and financial crisis, the IMF has increased its 
lending, using its cross-country experience to advise members on policy solutions, and has 
supported global policy coordination. This new role in the crisis has serious implications 
for countries that are pursuing reforms, especially austerity measures that may have an 
impact on the effective delivery of public services and the realization of human rights. 
</p>
<p>46. The World Bank provides financial and technical assistance, low-interest loans, 
interest-free credit, and grants to support investments in areas such as education, health, 
public administration, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture, 
and environmental and natural resource management. 
</p>
<p>47. World Bank and IMF lending can influence policy formulation regarding trade 
liberalization, investment, deregulation and privatization of services and industries. 
Conditions have sometimes required that borrower States reform the public sector or 
privatize public services. It is important that the human rights impacts of these reforms or 
conditions are assessed and potential damage prevented and remedied.  
</p>
<p>48. The World Trade Organization (WTO) provides a forum for negotiating agreements 
aimed at reducing obstacles to international trade and ensuring a level playing field for all. 
These activities include administering and monitoring the application of WTO rules on 
trade in goods, trade in services, and trade-related intellectual property rights. The 
substantive scope of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services is determined by 
article 1 of the Agreement, which precludes the application of the Agreement to &#8220;services 
supplied in the exercise of governmental authority&#8221; (para. 3 (b)), which are themselves 
defined in article 1, paragraph 3 (c) of the Agreement. It is important that any rules for trade 
in services and related agreements should be assessed for their human rights impacts.

<p><b> IV. Major public service challenges that affect human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Organization of authority in relation to public service 
</b></p>
<p>49. Decentralization refers to the structuring or organization of governmental authority 
in order to establish a system of co-responsibility between institutions at the central, 
regional and local levels. There are several advantages and disadvantages to 
decentralization. It can lead to improved access to public services, with the participation of 
local communities in decision-making and local dispute settlement and remedies. Through 
decentralization, there may be better grass-roots implementation of services and a more 
results-driven approach. The disadvantages are that decentralization can increase the 
likelihood of duplicating public service efforts, with the consequent fiscal loss which could 
have a direct impact on the funds available for the delivery of public services. There is also 
less likelihood of maintaining consistent standards and implementation of services, such as 
staff training. Regardless of whether services are decentralized, it is recognized that 
strategy is often set at the national level and implementation activities are carried out 
locally. It is therefore important that centrally formulated policy should take into account 
the needs of citizens throughout the country.32  
</p>
<p><b> B. Privatization and public-private partnerships 
</b></p>
<p>50. Effective accountability mechanisms are needed when privatizing public services or 
in the case of public-private partnerships. Regardless of whether services are privatized or 
not, there must be careful monitoring in place for quality control of each service, as well as 
rigorous and transparent procedures for tendering them out. The public service ethos should 
attach to the public service, not the status of the service provider.  
</p>
<p>51. When services are privatized, there can be adverse human rights impacts such as 
inadequate participation of communities in decision-making processes. A rights-based 
understanding of governance includes ensuring that private actors comply with human 
rights standards. It also embodies the view that the delivery of services such as health and 
education are rights that achieve and secure the dignity of all individuals.33 The Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, adopted in 2011, indicate that States should set 
out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their territory and/or 
jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations and in any public service they 
deliver.34 
</p>
<p><b> C. Corruption 
</b></p>
<p>52. The good governance principles of transparency, accountability and integrity in 
public services act as a preventative mechanism against corruption, which can exist in 
numerous forms, including nepotism, payment for services that do not require it, bribes, or

<p>tenders for privatization or third party delivery being given on a non-competitive basis. 
There have been several regional and international efforts to combat corruption.35 Measures 
can be implemented to prevent corruption, such as rotating staff in highly influential 
positions within public service governance, regularly training and assessing staff, and 
ensuring free access to information concerning contentious issues such as tendering out of 
services and budgetary records. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Conflicts, disasters and countries in transition 
</b></p>
<p>53. Conflict, post-conflict situations and disasters pose particular challenges to the 
effective functioning of any public service, which might be in a state of suspension, 
fragmented operation, or at worst, complete decimation. Humanitarian agencies can provide 
invaluable assistance during periods when there might otherwise be nothing in place. In 
addition, when States enter the post-conflict or post-disaster phase, it can take many years 
to instil trust in service users when rebuilding administrative functions. Good governance 
principles are particularly important in these fragile situations, ensuring that the foundation 
of any emerging government administration is one of integrity, transparency and capacity.36

<p><i>  Public service commitment 
</i></p>
<p>56. Some States have a publicly stated set of aims which serve to engender a sense of 
accountability. For example, Morocco has a Charter of Public Service and Sri Lanka has a 
Citizens&#8217; Charter. 
</p>
<p><i>  Recruitment 
</i></p>
<p>57. Nearly all Member States have examinations or open competitions for the 
recruitment of civil servants, which aids transparency and integrity. This also ensures that 
the highest possible standards are maintained when employing those who administer 
services to the public. For example, Moldova stressed that both progress within the civil 
service and first-time recruitment are based on a meritocratic system that depends on skills 
and performance.  
</p>
<p><i>  Training 
</i></p>
<p>58. Many Member States incorporate human rights education into the training given to 
staff working in public services, although this is not always compulsory and the frequency 
of the training varies. In Montenegro, it is conducted annually. In Qatar, human rights 
education is a legal requirement and the United Arab Emirates has a system of credit hours 
for the training of public servants. There are efforts in some States, notably Georgia, for 
human rights training to be disseminated as widely as possible. Serbia noted that &#8220;education 
on the protection and respect of human rights can be successful only in an environment 
where human rights are consistently exercised and respected&#8221;. In many States, such as 
Australia and Estonia, training is delegated to agency heads, which means that central 
Government is not responsible for it. In Burkina Faso, the Ministry of Human Rights assists 
in training. In Mauritius, the National Human Rights Commission gives lectures to the 
police. Latvia has a school of public administration that provides training. Similarly, 
Slovenia has an academy dedicated to administration with a compulsory human rights 
module, and Tanzania has a college dedicated to public service. 
</p>
<p><i>  Assessing public service employees  
</i></p>
<p>59. Some Member States have a system of assessing employees using key performance 
indicators and taking into account the views of online communities. Latvia has introduced 
new regulations that allow for a 360-degree performance evaluation for those working in 
public service. 
</p>
<p><i>  E-technology<b> 
</b></i></p>
<p>60. Many Member States are modernizing their public service systems with the use of e-
technology, given that increasing numbers of people have access to mobile telephones, 
even in remote and poor areas of Burkina Faso and Morocco. Cameroon has a website (and 
a radio programme) on public services. Mauritius has introduced a human rights e-portal.  
</p>
<p><i>  Modernization of public service systems 
</i>61. A recurrent theme in the contributions, as highlighted by France and the Russian 
Federation, was efforts to simplify, modernize and streamline overly bureaucratic 
processes. In Georgia, &#8220;one-stop shops&#8221; have been introduced, providing easy access to 
information and forms, and websites offer similar services. The hope is that this will 
transform the public service from a bureaucracy to a results-driven organization, delivering 
on governments&#8217; social contracts with citizens, and building credibility and trust, as in 
Georgia. There was mention of the increasing creation and use of multiple service delivery </p>


<p>systems, such as in Egypt, where public services can be accessed in post offices, call 
centres and kiosks. 
</p>
<p><i>  Temporary special measures 
</i></p>
<p>62. Many Member States, such as Columbia, employ temporary special measures in 
order to recruit women into positions in the public service. Sometimes this is extended to  
persons with disabilities. In some countries, such as Argentina and Sri Lanka, there are 
quotas for people with disabilities, but not for women. The quotas vary: France has a 
minimum gender quota of 40 per cent for both genders and applies financial penalties to 
public bodies that do not adhere to the quota policies.  
</p>
<p><i>  Respect for equality and diversity in public services 
</i>63. Many States have domestic laws to promote and protect equality. With regard to 
public services, Australia has a workplace diversity programme. Sri Lanka promotes the 
learning of multiple languages for public servants, as significant portions of the population 
speak different languages. France has a charter for the promotion of equality in public 
services.  
</p>
<p><i>  Corruption 
</i></p>
<p>64. Some Member States take measures to prevent corruption, such as the Russian 
Federation where civil servants are rotated in and out of highly desirable positions, and also 
by providing training. Georgia has taken steps to rid its public service of corruption, 
including by introducing a law on conflict of interests and corruption, and is now building 
its public service on a customer-oriented model. Some States, including Burkina Faso, 
Chile and Guatemala, publicly disclose costs, and Chile has a legal framework on 
transparency and good governance as well as a Transparency Board. Guatemala has 
legislation on access to public information and has set up a working group to address good 
governance and human rights.  
</p>
<p><i>  Audits 
</i></p>
<p>65. Several States have created supervisory bodies and/or undertake audits. This acts as 
an accountability mechanism and aids transparency. 
</p>
<p><i>  International, regional and United Nations assistance 
</i></p>
<p>66. Some Member States described their collaboration with regional and international 
assistance, either in the form of anti-corruption initiatives, assessments, or, in the case of 
Kazakhstan, training. United Nations agencies play a crucial role in helping to rebuild 
public services, especially after conflicts, declarations of independence and disasters. In 
Iraq, intergovernmental organizations have been and still are involved with public services. 
In situations where public services suffer, such as in Iraq, States will revert directly to the 
principles set out in international law. Mauritius pointed out that UNDP and UNODC have 
facilitated police reform in order to achieve a &#8220;human rights compliant organization&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Creating a culture of human rights<b> 
</b></i>67. Some Member States and the Council of Europe highlighted the fact that they take a 
proactive approach to creating a culture of human rights, as it is called in Columbia, or a 
&#8220;human rights climate&#8221; in Mauritius, or a &#8220;culture of respect for human rights&#8221; in the case 
of the Council of Europe and France. </p>


<p><i>  Community participation<b> 
</b></i></p>
<p>68. Many Member States, such as Sri Lanka, encourage public and community 
participation, including joint decision-making processes. In Georgia, during public 
procurement processes, citizens can participate online, and there is a dispute resolution 
board on which civil society is represented on an equal footing with public officials.  
</p>
<p><i>  Bilateral relationships 
</i></p>
<p>69. Some Member States utilize bilateral support mechanisms where both countries&#8217; 
public services benefit from the relationship, as is the case with Colombia and Spain.  
</p>
<p><i>  Complaints processes 
</i></p>
<p>70. Multiple avenues exist in many Member States through which complaints about 
public officials, incidents or tender processes can be pursued, including ombudsmen, the 
courts and service commissions.  
</p>
<p><i>  Accountability 
</i></p>
<p>71. National Human Rights Commissions play an important role in ensuring the 
accountability of service providers, as the Commissions monitor the activities of service 
providers and can raise complaints, as well as offering training. The Division for Public 
Administration and Development Management recognized that &#8220;the overriding purpose of 
promoting public service is to support peace and security, social rehabilitation and human 
rights and development&#8221;. Qatar has outlined its work with not-for-profit organizations and 
UNDP; some NGOs in Qatar provide some public services.  
</p>
<p><i>  Human rights education 
</i></p>
<p>72. Mauritius is planning on introducing human rights education programmes into high 
school national curricula in order to help create a national culture of human rights 
awareness.  
</p>
<p><i>  Third-party delivery 
</i></p>
<p>73. Latvia has a law that sets limits on the delegation of public services to third parties, 
and creates exceptions in the cases of some public services which may not be delegated. 
Tanzania has a Public-Private Partnership Act which provides a performance management 
system and under which non-State actors perform non-core functions of service delivery.  
</p>
<p><i>  National goals 
</i></p>
<p>74. National plans of development that highlight human rights principles are in 
existence in some States, including Mexico, Moldova, Qatar and Romania.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>75. <b>The management of public service is a critical link between duty bearers and 
rights-holders. Delivery institutions such as hospitals and schools and providers of 
infrastructure and other basic facilities such as energy, water and sanitation are 
essential to the implementation of human rights. How these services are perceived and 
actually delivered has a significant impact on how governance is assessed within a 
State. When a public service is run down, has shortages of staff and basic 
infrastructure, struggles to provide basic services, is poorly managed in terms of 
financial and other resources, or when people experience corruption and inefficiency, </b></p>


<p><b>there is a resulting lack of confidence in all other aspects of governance. A sustained 
effort should therefore be made to integrate human rights principles and standards 
into the public service and into governance more broadly.</b>  
</p>
<p>76. <b>These principles and standards should be promoted and instilled in the national 
public service through education and capacity-building programmes that are 
mandatory for all those delivering or administering public services.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Practical measures that can be adopted to further the implementation of a 
human rights approach to public services include: (a) integrating human rights 
considerations in the recruitment of personnel; (b) providing human rights training 
and guidance for all staff; (c) incorporating human rights into codes of conduct and 
practice; (d) establishing transparent, responsive, inclusive and participatory 
approaches to public service; (e) providing incentives for achievements in human 
rights and public services; (f) integrating and applying human rights standards across 
all services, alongside legal and financial implications; (g) creating adequate grievance 
mechanisms and effective remedies; and (h) systematically measuring the impacts of 
service delivery on internationally guaranteed human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>International efforts relating to public service improvement are fragmented 
across a number of international treaty regimes and organizations. There is a need for 
human rights-based policy coherence and coordination to support public service 
improvements globally.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>International financial and trade institutions have a significant impact on 
public service provision through their policies and rules. There is a need for better 
synergy between international financial institutions and United Nations mechanisms. 
This may also assist in moving towards a credible and transparent global 
accountability framework in relation to public service, in a manner consistent with 
human rights obligations.
