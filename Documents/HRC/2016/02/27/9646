</b></p>
<p><b>The deteriorating situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic, and the recent killings in El-Houleh 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 66/176 of 19 December 2011 and 66/253 of 
16 February 2012, Human Rights Council resolutions S-16/1 of 29 April 2011, S-17/1 of 22 
August 2011, S-18/1 of 2 December 2011, 19/1 of 1 March 2012 and 19/22 of 23 March 
2012, and Security Council resolutions 2042 (2012) of 14 April 2012 and 2043 (2012) of 
21 April 2012, 
</p>
<p> <i>Condemning</i> the killings, confirmed by United Nations observers, of dozens of men, 
women and children and the wounding of hundreds more in the village of El-Houleh, near 
Homs, in attacks that involved the wanton killing of civilians by shooting at close range and 
by severe physical abuse by pro-regime elements and a series of Government artillery and 
tank shellings of a residential neighbourhood, and reiterating that all violence in all its 
forms by all parties must cease, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that, in a statement made on 27 May 2012, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights stated that the atrocities in El-Houleh may amount to 
crimes against humanity, and noting her repeated encouragement to the Security Council to 
refer the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic to the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 
territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic and to the principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Condemns</i> <i>in the strongest possible terms</i> such an outrageous use of force 
against the civilian population, which constitutes a violation of applicable international law 
and of the commitment of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, under Security 
Council resolutions 2042 (2012) and 2043 (2012), to cease violence in all its forms, 
including the cessation of the use of heavy weapons in population centres;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Condemns</i> <i>in the harshest terms</i> the outrageous killing of forty-nine children, 
all under the age of 10; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Deplores</i> the fact that the recent killings in El-Houleh occurred in a context 
of continued human rights violations in the Syrian Arab Republic, including ongoing 
arbitrary detentions, hindered access for the media and restrictions of the right to peaceful 
assembly; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Emphasizes</i> the continued failure of the Syrian authorities to protect and 
promote the rights of all Syrians, including through repeated and systematic violations of 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reiterates</i> its urgent call upon the Syrian authorities to put an immediate end 
to all violence and all human rights violations, and to meet their responsibility to protect 
their populations; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls</i> <i>once again</i> <i>upon</i> the Syrian authorities to immediately allow United 
Nations human rights mechanisms and missions full and unfettered access and freedom of 
movement within the Syrian Arab Republic; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-19/2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Stresses</i> the need to conduct an international, transparent, independent and 
prompt investigation into violations of international law with a view to hold to account 
those responsible for widespread, systematic and gross human rights violations, including 
those violations that may amount to crimes against humanity; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the commission of inquiry to urgently conduct a comprehensive, 
independent and unfettered special inquiry, consistent with international standards, into the 
events in El-Houleh and, if possible, to publicly identify those who appear responsible for 
these atrocities, and to preserve the evidence of crimes for possible future criminal 
prosecutions or a future justice process, with a view to hold to account those responsible, 
and also requests the commission to provide a full report of the findings of its special 
inquiry to the Human Rights Council at its twentieth session, and to coordinate, as 
appropriate, with relevant United Nations mechanisms;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls upon</i> the Syrian authorities to cooperate fully with the commission of 
inquiry and to accord it full and unfettered access to the Syrian Arab Republic to conduct 
its work; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Calls upon</i> all States Members of the United Nations to assist the commission 
of inquiry in its mission by providing the support necessary for it to achieve its objectives, 
including, but not limited to, Member States calling upon the Syrian authorities to grant the 
commission the access required to conduct its work; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Calls upon</i> the Syrian authorities to grant immediate, unimpeded and full 
access of humanitarian organizations to all areas of the Syrian Arab Republic in order to 
allow them to provide relief and humanitarian assistance, and calls on all sides to respect 
the safety of humanitarian workers; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Requests</i> the cooperation, as appropriate, of other relevant United Nations 
bodies with the commission of inquiry to carry out its mission, and requests the assistance 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Secretary-General in 
this regard; 
</p>
<p> 13.  <i>Calls</i> <i>for</i> the urgent, comprehensive and immediate implementation of all 
elements of the six-point proposal of the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the 
League of Arab States, Kofi Annan, as annexed to Security Council resolution 2042 (2012) 
without any preconditions;  
</p>
<p>14. <i>Invites</i> the Joint Special Envoy for the United Nations and the League of 
Arab States to provide a briefing to the Human Rights Council at its twentieth session; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter.  </p>
