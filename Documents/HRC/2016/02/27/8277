<p><b>  Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
</b></p>
<p><i>Chair-Rapporteur:</i> El Hadji Malick Sow 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> During 2011, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention commemorated its 
twentieth anniversary. On that occasion, the Working Group launched a database to 
facilitate access of victims, States and civil society to its Opinions and other materials.  
</p>
<p> The Working Group has visited Georgia and Germany at the invitation of their 
respective Governments. The reports of these visits are contained in addenda to the present 
document (A/HRC/19/57/Add.2 and 3). 
</p>
<p> Throughout the period 1 January to 30 November 2011, the Working Group 
adopted 68 Opinions concerning 105 persons in 31 countries. These Opinions are contained 
in the addendum 1 to the present document (A/HRC/19/57/Add.1).  
</p>
<p> Moreover, during the period 18 November 2010&#8211;17 November 2011, the Working 
Group transmitted 108 urgent appeals to 45 Governments concerning 1,629 persons (1,526 
men, 99 women and 4 minors). Governments and sources reported that 21 persons were 
released. 
</p>
<p> Information about the implementation of recommendations made by the Working 
Group to the Governments of countries visited was received from the Governments of 
Angola and Colombia.  
</p>
<p> This report includes thematic issues to which the Working Group has devoted its 
attention in 2011, namely the exceptional character of pretrial detention and the human 
right of habeas corpus. The Working Group also takes the opportunity to reflect upon the 
impact of its work, cooperation with other United Nations bodies and international and 
regional instruments for the protection and promotion of human rights, and the need to 
revisit the definition and scope of arbitrary deprivation of liberty. In connection with the 
latter, the Working Group has held informal consultations with representatives of 
Governments and civil society in preparation of its Deliberation No. 9 on the definition and 
scope of arbitrary deprivation of liberty in customary international law. 
</p>

<p> The Working Group calls upon all States to remedy arbitrary detention mainly 
through release and compensation measures in compliance with international human rights 
norms and standards. The Working Group also recommends that States guarantee the 
human right of habeas corpus under all circumstances as an effective tool to combat the 
phenomenon of arbitrary detention.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established by the former 
Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1991/42 and entrusted with the 
investigation of instances of alleged arbitrary deprivation of liberty, according to the 
standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant 
international instruments accepted by the States concerned. The mandate of the Working 
Group was clarified and extended by the Commission in its resolution 1997/50 to cover the 
issue of administrative custody of asylum-seekers and immigrants. At its sixth session, the 
Human Rights Council assessed the mandate of the Working Group and adopted resolution 
6/4 which confirmed the scope of its mandate. On 30 September 2010, by its resolution 
15/18, the Human Rights Council extended the Working Group&#8217;s mandate for a further 
</p>
<p>three-year period.  
</p>
<p>2. During 2011, the Working Group was composed of Ms. Shaheen Sardar Ali 
(Pakistan), Mr. Mads Andenas (Norway), Mr. Roberto Garret&#243;n (Chile), Mr. El Hadji 
Malick Sow (Senegal) and Mr. Vladimir Tochilovsky (Ukraine). 
</p>
<p>3. El Hadji Malick Sow is the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group and  
Shaheen Sardar Ali its Vice-Chair. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group in 2011 
</b></p>
<p>4. During the period 1 January to 30 November 2011, the Working Group held its 
sixtieth, sixty-first and sixty-second sessions. It undertook two official missions: to Georgia 
(15&#8211;24 June 2011) and Germany (26 September&#8211;5 October 2011) (see addenda 2 and 3, 
respectively). 
</p>
<p>5. On 14 November 2011, the Working Group celebrated its twentieth anniversary with 
a commemorative event organized in Paris with the support of the Governments of France 
and Norway and the French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. The 
event brought together various stakeholders, who engaged in round-table discussions on 
issues relating to development of the work and jurisprudence of the Working Group and 
identified best practices to enhance its functions. The Working Group was honoured with 
the presence of two persons who had been the subject of Opinions of the Working Group, 
Birtukan Mideksa and Haitham al-Maleh, as well as with a video sent by Aung San Suu 
Kyi, who thanked the Working Group for the six Opinions rendered regarding her 
detention. Among members of the panels of the event were Nicole Ameline; Carlos Ayala 
Corao and Jared Genser; former Working Group Chair-Rapporteurs Louis Joinet and Le&#239;la 
Zerrougui and former Vice-Chair Tam&#225;s B&#225;n. Emmanuel Decaux, Michel Forst, Bacre 
Ndiaye, Tarald Brautaset, Halvor Saetre, Christian Strohal, and Fran&#231;ois Zimeray honoured 
the event with their presence. At the event in Paris, the Working Group launched its 
database containing over 650 Opinions on individual cases adopted since the establishment 
of the Group. The database is publicly available at www.unwgaddatabase.org in English, 
French and Spanish.   
</p>
<p>6. On 22 November 2011, the Working Group held informal consultations in Geneva 
with representatives of Governments and civil society in the context of elaborating its 
Deliberation No. 9 on the definition and scope of arbitrary deprivation of liberty in 
customary international law. In this connection, by note verbale dated 31 October 2011, the 
Working Group requested the Governments to provide written comments on the following 
questions: &#8220;(1) is the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty expressly contained in 
your country&#8217;s legislation? If so please refer to the specific legislation; (2) what elements </p>


<p>are taken into account by national judges to qualify the deprivation of liberty as arbitrary? If 
possible, please provide concrete examples of the judgments&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Handling of communications addressed to the Working Group during 
</b></p>
<p><b>2011 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communications transmitted to Governments 
</b></p>
<p>7. A description of the cases transmitted and the contents of the replies of Governments 
can be found in the respective Opinions adopted by the Working Group 
(A/HRC/19/57/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>8. During its sixtieth, sixty-first and sixty-second sessions, the Working Group 
adopted 68 Opinions concerning 105 persons in 31 countries. Some details of the Opinions 
adopted during these sessions appear in the table below and the complete texts of Opinions 
Nos. 1/2011 to 68/2011 are reproduced in addendum 1 to the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Opinions of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>9. Pursuant to its revised methods of work (A/HRC/16/47, annex), the Working Group, 
in addressing its Opinions to Governments, drew their attention to resolutions 1997/50 and 
2003/31 of the former Commission on Human Rights and resolutions 6/4 and 15/18 of the 
Human Rights Council, requesting them to take account of the Working Group&#8217;s Opinions 
</p>
<p>and, where necessary, to take appropriate steps to remedy the situation of persons arbitrarily 
deprived of their liberty and to inform the Working Group of the steps they had taken. On 
the expiry of the two-week deadline, the Opinions were transmitted to the source.

</b></p>
<p>10. By letter dated 11 February 2011, the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela informed the Working Group that Mar&#237;a Lourdes Afiuni Mora, subject of 
Opinion No. 20/2010 (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), has been under house arrest 
since 3 February 2011 following a judgment rendered by Judge 26 of the Metropolitan Area 
of Caracas.  
</p>
<p>11. By letter dated 31 May 2011, the Permanent Representative of Belarus to the United 
Nations Office at Geneva took note of Working Group&#8217;s Opinion No. 13/2011 (Belarus) 
</p>
<p>and considered that it was non-objective and biased. The subject of the Opinion, Mr. 
Statkevich, had taken part in an attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat in Belarus organized by some ex-
presidential candidates. These persons were involved in masterminding and participating in 
mass disturbances and in an attempt to seize the House of Government and the Parliament. 
The authorities took forceful measures to subdue those attempts. The Government added </p>


<p>that the right to freedom of assembly must be exercised without violence leading to public 
disorder. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government of Indonesia submitted additional information concerning Working 
Group&#8217;s Opinion No. 48/2011 (Indonesia). It stated that all stages of the legal proceedings 
had been exhausted in the case of Mr. Karma, from the District to the Constitutional Court. 
The sentence against him, according to the Government, is justified and proportionate and 
can be carried out by the Government for the sake of the broader national security of 
Indonesians throughout the archipelago. Mr. Karma enjoys access to health facilities and 
the right to receive visits from his attorney and his relatives.  
</p>
<p>13. The source reported that Mr. Haytham Al-Maleh, the subject of Opinion No. 
27/2010 (Syrian Arab Republic), was released on 8 March 2011, and that Messrs. Mustafa, 
Saleh and Ahmad, the subjects of Opinion No. 1/2011 (Syrian Arab Republic), were 
released on 17 May 2011. 
</p>
<p>14. The source also reported that Mr. Al Chibani, who had been the subject of Opinion 
No. 6/2011 (Libya), was released on 15 September 2011. 
</p>
<p>15. Further, information was received from the source that Mr. Al Karoui, the subject of 
Opinion No. 45/2011 (Saudi Arabia) was released on 7 November 2011. 
</p>
<p>16. The source reported that Mr. Gonz&#225;lez, one of the five persons subject of Opinion 
No. 19/2005 (United States of America), was released on 7 October 2011, after having 
served his sentence. However, he is to remain in the territory of the United States of 
America for another three year period under the regime of conditional liberty pursuant to a 
decision by Judge of the South District of Florida.  
</p>
<p>17. The source reported that Mr. Ziad Wasef Ramadan, a witness in the Hariri murder 
investigations, and subject of the Working Group&#8217;s Opinion No. 24/2010 (Syrian Arab 
Republic), was sentenced to six years&#8217; imprisonment. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Requests for review 
</b></p>
<p>18. By letter of 22 August 2011, the Government of Switzerland reacted to Opinion No. 
4/2011 (Switzerland) adopted on 3 May 2011 and concerning Mr. Yambala. The 
Government requested the Group to review its Opinion. Mr. Yambala is at the prison of the 
airport of Zurich Kloten where he has been held since 25 March 2010, with the view to his 
expulsion. According to the Government, the maximum delay of 18 months in detention 
has not been exceeded. Mr. Yambala has had the possibility to exit Switzerland on several 
occasions had he cooperated with the authorities, in particular regarding the verification of 
his citizenship. The modalities of the application of the measures of detention taken against 
Mr. Yambala are in conformity with the Swiss law and comply with the requirements of 
necessity and proportionality.  
</p>
<p>19. At its sixty-first and sixty-second sessions, the Working Group examined the request 
for review from the Government of Switzerland in accordance with paragraph 21 of its 
methods of work. The Working Group held that the Government did not submit new facts 
which were not known to it at the time of adoption of its Opinion. The Working Group 
decided to maintain the text of its Opinion as originally adopted. 
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group acknowledges receipt of the response of the Government of 
Qatar to the case of Mr. Mohamed Farouk Ghareeb Al Mahdi (Opinion No. 25/2010). The 
Working Group considered that the response was received outside the deadline granted and 
decided to maintain the text of its opinion as adopted on 19 November 2010. The Working 
Group notes that Mr. Al Mahdi was released on 14 September 2010.  </p>


<p>21. The Working Group also decided to maintain the text of its Opinion No. 32/2010 
(Peru) concerning the detention of Mr. Polo Rivera. The Working Group considered that 
the Government has not provided it with new facts within the meaning of paragraph 21 of 
its methods of work so as to warrant a review of its Opinion.  
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group is examining a request for review of its Opinion No. 46/2011 
(Viet Nam) submitted by the Government of Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group is also examining a request for review of its Opinions Nos. 
15/2011 (China) and 16/2011 (China) submitted by the Government of the People&#8217;s 
Republic of China.   
</p>
<p><b> 5. Communications giving rise to urgent appeals 
</b></p>
<p>24. During the period 18 November 2010&#8211;17 November 2011, the Working Group 
transmitted 108 urgent appeals to 45 Governments concerning 1,629 persons (1,526 men, 
99 women and four minors). In conformity with paragraphs 22&#8211;24 of its revised methods of 
work (A/HRC/16/47, annex), the Working Group, without prejudging whether the detention 
was arbitrary, drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to the specific case 
as reported, and appealed to them to take the necessary measures to ensure that the detained 
persons&#8217; right to life and to physical integrity were respected. 
</p>
<p>25. When the appeal made reference to the critical state of health of certain persons or to 
particular circumstances, such as failure to execute a court order for release, the Working 
Group requested the Government concerned to take all necessary measures to have the 
person concerned released. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/2, the 
Working Group integrated into its methods of work the prescriptions of the code of conduct 
relating to urgent appeals and has since applied them.   
</p>
<p>26. During the period under review, 108 urgent appeals were transmitted by the 
Working Group as follows:

<p>27. The Working Group wishes to thank those Governments that heeded its appeals and 
took steps to provide it with information on the situation of the persons concerned, 
especially the Governments that released those persons. In other cases, the Working Group 
was assured that the detainees concerned would receive fair trial guarantees. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Requests for visits 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Working Group has been invited to visit on official mission Argentina (a 
follow-up visit), Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, El Salvador, India, Japan, the former Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya, Spain and the United States of America.   
</p>
<p>29. The Working Group has also asked to visit Sierra Leone, a country, which in spite of 
having extended an open formal invitation to all the thematic mechanisms of the Human 
Rights Council, has not yet replied to the Working Group&#8217;s request. It has also made 
requests to visit Algeria, Bahrain (a follow-up visit), Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, Greece, 
Guinea-Bissau, Morocco, Nauru, Nicaragua (a follow-up visit limited to Bluefields), Papua 
New Guinea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, 
Turkmenistan, the Philippines, Uzbekistan and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Follow-up to country visits of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>30. In accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group decided in 1998 to 
address a follow-up letter to the Governments of countries it had visited, requesting 
information on such initiatives as the authorities might have taken to give effect to the 
relevant recommendations adopted by the Working Group contained in the reports on its 
country visits (E/CN.4/1999/63, para. 36). 
</p>
<p>31. During 2011, the Working Group requested information from Angola, Italy, Malta 
and Senegal. It received information from the Governments of Angola and Colombia. 
</p>
<p><i>  Angola  
</i></p>
<p>32. By letter of 12 April 2011, the Government of Angola informed the Working Group 
of the measures taken in compliance with the recommendations issued in the Working </p>


<p>Group&#8217;s report on its official mission to Angola from 17 to 27 September 2007 
(A/HRC/7/4/Add.4). In the context of the Working Group&#8217;s recommendation to avoid 
arbitrary detention, the Government points out to Law No. 18-A of 17 July 1992, Pre-trial 
Imprisonment Law, which establishes a maximum detention period of five days before a 
person is brought to the Public Prosecutors. Article 3 of the aforementioned law allows the 
detainees to be kept incommunicado prior to the first interrogation. In case of strong 
suspicion of commission of the crime in flagrante delicto, and depending on the nature of 
the offence, a citizen may be placed in pretrial detention for a period from 30 to 135 days.   
</p>
<p>33. Article 64 of the 2010 Constitution of Angola provides that an ordinary law may 
deprive a citizen of his liberty. Article 73 of the Constitution provides that citizens have the 
right to take legal action, file complaints or denounce acts that undermine their rights. 
Article 74 of the Constitution allows the right for popular action and article 75 provides for 
disciplinary and criminal measures for any Government officials and agents responsible for 
violations of rights, freedoms and guarantees enshrined in the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>34. According to the Government, the constitutional framework has reinforced the work 
of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. All prosecutors are required to abide by pretrial detention 
periods prescribed by law and to oversee arbitrary deprivation of liberty. In this context, 
article 64 of the 2010 Constitution indicates the conditions under which public entities may 
detain a person and establishes the institution of the investigating judge, who has as his or 
her main function to protect the rights and freedom of citizens. The Government notes the 
elaboration of the following bills to modify the provisions of the 1929 Code of Criminal 
Procedure and to further avoid any unlawful detention: (a) amendment and revocation of 
various provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and of Executive Order No. 35007 of 
13 October 1945; (b) Statute governing the special proceeding for missing persons; (c) 
Statute governing measures for interim relief, in all phases of the criminal proceeding; (d) 
Statute governing habeas corpus, and; (e) Statute governing searches, seizures and arrests.  
</p>
<p>35.  With regard to pretrial detention, the Government notes that, for crimes carrying a 
correctional penalty, the detention period ranges from 3 to 30 days; for crimes punishable 
by long-term imprisonment &#8211; from 45 to 135 days; and for crimes against State security &#8211; 
from 90 to 125 days. The Government notes the overall level of compliance with these 
periods. 
</p>
<p>36.  In respect of the Working Group&#8217;s recommendation to reduce overcrowding in 
prisons, the Government of Angola points to a number of measures undertaken during the 
period 2007&#8211;2010, such as restoration, construction and expansion of prisons. The Angolan 
Judiciary created a special commission within the Provincial Court of Luanda to hear 
defendants who had been awaiting trial for a period of two to five years and a technical 
commission of judges and the Public Prosecutor, prison directors and clerks to better 
monitor the overcrowding in prisons. 
</p>
<p>37. The Government stresses that these and other measures have contributed to the 
decrease in the number of defendants awaiting trial. At present, the period for detainees 
awaiting trial has dropped to approximately one year. This improvement is also due to the 
expansion of the training programme at the National Institute of Legal Studies intended for 
judges and prosecutors in Angola. 
</p>
<p>38. The Government indicates that 1,570 prisoners were released nationwide for a 
variety of reasons, some of them involving irregularities and illegal detentions. Of the 
1,570, 1,347 were in pretrial detention and 223 convicted. 
</p>
<p>39. As part of an effort to reduce the overcrowding, the President granted a pardon in 
April 2009 to mark the seventh year of actual peace in Angola, set forth in Presidential 
Decree No. 11 of 3 April 2009, which permitted all convicted prisoners who had served 
half of their sentence by 31 March 2009 and those whose sentences did not exceed a period </p>


<p>of 12 years of imprisonment, to be released. Persons whose sentences exceeded 12 years 
had their sentences reduced by a quarter. 
</p>
<p>40. In its letter, the Government provided detailed information on the institution of 
parole in Angola. It noted that during the period of 2007&#8211;2010, orders were filed in favour 
of granting parole that resulted in some prisoners being released. As an example, in Luanda, 
where the prison population was the highest in the country from 2008 to 2010, 95 petitions 
were granted and 28 not granted on objective reasons. At the moment of submission of the 
information to the Working Group, 106 proceedings were in progress.  
</p>
<p>41. In relation to the recommendation by the Working Group to have more frequent 
inspections and visits by the Ombudsman and Office of the Attorney General to prison and 
detention centres, the Government notes that these have gradually increased since 2007. 
The Government mentions the ongoing programmes developed by a number of NGOs 
working directly with prisoners and detainees in Angola. 
</p>
<p>42. Regarding the recommendations for special treatment of minors in detention, the 
Government notes that the majority age in Angola is 18 years. However, minors aged 16 
and 17 years are criminally liable. Such criminal responsibility is relative, as not all of the 
sentences set forth in the Criminal Code are applicable to these minors. The heaviest 
sentences do not apply to these minors. Hence, minors aged 16 or 17 cannot be sentenced to 
more than eight years in prison and the judge has the authority to reduce that sentence to 
one year in prison pursuant to articles 94 and 108 of the Criminal Code. Minors aged 16 
and 17 are separated from the adults in accordance with article 22 of Law No. 8 of 29 
August 2008. The Government nevertheless notes that, owing to overcrowding, a strict 
separation and prevention of incidents between minors and adults is not yet entirely 
satisfactory. Minors under 16 years suspected of having committed an offence are protected 
by a special legal regime of the Juvenile Court. They can only be subject to a proceeding 
for application of crime prevention measures and proceeding for application of social 
protection measures.  
</p>
<p>43. The Government notes that following the adoption of the 2010 Constitution, the 
action of habeas corpus, which was already available in chapter VII, article 312, of the 
Angolan Code of Criminal Procedure, acquired a constitutional dimension through article 
</p><p>68.   
</p>
<p>44. Concerning the recommendation of the Working Group to place the prison 
administration under the authority of the Ministry of Justice, the Government notes that no 
final decision has yet been reached on this matter. The Government states that the Criminal 
Investigation Police and Prison Services are two entirely separate bodies under the 
authority of the Ministry of the Interior. 
</p>
<p>45. With regard to the possibility of establishing a mechanism that ensures the revision 
of the decisions of military courts by the civil Supreme Court, the Government recognizes 
the need for revising the laws pertaining to military justice. According to the Government, 
the possibility of control or oversight by the civil courts of the decisions of military courts 
would probably lead to a conflict of jurisdiction. The Government considers that the 
military judges under the Public Prosecutor ensure sufficient oversight of the decisions by 
the military courts. The Government reports that common crimes, even if these are 
committed by military personnel, are tried in the civil courts.  
</p>
<p><i>  Colombia 
</i></p>
<p>46. By letter of 7 December 2010, The Government of Colombia informed the Working 
Group about the measures it had taken to implement the Working Group&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>recommendations contained in the report on its visit to the country, carried out in October 
2008 (A/HRC/10/21/Add.3). The Government reported that Draft Law No. 113 (Civil </p>


<p>Coexistence Code) was submitted by the Executive Organ to the House of the 
Representatives on 5 October 2010. The Draft Code was approved in the first instance by 
the Senate on 1 December 2010. The new Code, based on the principles of respect to the 
right to liberty and the right of security, would unify in a sole legal text all norms 
concerning the Police. By Decree 3445 of 17 September 2010, the Government had 
established the post of High Presidential Adviser for Civil Coexistence and Citizen Security 
(Alta Consejer&#237;a Presidencial para la Convivencia y la Seguridad Ciudadana). 
</p>
<p>47. The Government of Colombia made reference to the National Plan of Judicial 
Decongestion 2009&#8211;2010 (Plan Nacional de Descongesti&#243;n 2009&#8211;2010) in order to try to 
reduce a significant backlog of cases. The National Plan had facilitated the issue of 54,238 
judicial resolutions as well as the process and treatment of 1,023,674 judicial files. The 
fight against corruption had motivated a thorough review of the structure of the Prosecutor 
General&#8217;s Office (Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n) as well as the creation of a specialized 
body against corruption at the Judicial Police. Lastly, concerning another concrete 
recommendation of the Working Group, the Government informed that the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers had visited the country in December 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Thematic considerations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Pretrial detention as an exceptional measure 
</b></p>
<p>48. In view of the communications received and findings resulting from its country 
visits, the Working Group notes with concern the increasing use of pretrial detention and its 
excessive length.  
</p>
<p>49. Whilst the resolution 1991/42 of the former Commission on Human Rights 
establishing the mandate of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention did not provide a 
definition of &#8220;detention&#8221;, the use of the term &#8220;deprivation of liberty&#8221; in resolution 1997/50 
</p>
<p>made it clear that the Working Group can be seized of all forms of detention.  
</p>
<p>50. Pretrial detention constitutes a grave limitation on the freedom of movement, a 
fundamental and universal human right. It places an individual&#8217;s life under the authority of 
agents responsible for his or her custody.  
</p>
<p>51. The question of pretrial detention is regulated by article 9 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Paragraph 3 of this article provides that &#8220;anyone 
</p>
<p>arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be brought promptly before a judge or other 
officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a 
reasonable time or to release&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>52. General comment No. 8 (1982) on the right to liberty and security of persons of the 
Human Rights Committee explains the notion of &#8220;promptly&#8221; by reference to a period of a 
few days. Pretrial detention must be as short as possible.  
</p>
<p>53. Article 9, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
sets forth two cumulative obligations, namely to be promptly brought before a judge within 
the first days of the deprivation of liberty and to have a judicial decision rendered without 
undue delays, in the absence of which the person is to be released.  
</p>
<p>54. This provision is completed by the second part of paragraph 3 of article 9 which 
provides that &#8220;it shall not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in 
custody, but release may be subject to guarantees to appear for trial, at any other stage of 
the judicial proceedings, and, should occasion arise, for execution of the judgement&#8221;. It </p>


<p>follows that liberty is recognized as a principle and detention as an exception in the 
interests of justice.  
</p>
<p>55. The rationale in paragraph 3 of article 9 also indicates that alternative measures 
including house arrest, judicial monitoring, release on bail shall not be regarded as 
compulsory vis-&#224;-vis a pretrial detention but rather optional. The consideration of 
alternative non-custodial measures allows it to be ascertained whether the principles of 
necessity and proportionality have been met. 
</p>
<p>56. The provisions contained in paragraph 3 of article 9 of the Covenant can be 
summarized as follows: 
</p>
<p>Any detention must be exceptional and of short duration and a release may be 
accompanied by measures intended only to ensure representation of the defendant in 
judicial proceedings. 
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group expresses its desire that the present understanding of paragraph 
3 of article 9 of the Covenant be commonly subscribed to and invites States to further 
promote it among agents responsible for the application of the law, with a view to 
contributing to the eradication of unjustified and prolonged pretrial detention, which 
constitutes arbitrary deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p>58. The above position finds further support in the presumption of innocence and 
individual liberty equally recognized in the Covenant. Finally, it should be noted that the 
rule contained in article 9 is applicable only to criminal procedure and not civil procedure.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Habeas corpus  
</b></p>
<p>59. Since its second report, which covered the activities in 1992, the Working Group has 
repeatedly addressed the issue of habeas corpus.1 It has consistently emphasized that habeas 
corpus is, in itself, a human right, as may be inferred from a careful reading of articles 8, 9 
and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and more explicitly, article 9, 
paragraph 4, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides 
that: &#8220;anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take 
proceedings before a court, in order that that court may decide without delay on the 
lawfulness of his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful.&#8221; The 
</p>
<p>Working Group maintains that habeas corpus &#8220;should be regarded not as a mere element in 
</p>
<p>the right to a fair trial but ... as a personal right&#8221; (E/CN.4/2004/3, para. 62). Similarly, 
principle 32 of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of 
Detention or Imprisonment provides that a detained person or his counsel &#8220;shall be entitled 
</p>
<p>at any time to take proceedings according to domestic law&#8221; for the same purposes. This is 
</p>
<p>also the understanding of the Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 8, 
paragraph 1, which prescribes that &#8220;the important guarantee laid down in paragraph 4, i.e. 
the right to control by a court of the legality of the detention, applies to all persons deprived 
of their liberty by arrest or detention&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>60. Moreover, States parties have the obligation, in accordance with article 2, paragraph 
3, of the Covenant, to ensure that an effective remedy is provided to any person whose 
rights as recognized therein are violated; and they have that obligation specifically in any 
</p>
<p>  
 1 See the reports of the Working Group, documents E/CN.4/1993/24, para. 43 (c); 
</p>
<p>E/CN.4/1994/27, para. 36; E/CN.4/1995/31, para. 45; E/CN.4/1996/40, paras. 110 and 124 
(5); E/CN.4/2004/3, paras. 62, 85 and 87; E/CN.4/2005/6, paras. 47, 61, 63&#8211;64, 75 and 78; 
A/HRC/7/4, paras. 64, 68 and 82 (a); A/HRC/10/21, paras. 53&#8211;54 and 73; A/HRC/13/30, 
paras. 71, 76&#8211;80, 92 and 96. </p>


<p>case in which an individual claims to be deprived of his or her liberty in violation of the 
Covenant, as stated in the paragraph 1 of general comment No. 8. The former Commission 
on Human Rights, in its resolution 1994/32, also encourages States to establish habeas 
corpus as &#8220;a personal right&#8221; not subject to derogation, including during states of emergency. 
</p>
<p>61. In the light of the above, the absence of a remedy of habeas corpus constitutes, per 
se, a human rights violation by depriving the individual &#8211; in effect, all individuals &#8211; of the 
human right to protection from arbitrary detention. For that reason, the Working Group 
recommended, for example, in its report on its mission to Senegal in 2009, that the 
Government should &#8220;consider the possibility of establishing habeas corpus as a means of 
</p>
<p>combating arbitrary detentions&#8221; (A/HRC/13/30/Add.3, para. 82 (a)). As the Working Group 
has already stated, that habeas corpus is &#8220;indispensable in a State governed by the rule of 
law as a safeguard against arbitrary detention&#8221; (E/CN.4/1994/27, para. 36). 
</p>
<p>62. The Human Rights Committee points out that article 9, paragraph 1, of the Covenant 
is applicable to all forms of deprivation of liberty, whether in criminal cases or in other 
cases such as, for example, mental illness, vagrancy, drug addiction, educational purposes, 
immigration control, reasons of public security, accusations of terrorism, prolonged pretrial 
detention, secret prisons or incommunicado detention. The Working Group had done the 
same, noting that, as part of the so-called &#8220;war against terrorism&#8221;, instances of arbitrariness 
and unacceptable limitations on the exercise of the human right of habeas corpus have been 
committed against political opponents, religious dissenters, and other persons exercising 
their freedoms of opinion, expression, conscience and religion (E/CN.4/2005/6, para. 63). 
In the course of its country visits, the Working Group pays particular attention to 
constitutional and legal provisions relating to personal freedom, and remedies for 
contesting arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p>63. The Working Group is of the view that, in their domestic legislation, States should 
ensure that the remedy of habeas corpus meets the following minimum requirements in 
order to comply with international human rights law: 
</p>
<p>(a) Informality: in other words, there may be no requirement of legal formalities 
that, if not complied with, might lead to the inadmissibility of the remedy. Any individual 
should therefore be able to apply for it in writing, orally, by telephone, fax, e-mail or any 
other means, without the need for prior authorization; 
</p>
<p>(b) Judicial level: it must be adjudicated by a judicial authority superior in rank 
to that of the public servant or judge who ordered the arrest; 
</p>
<p>(c) Effectiveness and accessibility: the decision to grant habeas corpus must be 
implemented immediately, either through the release of the person deprived of liberty or by 
unobstructed rectification of any flaws discovered, as recommended by the Committee 
against Torture (see CAT/C/CR/34/UGA, paras. 6 (b) and para. 10 (f)); 
</p>
<p>(d) Cost-free access: the detained person or his or her family should not be 
required to post bail or incur any cost whatsoever; 
</p>
<p>(e) Urgency of habeas corpus proceedings and judgement: (&#8220;without delay&#8221;, as 
indicated in article 9, para. 4, of the Covenant) meaning that the court must request the case 
file with a view to reaching a decision within a matter of hours; 
</p>
<p>(f) Prohibition of the intervention of a lawyer as a criterion for admissibility of 
the appeal; 
</p>
<p>(g) Universality: not only may it be sought regardless of the offence with which 
the detainee is charged, including treason and terrorism, but any person deprived of liberty, 
irrespective of his or her nationality, may exercise the right; </p>


<p>(h) Non-derogability: even in cases provided for in article 4 of the Covenant, and 
in cases of armed conflict &#8211; whether between two or more States parties or within the same 
State party &#8211; in conformity with the Geneva Conventions. Provision to that effect has been 
made by all human rights bodies of the United Nations system (see Commission on Human 
Rights resolution 1993/36, para. 16, and many others, including resolution 1994/32, which 
refers to habeas corpus as &#8220;a personal right not subject to derogation, including during 
</p>
<p>states of emergency&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>64. Constitutional or legal provisions governing the remedy of habeas corpus must 
provide safeguards against the following indications of a possible infringement of personal 
liberty: 
</p>
<p>(a) The absence of a detention order; 
</p>
<p>(b) The absence of legal grounds for the detention order; 
</p>
<p>(c) The judicial body&#8217;s lack of independence from the authority that ordered the 
deprivation of liberty; 
</p>
<p>(d) The authority&#8217;s lack of legal competence to order the detention of an 
individual; 
</p>
<p>(e) Enforcement of a legal detention order by public servants neither authorized 
to do so nor duly identified; 
</p>
<p>(f) Failure to show the detention order at the time of the arrest; 
</p>
<p>(g) Transfer of the detainee to a non-public location not equipped to serve as a 
place of detention; 
</p>
<p>(h) Use of prolonged incommunicado detention; 
</p>
<p>(i) Delay in bringing the detainee before the judicial authority within the shortest 
period of time provided for by law; 
</p>
<p>(j) Failure to inform the persons closest to the detainee of all relevant 
circumstances, especially in the case of minors; 
</p>
<p>(k) Failure to notify the diplomatic or consular representative of the detainee&#8217;s 
country of his or her arrest; 
</p>
<p>(l) Failure to record the entry into custody of a detainee in the logbook, as 
required by law, at the actual time of his or her admission, and to log in the corresponding 
detention order and its justification, the names of the officials who performed the arrest, 
and the date and time of the detainee&#8217;s admission and appearance before the court; 
</p>
<p>(m) Failure to provide notification of the right to an interpreter and the use of 
same; 
</p>
<p>(n) Denial of bail, or imposition of excessive bail, for release from custody 
during the trial; 
</p>
<p>(o) Detention resulting from the legitimate exercise of a universally recognized 
human right; 
</p>
<p>(p) Deprivation of liberty that constitutes the failure, in whole or in part, to 
comply with international rules relating to the right to a fair trial; 
</p>
<p>(q) Holding immigrants or asylum-seekers in custody for prolonged periods of 
time without recourse to other legal remedies for challenging such custody; 
</p>
<p>(r) Arrest that constitutes an act of discrimination prohibited by international 
law; </p>


<p>(s) Failure to inform the detainee of his or her rights, especially the right to 
appoint an attorney and to communicate freely and confidentially with same; the lack of 
effective remedies for challenging the legality of the detention order or the manner in which 
the detention is carried out; 
</p>
<p>(t) Failure to inform the detainee of his or her right to free legal assistance if he 
or she is unable to pay for such assistance; 
</p>
<p>(u) Lack of access to all the evidence on which the detention order was based; 
</p>
<p>(v) Lack of proportion between the act with which the detainee is accused and 
the extreme measure of deprivation of liberty; 
</p>
<p>(w) Denial of the right to receive visits from his or her close family members and 
lawyers; 
</p>
<p>(x) The failure to treat the detainee humanely and with respect for the inherent 
dignity of the human being, subjecting him or her to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p>(y) The application of measures to the detainee that amount to some form of 
discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion or religious belief, 
political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, economic position, birth or any 
other condition; 
</p>
<p>(z) Placement of the detainee with convicted prisoners; and 
</p>
<p>(aa) Failure to provide the detainee with the necessary medical care. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Cases, compliance and remedies  
</b></p>
<p>65. The Working Group has from its inception been concerned with fact-finding and the 
clarification and development of international law on arbitrary detention. It has developed 
extensive jurisprudence, in particular in its Opinions on individual cases, but also in its 
deliberations, legal opinions, country visit reports, urgent appeals and joint reports with 
other mandates of the special procedures on legality and arbitrariness in human rights 
treaties and customary international law.   
</p>
<p>66. The Working Group makes reference to its own jurisprudence and to that of other 
United Nations human rights bodies. For instance, the communications, general comments 
and reports of the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture are sources 
of authority on the interpretation of their respective treaties and on available remedies. The 
jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, regional human rights courts and 
national courts is constantly present in the Working Group&#8217;s deliberations even when 
</p>
<p>express reference is not made thereto. The Working Group&#8217;s approach reflects a wider 
practice of cross-fertilization between judicial and quasi-judicial bodies at the national, 
regional and international level. For instance, the Human Rights Committee, in <i>Yevdokimov 
and Rezanov v. Russian Federation </i>(communication No. 1410/2005, Views adopted on 20 
March 2004), made reference to the European Court of Human Rights. Similarly, in 
<i>Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo)</i>, the 
International Court of Justice made reference to the jurisprudence developed under the 
European, African and Inter-American systems for the promotion and protection of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>67. The Working Group welcomes the fact that the findings and recommendations in its 
reports and Opinions are increasingly made use of by other United Nations human rights 
bodies and regional human rights courts, such as the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights and the European Court of Human Rights. Also, when national courts are </p>


<p>determining the extent of international law obligations that may have a direct or indirect 
effect on matters before them, the reports and Opinions of the Working Group have 
provided assistance. This also applies when a national court considers a detention that the 
Working Group has declared arbitrary in violation of international law. The effectiveness of 
international human rights protection requires that all national authorities observe 
international law obligations. The Working Group has on occasion reminded a State that 
the duty to comply with international human rights rests not only on the Government but on 
all officials, including judges, police and security officers, and prison officers with relevant 
responsibilities. No person can contribute to human rights violations. The Working Group 
has also made clear that a widespread or systematic practice of detention can constitute a 
war crime or a crime against humanity.  
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group has in its jurisprudence established the ways in which it deals 
with evidentiary issues. Its approach is in line with the ruling of the International Court of 
Justice in <i>Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the 
Congo)</i>, which establishes the evidentiary position for claims to succeed in human rights 
cases, a position which this Working Group has adopted on previous occasions for its own 
Opinions in individual cases. Where it is alleged that a person has not been afforded, by a 
public authority, certain procedural guarantees to which he or she was entitled, it may be 
difficult to establish the negative fact that is asserted. A public authority is generally able to 
demonstrate that it has followed the appropriate procedures and applied the guarantees 
required by law &#8211; if such was the case &#8211; by producing documentary evidence of the actions 
that were carried out. In general the burden rests with the Government: it is for the 
Government to produce the necessary proof. More generally, the matter of the evidentiary 
burden arises where the source has established a prima facie case for breach of international 
requirements constituting arbitrary detention. Regrettably, in some cases, Governments 
have not responded to the request from the Working Group to provide it with information. 
In the absence of such information, the Working Group must base its Opinion on the prima 
facie case as made out by the source. Furthermore, mere assertions that lawful procedures 
have been followed will not be sufficient to rebut the source&#8217;s allegations; that follows from 
the nature of the prohibition of arbitrary detention.  
</p>
<p>69. The Working Group promotes compliance with international human rights law and 
standards prohibiting and preventing arbitrary detention, as expressed in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
The Human Rights Committee has authoritatively confirmed that &#8220;arbitrary deprivations of 
</p>
<p>liberty&#8221; constitute a violation of peremptory norms of international law which are non-
derogable (see general comment No. 29 (2001) on derogation during a state of emergency). 
In agreement with this position, the Working Group continues to apply the prohibition of 
arbitrary detention as a peremptory norm of international law (or <i>jus cogens</i>). The Working 
Group is preparing a deliberation on arbitrary detention in customary international law, 
which, among other matters, will provide an overview of statements by other bodies and the 
Working Group&#8217;s own practice on what constitutes detention, the legality requirement and 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of arbitrariness, in pre- and post-trial detention and detention during the 
trial, including the principles of necessity and proportionality which are at the core of the 
arbitrariness requirement.  
</p>
<p>70. In addition to promoting compliance with international human rights law and 
standards prohibiting and preventing arbitrary detention, the Working Group continues to 
promote adequate redress when arbitrary detention has occurred, in terms of articles 2, 
paragraph 3, and 9, paragraphs 4 and 5, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the requirements of customary international law. Having established the 
arbitrariness of detention in its Opinion, the Working Group will request the Government to 
take the necessary steps to remedy the situation and to bring it into conformity with the 
standards and principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Covenant. </p>


<p>The necessary step to be taken to remedy the situation when the detention falls within one 
of the categories applicable to the cases submitted to the Working Group is typically the 
immediate release of the detained person, and the Working Group in such cases states this 
explicitly. Such remedy follows from the generally recognized principle of restitution ad 
integrum, requiring the immediate restoration of the physical liberty of the arbitrarily 
detained person. It is also reflected in article 9, paragraph 4, of the Covenant, which 
requires that a court must be empowered to order the release of an unlawfully detained 
person. For such remedy to be effective, as required by article 2, paragraph 3, of the 
Covenant, detaining States are under an obligation to release the arbitrarily detained 
(foreign) detainee into their own territory, even if they wish to deport the (foreign) detainee, 
but where deportation of the detainee otherwise liable for removal to the country of origin 
or to a third country accepting the detainee is not promptly possible. This could occur if a 
removal would violate the principle of non-refoulement or if it is not possible for any other 
legal or factual reasons. Otherwise, the international human rights obligation for immediate 
restoration of the liberty of the arbitrarily detained person would be undermined. 
</p>
<p>71. When the Working Group finds in its Opinions that the detention of the concerned 
individual exclusively falls within category III as gravely violating the right to fair trial, the 
appropriate remedy might take forms different to that of the immediate release of the 
arbitrarily detained person. An example could be that of affording the detainee a retrial that 
meets all fair trial guarantees as contained in article 10 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and articles 9, paragraph 3, and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. However, given the gravity of the violation of fair trial guarantees, 
which is a condition for the Working Group to declare the detention to be arbitrary, 
immediate release would typically be the appropriate remedy here. Considering the time 
that the individual concerned has already spent in pretrial detention, conditional release, 
release on bail or other forms of release pending trial would typically be required. 
</p>
<p>72. In its reports and Opinions, the Working Group encourages States that have not 
ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to do so. When it wishes to 
restate or develop its jurisprudence on a matter of importance or on a point of law, or call 
on States to amend their national legislation or to change their practices so as to bring them 
into conformity with its international human rights obligations, it may, render an Opinion 
even though the person has been released. In any given case, the Working Group may 
remind States of their obligation under article 9, paragraph 5, of the Covenant to provide 
compensation to a released person. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The Working Group welcomes the cooperation it has received from States with 
regard to cases that it has considered. During 2011, the Working Group adopted 68 
</b></p>
<p><b>Opinions concerning 105 persons in 31 countries.  
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The Working Group welcomes the invitations extended to it as well as the 
cooperation on the part of the respective Governments. The Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducted two official visits in 2011, to Georgia and Germany. Among all the 
</b></p>
<p><b>requested country visits, the Working Group has received invitations from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments of Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, El Salvador, India, Japan, Spain, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>former Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the United States of America. The Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group reiterates its belief that its country visits are essential in fulfilling its mandate. 
</b></p>
<p><b>For Governments, these visits provide an excellent opportunity to show developments 
</b></p>
<p>and progress in detainees&#8217; rights and the respect for human rights, including the right 
</p>
<p><b>not to be arbitrarily deprived of liberty. </b></p>


<p>75.<b> Moreover, the Working Group considers of utmost importance effective follow-
up to its country visits and requests the support of Member States therein. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of the follow-up to and implementation of 
</b></p>
<p>recommendations contained in the Working Group&#8217;s Opinions. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The Working Group takes the opportunity to reiterate the exceptional 
character of the measure of detention under international human rights law. Article 9, 
</b></p>
<p><b>paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights sets forth 
</b></p>
<p><b>narrowly circumscribed principles for detention on a criminal charge so as to avoid 
</b></p>
<p><b>unlawfulness and arbitrariness. The Working Group emphasizes that the notions of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>promptness and reasonableness of pretrial detention are to be construed restrictively. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The time period referred to in article 9, paragraph 3, shall be no longer than a few 
</b></p>
<p><b>days. Whenever possible States shall seek to ensure that measures less restrictive than 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention are available so as not to undermine the very core of the human right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>liberty and freedom of movement. States are to ensure that these measures are 
</b></p>
<p><b>absolutely necessary and proportional to the objective sought. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>With respect to habeas corpus, the Working Group recognizes its existence as a 
self-standing human right. It lies at the core of combating and preventing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>phenomenon of arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The Working Group has consolidated 
</b></p>
<p><b>its understanding of the scope and effect of habeas corpus through its Opinions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>country visits. It reiterates that the right to habeas corpus is not subject to any 
</b></p>
<p><b>exceptions or derogations even in the context of armed conflict. Habeas corpus 
</b></p>
<p><b>constitutes the ultimate guarantee of individual liberty and provides the possibility to 
</b></p>
<p><b>contest the legality of any form and measure of deprivation of liberty.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Finally, the Working Group notes with satisfaction the increasing cross-
fertilization between its activities and the work of other United Nations bodies as well 
</b></p>
<p><b>as international and regional instruments for the promotion and protection of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights. In this context, the ongoing preparation of Deliberation No. 9 will draw upon 
</b></p>
<p>the statements by other bodies and the Working Group&#8217;s own practice on what 
</p>
<p><b>constitutes detention, the legality requirement and the prohibition of arbitrariness, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>pre- and post-trial detention and during the trial. The deliberation is intended to 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute to a harmonious interpretation of human rights norms and standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>applicable to deprivation of liberty under customary international law. Collaboration 
</b></p>
<p><b>of States and civil society in this context is essential to a successful outcome of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>study.     
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> So that it can report more systematically and comprehensively, the Working 
Group reiterates its proposal to the Human Rights Council to expand the mandate of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Working Group to include the examination of conditions of detention around the 
</b></p>
<p>world and the monitoring of States&#8217; compliance with their obligations concerning all 
</p>
<p><b>human rights of detained and imprisoned persons. The mandates of the African 
</b></p>
<p>Commission&#8217;s <b>Special Rapporteur on Prisons and Conditions of Detention in Africa 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons Deprived of Liberty of the Inter-
</b></p>
<p><b>American Commission on Human Rights might provide some guidance as to what 
</b></p>
<p><b>could be the scope of such an extended mandate.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>In the light of the exceptional nature of the pretrial detention measures, the 
Working Group requests States to ensure that measures alternative to detention and 
</b></p>
<p><b>less restrictive in character are available in domestic legal systems. At the same time, </b></p>


<p><b>it emphasizes that such measures are not compulsory but rather constitute a last 
</b></p>
<p>resort mechanism to restrict one&#8217;s liberty pending trial.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Working Group recommends that States provide for and ensure the right 
to a habeas corpus in their domestic legislation. The Working Group further 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that non-governmental organizations, national institutions and United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations agencies and offices should include relevant information on the action of 
</b></p>
<p><b>habeas corpus in their contributions to the universal periodic review mechanism. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Working Group recommends that States remedy arbitrary detention 
mainly by immediate release and compensation as required by international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights conventions and customary international law, and assist the Working Group in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the follow-up of its Opinions in individual cases. 
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
