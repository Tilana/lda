Noble Energy, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1.  Organization and Nature of Operations
Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble Energy, we or us) is a leading independent energy company engaged
in worldwide crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. Our core operating areas are
onshore US (DJ Basin, Marcellus Shale, Eagle Ford Shale, and Permian Basin), and offshore in
deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Eastern Mediterranean and West Africa.
Note 2.  Basis of Presentation
Presentation   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US (US GAAP) for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by US GAAP for
complete financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
contain all normally recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of our
financial position, results of operations, cash flows and shareholders’ equity for such periods.
Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-period
presentation. Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,
2016.
These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015.
Consolidation   Our consolidated accounts include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-
owned subsidiaries.  In addition, we use the equity method of accounting for investments in
entities that we do not control, but over which we exert significant influence. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Estimates   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP
requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management
evaluates estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other
factors, including the current economic and commodity price environment.
Issuance of Phantom Units On February 1, 2016, we issued cash-settled awards to certain
employees under the Noble Energy, Inc. 1992 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan in lieu of a
portion of restricted stock and stock options. We issued approximately one million awards (so
called phantom units, the nomenclature used in accounting literature), a portion of which are
subject to the achievement of specific performance goals. These phantom units, once vested, are
settled in cash. The phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in the Company. The
phantom unit value is the lesser of the fair market value of a share of common stock of the
Company as of the vesting date or up to four times the fair market value of a share of common
stock of the Company as of the grant date, which was $31.65. The Company recognizes the
value of our cash-settled awards utilizing the liability method as defined under Accounting
Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The fair value of
liability awards is remeasured at each reporting date, based on the fair market value of a share of
common stock of the Company as of the reporting date, through the settlement date with the
change in fair value recognized as compensation expense over that period. As of June 30, 2016,
the fair value remeasurement had a de minimis impact on our consolidated statement of
operations and balance sheet. See Note 7. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02): Leases. The
guidance requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights
and obligations created by leases with terms of more than 12 months. This ASU also requires
disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and
uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard will be effective for annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with earlier application permitted. We are
currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance to determine the effects it will have on our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In the normal course of business, we
enter into capital and operating lease agreements to support our exploration and development
operations and lease assets such as drilling rigs, platforms, storage facilities, field services and
well equipment, pipeline capacity, office space and other assets. We believe the adoption and
implementation of this ASU will likely have a material impact on our balance sheet resulting from
an increase in both assets and liabilities relating to our leasing activities.
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09):
Compensation - Stock Compensation, to reduce complexity and enhance several aspects of
accounting and disclosure for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for
income taxes, award forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well
8
Table of Contents
Noble Energy, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
as classification in the statement of cash flows. The ASU will be effective for annual and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with earlier application permitted. Certain aspects of
this guidance will require retrospective application while other aspects are to be applied
prospectively. We are currently evaluating the effect that the guidance will have on our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13):
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology
in current US GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses. The update is
intended to provide financial statement users with more useful information about expected credit
losses. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019,
with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the guidance will
have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11 (ASU 2015-11):
Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, effective for annual and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. ASU 2015-11 changes the inventory measurement principle for entities
using the first-in, first out (FIFO) or average cost methods. For entities utilizing one of these
methods, the inventory measurement principle will change from lower of cost or market to the
lower of cost and net realizable value. We follow the average cost method and do not believe
adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have a material impact on our financial position and results of
operations.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09),
which creates Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In summary, the core
principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, ASU 2014-09
requires enhanced financial statement disclosures over revenue recognition as part of the new
accounting guidance. The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. In March
2016, the FASB released certain implementation guidance through ASU 2016-08 to clarify
principal versus agent considerations. We are continuing to evaluate the provisions of ASU
2014-09 and have not yet determined the full impact it may have on our financial position and
results of operations. At a minimum, we expect we will be required to change from the
entitlements method used for certain domestic natural gas sales to the sales method of
accounting. We believe the impact of utilizing the sales method of accounting for our current
domestic natural gas sales agreements will be de minimus.
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-07 (ASU 2016-07):
Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, to eliminate retroactive application of equity
method accounting when an investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting as a
result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The ASU will be
effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with earlier
application permitted. We do not believe adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as all current investments are
accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02 (ASU 2015-02):
Consolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes the guidance as to
whether an entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) or a voting interest entity and how related
parties are considered in the VIE model. As of March 31, 2016, we have adopted the provisions
of ASU 2015-02, which did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

Certain of our revenue received from purchasers was historically presented with deductions
for transportation, gathering, fractionation or processing costs. Beginning in 2016, we have
changed our presentation of revenue to no longer include these expenses as deductions from
revenue. These costs are now included within production expense and prior year amounts of
$10 million and $19 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
Amount relates to the termination of a rig contract offshore Falkland Islands as a result of a
supplier's non-performance. See Note 8. Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs and
Undeveloped Leasehold and Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Exploration Program Update.
For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, amount includes $7 million and
$23 million, respectively, of expense due to unutilized firm transportation and shortfalls in
delivering or transporting minimum volumes under certain commitments.

Note 3. Rosetta Merger
On July 20, 2015, Noble Energy completed the merger of Rosetta Resources Inc. (Rosetta) into a
subsidiary of Noble Energy (Rosetta Merger). The results of Rosetta's operations since the
merger date are included in our consolidated statements of operations. The merger was effected
through the issuance of approximately 41 million shares of Noble Energy common stock in
exchange for all outstanding shares of Rosetta common stock using a ratio of 0.542 of a share of
Noble Energy common stock for each share of Rosetta common stock and the assumption of
Rosetta's liabilities, including approximately $2 billion fair value of outstanding debt. The merger
added two new onshore US shale positions to our portfolio including approximately 50,000 net
acres in the Eagle Ford Shale and 54,000 net acres in the Permian Basin (45,000 acres in the
Delaware Basin and 9,000 acres in the Midland Basin). In connection with the Rosetta Merger,
we incurred merger-related costs in 2015 of approximately $81 million, including (i) $66 million of
severance, consulting, investment, advisory, legal and other merger-

related fees, and (ii) $15 million of noncash share-based compensation expense, all of which
were expensed and were included in Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net.
Allocation of Purchase Price The merger has been accounted for as a business combination,
using the acquisition method. The following table represents the final allocation of the total
purchase price of Rosetta to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair
value at the merger date, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of
the identifiable net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.

As of December 31, 2015, our preliminary purchase price allocation reflected goodwill of $163
million based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Rosetta
Merger date. In conducting our goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2015, we
determined that our goodwill balance was no longer recoverable and fully impaired it, resulting
in a goodwill impairment charge in fourth quarter 2015. In second quarter 2016, we finalized
the purchase price allocation and recorded a $25 million gain to Other Operating Expense,

Net driven by adjustments made based on the filing of the final Rosetta federal income tax
return for the period ending on the Rosetta Merger date.
The fair value measurements of derivative instruments assumed were determined based on
published forward commodity price curves as of the date of the merger and represent Level 2
inputs. Derivative instruments in an asset position include a measure of counterparty
nonperformance risk, and the fair values of commodity derivative instruments in a liability position
include a measure of our own nonperformance risk, each based on the current published credit
default swap rates. The fair value measurements of long-term debt were estimated based on
published market prices and represent Level 1 inputs.
The fair value measurements of crude oil and natural gas properties and asset retirement
obligations are based on inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore represent
Level 3 inputs. The fair values of crude oil and natural gas properties and asset retirement
obligations were measured using valuation techniques that convert future cash flows to a single
discounted amount. Significant inputs to the valuation of crude oil and natural gas properties
included estimates of: (i) recoverable reserves; (ii) production rates; (iii) future operating and
development costs; (iv) future commodity prices; and (v) a market-based weighted average cost
of capital. These inputs required significant judgments and estimates by management at the time
of the valuation and were the most sensitive and subject to change.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The results of operations attributable to Rosetta are included in our consolidated statements of
operations beginning on July 21, 2015. Revenues of $127 million and $214 million and pre-tax
net income of $17 million and pre-tax net loss of $14 million were generated from Rosetta assets
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.
Proforma Financial Information The following pro forma condensed combined financial
information was derived from the historical financial statements of Noble Energy and Rosetta and
gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015. The below information reflects
pro forma adjustments based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe
are reasonable, including (i) adjustments to conform Rosetta's historical policy of accounting for
its crude oil and natural gas properties from the full cost method to the successful efforts method
of accounting, (ii) depletion of Rosetta's fair-valued proved crude oil and natural gas properties,
and (iii) the estimated tax impacts of the pro forma adjustments. The pro forma results of
operations do not include any cost savings or other synergies that may result from the Rosetta
Merger or any estimated costs that have been or will be incurred by us to integrate the Rosetta
assets. The pro forma condensed combined financial information has been included for
comparative purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the results that might have actually
occurred had the Rosetta Merger taken place on January 1, 2015; furthermore, the financial
information is not intended to be a projection of future results.

Note 4. Divestitures
Onshore US Properties
During the first six months of 2016, we entered into certain onshore transactions for which we:
closed the divestiture of our Bowdoin property in northern Montana generating proceeds of $43
million and recognized a $23 million loss on sale of assets;
sold other certain onshore US crude oil and natural gas properties, generating net proceeds of
$20 million. Proceeds were primarily applied to the DJ Basin depletable field, with no
recognition of gain or loss;
entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the divestiture of certain producing and
undeveloped crude oil and natural gas interests covering approximately 33,100 producing and
undeveloped net acres in the DJ Basin for $505 million, subject to customary closing
adjustments. We received proceeds of $486 million and expect to receive the remaining
consideration, subject to post-close adjustments, around year-end 2016. Proceeds were
primarily applied to the DJ Basin depletable field, with no recognition of gain or loss; and
executed an acreage exchange agreement to receive approximately 11,700 net acres within our
Wells Ranch development area in exchange for approximately 13,500 net acres primarily from
our Bronco area, located southwest of Wells Ranch. No gain or loss was recognized for the
transaction.
During the first six months of 2015, we sold certain onshore US crude oil and natural gas
properties, generating net proceeds of $151 million. Proceeds were primarily applied to the DJ
Basin depletable field, with no recognition of gain or loss, other than a de minimus gain in
second quarter 2015.
Cyprus Project (Offshore Cyprus) During fourth quarter 2015, we entered into a farm-out
agreement with a partner for a 35% interest in Block 12, which includes the Aphrodite natural gas
discovery, for $171 million. In first quarter 2016, we received proceeds of $131 million related to
the farm-out agreement and expect to receive the remaining consideration of $40 million, subject
to post-close adjustments, in 2017. The proceeds were applied to the Cyprus project asset with
no gain or loss recognized.

Offshore Israel Assets In November 2015, we executed an agreement to divest our 47% interest
in the Alon A and Alon C offshore Israel licenses, which include the Karish and Tanin fields, for a
total transaction value of $73 million. These assets were held for sale as of December 31, 2015,
and the transaction closed in January 2016.
Subsequent Event On July 4, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement to divest a 3% working
interest in the Tamar field, offshore Israel, for $369 million, subject to customary closing
adjustments. Under the terms of the agreement, the purchaser has the option to elect, before
closing, to purchase an additional 1% working interest at the same valuation. The divestiture is
expected to close in the third quarter of 2016, with an effective date of January 1, 2016.
Note 5.  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Objective and Strategies for Using Derivative Instruments   We are exposed to fluctuations in
crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids pricing. In order to mitigate the effect of commodity
price volatility and enhance the predictability of cash flows relating to the marketing of our global
crude oil and domestic natural gas, we enter into crude oil and natural gas price hedging
arrangements.
While these instruments mitigate the cash flow risk of future decreases in commodity prices, they
may also curtail benefits from future increases in commodity prices. See Note 7. Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures for a discussion of methods and assumptions used to estimate
the fair values of our derivative instruments.

Term Loan Agreement and Completed Tender Offers On January 6, 2016, we entered into a term
loan agreement (Term Loan Facility) with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, Mizuho Bank,
Ltd., as syndication agent, and certain other financial institutions party thereto, which provides for
a three-year term loan facility for a principal amount of $1.4 billion. Provisions of the Term Loan
Facility are consistent with those in the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Term
Loan Facility may be prepaid prior to maturity without premium. The Term Loan Facility will
accrue interest, at our option, at either (a) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the rate
announced by Citibank, N.A., as its prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) a
London interbank offered rate plus 1.0%, plus a margin that ranges from 10 basis points to 75
basis points depending upon our credit rating, or (b) a London interbank offered rate, plus a
margin that ranges from 100 basis points to 175 basis points depending upon our credit rating.
The interest rate for our Term Loan Facility is 1.71% as of June 30, 2016.
In connection with the Term Loan Facility, we launched cash tender offers for the 5.875% Senior
Notes due June 1, 2024, 5.875% Senior Notes due June 1, 2022 and 5.625% Senior Notes due
May 1, 2021, all of which were assumed in the Rosetta Merger. The borrowings under the Term
Loan Facility were used solely to fund the tender offers. Approximately $1.38 billion of notes
were validly tendered and accepted by us, with a corresponding amount borrowed under the new
Term Loan Facility. As a result, we recognized a gain of $80 million which is reflected in other
operating (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations.
See Note 7. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures for a discussion of methods and
assumptions used to estimate the fair values of debt.
Note 7.  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our consolidated
balance sheets. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable   The carrying amounts
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature or maturity of the instruments. 
Mutual Fund Investments   Our mutual fund investments consist of various publicly-traded mutual
funds that include investments ranging from equities to money market instruments. The fair
values are based on quoted market prices for identical assets.
Commodity Derivative Instruments   Our commodity derivative instruments may include variable
to fixed price commodity swaps, two-way collars, three-way collars, swaptions and enhanced
swaps. We estimate the fair values of these instruments using published forward commodity
price curves as of the date of the estimate. The discount rate used in the discounted cash flow
projections is based on published LIBOR rates, Eurodollar futures rates and interest swap rates.
The fair values of commodity derivative instruments in an asset position include a measure of
counterparty nonperformance risk, and the fair values of commodity derivative instruments in a
liability position include a measure of our own nonperformance risk, each based on the current
published credit default swap rates. In addition, for collars, we estimate the option values of the
put options sold and the contract floors and ceilings using an option pricing model which takes
into account market volatility, market prices and contract terms. See Note 5. Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. 
Deferred Compensation Liability   The value is dependent upon the fair values of mutual fund
investments and shares of our common stock held in a rabbi trust. See Mutual Fund Investments
above. 
Phantom Units The fair value of phantom unit awards is measured based on the fair market value
of our common stock on the date of grant. We recognize the value of these awards utilizing the
liability method whereby these liability awards are remeasured at each reporting date, based on
the fair market value of a share of common stock of the Company as of the reporting date, through
the settlement date with the change in fair value recognized as compensation expense over that
period. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation.

Level 1 measurements are fair value measurements which use quoted market prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We use Level 1 inputs when
available as Level 1 inputs generally provide the most reliable evidence of fair value.
Level 2 measurements are fair value measurements which use inputs, other than quoted
prices included within Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.
Amount represents the impact of netting provisions within our master agreements that allow us
to net cash settle asset and liability positions with the same counterparty.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The fair value of impaired crude oil and natural gas properties was determined as of the date of
the assessment using a discounted cash flow model based on management’s expectations of
future production prior to abandonment date, commodity prices based on NYMEX WTI, NYMEX
Henry Hub, and Brent futures price curves as of the date of the estimate, estimated operating and
abandonment costs, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. Impairments for the first six months of
2015 were due primarily to increases in asset carrying values associated with increases in
estimated abandonment costs.
Additional Fair Value Disclosures
Debt   The fair value of fixed-rate, public debt is estimated based on the published market prices
for the same or similar issues. As such, we consider the fair value of our public, fixed-rate debt to
be a Level 1 measurement on the fair value hierarchy.
Our Term Loan Facility is variable-rate, non-public debt. The fair value is estimated based on
significant other observable inputs. As such, we consider the fair value of our Term Loan Facility
to be a Level 2 measurement on the fair value hierarchy. See Note 6. Debt.

Undeveloped Leasehold Costs As of June 30, 2016, we had capitalized undeveloped leasehold
costs of $2.1 billion, of which approximately $1.9 billion relates to our core operating areas
onshore US and is included in our proved property impairment testing for these areas. In
addition, we have capitalized undeveloped leasehold of $57 million relating to international
operations, and $195 million relating to deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Significant undeveloped leases are individually assessed for impairment. While none of our
significant undeveloped leases were impaired as of June 30, 2016, if, based upon a change in
exploration plans, availability of capital and suitable rig and drilling equipment, resource
potential, changing regulations and/or other factors, an impairment is indicated, a valuation
allowance will be provided. Costs of individually insignificant leases are combined and
amortized over their lease term. Expense associated with either impairment or amortization of
undeveloped leases is included in exploration expense in our consolidated statement of
operations.
Note 9.  Asset Retirement Obligations

The weighted average number of shares outstanding includes the weighted average shares of
common stock issued in connection with the underwritten public offering of 24.15 million
shares of Noble Energy common stock in first quarter 2015 and issued in connection with the
exchange of approximately 41 million shares for all outstanding shares of Rosetta common
stock on July 20, 2015.
For all periods, all outstanding options and non-vested restricted shares have been excluded
from the calculation of diluted loss per share as Noble Energy incurred a net loss. Therefore,
inclusion of outstanding options and non-vested restricted shares in the calculation of diluted
loss per share would be anti-dilutive.

Accumulated Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries As of December 31, 2015, we no
longer consider our foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings to be indefinitely reinvested
outside the United States and, accordingly, recorded additional deferred income taxes, net of
estimated foreign tax credits.
Effective Tax Rate (ETR) Our ETR for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016,
varied as compared with three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily as a result
of a tax benefit. This is primarily due to a higher income tax benefit as compared with the change
in the components of the overall net loss from period to period, which is impacted by certain
income items with different tax rates.
Also, during 2016, the change in our permanent reinvestment assumption, noted above, resulted
in additional deferred income tax expense (net of estimated foreign tax credits) being recorded on
certain income items, including income from equity method investees and increased earnings in
our foreign jurisdictions with rates that vary from the US statutory rate. This additional deferred
income tax expense had the result of offsetting our income tax benefit to a greater extent in the
three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 thereby driving the ETR lower than it would
have been if additional deferred taxes had not been recorded.
In our major tax jurisdictions, the earliest years remaining open to examination are as follows: US
– 2012, Equatorial Guinea – 2011 and Israel – 2011.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 13.  Commitments and Contingencies  
CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation In accordance with our Marcellus Shale joint venture
arrangement with a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy Inc. (CONSOL), we agreed to fund one-third
of CONSOL's 50% working interest share of future drilling and completion costs, capped at $400
million each year (CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation). The remaining obligation totaled
approximately $1.6 billion at June 30, 2016.
The CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation is suspended if average Henry Hub natural gas prices fall
and remain below $4.00 per MMBtu in any three consecutive month period and remain
suspended until average Henry Hub natural gas prices equal or exceed $4.00 per MMBtu for
three consecutive months. The funding has been suspended since November 2014 due to lower
natural gas prices. Based on the June 30, 2016 NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price curve, we
expect that the CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation will be suspended for the next 12 months.
Delivery and Firm Transportation Commitments We have commitments to deliver approximately
422 Bcf of natural gas produced onshore US (primarily in the Marcellus Shale) under long-term
sales contracts and have also entered into various long-term gathering, processing and
transportation contracts for approximately 287 MMBbls of crude oil and nearly 7.7 Tcf of natural
gas for certain of our onshore US production (primarily in the Marcellus Shale, DJ Basin and
Eagle Ford Shale).
We enter into long-term contracts to provide production flow assurance in over-supplied basins
and/or areas with limited infrastructure. This strategy provides for optimization of transportation
and processing costs. As properties are undergoing development activities, we may experience
temporary delivery or transportation shortfalls until production volumes grow to meet or exceed
the minimum volume commitments. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we
incurred expense of approximately $7 million and $23 million, respectively, related to
deficiencies and/or unutilized commitments. We expect to continue to incur deficiency and/or
unutilized costs in the near-term as development activities continue. Should commodity prices
continue to decline or if we are unable to continue to develop our properties as planned, or
certain wells become uneconomic and are shut-in, we could incur additional shortfalls in
delivering or transporting the minimum volumes and we could be required to make payments in
the event that these commitments are not otherwise offset.
Legal Proceedings  We are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of
business.  These proceedings are subject to the uncertainties inherent in any litigation.  We are
defending ourselves vigorously in all such matters and we believe that the ultimate disposition of
such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
Colorado Air Matter In April 2015, we entered into a joint consent decree (Consent Decree) with
the US Environmental Protection Agency, US Department of Justice, and State of Colorado to
improve emission control systems at a number of our condensate storage tanks that are part of
our upstream crude oil and natural gas operations within the Non-Attainment Area of the DJ
Basin. The Consent Decree was entered by the Court on June 2, 2015.   
The Consent Decree, which alleges violations of the Colorado Air Pollution Prevention and
Control Act and Colorado’s federal approved State Implementation Plan, specifically Colorado
Air Quality Control Commission Regulation Number 7, requires us to perform certain injunctive
relief activities to complete mitigation projects and supplemental environmental projects (SEP),
and pay a civil penalty. Costs associated with the settlement consist of $4.95 million in civil
penalties which were paid in 2015. Mitigation costs of $4.5 million and SEP costs of $4 million
are being expended in accordance with schedules established in the Consent Decree. Costs
associated with the injunctive relief are not yet precisely quantifiable as they will be determined
in accordance with the outcome of evaluations on the adequate design, operation, and
maintenance of certain aspects of tank systems to handle potential peak instantaneous vapor
flow rates between now and mid-2017.
Compliance with the Consent Decree could result in the temporary shut in or permanent plugging
and abandonment of certain wells and associated tank batteries. The Consent Decree sets forth
a detailed compliance schedule with deadlines for achievement of milestones through early
2019. The Consent Decree contains additional obligations for ongoing inspection and monitoring
beyond that which is required under existing Colorado regulations.  Inspection and monitoring
findings may influence decisions to temporarily shut in or permanently plug and abandon wells
and associated tank batteries.     
We have concluded that the penalties, injunctive relief, and mitigation expenditures that resulted
from this settlement did not have, and based on currently available information will not have, a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Colorado Air Compliance Order on Consent  In December 2015, we received a proposed
Compliance Order on Consent (COC) from the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment's Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) to resolve allegations of noncompliance
associated with certain engines subject to various General Permit 02 conditions and/or individual
permit conditions as well as certain emission control devices subject to various individual permit
conditions that applied to assets currently owned and operated by both Noble Energy, Inc. and
Noble Midstream Services, LLC.  In May, 2016, Noble Energy, Inc. on behalf of itself and its
wholly owned subsidiary Noble Midstream Services, LLC, on behalf of itself and its wholly
owned subsidiary Colorado River DevCo LP, reached a final resolution with the APCD, which
requires completion of compliance testing, modification of certain permits, payment of a civil
penalty of $44,695, and an expenditure of no less than $178,780 on an approved SEP. This
resolution is not believed to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Item 2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(MD&A) is intended to provide a narrative about our business from the perspective of our
management. We use common industry terms, such as thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day
(MBoe/d) and million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), to discuss production and sales
volumes. Our MD&A is presented in the following major sections:
•Executive Overview;
•Operating Outlook;
•Results of Operations; and
•Liquidity and Capital Resources.
 
The preceding consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, contain detailed
information that should be read in conjunction with our MD&A.
 
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
We are a globally diversified explorer and producer of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids (NGLs). We aim to achieve sustainable growth in value and cash flow through the
development of a high-quality and diverse, worldwide portfolio of assets with investment
•
•
flexibility between onshore unconventional developments and offshore exploration leading to
major development projects. Our portfolio is further diversified through US and international
projects and production mix among crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Our core operating areas
include onshore US, primarily the DJ Basin, Marcellus Shale, Eagle Ford Shale and Permian
Basin; offshore US Gulf of Mexico; West Africa; and Eastern Mediterranean. In these areas we
believe we have a strategic competitive advantage and will generate attractive returns throughout
oil and gas business cycles.
Our portfolio is further complimented through the pursuit of certain exploration opportunities as
we seek to establish potential new core areas, such as Suriname and Gabon. We may conclude
that an exploration area is not commercially viable and, therefore, may exit locations, such as we
did in 2015 with Nevada, Sierra Leone and Nicaragua.
The following discussion highlights significant operating and financial results for second quarter
2016. This discussion includes operating results associated with our Rosetta Merger, which
closed in third quarter of 2015, and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which includes disclosures regarding our
critical accounting policies as part of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”
Second Quarter 2016 Significant Operating Highlights Included:
continued cost reduction efforts in capital, lease operating expense and general and
administrative areas, with sustained efforts to further optimize operational performance in the
current commodity price environment (see Cost Reduction Efforts, below);
averaged record quarterly total sales volumes of 427 MBoe/d, net, including a record 282

Impact of Current Commodity Prices on our Business 
The upstream oil and gas business is cyclical and we are currently operating in a period of low
commodity prices. Commodity prices began declining sharply during fourth quarter 2014 and
continued to decline throughout 2015. Thus far in 2016, crude oil and natural gas prices have
remained volatile ranging from below $30 per barrel to above $50 per barrel and less than $2 per
MMBtu to near $3 per MMBtu. Current commodity prices continue to negatively impact our
revenues, profitability, and cash flows. In response to the commodity price environment, we have
taken a disciplined approach to our 2016 capital program by focusing on long-term value
creation, optimizing allocation of capital and driving operational and cost efficiencies across our
asset portfolio. Our current 2016 capital spending program accommodates an investment level of
less than $1.5 billion, approximately 50% lower than 2015 and approximately 70% lower than
2014. See Operating Outlook – 2016 Capital Investment Program, below.
Positioning for the Future 
We have taken steps to sustain our business in the current volatile and low commodity price
environment. We have adopted a comprehensive effort to maintain strong liquidity and balance
sheet, manage our capital investment and asset portfolio and maximize operational returns,
particularly through use of existing infrastructure. Our 2016 capital program is focused in areas of
highest returns at current prices and is complimented by proceeds from asset monetizations. In
addition, we adjusted the quarterly dividend to 10 cents per common share beginning in first
quarter 2016, representing a reduction of 8 cents, or 44%, from 2015 quarterly dividend
levels. We also engaged in debt refinancing activities in first quarter 2016 by tendering for certain
outstanding notes and refinanced with a lower cost three year loan (1.71% as of June 30, 2016).
In late 2015, we also extended our Credit Facility maturity date from 2018 to 2020.
We believe we have positioned the Company for sustainability, improved operational efficiency,
and long-term success throughout the oil and gas business cycle. However, if the industry
downturn continues for an extended period, or becomes more severe, we could experience
additional material negative impacts on our revenues, profitability, cash flows, liquidity and
proved reserves, and in response, we may consider additional reductions in our capital program
or dividends, and further asset sales and/or additional organizational changes. Our production
and our stock price could decline further as a result of these potential developments.
Cost Reduction Efforts
We continue to focus on maintaining a strong safety culture, driving operational efficiencies,
increasing productivity and leveraging the current commodity price environment to reduce our
cost structure. Cost reduction initiatives, including operational enhancements, reduction of
overhead costs and new pricing arrangements with suppliers, have resulted in total lease
operating expense decreases of 8% and 2% from second quarter 2015 and first half 2015,
respectively. Total general and administrative expense remained relatively flat as compared to
the same periods. These cost measurements are especially meaningful given the increase in our
sales volumes by 128 MBoe/d and 113 MBoe/d as compared to the same periods in prior year. In
addition, we have continued to leverage our expertise in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale and
have begun to realize operational synergies positively impacting costs and performance
associated with our recently acquired Texas assets.
Our onshore and global portfolio provides significant optionality, allowing us to reduce our capital
spending by nearly 60% for the first half of 2016, as compared to the same period of 2015. As the
majority of our onshore US assets are held by production, the investment flexibility of our portfolio
allows us to invest at levels appropriate to the commodity price environment.

Sales Volumes
On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, or BOE, total sales volumes were 43% higher for second
quarter 2016 as compared with second quarter 2015, and our mix of sales volumes was 44%
global liquids, 36% US natural gas and 20% international natural gas. On a BOE basis and
excluding the impact of the Rosetta Merger, total sales volumes were 18% higher for second
quarter 2016 as compared with second quarter 2015, and our mix of sales volumes was 40%
global liquids, 36% US natural gas and 24% international natural gas. See Results of Operations
– Revenues, below.
Commodity Price Changes
Crude oil prices are driven by global crude oil supply and demand factors. During 2014, crude oil
became oversupplied as production from non-OPEC producers increased, primarily driven by US
crude oil production growth from tight formations and the de-bottlenecking of transportation
infrastructure, while global crude oil demand growth was curtailed by lower global economic
growth, especially in Europe, coupled with slower growth in China.
The outlook for crude oil prices for the remainder of 2016 and beyond depends primarily on
supply and demand dynamics and geopolitical and security concerns in crude oil-producing
nations. In June 2016, OPEC and other major oil producers reconvened to discuss efforts to
reduce the oversupply and attempt to re-balance the market, but again failed to reach an
agreement to limit crude oil production. On the demand side, recent projections have reduced
anticipated global crude oil demand growth for 2016 and Chinese economic indicators have
•
•
•
•
weakened, which continue to exacerbate the current oversupply position, resulting in a softer
commodity price environment.
Longer term, we expect supply and demand to re-balance. If prices remain at lower levels, we
expect producers will reduce investment which will, over time, reduce production and stored
inventory levels, helping to balance supply and demand in the crude oil market.
We plan for commodity price cyclicality in our business and believe we are well positioned to
withstand current and future commodity price volatility due to the following:
we have a high-quality, globally diversified portfolio of assets, the majority of which are held by
production and provide investment flexibility;
we have achieved substantial cost reductions impacting both operating expenses and capital
expenditures, including a significantly reduced capital investment program which allows us to
respond to changing commodity price conditions in 2016, thereby positively impacting operating
cash flows;
we have hedged a portion of our domestic natural gas and global liquids sales volumes and are
partially hedged for 2017;
•we have a strong balance sheet with a ratio of debt-to-book capital of 45% at June 30, 2016; and
we have robust liquidity of approximately $5.3 billion at June 30, 2016 and ability to access
capital markets.
Major Development Project Updates
We continue to advance our major development projects, which we expect to deliver incremental
production over the next several years. Updates on major development projects are as follows:
Sanctioned Ongoing Development Projects
A "sanctioned" development project is one for which a final investment decision has been made.
DJ Basin (Onshore US)   During the quarter, we operated two drilling rigs, drilled 26 wells and
commenced production on 25 wells. We continued to improve and enhance our completion
designs, including utilizing extended-reach laterals with monobore drilling, slickwater completion
fluid, and enhanced proppant loading, and were able to deliver production at lower capital and
lease operating expense costs than second quarter of 2015. We also entered into certain
strategic transactions during the quarter including an agreement for $505 million to divest
approximately 33,100 producing and undeveloped net acres in the Greeley Crescent area of
Weld County, Colorado, representing approximately 8% of our total DJ Basin acreage. In
addition, we executed an acreage exchange agreement to receive approximately 11,700 net
acres within our Wells Ranch development area in exchange for approximately 13,500 net acres
primarily from our Bronco area, located southwest of Wells Ranch. Both of these transactions
allow for asset value acceleration and are part of our ongoing portfolio management efforts.
Marcellus Shale (Onshore US)   Currently, we have no operated or non-operated rigs running in
the Marcellus Shale. For 2016, we and CONSOL have agreed to operate within cash flow and
have agreed to a plan which will focus on well completions. As such, our allocated capital to be
invested in the Marcellus Shale will be limited to the completion of certain previously-drilled wells
primarily located in non-operated dry gas areas. During the quarter, our joint venture partner
commenced production on 17 wells.
Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin (Onshore US) In the Eagle Ford Shale, we had no
operated drilling rigs running in the quarter; however, we commenced production on seven wells.
In the Permian Basin, we operated one drilling rig and drilled one
27
Table of Contents
horizontal well during the quarter. We also commenced production from one well in this basin.
We have continued improving our completion designs and are applying best practices from our
other onshore US operations, including utilizing slickwater as a completion fluid and testing
varying well spacing, lateral lengths and proppant quantities.
Gunflint (Deepwater Gulf of Mexico) Gunflint (31% operated working interest) was a 2008 crude
oil discovery, utilizing a two-well subsea tieback to the third-party owned Gulfstar One facility.
Production commenced in July 2016.
Operatorship of the Thunder Hawk Production Facility  Production from our Big Bend and
Dantzler fields (54% and 45% operated working interests, respectively) flows to and is processed
by the Thunder Hawk facility. We are in the process of assuming operatorship and are targeting
transition by late third quarter 2016.
Alba Field (Offshore Equatorial Guinea) The Alba B3 compression platform was successfully
installed in first quarter 2016. Additionally in July 2016, hook-up and commissioning activities
were completed and first production commenced. The successful completion of this project
extends the resource recovery life and slows the natural decline of this field.
Tamar Southwest We continue to work with the Government of Israel to obtain regulatory
approval of our development plan, which is intended to utilize current Tamar infrastructure. The
Government of Israel agreed, following a recommendation of the Supreme Court, to enter into
mediation discussions that may resolve the dispute relating to the possible unitization of the Eran
license, which is adjacent to the Tamar Southwest field. Timely development of Tamar
Southwest will help to reinforce the reliability for our Tamar project and support increased
demand.
Unsanctioned Development Projects
Leviathan Project (Offshore Israel)   The marketing and development of natural gas is intended to
serve both domestic demand and regional export. We are actively engaged in natural gas
marketing activities and executed our second natural gas sales and purchase agreement in mid-
2016. Our Plan of Development was approved by the Government of Israel during second quarter
2016 and we and our partners are beginning to perform front-end engineering design (FEED)
studies necessary to progress the project to final investment decision. Timing of project sanction
depends on numerous factors, including completion of necessary marketing activities,
engineering and construction planning and availability of funds from us and our partners to invest
in the project. See Update on Israel Natural Gas Regulatory Framework, below.
Tamar Expansion Project (Offshore Israel) We have begun the planning phase for an expansion
project which would expand Tamar field deliverability to approximately 2.1 Bcf/d, a quantity that
would allow for regional export. Expansion would include a third flow line component and
additional producing wells. Timing of project sanction will be dependent upon progression of
marketing efforts of these resources. See Update on Israel Natural Gas Regulatory Framework,
below.
Cyprus Project (Offshore Cyprus)  During fourth quarter 2015, we entered into a farm-out
agreement with a partner for a 35% interest in Block 12, which includes the Aphrodite natural gas
discovery, for $171 million. In first quarter 2016, we received proceeds of $131 million related to
the farm-out agreement and expect to receive the remaining consideration of $40 million, subject
to post-close adjustments, in 2017. The proceeds were applied to the Cyprus project asset with
no gain or loss recognized. We will continue to operate with a 35% interest. As part of the farm-
out process, we negotiated a waiver of our remaining exploration well obligation.
During 2015, we submitted a Declaration of Commerciality and in second quarter 2016, we
submitted an updated Development Plan to the Government of Cyprus. We continue to work with
the Government of Cyprus to obtain approval of the development plan and the issuance of an
Exploitation License for the Aphrodite field. Receiving an Exploitation License, in conjunction
with securing markets for Aphrodite gas, will allow us and our partners to perform the necessary
FEED studies and progress the project to final investment decision. In preparation for FEED, we
and our partners are currently performing preliminary engineering and design (pre-FEED) for the
potential development of Aphrodite field that, as currently planned, would deliver natural gas to
potential customers in Cyprus and Egypt.
See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 8. Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs and Undeveloped
Leasehold.
Exploration Program Update
Our 2016 exploration budget has been substantially reduced compared to prior years, but
provides flexibility to respond to commodity price changes. While we are conducting limited
exploratory activities in the current year, our core areas provide for exploration opportunities and
we have increased our evaluation of new venture opportunities in both US and international
locations.
We do not always encounter hydrocarbons through our drilling activities. In addition, we may find
hydrocarbons but subsequently reach a decision, through additional analysis or appraisal
drilling, that a development project is not economically or operationally viable. In the event we
conclude that one of our exploratory wells did not encounter hydrocarbons or that a discovery is
not economically or operationally viable, the associated capitalized exploratory well costs would
be recorded as dry hole expense.
28
Table of Contents
Additionally, we may not be able to conduct exploration activities prior to lease expirations. As a
result, in a future period, dry hole cost and/or leasehold abandonment expense could be
significant. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 8. Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs and
Undeveloped Leasehold and Operating Outlook – Potential for Future Impairment, Dry Hole or
Lease Abandonment Expense, below.
Updates on significant exploration activities are as follows:
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico In first quarter 2016, drilling operations were completed at our
Silvergate exploration well. The well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons and was
plugged and abandoned, resulting in dry hole expense of $91 million in first half 2016. In second
quarter 2016, we spud our Katmai 2 appraisal well (38% operated working interest), located in
Green Canyon 39, and encountered high pressure in the untested fault block. In response, we
temporarily abandoned the well and are assessing plans to complete appraisal. As of June 30,
2016, we have capitalized approximately $35 million of costs associated with our Katmai 2
appraisal well.
Offshore West Africa We are interpreting and evaluating recently acquired 3D seismic data
across Equatorial Guinea Blocks I and O which will aid in advancing exploration and
development opportunities, including the Diega/Carmen and Carla discoveries.
Offshore Cameroon  We have an interest in approximately 167,800 gross undeveloped acres
offshore Cameroon in our YoYo mining concession (50% operating working interest). Petronas
Carigali Overseas Sdn. Bhd. (PETRONAS) holds the other 50% operating working interest and
has given notice to us and the Cameroon government of their intention to exit this acreage
position. Once the assignment process is finalized, we will hold 100% operating working interest
in the YoYo mining concession. We have begun efforts to market this additional working interest.
The YoYo-1 exploratory well was drilled in 2007, discovering natural gas and condensate. We
are working with the government of Cameroon to evaluate natural gas development options and
are negotiating with the Cameroon government to convert the YoYo mining concession to a
production sharing contract. We have completed the reprocessing of 3D seismic data over our
YoYo mining concession and are currently evaluating the results. We provided notice in April
2016 to the Cameroon government of our intention to exit our acreage position in the Tilapia
block (46.67% operating working interest). In July 2016, we relinquished our acreage position to
the Cameroon government which covered an area of approximately 900,000 gross acres. We
continue to work with the Cameroon government to finalize our exit.
Offshore Eastern Mediterranean In July 2016, the Petroleum Commissioner of Israel deemed our
Dolphin 1 (39.66% operated working interest) 2011 natural gas discovery to be non-commercial.
As a result, we recorded exploration expense of $27 million in second quarter 2016 due to the
expiration of our exploration license. For other offshore Eastern Mediterranean updates, see
Update on Israel Natural Gas Regulatory Framework, below.
Offshore Falkland Islands In 2015, we experienced material operational issues with a drilling rig
while drilling the Humpback well. The same drilling rig was scheduled to drill another prospect
but due to significant safety and operational concerns, the drilling contract was terminated in first
quarter 2016. We have been and will continue to work closely with our partners and the Falkland
Islands Government to evaluate a path forward that includes retaining flexibility for any possible
prospects. In the first half of 2016, we expensed $47 million of capitalized rig costs relating to pre-
drill activities. These costs are reflected in Other Operating Expense, Net in the consolidated
statements of operations.
Offshore Suriname  The initial phase of exploration on Block 54 (non-operated 20% working
interest) requires acquisition of a 3D seismic survey, which has been completed and is currently
being processed.  Evaluation of the seismic survey will determine if a commitment to a
subsequent exploration phase to drill an exploration well is warranted.
Offshore Gabon We are the operator of Block F15 (60% working interest), an undeveloped, deep
water area. Our exploration commitment includes a 3D seismic obligation which was acquired
during second quarter 2016 and is currently being processed. Final product delivery is
anticipated early 2017.
Update on Israel Natural Gas Regulatory Framework
The Natural Gas Framework (Framework), as adopted by the Government of Israel, provides
clarity on numerous matters concerning resource development, including certain fiscal, antitrust
and other regulatory matters, which we will rely upon to support a final investment decision and
upon which we can develop these resources while ensuring economic benefits to the state of
Israel and its citizens. The Framework provides for the reduction of our ownership interest in
Tamar to 25% within six years, while enabling the marketing of Leviathan natural gas to Israeli
customers. The development of Leviathan will substantially expand our capacity to deliver
natural gas to Israel and the region, as well as provide a second source of domestic natural gas
supply and redundancy of infrastructure.
In second quarter 2016, the Government of Israel adopted a new economic stability clause which
does not prevent possible adverse legislation but instead provides for project economic stability
in the event of certain future adverse actions. While it is
29
Table of Contents
•
•
possible that adoption of the new stability clause could be challenged in the Israeli Supreme
Court, we believe this new clause addresses concerns raised by the Court in its March 2016
ruling and is consistent with that ruling.
Pending Master Limited Partnership
On October 22, 2015, Noble Midstream Partners LP (Noble Midstream), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Noble Energy, filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to a proposed master limited partnership. On July 22,
2016, Noble Midstream filed an amendment to the Form S-1. Under the proposed structure,
Noble Midstream will own, operate and develop certain of our DJ Basin crude oil, natural gas
and water-related midstream infrastructure and will develop crude oil and produced water
midstream infrastructure in the Delaware Basin of the Permian Basin. Noble Energy will own the
general partner of Noble Midstream and will retain a majority of limited partnership interests in
the proposed master limited partnership. As of the date of this report, the registration statement is
not effective. The completion of the proposed offering is subject to numerous considerations,
including capital market conditions, and we can provide no assurance that it will be successfully
completed.
Divestiture and Acreage Exchange Activities
We actively manage our asset portfolio and periodically divest assets. During first half 2016, we:
entered into an agreement to divest certain producing and undeveloped crude oil and natural
gas interests in the DJ Basin for $505 million, receiving partial proceeds of $486 million;
•executed an acreage exchange to further enhance our Wells Ranch position in the DJ Basin;
entered into an agreement on July 4, 2016 for the divestiture of 3% working interest in the Tamar
field for $369 million, partially fulfilling our commitment required by the Framework; Under the
terms of the agreement, the purchaser has the option to elect, before closing, to purchase an
additional 1% working interest at the same valuation;
closed the sale of certain smaller onshore US property packages resulting in net proceeds of
$63 million;
closed the divestiture of our interest in the Karish and Tanin fields for $73 million in first quarter
2016; and
closed our farm-out of 35% interest in the Aphrodite field having received partial payment of
$131 million in first quarter 2016.
Proceeds from divestitures allow us to allocate capital and other resources to potentially higher-
value and higher-growth areas and enhances our balance sheet strength. We will continue to
evaluate divestment opportunities of other assets within our portfolio.
See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4. Divestitures and Operating Outlook - Potential for
Future Impairment, Dry Hole or Lease Abandonment Expense, below.
Update on Regulations
US Offshore Regulatory Developments On April 14, 2016, the Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) adopted a final rule establishing updated standards for
blowout prevention systems and other well controls for offshore oil and gas activities conducted
in US federal waters, including the Gulf of Mexico. Although the final rule incorporates some of
the changes recommended by the oil and gas industry, it imposes a number of new requirements
relating to well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time well monitoring and subsea
containment. For example, the new rule requires double sets of shear rams on all deepwater
blowout preventers (BOPs), periodic inspections of BOPs and outside audits of equipment, and
real-time well monitoring requirements. The new rule will likely increase the costs associated
with well design, drilling and completion operations, as well as ongoing monitoring costs for our
•
•
•
wells in the Gulf of Mexico. The final rule went into effect on July 28, 2016.
On March 17, 2016, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) proposed a new air
quality monitoring rule that would significantly broaden the scope of air emissions that operators
in US federal waters, including the Gulf of Mexico, must measure, monitor and control. Among
other items, the proposed rule would expand the types of emissions that must be measured,
require operators to measure emissions more frequently, and increase the scope of facilities that
must be monitored. If adopted as proposed, the new rule would likely increase the cost
associated with our activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The comment period for the proposed rule
expired June 20, 2016.
On July 14, 2016, the BOEM issued an updated Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL)
providing details on revised procedures the agency will be using to determine a lessee’s ability
to carry out decommissioning obligations for activities on the Outer Continental Shelf, including
the Gulf of Mexico. This revised policy becomes effective September 12, 2016 and will institute
new criteria by which the BOEM will evaluate the financial strength and reliability of lessees and
operators active on the Outer Continental Shelf. If the BOEM determines under the revised policy
that a company does not have the financial ability to meet its decommissioning and other
obligations, the company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance. We
are currently evaluating the policy changes and the impact they may have on our operations in
the Gulf of Mexico. Compliance with the revised policy could increase the costs associated with
our activities in the Gulf of Mexico.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is proposing to expand the
boundaries of the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Mexico. NOAA
released its draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) on the proposed expansion in June
2016, in which it proposed five alternatives for expanding existing sanctuary regulations to new
geographic areas. Two of these alternatives for sanctuary expansion have the potential to impact
certain of our leases which could increase drilling, operating and decommissioning costs. Public
comments to the DEIS are due August 19, 2016 and we are currently evaluating the expansion
alternatives as outlined in the DEIS and any potential impact on our operations in the Gulf of
Mexico.
Colorado Crude Oil and Natural Gas Regulation In 2014, by executive order, Colorado Governor
Hickenlooper created a 21-member Oil and Gas Task Force (Task Force) made up of
representatives of local governments, civic entities, environmental organizations and industry for
the purpose of making recommendations regarding oil and gas development in communities.
After 18 months, the Task Force, which included a representative from Noble Energy, concluded
its activities on February 27, 2015. Nine recommendations were sent to the governor, seven of
which were unanimously supported by members of the Task Force. All nine recommendations
have been adopted by legislation or regulation and the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation
Commission completed work on new rules which govern the siting of large oil and gas
operations in urban areas and require greater coordination of drilling operations with local
governments. These new rules took effect in March 2016 and there is strong public support for
them to be implemented.
Earlier in 2016, the State of Colorado approved for signature gathering four ballot measures
which would impact oil and gas operations. Measure 40, which would grant local communities
self-governance and the opportunity to ban certain businesses from operating in their
jurisdictions, has been withdrawn. Measure 63 would establish a constitutional right to a healthy
environment and provide local governments the obligation to protect the environment. Measure
75 would grant local governments control over oil and gas development, notwithstanding state
law. Measure 78 would require that all new oil and gas facilities be located 2,500 feet from
occupied structures and an expansive list of landscape features called "areas of special
concern." If implemented, Measure 78 in particular would significantly and adversely impact
future oil and gas operations and has strong opposition from the oil and gas industry, the
governor, the broad business community and other stakeholder groups.
Measures 63, 75 and 78 are currently in the signature gathering phase and the proponents have
until August 8, 2016 to gather 98,492 valid signatures to qualify for the November 2016 ballot. If
balloted and approved in the November 2016 election, these measures would limit oil and gas
operations, require greater distances between oil and gas facilities and occupied structures, and
would otherwise limit the production and development of crude oil and natural gas in the state.
The adoption of these measures would result in significantly limiting or even potentially
preventing the future development of crude oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct
operations. In addition, we may incur additional costs to comply with any such requirements or
may experience delays and/or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration,
development, or production activities. Furthermore, our drilling activities could possibly be limited
or hindered and the amounts that we are ultimately able to produce from our undeveloped
reserves could be adversely affected. Such compliance costs and delays, curtailments,
limitations, or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could result in a material impairment of
these assets.
We continue to monitor proposed and new regulations and legislation in all our operating
jurisdictions to assess the potential impact on our company. Concurrently, we are engaged in
extensive public education and outreach efforts with the goal of engaging and educating the
general public and communities about the economic and environmental benefits of safe and
responsible crude oil and natural gas development.
Impact of Dodd-Frank Act Section 1504  On June 27, 2016, the SEC adopted resource extraction
issuer payment disclosure rules under Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act that will require
resource extraction companies, such as us, to publicly file with the SEC information about the
type and total amount of payments made to a foreign government, including subnational
governments (such as states and/or counties), or the U.S. federal government for each project
related to the commercial development of crude oil, natural gas or minerals, and the type and
total amount of payments made to each government. Reporting and disclosure will be required
annually beginning with the 2018 fiscal year.

OPERATING OUTLOOK
2016 Production   We have adopted a comprehensive effort to manage the Company's balance
sheet and position ourselves for future growth. While we seek to enhance operational efficiencies
and maximize our return on employed capital, our total crude oil, natural gas and NGL production
•
•
•
•
•
•
for 2016 may not grow at a rate consistent with prior years and potentially could decline.
Production may be impacted by factors including:
commodity prices which, if subject to further decline, could result in certain current production
becoming uneconomic;
overall level and timing of capital expenditures which, as discussed below and dependent upon
our drilling success, will impact near-term production volumes;
Israeli industrial and residential demand for electricity, which is largely impacted by weather
conditions and conversion of the Israeli electricity portfolio from coal to natural gas;
•timing of crude oil and condensate liftings impacting sales volumes in West Africa;
natural field decline in the onshore US, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and offshore Equatorial
Guinea;
potential weather-related volume curtailments due to hurricanes in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico, or winter storms and flooding impacting onshore US operations;
reliability of support equipment and facilities, pipeline disruptions, and/or potential pipeline and
processing facility capacity constraints which may cause restrictions or interruptions in
production and/or mid-stream processing;
•malfunctions and/or mechanical failures at terminals or other onshore US delivery points;
•impact of enhanced completion efforts for onshore US assets;
•potential shut-in of US producing properties if storage capacity becomes unavailable;
•potential drilling and/or completion permit delays due to future regulatory changes; and
•potential purchases of producing properties or divestments of operating assets.
2016 Capital Investment Program Given the current commodity price environment, we have
designed a substantially reduced and flexible capital investment program that is part of our
comprehensive effort to manage our balance sheet while preserving and building value. Our
current 2016 capital investment program accommodates an investment level of less than $1.5
billion, or approximately 50% lower than our 2015 program. Allocation of capital within our
program is primarily focused in areas of best returns and where we are able to maximize use of
existing infrastructure. In this regard, our program allocates two-thirds of total investment to core
onshore US assets and the remaining one-third to offshore development and exploration.
See Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities.
Potential for Future Dry Hole Cost, Lease Abandonment Expense or Property Impairments
Exploration Activities Our exploratory drilling program seeks to provide long-term growth from
existing and potential new core areas. In the event we conclude that an exploratory well did not
encounter hydrocarbons or that a discovery is not economically or operationally viable, the
associated capitalized exploratory well costs would be charged to expense. For example, in the
first half of 2016, we recorded total dry hole costs of $114 million primarily associated with our
Silvergate exploratory well in Gulf of Mexico and our Dolphin 1 discovery offshore Israel. The
Silvergate well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons and was plugged and abandoned,
and our Dolphin 1 discovery was ruled by the Petroleum Commissioner of Israel to be non-
commercial. We recorded $27 million of exploration expense following expiration of the
exploration license. See Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 8. Capitalized Exploratory Well
Costs and Undeveloped Leasehold.
Additionally, we may not conduct exploration activities prior to lease expirations. For example, in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we continue to mature our prospect portfolio. However, regulations
have become more stringent due to the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010. In some instances,
specifically engineered blowout preventers, rigs, and completion equipment may be required for
high pressure environments. Regulatory requirements or lack of readily available equipment
could prevent us from engaging in future exploration activities during our current lease terms. In
addition, the current commodity price environment may render certain prospects economically
less attractive and we may not conduct exploration activities before lease expiration.
We currently have capitalized undeveloped leasehold cost of approximately $195 million related
to deepwater Gulf of Mexico prospects that have not yet been drilled. These leases will expire
over the years 2016 - 2024. Certain of these leases are individually significant and are separately
assessed for impairment. Costs of individually insignificant leases are combined and amortized
over their lease term. While none of our significant undeveloped leases were impaired as of
June 30, 2016, changes in exploration plans, availability of capital and suitable rig and drilling
equipment, insufficient resource potential, changing regulations and/or other factors, could result
in future impairment. Moreover, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, some leases may become
impaired for other reasons such as production not being established, foregoing actions to extend
the terms of the leases, and/or leases becoming uneconomic due to low commodity prices or the
rising costs of complying with new regulations.

As a result of our exploration activities, future exploration expense, including leasehold expense,
could be significant. See Results of Operations - Oil and Gas Exploration Expense, below. See
also Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Producing Properties In 2016, leading commodity indices, including WTI, Brent and HH continue
to trade lower than prior years and remain volatile. A further decline in future crude oil, natural
gas or NGL prices could result in some of our properties becoming uneconomic, resulting in
additional impairment charges, decrease in proved reserves and/or shut-in of currently producing
wells.
In second quarter 2016, we assessed proved properties for possible impairment due to current
commodity prices. While the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our properties,
including certain of our offshore assets, did not indicate an impairment at June 30, 2016, certain
properties may become impaired if, for example, commodity prices decline further, operating or
development costs increase, or estimated proved reserves are revised downward.
In addition, in certain onshore US areas, transportation bottlenecks caused by oversupply and/or
lack of infrastructure can reduce the amount of production reaching higher priced out-of-basin
locations, resulting in less favorable basis differentials, or differences between WTI and HH
pricing and the average prices we actually receive. A worsening of these basis differentials could
also reduce cash flows and result in property impairment charges.
The cash flow model that we use to assess proved properties for impairment includes numerous
assumptions, such as management’s estimates of future crude oil and natural gas production
along with operating and development costs, market outlook on forward commodity prices, and
interest rates. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date of estimate.
However, a decrease in forward commodity prices, or widening of basis differentials, alone could
result in an impairment.
In addition, well decommissioning programs, especially in deepwater or remote locations, are
often complex and expensive. It may be difficult to estimate timing of actual abandonment
activities, which are subject to regulatory approval and the availability of rigs and services. It may
be difficult to estimate costs of rigs and services in periods of fluctuating demand. In addition, we
do not operate certain assets and therefore we work with respective operators to receive updated
estimates of abandonment activities and costs. As such, our ARO estimates may change,
sometimes significantly, and could result in asset impairment and/or have other financial impacts.
Divestments We actively manage our asset portfolio. If properties are reclassified as assets held
for sale in the future, they will be valued at the lower of net book value or anticipated sales
proceeds less costs to sell. Impairment expense would be recorded for any excess of net book
value over anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell.

Changes in revenues are discussed below.
Oil, Gas and NGL Sales 
We generally sell crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs under two types of agreements common in
our industry. Both types of agreements may include transportation charges. One type of
agreement is a netback agreement, under which we sell crude oil and natural gas at the
wellhead and receive a price, net of transportation expense incurred by the purchaser. In the
case of NGLs, we may receive a price from the purchaser, which is net of fractionation and
processing costs. Historically, we have recorded revenue at the net price we had received from
the purchaser, net of transportation, fractionation or processing costs. Beginning in 2016, we
changed our presentation of revenue to no longer include expenses netted from revenue by the
purchaser. Crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales are now shown without deductions relating to
transportation, fractionation or processing. These deductions are now recorded as production
expense. Prior year amounts, including revenues, expenses, average realized sales prices and
average production costs per BOE, have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
For NGL sales, amounts reclassified for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 totaled
$10 million and $19 million, respectively. Amounts reclassified for crude oil and natural gas sales
were de minimis.
In addition, commodity prices we receive may be reduced by location basis differentials, which
can be significant. For example, transportation bottlenecks and oversupply in the Marcellus
Shale have reduced the amount of production reaching higher priced out-of-basin locations. As a
result of location basis differentials, our reported sales prices may differ significantly from
published commodity price benchmarks for the same period.

Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of crude oil equivalent.
This ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency.
Given commodity price disparities, the price for a barrel of crude oil equivalent for US natural
gas and NGLs are significantly less than the price for a barrel of crude oil. In Israel, we sell
natural gas under contracts where the majority of the price is fixed, resulting in less commodity
price disparity.
Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a
methanol plant, an LPG plant, an LNG plant and a power generation plant. The methanol and
LPG plants are owned in part by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of
accounting.
Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the LPG plant in Equatorial Guinea.

Crude Oil and Condensate Sales – Revenues from crude oil and condensate sales decreased
during second quarter and the first six months of 2016 as compared with 2015 due to the
following:
decreases in average realized prices primarily due to the decline in global commodity prices
that began in the second half of 2014;
partially offset by:
higher sales volumes in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to production from the Big Bend and
Dantzler development projects, which began producing in fourth quarter 2015, which contributed
8 MBbl/d and 7 MBbl/d, net, respectively, during the first six months of 2016; and
sales volumes contributed by our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin assets acquired in third
quarter 2015, which contributed 12 MBbl/d and 6 MBbl/d, net, respectively, during the first six
months of 2016.
Natural Gas Sales – Revenues from natural gas sales increased during second quarter and the
first six months of 2016 as compared with 2015 due to the following:
371
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
quarterly sales volumes from the Tamar field, offshore Israel, which contributed 276 MMcf/d, net,
in response to seasonal demand and the increased use of natural gas over coal to fuel power
generation;
higher sales volumes in the Marcellus Shale due to commencing production on eight operated
wells, our joint venture partner commencing production on 34 wells, and the recognition of
efficiencies in base production performance; and
sales volumes contributed by our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin assets acquired in third
quarter 2015, which contributed 142 MMcf/d and 8 MMcf/d, net, respectively, during the first six
months of 2016;
partially offset by:
decreases in average realized prices primarily due to the decline in global commodity prices
that began in the second half of 2014.
NGL Sales – Revenues from NGL sales increased during second quarter and the first six months
of 2016 as compared with 2015 due to the following:
higher sales volumes in the DJ Basin due to increased activity in East Pony and Wells Ranch;
and
sales volumes contributed by our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin assets acquired in third
quarter 2015, which contributed 23 MBbl/d and 1 MBbl/d, net, respectively, during the first six
months of 2016;
partially offset by:
•decreases in average realized prices primarily driven by oversupply.
Income from Equity Method Investees  We have interests in equity method investees that operate
midstream assets onshore US and West Africa. Equity method investments are included in other
noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets, and our share of earnings is reported as
income from equity method investees in our consolidated statements of operations. Within our
consolidated statements of cash flows, activity is reflected within cash flows provided by
operating activities and cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities.
Income from equity method investees increased $19 million during the first six months of 2016 as
compared with 2015. The increase primarily includes a $12 million increase from Atlantic
Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO), our methanol investee, which experienced a 45-
day plant turnaround during first quarter 2015; a $5 million decrease from Alba Plant, our

Lease operating expense includes oil and gas operating costs (labor, fuel, repairs,
replacements, saltwater disposal and other related lifting costs) and workover expense.
Certain of our revenue received from purchasers was historically presented with deduction for
transportation, fractionation or processing costs. Beginning in 2016, we have changed our
presentation of revenue to no longer include these expenses as deductions from revenue.
These costs are now included within production expense and prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation. See Results of Operations – Revenues,
above.
•
For second quarter and the first six months of 2016, total production expense increased as
compared with 2015 due to the following:     
an increase in lease operating and transportation and gathering expense due to higher
production, including the addition of onshore US production from our Eagle Ford Shale and
Permian Basin assets acquired in third quarter 2015 and from our Big Bend and Dantzler
development projects, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which began producing in fourth quarter 2015;
partially offset by:
a decrease in lease operating expense due to continued focus on cost reduction and efficiency
initiatives; and
a decrease in production and ad valorem taxes resulting from lower revenues and an onshore
US severance tax receivable, both driven by a decline in US commodity prices.
•
•
The unit rate per BOE for total production expense decreased for three months and six months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to cost reduction initiatives in lease
operating expense, and lower production and ad valorem taxes as a result of the pricing
environment. The decrease in unit rate per BOE was partially offset by the increase in
transportation and gathering expense primarily due to the addition of our Eagle Ford Shale and
Permian Basin assets in third quarter 2015 and an increase in production in the Marcellus Shale.

an increase in the Marcellus Shale, Eastern Mediterranean and deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to
higher sales volumes;
a reduction in proved reserves in fourth quarter 2015 primarily due to downward price revisions
in DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale;
partially offset by:
a decrease in sales volumes offshore Equatorial Guinea due to downtime installing the B3
compression platform and scheduled maintenance in the Alba field; and
the impact of lower net book value as a result of a fourth quarter 2015 impairment for offshore
Equatorial Guinea properties.
The decrease in the unit rate per BOE for the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 as
compared with 2015 was due primarily to increased lower-cost production volumes from certain
onshore US properties and the Tamar and Alba fields. The decrease in the unit rate per BOE
was partially offset by an increase in higher-cost production volumes in deepwater Gulf of Mexico
and reductions in proved reserves in fourth quarter 2015 mainly due to downward price revisions.
Significant changes to the proved reserves at December 31, 2015 include; additions of 269
MMBoe resulting from the Rosetta Merger during the third quarter 2015 offset by downward
revisions of 307 MMBoe that were commodity price driven. Estimates of proved reserves
significantly affect our DD&A expense. Holding other factors constant, a decline in proved
reserves estimates caused by decreases in the 12-month average commodity prices, will result in
an increase in DD&A expense in future periods, which would reduce earnings.

G&A expense for the first six months of 2016 was flat as compared with 2015 primarily due to
cost savings initiatives, including reduced use of contractors and consultants and decreased
special projects and other discretionary expenses, and decreases in employee personnel costs,
partially offset by the addition of Rosetta employees in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in
the unit rate per BOE for the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 as compared with
2015 was due primarily to the increase in production volumes in onshore US, deepwater Gulf of
Mexico, and Eastern Mediterranean; and cost synergies achieved through the Rosetta Merger.

Loss (Gain) on Commodity Derivative Instruments   Loss (Gain) on commodity derivative
instruments is a result of mark-to-market accounting. Many factors impact a gain or loss on
commodity derivative instruments including: increases and decreases in the commodity forward

The decrease in capitalized interest for second quarter and the first six months of 2016 as
compared with 2015 is primarily due to lower work in progress amounts related to major long-
term projects in deepwater Gulf of Mexico (due to the Big Bend and Dantzler development
projects that were completed in fourth quarter 2015, partially offset by the Gunflint development
project that was completed July 2016), offshore Cyprus (due to the farm-out agreement with a
partner for a 35% interest in Block 12

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Capital Structure/Financing Strategy
In seeking to effectively fund and monetize our discovered hydrocarbons, we employ a capital
structure and financing strategy designed to provide sufficient liquidity throughout the volatile
commodity price cycle, including the current commodity price environment. Specifically, we strive
to retain the ability to fund long cycle, multi-year, capital intensive development projects
throughout a range of scenarios, while also funding a continuing exploration program and
maintaining capacity to capitalize on financially attractive periodic mergers and acquisitions
activity.
We endeavor to maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade debt rating in service of
these objectives. We utilize a commodity price hedging program to reduce the impacts of
commodity price volatility and enhance the predictability of cash flows along with a risk and
insurance program to protect against disruption to our cash flows and the funding of our
business.
We strive to maintain a minimum liquidity level to address volatility and risk. Traditional sources
of our liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, available borrowing capacity under
our Revolving Credit Facility, and proceeds from sales of non-core properties.
We occasionally access the capital markets to ensure adequate liquidity exists in the form of
unutilized capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility or to refinance scheduled debt maturities.
On January 6, 2016, we entered into the Term Loan Facility which provides for a three-year term
loan facility for a principal amount of $1.4 billion. In connection with the Term Loan Facility, we
launched cash tender offers for certain Senior Notes assumed in the Rosetta Merger. The
borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used solely to fund the tender offers. Collectively,
the result of these transactions provides for significant future interest expense savings with a
shorter term debt maturity. While we have no near-term debt maturities, we may seek to access
the capital markets to refinance a portion of our outstanding indebtedness. As of June 30, 2016,
we had $7.5 billion of long-term debt outstanding, $2.4 billion of which is due first quarter 2019.
See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt.
In addition, we evaluate potential strategic farm-out arrangements of our working interests for
reimbursement of our capital spending and may consider non-core asset sales or other sources
of funding. Furthermore, as required by the Israel Natural Gas Framework, we are required to
divest certain of our interests within a stipulated period of time. During first half 2016, we received
cash proceeds of approximately $767 million primarily from our divestment of certain onshore US
assets primarily in the DJ Basin, our Cyprus farm-out and the sale of our Karish and Tanin
discoveries offshore Israel. On July 4, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement to divest a 3%
interest in the Tamar field, offshore Israel, for $369 million, subject to customary closing
adjustments.
Cash on hand at June 30, 2016 totaled approximately $1.3 billion, which includes both domestic
and foreign cash, and there were no amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.
See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt and Revolving Credit Facility, below.
Our nearly 60% reduction in capital spending during the first six months of 2016 as compared to
the same period of 2015, coupled with operating efficiencies to increase production at lower
costs, has allowed us to closely align capital spending with our operating cash flows. We will
continue our effort to invest capital at a level supported by current operating cash flows. Our
financial capacity and lack of near-term debt maturities, coupled with our diversified global
portfolio, provides us with flexibility in our investment decisions including execution of our major
development projects and exploration activity.
To support our investment program, we expect that production resulting from our core onshore
US development programs, combined with new production from the Big Bend and Dantzler
development projects, which began producing in fourth quarter 2015, and from the Gunflint
development, which began producing in July 2016, as well as completion of the Alba B3
compression project, which commenced production in July 2016, and presuming no significant
further deterioration of prices, will result in cash flows which will be available to meet a portion of
future capital commitments in 2016 and subsequent years. See Results of Operations above.
We are currently evaluating potential development and/or financing scenarios for our significant
natural gas discoveries offshore Eastern Mediterranean. The magnitude of these discoveries
presents technical and financial challenges for us due to
42
Table of Contents
the large-scale development requirements. Each of these development options, including the
development of Leviathan infrastructure to supply domestic and regional demands, would require
a multi-billion dollar investment and require a number of years to complete. We received
approval from the Government of Israel of a revised stability provision as part of the Israel Natural
Gas Framework which is another key milestone in progressing the Leviathan project to
development sanction. See Update on Israel Natural Gas Regulatory Framework, above.

Cash and Cash Equivalents   We had approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents at
June 30, 2016, primarily denominated in US dollars and invested in money market funds and
short-term deposits with major financial institutions. Approximately $347 million of this cash is
attributable to our foreign subsidiaries. We have recorded a related deferred tax liability on
undistributed foreign earnings for the future additional US tax liability for the US and foreign tax
rate differences, net of estimated foreign tax credit.
Revolving Credit Facility   Our Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 27, 2020. The
commitment is $4.0 billion through the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of
June 30, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings
under our Revolving Credit Facility subject us to interest rate risk. See Item 1. Financial
Statements – Note 6. Debt and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.
Commodity Derivative Instruments   We use various derivative instruments in connection with
anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations
and ensure cash flow for future capital needs. Such instruments may include variable to fixed
price commodity swaps, two-way collars, three-way collars, swaptions and enhanced swaps.
Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are
either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. We net settle by counterparty
based on netting provisions within the master agreements. None of our counterparty agreements
contain margin requirements. 
Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets,
and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs.  As
of June 30, 2016, the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $229 million and the fair
value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $66 million (after consideration of netting
provisions within our master agreements). See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 7. Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures, for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair
values of commodity derivative instruments, and Credit Risk, below.
Credit Risk   We monitor the creditworthiness of our trade creditors, joint venture partners, hedge
counterparties, and financial institutions on an ongoing basis. Counterparty credit downgrades or
liquidity problems could result in a delay in our receiving proceeds from commodity sales,
reimbursement of joint venture costs, and potential delays in our major development projects. As
operator of the joint ventures, we pay joint venture expenses and make cash calls on our non-
operating partners for their respective shares of joint venture costs. Our projects are capital cost
intensive and, in some cases, a non-operating partner may experience a delay in obtaining
financing for its share of the joint venture costs or have liquidity problems resulting in slow
payment of joint venture costs. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of a joint
venture partner, we may be required to complete their share of remediation activities or fulfill their
lease obligations which could result in significant financial losses.
We are unable to predict sudden changes in a party's creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even
if we do accurately predict such sudden changes, our ability to negate these risks may be limited
and we could incur significant financial losses.
Credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the form of parental guarantees,
letters of credit or credit insurance; however, not all of our counterparty credit is protected through
guarantees or credit support. In addition, we maintain
43
Table of Contents
credit insurance associated with specific purchasers. However, nonperformance by a trade
creditor, joint venture partner, hedge counterparty or financial institution could result in significant
financial losses.
Contractual Obligations
Marcellus Shale Joint Development Agreement  The joint development agreement for our jointly
owned Marcellus Shale acreage provides for a multi-year drilling and development plan (default
plan). We and CONSOL have agreed to an annual plan that provides for fewer wells to be drilled
than the number of wells that was provided for in the default plan, and, for 2016, the amount of
capital investment allocated to the Marcellus Shale core area will be less than the amount
provided for in the default plan. Each of us has a non-consent right, which is the right to elect not
to participate in all (but not less than all) of the operations provided for the following year. If one of
us elects to exercise the non-consent right, then the other partner, in its sole discretion, may
determine the number of wells, if any, it will drill in such year, which may be significantly less
than the number of wells that was provided for in the default plan, or none at all. In the event we
elect to exercise our non-consent right for a given year, we would still have to pay the carried
costs that are contemplated by the development plan for that non-consent year. Under the joint
development agreement, this non-consent right may be exercised by each partner twice (in non-
consecutive years) prior to the termination of the default plan at the end of 2020. Neither of us has
exercised the non-consent right, and thus, each of us may still elect to exercise the non-consent
right twice (in non-consecutive years) prior to the end of 2020.
CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation See Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 13. Commitments and
Contingencies.
Exploration Commitments The terms of some of our production sharing contracts, licenses or
concession agreements may require us to conduct certain exploration activities, including drilling
one or more exploratory wells or acquiring seismic data, within specific time periods. These
obligations can extend over periods of several years, and failure to conduct such exploration
activities within the prescribed periods could lead to loss of leases or exploration rights.
Continuous Development Obligations  Although the majority of our assets are held by production,
certain of our onshore US assets are held through continuous development obligations.
Therefore, we are contractually obligated to fund a level of development activity in these areas
and failure to meet these obligations may result in the loss of a lease. Our 2016 capital program
allows for managing these obligations.
Delivery and Firm Transportation Agreements  We have entered into various long-term gathering,
processing, transportation and delivery contracts for some of our onshore US crude oil and
natural gas production. These contracts may commit us to deliver minimum volumes and require
us to make payments for any shortfalls in delivering or transporting the minimum volumes under
the commitments. We may use long-term contracts such as these, which may range in term from
one to 40 years, to provide flow assurance for production in over-supplied basins with
constrained infrastructure, such as currently in the Marcellus Shale, and to enable our production
to reach higher priced out-of-basin locations.
Although we strive to schedule well completion activities to meet the minimum volumes under the
commitments, we may experience temporary, and possibly prolonged, delivery or transportation
shortfalls. During first half 2016, we incurred expense of approximately $23 million related to
deficiencies and/or unutilized commitments. We expect to continue to incur deficiency and/or
unutilized costs in the near-term as development activities continue. For full year 2016, we
estimate these costs could range from approximately $45 million to $55 million. Should
commodity prices continue to remain low or decline further, or we are unable to continue to
develop our properties as planned, or certain wells become uneconomic and are shut-in, we
could incur additional shortfalls in delivering or transporting the minimum volumes under these
commitments. In the event that these commitments are not otherwise offset, we could be required
to make future payments for any shortfalls. While we continually seek to optimize under-utilized
assets through capacity release and third-party arrangements, as well as, for example, through
the shifting of transportation of production from rail cars to pipelines when we receive a higher
netback price, we may continue to experience these shortfalls both in the near and long-term.
Credit Rating Events We do not have any triggering events on our corporate debt that would
cause a default in case of a downgrade of our credit rating. In addition, there are no existing
ratings triggers in any of our commodity hedging agreements that would require the posting of
collateral. However, a series of downgrades or other negative rating actions could increase our
cost of financing, and may increase our requirements to post collateral as financial assurance of
performance under certain other contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation
contracts, crude oil and natural gas sales contracts, work commitments and certain abandonment
obligations. A requirement to post collateral could have a negative impact on our liquidity.

Operating Activities   Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2016
decreased significantly as compared with 2015. Decreases in average realized commodity
prices and lower settlements of commodity derivative instruments were partially offset by
increases in sales volumes. Working capital changes resulted in a $381 million operating cash
flow reduction in the first six months of 2016 as compared with a positive impact of $34 million in
the first six months of 2015.
Investing Activities   Our investing activities include capital spending on a cash basis for oil and
gas properties and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for by the equity
method. These investing activities may be offset by proceeds from property sales or dispositions,
including farm-out arrangements, which may result in reimbursement for capital spending that
had occurred in prior periods. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment decreased by
$1.09 billion during the first six months of 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to a
reduced capital spending program. Investing activities included $6 million in CONE Gathering
LLC during the first six months of 2016 as compared with $65 million in the same period of 2015.
We received $767 million in proceeds from asset divestitures during the first six months of 2016,
as compared with $151 million during the same period in 2015.
Financing Activities   Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of our common
stock, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the
repayment of borrowings. During the first six months of 2016, funds were provided by cash
proceeds from the term loan acquisition ($1.4 billion). We used cash to pay dividends on our
common stock ($86 million), fund the purchase of certain of our outstanding senior notes ($1.38
billion), and make principal payments related to capital lease obligations ($27 million).
In comparison, during the first six months of 2015, funds were provided by cash proceeds from
the issuance of shares of Company common stock to the public ($1.1 billion). We used cash to
pay dividends on our common stock ($134 million) and make principal payments related to
capital lease obligations ($29 million).

Total expenditures decreased during the first six months of 2016 as compared with 2015 due to
our reduced capital spending program. See Operating Outlook – 2016 Capital Investment
Program, above.
Financing Activities
Long-Term Debt   Our principal source of liquidity is our Revolving Credit Facility that matures
August 27, 2020. At June 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Facility, leaving $4.0 billion available for use. We may rely on our Revolving Credit Facility
to help fund our capital investment program, and may periodically borrow amounts for working
capital purposes. On January 6, 2016, we entered into the Term Loan Facility with Citibank, N.A.,
as administrative agent, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., as syndication agent, and certain other financial
institutions party thereto, which provides for a three-year term loan facility for a principal amount
of $1.4 billion. In connection with the Term Loan Facility, we launched cash tender offers for
certain Senior Notes assumed in the Rosetta Merger. The borrowings under the Term Loan
Facility were used solely to fund the tender offers. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6.
Debt.
Our outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding capital lease obligations) totaled approximately $6.1
billion at June 30, 2016. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 5.69%, with
maturities ranging from March 2019 to August 2097.
Dividends   We paid total cash dividends of 20 cents per share of common stock during the first
six months of 2016 as compared with 36 cents per share during the first six months of 2015.
On July 26, 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 10 cents per
common share, which will be paid on August 22, 2016 to shareholders of record on August 8,
2016. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of
our board of directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and
other factors.
Exercise of Stock Options   We received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $7
million during the first six months of 2016 and $4 million during the first six months of 2015.
Common Stock Repurchases   We receive shares of common stock from employees for the
payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based
compensation plans. We received 232,870 shares with a value of $8 million during the first six
months of 2016 and 253,597 shares with a value of $12 million during the first six months of
2015. 
Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Commodity Price Risk
Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes   We are exposed to market risk in the
normal course of business operations, and the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices
continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas
prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price
changes.
At June 30, 2016, we had various open commodity derivative instruments related to crude oil and
natural gas. Changes in fair value of commodity derivative instruments are reported in earnings
in the period in which they occur. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net asset
position with a fair value of $163 million. Based on the June 30, 2016 published commodity
futures price curves for the underlying commodities, a hypothetical price increase of $10.00 per
Bbl for crude oil would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative asset by
approximately $190 million. A hypothetical price increase of $0.50 per MMBtu for natural gas
would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative asset by approximately $44
million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the
event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we
choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty
would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
Interest Rate Risk
Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our Revolving
Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term
investments.
At June 30, 2016, we had approximately $7.5 billion (excluding capital lease obligations) of long-
term debt, net, outstanding. Of this amount, $6.1 billion was fixed-rate debt, net, with a weighted
average interest rate of 5.69%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair
value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to interest rate risk or cash flow loss.
However, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our interest-bearing cash and cash
equivalents balances. As of June 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled nearly $1.3
billion, approximately 48% of which was invested in money market funds and short-term
investments with major financial institutions. In addition, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility
are subject to variable interest rates which expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due
to potential increases in market
46
Table of Contents
interest rates. A change in the interest rate applicable to our variable-rate debt could expose us to
additional interest cost. While we currently have no interest rate derivative instruments as of
June 30, 2016, we may invest in such instruments in the future in order to mitigate interest rate
risk. A change in the interest rate applicable to our short-term investments would have a de
minimis impact.
Foreign Currency Risk
The US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations.
Substantially all of our international crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold pursuant to
US dollar denominated contracts. Transactions, such as operating costs and administrative
expenses that are paid in a foreign currency, are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the
financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. Certain monetary assets and
liabilities, such as taxes payable in foreign tax jurisdictions, are settled in the foreign local
currency. A reduction in the value of the US dollar against currencies of other countries in which
we have material operations could result in the use of additional cash to settle operating,
administrative, and tax liabilities.
Net transaction gains and losses were de minimis for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015.
We currently have no foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding. However, we may
enter into foreign currency derivative instruments (such as forward contracts, costless collars or
swap agreements) in the future if we determine that it is necessary to invest in such instruments
in order to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.
Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of
future events. These forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:
•our growth strategies;
•
•our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas
resources;
•anticipated trends in our business;
•our future results of operations;
•our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities;
•market conditions in the oil and gas industry;
•our ability to make and integrate acquisitions;
the impact of governmental fiscal terms and/or regulation, such as those involving the protection
of the environment or marketing of production, as well as other regulations; and
•access to resources.
Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,”
“believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” and similar words, although some forward-looking
statements may be expressed differently. These forward-looking statements are made based
upon our current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future
events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that
forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from
those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the
statements under Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 and in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which describe factors that
could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 is available on our website
at www.nobleenergyinc.com.
Item 4.     Controls and Procedures
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by our principal executive
officer and our principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly
report, each of them has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(Exchange Act)), are effective. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter
covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information
Item 1.    Legal Proceedings
See discussion of legal proceedings in Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements
- Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies of this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by
reference into this Part II. Item 1, as well as discussion in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Item 1A.    Risk Factors
There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, other than the following:
Certain proposed ballot measures considered in Colorado seek to vastly expand the right of local
governments to regulate and dictate location parameters of future crude oil and natural gas
exploration and development activities, and/or limit or prohibit crude oil and natural gas
production and development activities in their jurisdictions. If these measures are approved and
implemented, they could have material adverse effects on our operations in Colorado and the
value of our DJ Basin assets and development activities.
Certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to crude oil and natural gas development generally,
and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have advanced various ballot initiatives designed to
significantly limit or prevent crude oil and natural gas development. The State of Colorado
approved for signature gathering four ballot measures which would adversely impact our
Colorado operations.  A measure that would grant local communities certain additional rights to
self-governance, including ability to ban certain businesses from operating in their jurisdictions
has been withdrawn. Other measures would establish a constitutional right to a healthy
environment and obligate local governments to protect the environment, grant local governments
control over crude oil and natural gas development and require that all new crude oil and natural
gas facilities be located 2,500 feet from occupied structures and an expansive list of landscape
features called "areas of special concern." All of these measures are available for signature
gathering and the proponents have until August 8, 2016 to gather the requisite number of
signatures to qualify for the November 2016 ballot.
If any initiative or legislation of this nature is implemented and survives legal challenge,
significant additional limitations or prohibitions could be placed on crude oil and natural gas
production and development within certain areas of Colorado or the state as a whole. This could
adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of development activities in Colorado,
particularly those involving hydraulic fracturing, and significantly and adversely affect the value of
our assets, impede our growth and trigger a substantial impairment of these assets.
