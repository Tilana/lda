He appealed to the High Court and his appeal was dismissed on the 1st of May 2003. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against sentence. The appeal does not raise any question of law and consequently does not come within the provisions of s. 22 of the Court of Appeal Act. Leave to appeal is accordingly declined.
