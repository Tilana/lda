NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
June 30, 2016
NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
PetroShare Corp. (“PetroShare” or the “Company”) is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Colorado
on September 4, 2012 to investigate, acquire and develop crude oil and natural gas properties in the Rocky Mountain
or mid-continent portion of the United States. Since inception, PetroShare has focused on financing activities and the
acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas prospects in the Rocky Mountain and mid-
continent region of the United States. The Company’s recent focus is on the Wattenberg Field, part of the Denver-
Julesberg Basin in northeast Colorado. The Company is in the process of developing its operated and non-operated
Wattenberg assets, including those located within its Todd Creek Farms prospect. Currently, all of the Company’s
properties are located in the State of Colorado. As of June 30, 2016, PetroShare had an interest in 38 gross (16.6 net)
producing wells and approximately 9,877 gross (2,432 net) acres of oil and gas properties, most of which acreage is
held by production. PetroShare’s goal is to become a leading independent producer of crude oil and natural gas in the
Wattenberg Field.
NOTE 2 — BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with
Section 8-03 of Regulation S-X for interim financial statements required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”).  Certain information normally included in financial statements and the accompanying notes
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)
have been condensed or omitted. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s
Audited Financial Statements and notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, and the Company’s other filings with the SEC.
The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair
presentation of the Company’s Condensed Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2016; the Condensed Statements of
Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015; and the Condensed Statements of Cash
Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of
results of operations or cash flows for the full year.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. For further information, see Note 2 to the Financial Statements contained in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The Company has evaluated events or transactions through the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed
financial statements.  Except as otherwise set forth herein, there have been no material changes to the Notes from
those included with the Audited Financial Statements included in the Form 10-K.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Business Combinations
The Company accounts for the acquisition of oil and gas properties, that are not commonly controlled, based on the
requirements of FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires an acquiring entity to recognize the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting, provided such
assets and liabilities qualify for acquisition accounting under the standard. The Company accounts for property
acquisitions of proved developed oil and gas property as business combinations.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Issued
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date.  If not discussed, management believes
that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements upon adoption.
In September 2015, the FASB issued update 2015-16 Business Combinations (Topic 805), which updated guidance
that eliminates the requirement to restate prior periods to reflect adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized
in a business combination.  The updated guidance requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional
amounts that are identified during the measurement
Table of Contents
4
period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The standards update was effective
prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  The
Company adopted this standard update, as required, effective January 1, 2016, which did not have a material impact
on its Condensed Financial Statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  The standard requires lessees to recognize
the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet.  A lessee should recognize in the statement of
financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right
to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018.  The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period
presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim
or annual reporting period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its financial
statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, which includes provisions intended to simplify various
aspects related to how share-based compensation payments are accounted for and presented in the financial
statements. This amendment will be effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning on or after December 15,
2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the ASU on the Company’s
financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Various accounting standards and interpretations were issued in 2015 with effective dates subsequent to
December 31, 2015.  The Company has evaluated the recently issued accounting pronouncements that are effective
in 2016 and believes that none of them will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or
cash flows when adopted.
Further, the Company is monitoring the joint standard-setting efforts of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and
the International Accounting Standards Board.  There are a large number of pending accounting standards that are
being targeted for completion in 2016 and beyond, including, but not limited to, standards relating to revenue
recognition, accounting for leases, fair value measurements, accounting for financial instruments, disclosure of loss
contingencies and financial statement presentation. Because these pending standards have not yet been finalized, at
this time the Company is not able to determine the potential future impact that these standards will have, if any, on its
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
NOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS
PDC Acquisition
On June 30, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of certain oil and gas assets from PDC
Energy, Inc. (“PDC”), including leases covering approximately 3,652 gross (1,410 net) acres of
lands located in Adams County, Colorado and PDC’s interest in 35 currently producing wells
(“PDC assets”). Simultaneous with the closing, the Company’s principal lender exercised its
option under a participation agreement (Note 10) and acquired 50% of the interest the Company
acquired in the PDC assets. The acquisition was effective April 1, 2016.
The gross purchase price for the PDC assets was $4,611,833 after a holdback allowance of
$542,797 associated with certain title defects. Following the lender’s exercise of its option under
the participation agreement, the net purchase price to the Company was $2,305,917. The gross
purchase price may be adjusted upwards to $5,154,630 if PDC completes certain title curative
actions within 60 days following closing. The purchase price is also subject to certain post-
closing adjustments based on a final proration of costs and revenues from operation of the assets
following the effective date. The post-closing adjustment is scheduled 90 days after the
acquisition date.
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with FASB Topic ASC 805, Business
Combinations, which among other things requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured and
recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date.
A preliminary allocation of the purchase price was prepared using, among other things, an internally prepared reserve
analysis. The following allocation is subject to (i) the post-closing adjustments discussed above and (ii) certain
accruals, consisting primarily of lease operating expenses. The following allocation includes the use of estimates,
which were soley based on information that was available to management at the time these unaudited condensed
financial statements were prepared. Any changes to the estimates used in preparing this preliminary purchase price
allocation could result in a corresponding change in the final purchase price allocation.

In accordance with FASB Topic ASC 805, the following unaudited supplemental pro forma condensed results of
operations present combined information as though the business combination had been completed as of January 1,
2015. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information was derived from the historical revenues and direct
operating expenses of PDC and the Company and adjusted to include: (i) depletion expense applied to the adjusted
basis of the properties acquired, and (ii) accretion expense associated with the asset retirement obligations recorded
using the Company’s assumptions about the future liabilities. These unaudited supplemental pro forma results of
operations are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the actual results that
would have been achieved by the combined company for the periods presented or that may be achieved by the
combined company in the future. Future results may vary significantly from the results reflected in this unaudited pro
forma financial information.

On March 10, 2016, the Company acquired certain surface rights and easements on lands located in Township 1
South, Range 67 West located on its Todd Creek Farms prospect in exchange for $184,360 in cash. The surface
rights and easements permit the Company to access its Shook well pad. Pursuant to a participation agreement
between the Company and its principal lender, the lender exercised its option to acquire 50% of the Company’s
interest.
On March 31, 2016, the Company acquired certain oil and gas assets on land adjacent to the Company’s Todd Creek
Farms prospect, including: (i) oil and gas leases covering approximately 320 net acres located in Section 10,
Township 1 South, Range 67 West; (ii) a 100% working interest in one well located on the aforementioned leases;
(iii) the seller’s interest in all of the oil, gas, natural gas liquids, and associated hydrocarbons produced from the well;
(iv) the seller’s interest in and to certain contracts and agreements applicable to the well and leases; (v) machinery,
fixtures, gathering and flow lines, tanks, boilers and other equipment, tangible personal property and improvements
located on and used or held in connection with the  leases and the well; and (vi) the seller’s interest in all easements,
permits, licenses and rights of way associated with the foregoing. The Company paid $1,180,547 for the foregoing
assets, which purchase price is subject to upward and downward adjustments in certain circumstances. In addition to
the acquisition, the Company assumed certain of the seller’s obligations and liabilities. The transaction has an
effective date of January 1,

2016. Pursuant to the participation agreement between the Company and its principal lender, the lender exercised its
option to acquire 50% of the Company’s interest in the leases and the well by paying the Company $590,274 in cash
on April 19, 2016.
On April 14, 2016, the Company acquired certain oil and gas leases near the Company’s existing leases in its Todd
Creek Farms prospect covering approximately 378 net acres in Section 5, Township 1 South, Range 67 West.  The
Company also acquired the seller’s right to participate in, and agreed to pay all of the seller’s costs and expenses
related to, the drilling, completion, equipping and producing of up to 14 wells covering part of these leases proposed to
be drilled by a third-party operator. The Company paid $576,112 for this acquisition. The transaction was effective on

Activity under the Plan for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is as follows:
On January 28, 2016, the Company issued 875,000 options to purchase its common stock in connection with the
employment of its Chief Operating Officer. The options are exercisable at a price of $1.00 per share and expire on
December 31, 2022. The option vests as follows: (i) 125,000 upon the date of grant, and (ii) 750,000 on January 1,
2017, provided that the optionee has been continuously employed by the Company up to that date. The options are
subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and a stock option agreement.
On April 12, 2016, the Company issued 250,000 options to purchase its common stock in connection with the hiring of
the Company’s Vice President of Land.  The option vests as follows: (i) 50,000 on the date of grant; (ii) 100,000 on
April 15, 2017; and (iii) 100,000 on April 15, 2018, provided that the optionee has been continuously employed by the
Company up to each vesting date.  The options are exercisable at a price of $0.80 per share and expire on April 15,
2021. The options are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and a stock option agreement.
On May 4, 2016, the Company issued 50,000 options to purchase its common stock in connection with the addition
and appointment of two members of the Company’s the Board of Directors (Note 11).  The options vested on the date
of the grant.  The options are exercisable at a price of $1.10 per share and expire on December 31, 2022. The options
are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and a stock option agreement.
The fair value of each share-based award was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes pricing
model that incorporates key assumptions including volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. As
PetroShare’s common stock has limited historical trading data, the expected stock price volatility is based primarily
on the historical volatility of a group of publicly-traded companies that share similar operating metrics and histories. 
The expected term of the awards represents the period of time that management anticipates awards will be
outstanding. As there was insufficient historical data available to ascertain a forfeiture rate, the plain vanilla method
was applied in calculating the expected term of the options. The risk-free rates for the periods within the contractual
life of the options are based on the US Treasury bond rate in effect at the time of the grant for bonds with maturity
dates at the expected term of the options. PetroShare has never paid dividends on its common stock and currently
does not intend to do so, and as such, the expected dividend yield is zero. Compensation expense related to stock
options was recorded net of estimated forfeitures, which for options remaining at December 31, 2016, the Company
expects no additional forfeitures.

Item 2.                   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
In the following discussion, “PetroShare Corp.,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to PetroShare Corp.
Overview
The following discussion updates and summarizes our plan of operation as of August 18, 2016 for the next 12
months. It also analyzes (i) our financial condition at June 30, 2016 and compares it to that at December 31, 2015,
and (ii) our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with the  accompanying financial statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this report and the audited financial statements and related notes contained in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
We were organized on September 4, 2012 under the laws of the State of Colorado to investigate, acquire and develop
crude oil and natural gas properties in the Rocky Mountain and mid-continent region of the United States. We have
narrowed our current leasing and drilling activities to the southern-Wattenberg area of the Denver-Julesberg Basin in
southern Weld and northern Adams Counties in northeast Colorado. We refer to this area as the Southern Core area. 
This area was selected due to the quality of the hydrocarbon-bearing rock and the production performance from other,
nearby wells. The Southern Core area contains the Niobrara and Codell formations, which tend to yield oil-weighted
production that remains economic in the prevailing commodity price environment.
Following the acquisition of certain oil and gas assets from PDC Energy, Inc. (“PDC”), we are the operator of 36
currently-producing oil and gas wells located in the Southern Core area, the majority of which are located on our Todd
Creek Farms prospect. We are also the operator of two oil and gas wells on our Buck Peak prospect. As of
August 18, 2016, we have a lease inventory covering a total of approximately 9,877 gross acres, the majority of which
is in the Southern Core area. After assignment to our working interest partners, we have approximately 407 net acres
in our Buck Peak prospect and 2,025 net acres in our Todd Creek Farms prospect, which we are in the process of
developing.
On June 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain oil and gas assets from PDC (the “PDC assets”). The PDC
assets include leases covering approximately 3,652 gross (1,410 net to our interest) acres of lands located in Adams
County, Colorado. All of the acreage is currently held by production. We acquired PDC’s interest in 44 productive
wells, 35 of which are currently producing and nine of which are shut-in. We also acquired PDC’s interest in 11
producing wells to which PDC non-consented and to which we are ascribing no economic value. Much of the acreage
we acquired from PDC is within our Todd Creek Farms prospect; the remainder of the acreage is located throughout
Adams County and is prospective for formations other than the Niobrara and Codell. The PDC asset acquisition was
effective April 1, 2016. For the period between April 1, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the revenue and expenses related to
the PDC assets will be recorded as adjustments to capitalized costs effective July 1, 2016.
The total purchase price for the PDC assets was $4,611,833. Following the exercise of its option under the
Participation Agreement, Providence acquired 50% of our interest in the PDC assets. Our net cost for the PDC assets
was $2,305,917.  The gross purchase price may be adjusted upwards up to $5,154,630 if PDC completes certain title
curative actions. The purchase price is also subject to certain post-closing adjustments based on a final proration of
costs and revenues from operation of the assets at the effective date.
The PDC assets provide us with revenue and cash flow from the estimated 62.5 BOE/D, net to our interest, from the
35 producing wells, which revenue we commenced recording on July 1, 2016. We became the substituted operator of
field operations on or about July 31, 2016 for all of the wells we acquired from PDC. The acquisition also will allow us
to drill up to 32 additional horizontal wells, including eight currently-approved horizontal well permits on the Corcillius
pad. Whether we ultimately drill any wells on the acreage is dependent on many factors, including receipt of adequate
working capital from our anticipated public offering of common stock, current and projected prices of oil and gas,
identification of compelling drill locations, and obtaining all required permits. However, we do not expect to drill any
wells on the acreage we acquired from PDC until at least 2017.
Plan of Operation and Expected Capital Expenditures
Our plan of operation for the next 12 months includes: (i) continuing permitting and development of our Shook and
Corcillius pad drilling programs on the Todd Creek Farms prospect, (ii) operating and increasing production from the
wells we purchased from PDC, (iii) participating as a non-operator in drilling projects operated, or to be operated, by
third-parties, (iv) identifying other lease and asset acquisitions on or near our Todd Creek Farms prospect, and
(v) maintaining our operated wells on our Buck Peak prospect. Our goal is to become a leading independent producer
of crude oil and natural gas and liquids in the Wattenberg Field.

In April 2016, we acquired certain oil and gas leases near our Todd Creek Farms prospect covering approximately 378
net acres in Section 5, Township 1 South, Range 67 West. As part of the acquisition, we acquired the seller’s right to
participate in, and agreed to pay all of the seller’s costs and expenses related to, the drilling, completion, equipping
and producing of a 14 well drilling program on the Jacobucci pad operated by PDC. This program commenced in
April 2016 and consists of 14 mid-range lateral wells, all of which are expected to be drilled and completed during
2016 and 2017. We expect to participate in all 14 wells, with working interests varying from 10 to 29% and an average
over all the wells of approximately 20%. The anticipated cost to our interest to drill and complete all of the wells is
approximately $9.2 million. We expect to pay those costs through existing working capital, draws on our line of credit
and the proceeds of our anticipated public offering. We do not expect to receive revenue from these wells until the
second quarter of 2017. As of August 18, 2016, PDC had drilled but not yet completed four of the 14 planned wells on
the Jacobucci pad. Our costs for those four wells through June 30, 2016 was approximately $500,000.
We also are in the process of permitting an 8-well drilling program consisting of standard-range lateral wells on our
Corcillius pad, located in Section 6 of Township 1 South, Range 67 West, Adams County, on leases we acquired from
PDC and part of our Todd Creek Farms prospect. We intend to be the operator of any wells drilled on the Corcillius
pad. Subject to approval of required permits and the availability of working capital, we expect to begin drilling our
Corcillius wells in early 2018. Based on current estimates, we have budgeted $8.1 million in 2018 for our 50% share of
up to 7 wells. We do not expect to receive revenue from any Corcillius wells until mid-2018.
Due to the inherent uncertainty with the permitting process and because we cannot control the drilling and completion
schedules of our non-operated properties, we are unable to predict with any degree of confidence when we will receive
revenue from our projected horizontal wells. However, we expect to begin receiving revenue from our recently acquired
vertical wells immediately.
As of June 30, 2016, we had generated only nominal revenue related to the sale of oil from Buck Peak. Management
has determined that further exploration at Buck Peak is currently uneconomic due to the downturn in oil prices over
the past two years and the nominal production rate of the initial two wells. However, we will maintain the majority of
our interests in the prospect area through the terms of the existing leases and will continue to monitor oil prices and
the production rates of our wells, as well as other development in the area, to determine further activities in that area.
We also intend to monitor the production from the 35 producing wells we acquired from PDC in order to determine
whether the production could be improved through workovers or by other means. We do not expect that we will incur
any material capital expenditures related to those wells.
In maintaining our wells on the Buck Peak prospect, we may incur additional capital expenditures; however we expect
any expenditures related to the Buck Peak wells will be nominal.
We are actively seeking additional acreage acquisitions, but as of August 18, 2016 we have not entered into any
definitive purchase agreements.
All of the foregoing activities and related capital expenditures are subject to receipt of adequate capital, as our current
resources are limited.
Results of Operations
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to June 30, 2015
Overview:  Our net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $918,201, or $0.04 per
share, compared to net loss of $245,674 or $0.01 per share for the three months ended June 30,
2015.  The increase in net loss of $672,527 in the 2016 period resulted primarily from an
increase in general and administrative expenses of $639,067 and an increase in interest
expense of $24,210.
Revenues:  Crude Oil sales revenue was $nil for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which is
unchanged for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  Our Buck Peak prospect wells remained
off-line during the second quarter of 2016. We have commenced recording revenue related to our
recently acquired assets effective July 1, 2017.

Total production expense increased $8,154 or 297% for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the
three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in lease operating costs relates primarily to Ad Valorem taxes on
our Buck Peak prospect wells.
Routine lease operating expense (“LOE”), consisting of field personnel, fuel/power, chemicals, disposal, transportation
and other costs, per BOE was $nil and $nil for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
General and administrative expenses: We incurred general and administrative expenses of $875,344
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $236,277 in the three months ended
June 30, 2015, representing an increase of $639,067 or 270%. This increase in the current
period is primarily attributable to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $370,519
(a non-cash expense), as compared to $nil in the prior period; an increase in salary and wage
expense of $70,583, or 81%, primarily related to the hiring of new employees and directors; an
increase in professional services fees of $95,042, or 188%, relating to our status as a public
company, investor relations services, and services related to our recent acquisitions of oil and
gas properties; and increases in insurance costs of $30,683, or 598%. Since the beginning of
2016, we have added to our personnel to assist in managing our recently-acquired properties
and anticipated drilling programs.
Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion:  Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and
accretion increased $913 or 65% for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the
three months ended June 30, 2015.  The increase relates primarily to higher depreciation
expense on office equipment and software for the second quarter of 2016.
Loss on impairment of oil and gas properties: Impairment expense increased to $318 or 100% for the
three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $nil for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Interest income (expense): During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized interest
income of $138 compared to $3 in the three months ended June 30, 2015.  During the three
months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized interest expense of $34,950 compared to $10,740
in the three months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of 225%.  The interest expense
recognized in the current period relates to the higher outstanding balance on our line of credit,
which totaled $4.66 million as of June 30, 2016.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to June 30, 2015
Overview:  Our net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1,641,007, or $0.08 per
share, compared to a net loss of $456,765 or $0.03 per share for the six months ended June 30,
2015. The increase in net loss of $1,184,242 in the 2016 period resulted primarily from an
increase in general and administrative expenses of $1,126,408, and to a lesser extent, an
increase in interest expense of $46,156.
Revenues:  Crude Oil sales revenue was $nil for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared
to $1,328 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Our Buck Peak prospect wells remained off-
line during the first half of 2016.
Volumes and Prices:  Crude oil sales volumes decreased 36.56 Bbls or 100% for the six months

Total production expense decreased $1,343 or 19% for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in lease operating costs relates primarily to keeping our Buck Peak wells
offline during the first half of 2016, partially offset by Ad Valorem taxes on our Buck Peak wells.
LOE per BOE was $nil and $189.72 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
General and administrative expenses: We incurred general and administrative expenses of
$1,554,920 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $428,510 in the six months
ended June 30, 2015, representing an increase of $1,126,410 or 263%. This increase is primarily
attributable to an increase in total share based compensation expense of $714,984 in the current
period  as compared to $nil in the same 2015 period; an increase in salary and wage expense of
$117,833, or 68%, primarily related to the hiring of new employees and directors; and an
increase in professional services fees of $149,253, or 160%, related to our status as a public
company, investor relations services, and services related to our recent acquisitions of oil and
gas properties.
Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion:  Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and
accretion decreased $7,550 or 63% for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015.  The decrease resulted from no depletion expense recorded
during the period, as our Buck Peak prospect wells remained offline during the second quarter of
2016.
Loss on impairment of oil and gas properties: Impairment expense increased $17,039 or 100% for the
six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $nil for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This
increase is attributable to additional impairment on our Buck Peak prospect wells.
Interest income (expense): During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized interest
income of $501 compared to $3 in the six months ended June 30, 2015.  During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, we recognized interest expense of $56,896 compared to $10,740 in the six
months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of 81%.  The interest expense recognized in the
current period relates to the accrued interest on the outstanding balance on our line of credit.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
To date, we have generated essentially all of our capital resources through the sale of common stock, prospect fees
received from working interest partners, drilling advances from working interest partners, and advances under our line
of credit. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we received $95,000 in proceeds from the sale of our common
stock through a private placement. To date, we have generated nominal cash from operations and negative cash
flows from operating activities.
Our line of credit provides us capital to pay for development and additional drilling and leasing activities.  The amount
we invest in development, drilling, and leasing activities depends on, among other factors, opportunities presented to
us and the success of any fundraising efforts. In the event we are successful in raising additional capital through
equity offerings, we may elect to use some of those proceeds to pay down some or all of the borrowings under the
line of credit. The most significant of our future capital requirements include (i) costs to drill or participate in additional
wells; (ii) costs to acquire additional acreage that we may identify in the Southern Core area or other areas that we
may identify; (iii) approximately $200,000 per month for salaries and other corporate overhead; and (iv) legal and
accounting fees associated with our status as a public company required to file reports with the SEC. We anticipate
funding these projected capital requirements with cash on hand, proceeds from the sale of common stock and/or the
line of credit.
Working Capital
As of June 30, 2016, we had working capital of $1,825,907, comprised of current assets of $2,557,837 and current
liabilities of $731,930. Working capital decreased by $1,285,582 from December 31, 2015, due to cash used in
operations and the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties and related assets.  We expect that our working
capital will continue to decrease as we acquire additional properties and participate in drilling of wells on our
properties. Our remaining line of credit, cash on hand, and anticipated revenue from our producing wells provide us
with additional liquidity to operate our business, and we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital for the next
12 months. On August 12, 2016, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC, through which we are
seeking to raise up to $27 million. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional working capital, we may have to reduce
or abandon planned drilling projects and other acquisitions.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 we sold 95,000 shares of our common stock through a private placement
for proceeds of $95,000. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 we also borrowed $3,600,000 against our line of
credit on various dates to pay

for our share of our acquisitions of crude oil and natural gas properties and to fund general and administrative
expenses related to the acquisition.
Cash Flows
Six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to June 30, 2015
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $652,699 compared to $432,112
during the six months ended June 30, 2015, representing an increase of $220,587. A significant increase in our net
loss for the 2016 period was partially offset by the decrease in the 2016 period of several items, including (i) a
significant increase in share-based compensation and net accrued liabilities recorded for the acquisition of crude oil
and natural gas properties in the Todd Creek Farms prospect; (ii) satisfaction of accounts payable and accrued
liabilities incurred in connection with drilling and completion of the Buck Peak wells; and (iii) payment of drilling
advances on behalf of our working interest partners in the 2015 period.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $4,079,165 compared to
$800,623 during the six months ended June 30, 2015, representing an increase of $3,278,542. During the 2016 period,
we recorded net acquisitions of $3,479,823 related to the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties, including
a business combination of $2,305,917, in our Todd Creek Farms prospect, additions of $14,158 in furniture, fixtures
and equipment, and development of crude oil and natural gas properties of $585,184. During the 2015 period, we
recorded net acquisitions of $785,630 related to the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties in our Todd
Creek Farms prospect, $nil in additions of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and we paid $14,993 for our share of the
development of our properties.
Financing Activities
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we borrowed $3,600,000 on the line of credit from Providence, compared
to borrowing on the line of credit of $1,000,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2015.  As of June 30, 2016, we
had drawn approximately $4.66 million against our line of credit.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we sold 95,000 shares of our common stock at $1.00 per share for gross
proceeds of $95,000.  During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we sold 340,000 shares of our common stock at
$1.00 per share for gross proceeds of $340,000, less offering costs of $290,800 pursuant to our public offering.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or obligations.

Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
The important factors that could affect the accuracy of forward-looking statements and prevent us from achieving our
stated goals and objectives include, but are not limited to:
·                              Changes in the general economy affecting the disposable income of the public;

production and the impact of these facilities on price;
·                              The level of demand for the production of crude oil and natural gas;
·                              Changes in our business strategy;
·                              Potential failure to achieve production from development drilling projects; and

Those factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report are difficult to predict and expressly qualify all
subsequent oral and written forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. In light of
these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not have any

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), the phrase “disclosure controls and procedures” means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  We conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016.  This
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Table of Contents
Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding
of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements
on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 1A.   Risk Factors
18
PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION
Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You
should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our financial statements and related notes, and in our Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015 and the other reports we file with the SEC. The following risk factors update and
supplement the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and other reports subsequently filed with the SEC.
Our Southern Core area assets, including the PDC assets, may be less valuable to us than expected.
We have made several oil and gas acquisitions in the Southern Core area since January 1, 2016. Most significantly,
effective April 1, 2016, we acquired the PDC assets from PDC. The PDC assets include leases covering
approximately 3,652 gross (1,410 net) acres of lands located in Adams County, Colorado and PDC’s interest in 35
wells that are currently producing, and 8 wells that are permitted. Much of the acreage we acquired from PDC is within
our Todd Creek Farms prospect while the remainder of the acreage is located in outlying areas of Adams County and
is prospective for formations other than the Niobrara and Codell.
The value of our Southern Core area assets, including the PDC assets, is based in large part on our ability to develop
the properties and increase proven and probable reserves. This, in turn, requires us to make accurate estimates of our
capital needs to implement and continue a development program for those properties, to obtain that capital and to
successfully drill the wells. We may not be able to obtain the capital necessary to develop these properties or our
development efforts may not be successful. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital or successfully develop
these properties, the price of our stock may decline.
The due diligence undertaken in connection with the acquisition of the PDC assets and other recent
acquisitions may not have revealed all relevant considerations or liabilities related to those assets, which
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
In addition to our acquisition of the PDC assets, we have also entered into several asset purchase agreements to
date, acquiring certain oil and gas assets and surface rights and easements on lands located within our Todd Creek
Farms prospect. The due diligence undertaken by us in connection with the acquisition of the PDC assets or other
properties may not have revealed all relevant facts that may be necessary to evaluate such acquisitions. The
information provided to us in connection with our diligence may have been incomplete or inaccurate. As part of that
process, we have also made subjective judgments regarding the results of operations and prospects of the PDC and
other assets. If the due diligence investigation has failed to correctly identify material issues and liabilities that may
be present, such as title defects or environmental problems, we may incur substantial impairment charges or other
losses in the future. In addition, we may be subject to significant, previously undisclosed liabilities that were not
identified during the due diligence process and which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations.

Each of the foregoing transactions was completed pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. In each transaction, we did not engage in any general solicitation or advertising
and we offered the securities to a limited number of persons with whom we had pre-existing relationships. We
exercised reasonable care to ensure that the purchasers of securities were not underwriters within the meaning of the
Securities Act, including making reasonable inquiry prior to accepting any subscription, making written disclosure
regarding the restricted nature of the securities and placing a legend on the certificates representing the shares. Stop
transfer restrictions were placed with our transfer agent and a restrictive legend was placed on the certificate in
connection with these offerings. In addition, the shares were issued exclusively to what the Company reasonably
believed were accredited investors as defined in Rule 501 of the Securities Act.
Public Offering
We filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-198881) in connection with our initial public offering, which
was originally declared effective by the SEC on February 4, 2015. On July 15, 2015, we filed a post-effective
