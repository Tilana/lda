</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> I. Context 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 21 and 22 May 2014, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
</p>
<p>women and children, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo,1 convened the second consultative meeting on 
</p>
<p>strengthening partnerships with national rapporteurs on trafficking in persons and 
</p>
<p>equivalent mechanisms, in partnership with the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
</p>
<p>Crime (UNODC). The meeting, which took place in Bangkok, aimed to provide an 
</p>
<p>opportunity to continue sharing experiences and lessons learned among national rapporteurs 
</p>
<p>on trafficking in persons and equivalent mechanisms, and to strengthen further the 
</p>
<p>partnership between her mandate and those mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>2. The global consultation brought together 46 participants, including national 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs and representatives of equivalent mechanisms from 26 countries in different 
</p>
<p>regions of the world, and representatives of relevant United Nations, international and 
</p>
<p>regional organizations. 
</p>
<p>3. The setting up and strengthening of national coordinating mechanisms as a means of 
</p>
<p>effectively addressing trafficking in persons has been the subject of much international 
</p>
<p>attention. In the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, 
</p>
<p>States Members encourage effective cooperation and coordination of efforts at the national, 
</p>
<p>bilateral, subregional, regional and international levels, and through the networks provided 
</p>
<p>by relevant organizations to share best practices in capacity-building for responding to and 
</p>
<p>combating trafficking in persons.2 In several of its resolutions, the General Assembly has 
</p>
<p>encouraged States to consider setting up or strengthening national coordinating 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, such as a national rapporteur or an inter-agency body, to encourage the 
</p>
<p>exchange of information and to report on data, root causes, factors and trends in violence 
</p>
<p>against women, in particular trafficking.3 In its resolution 68/192, the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>invited the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the Working Group 
</p>
<p>on Trafficking in Persons, pursuant to the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
</p>
<p>Organized Crime, to consider the need for meetings of representatives of national 
</p>
<p>coordinating mechanisms on combating trafficking in persons, with a view to facilitating, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, better international coordination and information exchange on good practices to 
</p>
<p>address the problem of trafficking in persons. Likewise, in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, 
</p>
<p>contained in the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to the 
</p>
<p>Economic and Social Council (E/2002/68/Add.1), States and, where applicable, 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, should consider establishing 
</p>
<p>mechanisms to monitor the human rights impact of anti-trafficking laws, policies, 
</p>
<p>programmes and interventions.4 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The present report is submitted by Ms. Giammarinaro, who took up her functions in July 2014, after 
</p>
<p>the second consultation with national rapporteurs on trafficking in persons and equivalent 
</p>
<p>mechanisms had taken place in May 2014. All references to the Special Rapporteur in the present 
</p>
<p>report are therefore to Ms. Ezeilo. 
</p>
<p> 2 General Assembly resolution 64/293, annex, para. 51.  
</p>
<p> 3  See, for example, General Assembly resolutions 59/166, 61/144 and 63/156 on trafficking in women 
</p>
<p>and girls. 
4  In accordance with article 9 of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
</p>
<p>Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Transnational Organized Crime (the Palermo Protocol), States are required to establish 
</p>
<p>comprehensive policies, programmes and other measures to prevent and combat trafficking in 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>4. At the regional level, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Human Beings encourages States parties to consider appointing national 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs or other mechanisms to monitor the anti-trafficking activities of State 
</p>
<p>institutions and the implementation of national legislation (art. 29). The scope and mandate 
</p>
<p>of those mechanisms is clearly defined in directive 2011/36/EU of 5 April 2011 of the 
</p>
<p>European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union on preventing and 
</p>
<p>combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims. 
</p>
<p>5. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur, set out in Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>8/12, includes identifying and sharing best practices, proposing adequate responses to 
</p>
<p>challenges and obstacles in order to uphold and protect the human rights of victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking, identifying gaps in protection, and emphasizing practical solutions, including 
</p>
<p>through international cooperation, with a view to protecting the human rights of actual or 
</p>
<p>potential victims of trafficking. Based on her research and her ensuing report to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council at its tenth session, the Special Rapporteur recommended that States should 
</p>
<p>consider the appointment of a national rapporteur who would liaise with the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur to gather, exchange and process information on trafficking in persons, and 
</p>
<p>monitor and evaluate anti-trafficking action (A/HRC/10/16, p. 27). The analysis and data 
</p>
<p>provided by national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms can be instrumental in 
</p>
<p>measuring the effectiveness of the steps taken to prevent human trafficking, prosecute 
</p>
<p>alleged perpetrators and protect victims. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur has long maintained the need for better cooperation among 
</p>
<p>countries of origin, transit and destination in order to address effectively the serious 
</p>
<p>challenge to humanity posed by the phenomenon of trafficking in persons. In her report to 
</p>
<p>the fourteenth session of the Human Rights Council, she recognized the key role of regional 
</p>
<p>and subregional mechanisms in providing an anti-trafficking response that is both 
</p>
<p>multilateral and sufficiently close to countries&#8217; realities and specificities within a certain 
</p>
<p>region (A/HRC/14/32, para. 2). Furthermore, participants in a consultation on the role of 
</p>
<p>regional and subregional mechanisms in international efforts to counter trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons, especially women and children, convened in Dakar in October 2010 by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, emphasized that a prerequisite to effective and wider cooperation was effective 
</p>
<p>coordination at the national and regional levels through structures such as focal points, 
</p>
<p>coordinators or rapporteurs. In February 2012, in the spirit of cooperation and sharing of 
</p>
<p>experience, the Special Rapporteur participated in a meeting of the informal network of 
</p>
<p>European Union national rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms, organized by the European 
</p>
<p>Commission and the European Union Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, at which the 
</p>
<p>participants shared information on their work and activities and held discussions on the 
</p>
<p>challenges of, and good practices for, implementing the existing national referral 
</p>
<p>mechanisms; the advantages of having transnational referral mechanisms; and the issues of 
</p>
<p>victim identification and safe return to prevent retrafficking. 
</p>
<p>7. On 23 and 24 May 2013 in Berlin, as a follow-up to the discussions and initiatives 
</p>
<p>mentioned above and in the framework of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur convened 
</p>
<p>the first consultative meeting on strengthening partnerships with national rapporteurs on 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons and equivalent mechanisms. The objective was to promote the 
</p>
<p>exchange of information on trends, good practices and lessons learned from the activities of 
</p>
<p>various national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms; consider and discuss possible 
</p>
<p>ways of promoting partnerships and cooperation between national rapporteurs and 
</p>
<p>equivalent mechanisms from various regions of the world; and provide an opportunity for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>persons, which should, as appropriate, include cooperation with non-governmental organizations, 
</p>
<p>other relevant organizations and other elements of civil society. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>the 40 participants from 19 countries and representatives of relevant United Nations, 
</p>
<p>international and regional organizations to meet one another and create and enhance 
</p>
<p>networking opportunities between national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms from 
</p>
<p>countries in different regions.  
</p>
<p>8. The outcome of the consultation was a set of recommendations, based on the 
</p>
<p>observations and conclusions of the participants, for fostering cooperation and sharing 
</p>
<p>expertise and good practice among national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms from 
</p>
<p>different regions of the world. The recommendations are contained in the report of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, on the 
</p>
<p>consultative meeting on strengthening partnerships with national rapporteurs on trafficking 
</p>
<p>in persons and equivalent mechanisms (Berlin, 23&#8211;24 May 2013) (A/HRC/26/37/Add.1, 
</p>
<p>annex). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>9. The second consultative meeting was opened by Laurent Meillan, Officer-in-Charge 
</p>
<p>at the OHCHR Regional Office for South-East Asia, who welcomed the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and all the participants to 
</p>
<p>Bangkok. Mr. Meillan congratulated the Special Rapporteur for the ground-breaking work 
</p>
<p>she had undertaken during her mandate by giving voices to victims. He also underlined the 
</p>
<p>fact that partnership and cooperation were among the central tenets of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s approach to combating trafficking in persons, which included advocacy for 
</p>
<p>the establishment of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms and regular 
</p>
<p>consultations with stakeholders at the national, subregional, regional and international 
</p>
<p>levels. In his welcoming remarks Sebastian Baumeister, Project Coordinator at the UNODC 
</p>
<p>Regional Office in Bangkok, pointed out some of the key challenges faced in South-East 
</p>
<p>Asia, such as the hidden nature of trafficking in persons, the small number of identified and 
</p>
<p>supported victims, the low conviction rates and the overall insufficient awareness about the 
</p>
<p>crime of human trafficking. He also noted that migrant smuggling, as a main driver of 
</p>
<p>irregular migration, significantly contributed to fuelling human trafficking. He called on 
</p>
<p>participants to use the consultative meeting as an opportunity to strengthen the network 
</p>
<p>between national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms. In her remarks, Joy Ngozi 
</p>
<p>Ezeilo, Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
</p>
<p>explained the objective of the meeting and recalled that international bodies had for a long 
</p>
<p>time been making a compelling call for the establishment of national rapporteurs and 
</p>
<p>equivalent mechanisms to monitor the situation of human trafficking within countries, but 
</p>
<p>also to evaluate the degree of implementation of existing legislation and the effectiveness of 
</p>
<p>national action plans and policies, as well as strengthening the gathering and use of data 
</p>
<p>and reporting on trafficking in human beings. She noted that, in exercising her mandate, she 
</p>
<p>had consistently advocated for the importance of such mechanisms and emphasized that 
</p>
<p>cooperation and exchange of expertise and good practices among countries would 
</p>
<p>contribute to raising the effectiveness of anti-trafficking efforts. 
</p>
<p>10. The objectives and expected outcomes of the second consultative meeting were: 
</p>
<p>(a) to deepen discussion on the importance and benefits of establishing and implementing 
</p>
<p>the mandate of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms; (b) to promote the 
</p>
<p>exchange of information on current trends, good practices and lessons learned from the 
</p>
<p>activities of various national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms carrying out similar 
</p>
<p>functions, including national coordinating mechanisms; and (c) to provide a forum for 
</p>
<p>developing and enhancing networking between national rapporteurs and equivalent 
</p>
<p>mechanisms across countries and regions.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>11. The agenda of the consultative meeting was divided into five sessions, covering 
</p>
<p>different aspects of strengthening the role of national rapporteurs on trafficking in persons 
</p>
<p>and equivalent mechanisms and the potential for cooperation and coordination between 
</p>
<p>them and with other regional, State and non-State actors (see appendix).5  
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of the discussions held during the consultative 
meeting 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The role of national rapporteurs on trafficking in persons and 
</b></p>
<p><b>equivalent mechanisms in addressing trafficking in persons: 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. Presentations on the institutional framework were made by national rapporteurs and 
</p>
<p>representatives of equivalent mechanisms from Brazil, Israel, Nepal and Nigeria. While 
</p>
<p>noting the differences and similarities between such bodies, speakers and participants 
</p>
<p>highlighted the following key functions and responsibilities in achieving the common goal 
</p>
<p>of responding to and combating trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>13. Some of the key functions of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms were 
</p>
<p>identified as the collection of information on trafficking in persons, analysis of its root 
</p>
<p>causes, nature, extent and type, and the identification of emerging trends in trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons, all with a view to contributing to the development of effective anti-trafficking 
</p>
<p>policies, programmes and interventions. In Finland, the national rapporteur has identified 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons for sexual exploitation as an emerging form of trafficking which has, 
</p>
<p>until recently, been underreported. In Nigeria, the National Agency for the Prohibition of 
</p>
<p>Traffic in Persons and Other Related Matters is mandated to conduct research on the root 
</p>
<p>causes of trafficking in persons, and in Uganda, the establishment of a national databank on 
</p>
<p>cases of trafficking in persons is one of the functions of the Coordination Office to Combat 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons. 
</p>
<p>14. Monitoring and evaluating the impact of existing anti-trafficking legislation and 
</p>
<p>policies, revising existing laws and guidelines in line with international standards, and 
</p>
<p>proposing new legislation and standard operating procedures for their uniform 
</p>
<p>implementation also emerged as functions of national rapporteurs and equivalent 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. In Israel, the National Anti-Trafficking Coordinator contributed to the 
</p>
<p>promulgation of anti-trafficking legislation at the beginning of her mandate. 
</p>
<p>Representatives from Finland, the Philippines and Uganda have proposed revisions of 
</p>
<p>existing laws and regulations related to various aspects of trafficking in persons. The 
</p>
<p>mechanisms in India, Nigeria and Uganda have developed standard operating procedures to 
</p>
<p>enable stakeholders to harmonize their anti-trafficking actions. 
</p>
<p>15. Some mechanisms are involved in the prosecution and punishment of traffickers. In 
</p>
<p>Nepal, they conduct investigations and fact-finding missions and in Nigeria, they are 
</p>
<p>involved in investigating and prosecuting traffickers.  
</p>
<p>16. With regard to redress, recovery and reintegration of victims of trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons, several national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms have proposed the 
</p>
<p>establishment of relevant institutions, including shelters for male and female victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking in Israel and a one-stop victims&#8217; assistance centre in the Philippines. The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 The agenda of the meeting is also available from 
</p>
<p>www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Trafficking/Pages/2ndConsultativeMeeting2014.aspx. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>mechanism in Uganda has been considering turning the Coordination Office into a one-stop 
</p>
<p>operational agency for all counter-human trafficking activities in order to improve the 
</p>
<p>protection of victims and enhance preventive strategies. The mechanism in the United Arab 
</p>
<p>Emirates works closely with shelters where victims of trafficking in persons, especially 
</p>
<p>women and children, stay. It also supports a newly established shelter for male victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>17. Cooperation and coordination among all stakeholders within a country, as well as 
</p>
<p>capacity-building among concerned stakeholders and raising public awareness, were 
</p>
<p>identified as other key tasks of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms. In Finland 
</p>
<p>and Nepal, that includes periodic reporting on trafficking in persons to Parliament and 
</p>
<p>Government, which also serves to raise awareness among officials. In Latvia, those tasks 
</p>
<p>are achieved by sharing best practices among stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>18. Some national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms are involved in the promotion 
</p>
<p>of cooperation and partnership at the bilateral, subregional, regional and international 
</p>
<p>levels. In Nigeria, the National Agency for the Prohibition of Traffic in Persons and Other 
</p>
<p>Related Matters cooperates and assists national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms in 
</p>
<p>West Africa and other parts of the world and reinforces anti-trafficking measures in 
</p>
<p>bilateral and multilateral agreements. The mechanism in Nepal has proposed a 
</p>
<p>memorandum of understanding with Malaysia and Qatar on the protection of the rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants.  
</p>
<p>19. With regard to the type of national coordinating mechanism that could best address 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons, a variety of models of national rapporteurs and equivalent 
</p>
<p>mechanisms emerged, namely inter-agency coordinating structures, stand-alone institutions, 
</p>
<p>offices within government institutions and institutions that are integrated into a broad-based 
</p>
<p>human rights institution. The possible advantages and disadvantages of each coordinating 
</p>
<p>mechanism were discussed on the basis of factors such as the size of the country, its 
</p>
<p>geographical location, the extent of the problem and the availability of resources. 
</p>
<p>20. Besides serving as a platform for concerned Governments and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>actors involved in the fight against trafficking in persons, the main benefit of an inter-
</p>
<p>agency coordinating structure is the maximized utilization of existing human, financial and 
</p>
<p>material resources to address the multifaceted phenomenon of trafficking in persons 
</p>
<p>through a multi-stakeholder response. Given their nature and the importance of networking, 
</p>
<p>coordinating mechanisms can act as peer support groups and provide forums for sharing 
</p>
<p>experiences and ideas and discussing areas of common concern and joint strategies, as well 
</p>
<p>as offering visibility and fostering collaboration and compliance with international 
</p>
<p>standards. The government institutions most involved in combating trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p>such as the Ministry of Justice in Brazil, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs in Bahrain and 
</p>
<p>the United Arab Emirates, the Ministries of the Interior in Latvia and Uganda and the 
</p>
<p>Ministry for Public Welfare in Indonesia, head those inter-agency structures. Often, the 
</p>
<p>choice of ministry as the lead institution can affect how trafficking in persons is 
</p>
<p>predominantly approached at the national level, for instance as a law enforcement or a 
</p>
<p>migration issue. With regard to challenges, the experience of some countries revealed that 
</p>
<p>coordination among the various members was often poor, and the individual entities often 
</p>
<p>had to deal with competing priorities in their parent institutions. Moreover, it was noted that 
</p>
<p>the funding allocated for the work of the inter-agency mechanism was found to be irregular 
</p>
<p>and insufficient. 
</p>
<p>21. Some countries have established national stand-alone institutions to address the 
</p>
<p>problem of trafficking in persons within the country. The National Agency for the 
</p>
<p>Prohibition of Traffic in Persons and Other Related Matters in Nigeria is one such 
</p>
<p>institution, with a board, an executive secretary and eight departments headed by directors. 
</p>
<p>It has a clear mandate to focus national efforts to combat the phenomenon in close </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>collaboration with government and non-governmental agencies within the country, and at 
</p>
<p>the regional and international levels. The likelihood that the mandate will remain relatively 
</p>
<p>restricted to the protection of only the most vulnerable and excluded groups, at the expense 
</p>
<p>of a comprehensive approach, was identified as the risk of stand-alone institutions.  
</p>
<p>22. Another type of national rapporteur or equivalent mechanism is a department or 
</p>
<p>office within a government institution charged with combating trafficking in persons. One 
</p>
<p>example is the Office of the National Anti-Trafficking Coordinator in Israel, which was 
</p>
<p>established under the Ministry of Justice and is tasked with promoting cooperation among 
</p>
<p>all relevant government authorities. The Office also serves as a bridge between government 
</p>
<p>authorities and non-governmental organizations, as well as facilitating cooperation with 
</p>
<p>relevant international bodies. One advantage of such an institution is the relative flexibility 
</p>
<p>it has to adapt its responses to changing trends in trafficking, although coordination among 
</p>
<p>stakeholders could be a challenge. 
</p>
<p>23. The benefits of a mechanism to address trafficking in persons that is independent 
</p>
<p>from the Government were particularly noted by participants from Nepal, where the Office 
</p>
<p>of the Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Women and Children is part of the National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission, and from Finland, where the Ombudsman for Minorities is 
</p>
<p>appointed as a National Rapporteur. The main strength of that arrangement is the ability to 
</p>
<p>build on the interdependence and indivisibility of all human rights and mainstream the issue 
</p>
<p>across all anti-trafficking areas. Given the autonomous nature of such mechanisms, their 
</p>
<p>staff can objectively evaluate the implementation of anti-human trafficking legislation, 
</p>
<p>strategies and activities, point out existing drawbacks and make comprehensive legal and 
</p>
<p>policy recommendations. Their autonomy also increases the credibility of their actions, 
</p>
<p>which include handling complaints regarding trafficking in persons. The Office of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Women and Children in Nepal is mandated to carry 
</p>
<p>out investigations and monitor site visits. In Finland, the National Rapporteur provides 
</p>
<p>legal advice and may also assist victims of human trafficking in securing their rights. The 
</p>
<p>National Rapporteur enjoys independent collaboration with the Government, civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations (CSOs) and victims, based on trust. However, in order to ensure a unified 
</p>
<p>approach in that set-up, there is a need for willingness and incentives to undertake cross-
</p>
<p>disciplinary work in collaboration with stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>24. The representatives of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms from Latvia, 
</p>
<p>the Philippines, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates highlighted the fact that, for the 
</p>
<p>most part, those institutions were created, their objectives defined and their powers and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities conferred through legislation (acts of parliament, government resolutions or 
</p>
<p>ministerial decrees), national action plans and other adopted measures and high-level 
</p>
<p>governmental expressions of policy. Besides being an indication of the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>commitment to fighting trafficking in persons, those instruments provided legitimate 
</p>
<p>grounds for an institutionalized response and the work of national rapporteurs on trafficking 
</p>
<p>in persons and equivalent mechanisms, and allowed them access to information. They also 
</p>
<p>formed the basis for cooperation with relevant stakeholders at the national, regional and 
</p>
<p>international levels. The relative ease or difficulty of amending the provisions of those 
</p>
<p>frameworks in order to adapt to the changing anti-trafficking work of the national 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms was also noted. 
</p>
<p>25. In addition, a number of challenges and dilemmas were identified by national 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms in the course of their work. The lack of systematic 
</p>
<p>collection, exchange and analysis of information and coordination between relevant 
</p>
<p>government institutions, the judiciary, law enforcement agencies and service providers 
</p>
<p>were some of the challenges shared by presenters and participants. In Brazil, that resulted in 
</p>
<p>non-uniform implementation of existing anti-trafficking policies and legislation within the 
</p>
<p>regions of the country. The mechanisms from Bahrain, Indonesia and the Philippines found </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>the collection and management of standardized or homogenous information and data by all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders challenging. In countries where trafficking in persons for the purpose of labour 
</p>
<p>exploitation was a reality, such as the United Arab Emirates, collaboration with the private 
</p>
<p>sector to address the phenomenon jointly had proven challenging. The representatives of 
</p>
<p>Nigeria and Uganda had found that exchanging information and coordinating with other 
</p>
<p>national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms in source, transit and destination countries 
</p>
<p>was often difficult, which had a negative impact on the speedy provision of remedies to 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>26. The rapid identification of existing and emerging forms of trafficking in persons 
</p>
<p>with a view to addressing the evolving nature of trafficking in persons, including acts of 
</p>
<p>trafficking committed with sophisticated and new technology tools, was found to be 
</p>
<p>challenging. The national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms in Latvia and Nigeria 
</p>
<p>identified another problem: the slow legislative response when it came to promulgating and 
</p>
<p>amending existing anti-trafficking laws and the gaps in legislation establishing national 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms, compared with the rapidly changing phenomenon 
</p>
<p>of trafficking. The representatives of Latvia and Uganda also highlighted the inadequate 
</p>
<p>implementation of existing laws owing to a lack of awareness and capacity among the 
</p>
<p>relevant staff of the judiciary and law enforcement officers. In addition, the inadequate 
</p>
<p>level of protection provided to victims of trafficking hindered them from accessing 
</p>
<p>assistance. In Nigeria, the fear of reprisals by traffickers hindered victims of trafficking 
</p>
<p>from benefiting from such assistance. The absence of referral mechanisms for victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking was also a challenge noted by the representative of Latvia. 
</p>
<p>27. Another concern faced by national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms relates to 
</p>
<p>human resources. That includes high staff turnover in Indonesia and delays in replacing key 
</p>
<p>staff, such as in Nepal, where the position of Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Women 
</p>
<p>and Children has been vacant since 2012. The representatives of Brazil, Nigeria and 
</p>
<p>Uganda also mentioned different levels of commitment and, at times, the limited awareness 
</p>
<p>of trafficking in persons among staff. The staff of the Ugandan Coordination Office to 
</p>
<p>Combat Trafficking in Persons had found that the lack of control over members of the task 
</p>
<p>force who were scattered in different ministries and their heavy workloads within their 
</p>
<p>parent government institutions left them with limited time to dedicate to their anti-
</p>
<p>trafficking responsibilities. Financial constraints were also highlighted as a challenge that 
</p>
<p>affected the work of the national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms. The size and 
</p>
<p>cultural diversity of some countries were also identified as challenges by national 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms, as their limited resources did not enable them to be 
</p>
<p>physically present in all areas of the country and to adapt their anti-trafficking efforts to all 
</p>
<p>forms of trafficking and all victims.  
</p>
<p>28. In spite of those challenges, national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms have 
</p>
<p>been able to make concrete contributions to anti-trafficking efforts, including in the 
</p>
<p>proposal, development, implementation and monitoring of national anti-trafficking 
</p>
<p>legislation, policies and mechanisms in cooperation with government and CSO 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. Participants highlighted the need for a human rights-based and victim-centred 
</p>
<p>approach and cautioned that the fight against trafficking in persons should not encroach on 
</p>
<p>safe migration routes used by people in search of better living conditions. The 
</p>
<p>representative of Brazil mentioned that victims of trafficking for the purpose of labour 
</p>
<p>exploitation were allowed to stay in the country for up to one year, even if they did not 
</p>
<p>cooperate with the authorities. Thereafter, they could apply for permanent residence. In 
</p>
<p>Malaysia, victims of trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation who did not require 
</p>
<p>care and protection were allowed to work legally in the country. Some national rapporteurs 
</p>
<p>and equivalent mechanisms had been able to identify new trends and forms of trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons and had adapted their responses accordingly (see para. 13 above). The mechanisms 
</p>
<p>in Israel, Morocco and Uganda had played a role in proposing new anti-trafficking </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>legislation, while the mechanisms in Nigeria and the Philippines were working towards the 
</p>
<p>amendment of existing laws in order to address gaps, in line with the rapidly changing 
</p>
<p>phenomenon of trafficking in persons. The mechanisms in Israel and the Philippines had 
</p>
<p>been instrumental in putting in place or strengthening anti-trafficking task forces. In 
</p>
<p>Nigeria, a trust fund for victims of trafficking in persons had been set up, financed from the 
</p>
<p>sale of confiscated assets of convicted traffickers, and a national referral mechanism had 
</p>
<p>been developed. The mechanisms in the Philippines and Uganda were exploring the 
</p>
<p>possibility of setting up one-stop victim assistance centres. 
</p>
<p>29. Generally, all national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms are involved in 
</p>
<p>advocacy and awareness-raising activities on the problem of trafficking, targeting all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including front line officials such as the judiciary and the police, and CSOs. 
</p>
<p>Periodic reports to higher public bodies on progress in implementing national plans of 
</p>
<p>action, such as those submitted by the Brazilian and Finnish mechanisms, provide an 
</p>
<p>opportunity to indirectly raise awareness of political leaders and policymakers about 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons. As a result of the 2010 report to Parliament of the Finnish National 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings, Parliament required the Government to take 
</p>
<p>specific action to enhance victim identification, assistance and protection, and to improve 
</p>
<p>pretrial investigation and prosecution processes. In Nigeria, the National Agency for the 
</p>
<p>Prohibition of Traffic in Persons and Other Related Matters found that, by highlighting the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of trafficking in persons on the nationwide aspiration to economic 
</p>
<p>development, security and good governance, people accepted that the issue was the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of both the Government and society. Since 2007, the mechanism in 
</p>
<p>Cambodia has been using the commemoration of a national anti-trafficking day to raise 
</p>
<p>awareness nationwide about trafficking in persons. Numerous publications and media 
</p>
<p>campaigns are also used in many countries to raise awareness about trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>In Colombia, India and Mexico, films and soap operas on the topic have been produced for 
</p>
<p>cinema and television. A number of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms also 
</p>
<p>have websites that contain awareness-raising material and contact information that can be 
</p>
<p>widely accessed. 
</p>
<p>30. The national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms in Nigeria and the United Arab 
</p>
<p>Emirates have contributed to the processes of proposing, drafting and entering into bilateral 
</p>
<p>and multilateral agreements with other countries in order to address cross-border trafficking 
</p>
<p>in persons (see para. 39 below). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional and subregional frameworks supporting the work of national 
</b></p>
<p><b>rapporteurs on trafficking in persons and equivalent mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>31. Representatives of the Organization of American States, the Association of 
</p>
<p>Southeast Asian Nations Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Women and Children, and United Nations Action for Cooperation against Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons made presentations on how national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms could 
</p>
<p>be strengthened to enable them to fight trafficking effectively at the regional and 
</p>
<p>subregional levels. They recognized the catalytic role of national rapporteurs and equivalent 
</p>
<p>mechanisms in generating political will at the national level, which could then be translated 
</p>
<p>into implementing subregional and regional anti-trafficking polices that were based on 
</p>
<p>human rights and national legislation. 
</p>
<p>32. The experience of cooperation between India and the South Asian Association for 
</p>
<p>Regional Cooperation (SAARC) demonstrated how a national rapporteur or equivalent 
</p>
<p>mechanism could contribute to fighting trafficking in persons at the regional level. India 
</p>
<p>has developed standard operating procedures for implementing the SAARC Convention on 
</p>
<p>Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children, which has been ratified by </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>all SAARC member States. Two toll-free numbers, one for children and the other for 
</p>
<p>women, have also been set up in India and can be used by the secretariat of SAARC. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, in 2013, India hosted a group of SAARC member States on a study tour to learn 
</p>
<p>from the experiences of the Indian Integrated Anti-Human Trafficking Units.  
</p>
<p>33. The importance of bilateral cooperation agreements between national rapporteurs 
</p>
<p>and equivalent mechanisms, in addition to the regional framework, was also mentioned by 
</p>
<p>participants, who noted that such cooperation constituted good practice. It allowed the 
</p>
<p>authorities to really tailor anti-trafficking measures to the specific issues in both countries. 
</p>
<p>The representatives from Cambodia indicated that their country had consolidated its 
</p>
<p>cooperation with Malaysia beyond the framework of the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial 
</p>
<p>Initiative against Trafficking (COMMIT), through bilateral agreements. Indonesia had also 
</p>
<p>entered into bilateral cooperation with countries within the region and beyond. The 
</p>
<p>representative of the mechanism from Finland highlighted the need for such cooperation, in 
</p>
<p>particular between countries in which national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms had 
</p>
<p>similar mandates and tasks. 
</p>
<p>34. The representatives of the mechanisms in Brazil and Mexico recommended that 
</p>
<p>national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms should support anti-trafficking work at the 
</p>
<p>regional level by sharing their awareness-raising materials, including soap operas and other 
</p>
<p>media coverage, with the Organization of American States. They also noted that such 
</p>
<p>cooperation could be an effective means of reducing the costs of producing such materials 
</p>
<p>for regional mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>35. Participants also highlighted the fact that regional and subregional mechanisms were 
</p>
<p>in a unique position to support the efforts and build the capacity of national rapporteurs and 
</p>
<p>equivalent mechanisms so as to encourage a uniform anti-trafficking response that was both 
</p>
<p>multilateral and sufficiently close to countries&#8217; realities and specificities within a certain 
</p>
<p>region. Existing regional mechanisms or new structures dedicated to combating trafficking 
</p>
<p>in persons within existing regional human rights mechanisms could provide technical 
</p>
<p>assistance in drafting legislation, developing specific tools such as guidelines and standard 
</p>
<p>operating procedures, trainings practitioners and commissioning studies, as well as 
</p>
<p>monitoring and evaluating the work of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms at 
</p>
<p>the regional level. The representative of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
</p>
<p>Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children noted 
</p>
<p>that gender-sensitive guidelines for dealing with victims of trafficking were currently being 
</p>
<p>developed. The aim of the guidelines was to address similar problem of trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons within the region in a uniform manner. The guidelines were expected to be put into 
</p>
<p>practice following a consultative meeting with all member States in September 2014. 
</p>
<p>National rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms were expected to complement that 
</p>
<p>regional initiative by playing a crucial role in its implementation and ensuring that the 
</p>
<p>guidelines were applied at the national level.  
</p>
<p>36. It was noted that regional and subregional mechanisms could also serve as platforms 
</p>
<p>on which national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms could exchange information and 
</p>
<p>learn from each other in order to address the dynamic nature of trafficking in persons in the 
</p>
<p>region. That could be done through initiatives aimed at addressing cross-border trafficking 
</p>
<p>in persons, sharing information, including good practices, tools and databases among 
</p>
<p>agencies. The representative of the mechanism from Finland also noted that regional 
</p>
<p>mechanisms facilitate the work of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms by 
</p>
<p>keeping trafficking in persons on the regional agenda and encouraging Governments to act 
</p>
<p>at the national level.  
</p>
<p>37. Participants emphasized the fact that, in order to fight trafficking in persons at the 
</p>
<p>regional and subregional levels, it was first necessary to strengthen coordination between 
</p>
<p>the different regional and subregional bodies involved in combating trafficking in persons. </p>

<p><b> C. Fostering partnership among national rapporteurs on trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons and equivalent mechanisms: challenges, dilemmas and 
</b></p>
<p><b>lessons learned  
</b></p>
<p>38. The representatives of Bahrain, Colombia, Finland and Indonesia identified the 
</p>
<p>challenges and dilemmas faced by national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms in 
</p>
<p>fostering partnership between themselves. The difference in the mandates and duties of 
</p>
<p>national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms, highlighted by the Finnish representative, 
</p>
<p>and the lack of information about the existence of those mechanisms and how to reach 
</p>
<p>them, raised by the representatives of China and India, were identified as the main 
</p>
<p>difficulties. In addition, the Indonesian representative mentioned that the ad hoc nature of 
</p>
<p>some of the partnerships, and staff turnover within the offices of national rapporteurs and 
</p>
<p>equivalent mechanisms affected continued coordination and partnerships with similar 
</p>
<p>mechanisms in other countries. 
</p>
<p>39. In the discussions, participants considered how national rapporteurs and equivalent 
</p>
<p>mechanisms could increasingly and substantially coordinate among themselves in order to 
</p>
<p>complement regional and international efforts. The representative of the mechanism in 
</p>
<p>Finland mentioned that bilateral cooperation between countries in which national 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms had similar mandates and functions facilitated 
</p>
<p>cooperation. The representative of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Traffic in 
</p>
<p>Persons and Other Related Matters in Nigeria added that formal memorandums of 
</p>
<p>understanding with sister national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms in source, transit 
</p>
<p>and destination countries also established a framework for national rapporteurs and 
</p>
<p>equivalent mechanisms to work together, including solving cases of cross-border trafficking 
</p>
<p>in persons. The representative of the Indonesian mechanism highlighted the fact that 
</p>
<p>capacity-building of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms could facilitate 
</p>
<p>exchanges of experience and information in a uniform manner.  
</p>
<p>40. The initiative of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women 
</p>
<p>and children, to convene annual consultative meetings for national rapporteurs and 
</p>
<p>equivalent mechanisms was also seen as another good practice that would bolster contact 
</p>
<p>and coordination among those mechanisms and complement national, regional and 
</p>
<p>international anti-trafficking efforts. Participants called on the Special Rapporteur to 
</p>
<p>continue providing a forum for networking between national rapporteurs and equivalent 
</p>
<p>mechanisms by convening periodic consultative meetings on specific themes. The 
</p>
<p>representative of the mechanism from Morocco proposed that the issue of trafficking 
</p>
<p>should be on the agenda of the International Conference of National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Institutions, just as the issue of migration had been discussed at the Eighth International 
</p>
<p>Conference of National Human Rights Institutions, held in 2006. The representative of 
</p>
<p>Malaysia proposed that a forum for joint events between national human rights institutions 
</p>
<p>and national rapporteurs on trafficking in persons and equivalent mechanisms could 
</p>
<p>contribute to addressing the issue from different angles. In addition to existing websites 
</p>
<p>with lists of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms, the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>network of participants in the first and second consultative meetings for national 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms convened by the Special Rapporteur, with a 
</p>
<p>mailing list, was proposed as an initial means of ensuring that the anti-trafficking 
</p>
<p>mechanisms could maintain contact, exchange information and coordinate their work.  </p>

<p><b> D. Fostering cooperation between national rapporteurs and equivalent 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms and State and non-State actors in destination, transit and 
</b></p>
<p><b>source countries 
</b></p>
<p>41. The question of how national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms could 
</p>
<p>cooperate with State actors in destination, transit and source countries, while retaining 
</p>
<p>independence and impartiality, was addressed in the presentations of the representatives of 
</p>
<p>India, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco and Romania. While memorandums of understanding 
</p>
<p>with other countries were identified as the most common form of cooperation, the 
</p>
<p>representative of India stated that India cooperated with Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal on 
</p>
<p>the basis of standard operating procedures to ensure coordination in the repatriation of 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking in persons, and mentioned that Bangladesh and India had set up a 
</p>
<p>joint task force to fight trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>42. The role of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms in strengthening 
</p>
<p>cooperation with non-State actors was also discussed. It was noted that non-State actors 
</p>
<p>should include not only CSOs, but also victims of trafficking in persons, business, medical 
</p>
<p>and faith-based communities. The representatives of Bahrain and Brazil mentioned the 
</p>
<p>benefits of involving religious leaders, who could authoritatively influence a large portion 
</p>
<p>of the population, in the fight against trafficking. The representative of Israel said that an 
</p>
<p>effective way to engage the business community in the fight against trafficking in persons 
</p>
<p>was to emphasize the negative impact of trafficking on the profits that businesses had to 
</p>
<p>make. In Mexico, the Ministry of the Economy was part of the intersectoral committee that 
</p>
<p>constituted the equivalent mechanism there; it had established a compliance code for the 
</p>
<p>tourism sector and was involving that sector in its campaign against child trafficking. In the 
</p>
<p>Philippines, the tourism sector in one area of the country had taken the initiative of 
</p>
<p>declaring zero tolerance for trafficking in persons and was reporting any cases that it 
</p>
<p>identified to the relevant authorities. The Special Rapporteur informed participants about 
</p>
<p>her work with business enterprises and medical professionals in the preparation of her 
</p>
<p>reports on the issue of trafficking in persons in supply chains (A/67/261), benchmarks and 
</p>
<p>indicators for ensuring trafficking-free supply chains (A/HRC/23/48/Add.4, appendix I), 
</p>
<p>and her thematic analysis of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal 
</p>
<p>(A/68/256).  
</p>
<p>43. The value of collaborating with CSOs who were close to the affected groups and 
</p>
<p>individuals by involving them in national plans of action and other activities and by 
</p>
<p>supporting their work was also recognized by all. Building the capacities of CSOs and 
</p>
<p>providing resources to enable them to conduct their anti-trafficking work, including by 
</p>
<p>sharing tools for the collection of information and the monitoring and evaluation of anti-
</p>
<p>trafficking work in a uniform manner, was deemed important. In terms of challenges, the 
</p>
<p>representative of Israel mentioned the reluctance of some CSOs to benefit from government 
</p>
<p>funding to conduct their work, while the representative of Indonesia noted the limited 
</p>
<p>resources and capacities of some CSOs, which resulted in delays in the provision of regular 
</p>
<p>reports to the local and national anti-trafficking task forces of which they were a part.

<p><b> (a) There is a need to build the capacities of and allocate adequate resources 
</b></p>
<p><b>to national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms with a view to facilitating, inter 
</b></p>
<p><b>alia, independent and effective collection of data, exchange of information and 
</b></p>
<p><b>coordination to address the problem of trafficking in persons. National rapporteurs 
</b></p>
<p><b>and equivalent mechanisms should also track progress in the fight against trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>in persons through monitoring, evaluating and widely disseminating information on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the impact of anti-trafficking laws, policies, programmes and interventions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) National rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms should be able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>update anti-trafficking responses in order to ensure that they are capable of reacting 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the changing nature of trafficking in persons, in collaboration with stakeholders; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) In order to better understand the roles of national rapporteurs and 
</b></p>
<p><b>equivalent mechanisms, a global baseline study should be commissioned on lessons 
</b></p>
<p><b>learned from national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms and examining trends 
</b></p>
<p><b>and providing guidance in relation to those mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>In order to enhance collaboration between regional and subregional 
</b></p>
<p><b>frameworks and national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Taking into consideration the specificities of each national rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>and equivalent mechanism, regional and subregional mechanisms should consider 
</b></p>
<p><b>developing specific anti-trafficking tools such as guidelines, standard operating 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures, training modules for use by national rapporteurs and equivalent 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms to build their capacities and encourage a uniform approach within the 
</b></p>
<p><b>region or subregion. Regional and subregional mechanisms could build on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>experience of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms, including by 
</b></p>
<p><b>disseminating training and awareness-raising materials that are already available 
</b></p>
<p><b>within the region and subregion; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The setting up of anti-trafficking monitoring mechanisms within 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional and subregional human rights systems should be considered. When such 
</b></p>
<p><b>structures already exist, coordination among the various regional bodies that are 
</b></p>
<p><b>involved in anti-trafficking work should be strengthened; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The establishment of a regional network of national rapporteurs and 
</b></p>
<p><b>equivalent mechanisms should be considered in order to address the issues involved in 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking in persons in a uniform manner, exchange information and build on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>different national experiences.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>47. <b>In order to foster cooperation between State actors and national rapporteurs 
</b></p>
<p><b>and equivalent mechanisms: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) National rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms should adopt a human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights-based and victim-centred approach in their efforts to combat trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) National rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms should enhance efforts 
</b></p>
<p><b>to strengthen partnership, cooperation and coordination with national-level actors 
</b></p>
<p><b>and encourage political will at the national level in order to address the root causes of 
</b></p>

<p><b>  </b>48. <b>In order to foster cooperation between non-State actors and national 
</b></p>
<p><b>rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The participation of all stakeholders, including victims of trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons, CSOs, academia, national human rights institutions, faith-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations and the medical and business sectors, should be sought in developing 
</b></p>
<p><b>and implementing anti-trafficking responses; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) National rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms should continue 
</b></p>
<p><b>engaging more closely with civil society organizations that are involved in combating 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking in persons and protecting and assisting victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Given the low level of engagement of non-State actors other than NGOs 
</b></p>
