<p><b>the situation of human rights in Colombia</b>*<b> </b>**<b> </b>***<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report highlights positive developments undertaken by the Government 
of Colombia to promote and protect human rights in 2011, as well as outstanding concerns. 
It further summarizes the main activities undertaken by the office in Colombia of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and proposes practical 
recommendations to improve the human rights situation. 
 In 2011, political opportunities for the promotion and protection of human rights 
expanded. The High Commissioner recognizes the Government&#8217;s efforts to strengthen the 
rule of law. Significant legislative and public policy initiatives were undertaken, human rights 
violations were condemned and action against corruption and illegal land appropriation was 
taken. However, these efforts have yet to achieve the desired results at the local level.

<p> Of particular importance were steps to address human rights violations of the 
magnitude of the extrajudicial executions in the form of &#8220;false positives&#8221; or the illegal mass 
wiretapping conducted by intelligence agencies recorded in prior years. The adoption of the 
&#8220;Victims&#8217; and Land Restitution Law&#8221; demonstrated the Government&#8217;s commitment to 
</p>
<p>upholding the rights of the victims of the internal armed conflict regardless of the identity 
of the perpetrator. Active and direct engagement by civil society, especially by victims and 
their organizations, is required to continue improving the situation. 
 A significant number of human rights and international humanitarian law violations 
are still committed, primarily by illegal armed groups, but also allegedly by State agents. 
The continuing high level of violence and the persistence of the internal armed conflict 
have serious humanitarian consequences for civilians.

</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In October 2010, the Government of Colombia and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights renewed the 1996 agreement that established the office in 
Colombia (OHCHR-Colombia), until 31 October 2013. The renewal reiterated all aspects 
of the original mandate, adding assistance to the Government in establishing a national 
human rights centre. 
</p>
<p>2. OHCHR-Colombia continued to observe the human rights situation, to provide 
national counterparts with legal advice and technical cooperation, and to promote human 
rights and international humanitarian law in the context of the internal armed conflict and 
its serious humanitarian consequences. 
</p>
<p>3. The Secretary-General visited Colombia in June. He witnessed the signing of Law 
1448 of 2011, known as the &#8220;Victims&#8217; and Land Restitution Law&#8221;, and the adoption of 
Agreement for Prosperity No. 36.  
</p>
<p>4. Colombia became a non-permanent member of the Security Council for 2011-2012. 
The Free Trade Agreement between Colombia and Canada entered into force in August and 
the Free Trade Agreement with the United States of America was signed in October. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>5. Violence caused by the internal armed conflict and its serious humanitarian 
consequences, including forced displacement, the recruitment of children and adolescents, 
and anti-personnel mine incidents, continue to affect the full enjoyment of rights. The 
Constitutional Court confirmed in 2011 the &#8220;persistence of the unconstitutional state of 
affairs&#8221; identified in 2004 regarding forced displacement.1 President Juan Manuel Santos 
publicly recognized the internal armed conflict, which was denied by previous 
Governments. This facilitates constructive dialogue with the international community, 
makes it possible to use a common language when referring to the situation in Colombia, 
and contributes to the effective implementation of international protection.   
</p>
<p>6. In November, the top commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - 
People&#8217;s Army (FARC-EP), Guillermo Le&#243;n S&#225;enz Vargas, alias &#8220;Alfonso Cano&#8221;, was 
killed in combat during a military operation. 
</p>
<p>7. Several cases of large-scale corruption in the areas of agriculture, health, drugs and 
public contracts are currently under investigation. Various public officials of the previous 
Government have been prosecuted and serious cases of corruption in Bogot&#225; raised 
particular public concern.  
</p>
<p>8. Local elections of more than 18,000 authorities were held in October. Despite 
isolated acts of violence, voting took place in an environment of calm, contrasting with 
violence and reports of fraud and corruption during the campaign. The State improved its 
inter-institutional coordination to respond to violence and illegal armed groups&#8217; attempts to 
control results. Reports of irregularities and electoral wrongdoings confirm the need to 
continue strengthening institutional controls in the regions.  
</p>
<p>9. Impunity remains a structural problem affecting the full enjoyment of rights. 
Combating it requires a criminal policy that upholds human rights, emphasizes crime 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Order 219.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>prevention and strengthens training and education. OHCHR-Colombia notes, however, that 
Law 1453 of 2011, known as the &#8220;Citizen Security Law&#8221;, prioritizes substantially higher 
penalties, restrictive grounds for release and alternatives to imprisonment, and extended 
procedural timelines. 
</p>
<p>10. The Government and the Judiciary made efforts to achieve judicial reforms through 
a participatory and consensus-based process; such efforts should be increased. These 
reforms should focus on the need to increase the efficiency and quality of the judicial 
system and improve access to justice, designing mechanisms to resolve the backlog of 
existing cases.  
</p>
<p>11. High-ranking Government members and military officers have been critical of the 
work of the United Nations, in the national media and at the international level. This 
criticism related primarily to the implementation of Security Council resolution 1612 
(2005) on children and armed conflict, and other areas of cooperation. 
</p>
<p>12. Between April 2010 and October 2011, the emergency situation caused by rains and 
flooding affected almost 3.5 million people, including 1.4 million who had previously been 
displaced.2  
</p>
<p>13. As part of a process of dialogue and consensus building, expected to culminate in 
December 2012 with the National Conference on Human Rights, several regional forums 
were held, with the participation of representatives of Government, civil society and the 
international community. In November, the National System for Human Rights and 
International Humanitarian Law, a policy coordination and follow-up mechanism, was 
established, led by the Vice-President of the Republic.3 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights and international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>14. OHCHR-Colombia continues to be concerned about the significant number of 
attacks against human rights defenders, community, social, Afro-Colombian and 
indigenous leaders, trade union members and journalists. Of particular concern in 2011 
were numerous cases of harassment, threats, and detention apparently without proper 
investigation.  
</p>
<p>15. Illegal surveillance of and threats made in pamphlets and e-mails against human 
rights defenders were registered, particularly in Antioquia, Atl&#225;ntico, Arauca, Bogot&#225;, 
Bol&#237;var, Caquet&#225;, Cesar, Choc&#243;, C&#243;rdoba, Guaviare, Meta, Nari&#241;o, Norte de Santander, 
Santander, Valle del Cauca and Vichada. Of particular concern were threats against 
women&#8217;s organizations, especially those working on the Caribbean coast, and against 
journalists. By September, one journalist had been killed and 107 had been threatened, 
almost twice as many as in 2010.4   
</p>
<p>16. In several cases, illegal armed groups that emerged after the demobilization of 
paramilitary organizations, such as the Popular Revolutionary Anti-terrorist Army of 
Colombia (ERPAC), Los Paisas, Los Rastrojos and Los Urabe&#241;os, and occasionally FARC-
EP, claimed responsibility for these acts. On other occasions, there has been uncorroborated 
information on the involvement of State agents, including members of civilian and military 
</p>

</p>
<p>intelligence services, in illegal and clandestine operations. Most cases have not been 
resolved. If no significant progress is made in preventing, investigating and punishing these 
acts, it will be difficult to guarantee non-repetition.   
</p>
<p>17. Detentions of human rights defenders on the basis of what seems to be 
unsubstantiated information occurred in Antioquia, Caquet&#225;, Huila, Norte de Santander, 
Putumayo, Santander and Tolima. One example is the case of a member of the Political 
Prisoners Solidarity Committee in Bucaramanga: more than eight months after the warrant 
for her arrest had been issued, the investigation against her was closed, with no charges 
having been laid, and she was released.  
</p>
<p>18. OHCHR-Colombia is concerned about certain investigations led by the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office involving human rights defenders. Some of its prosecutors act quickly on 
the basis of what seems to be unsubstantiated information in cases against human rights 
defenders, while others do not properly pursue cases in which defenders are the victims.  
</p>
<p>19. The Presidential Human Rights Programme5 reported the deaths of 20 union 
members (including 12 teachers) between January and October, 34 per cent fewer than 
during the same period of the previous year. While the Unitary Workers Union also 
reported fewer deaths, it recorded the killing of 21 trade unionists in the same period.  
</p>
<p>20. The Government, inter alia, unified the protection programmes of the Ministry of 
Interior6 and the Department of National Security (DAS) under the new National Protection 
Unit.7 It is crucial that this new unit coordinate its efforts with other State protection 
programmes. Other challenges include the effective implementation of a differential 
approach, the coordination by the Ministry of Interior of risk assessments, which are to be 
completed within a maximum of 30 days, as well as coverage for additional persons8. One 
example that highlights the shortcomings of the system is the murder of the municipal 
ombudsperson of Aguadas, Caldas, in January, after an official risk assessment did not 
recommend protection measures. 
</p>
<p>21. Led by the Ministry of Interior, six thematic meetings took place in the framework 
of the National Round Table on Guarantees.9 This process was suspended in June by human 
rights organizations in view of the continued attacks against them. When the process 
resumed one month later, new agreements were reached, inter alia, on the establishment of 
regional risk assessment committees and of a procedure to assess urgent cases. Compliance 
with these agreements is crucial to increase the levels of trust between the Government and 
the organizations.  
</p>
<p>22. A person recognized by the State as a victim of the 1997 massacre in Mapirip&#225;n, 
Meta withdrew her testimony. Acknowledging the need to investigate this and other similar 
cases, OHCHR-Colombia is concerned about attempts to use this fact to delegitimize 
victims, human rights defenders and their organizations, and regional protection 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>  
 5 Government programme, led by the Vice-President, for the coordination of public policies on human 
</p>
<p>rights.

</b></p>
<p><b> B. Intelligence services 
</b></p>
<p>23. Judicial and disciplinary authorities made progress in resolving cases, reported in 
previous years, of wiretapping, surveillance and other illegal activities by members of 
intelligence services. However, OHCHR-Colombia continued to receive new reports of 
illegal activities, targeting in particular human rights defenders and journalists.  
</p>
<p>24. In September, the Supreme Court of Justice sentenced Jorge Noguera Codes, the 
2002-2005 DAS director, to 25 years in prison for homicide and criminal association with 
paramilitary groups. Other DAS directors, who were in office between 2005 and 2008, and 
over 40 DAS officials, as well as senior officials from the previous Government, have been 
implicated in judicial proceedings for abuses and illegal activities.   
</p>
<p>25. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes the adoption in June of the &#8220;Intelligence Law&#8221;. The 
law defines the limits and purposes of intelligence in terms of respecting human rights and 
creates two commissions: one to assist in the purging of intelligence files and another, a 
congressional commission, to monitor intelligence activities. Noteworthy challenges to the 
implementation of this law are the weak mandate of the congressional commission and the 
lack of effective internal control mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>26. In addition to this legal framework, measures must be adopted in order to 
comprehensively reform intelligence services and transform the institutional culture that led 
to the commission of human rights violations. For example, the process for updating, 
rectifying, annulling or keeping personal information in intelligence files, as noted by the 
Constitutional Court in October,10 should be regulated. It is also necessary to protect public 
officials from the intelligence services who report abuses or refuse to comply with illegal 
requests. Moreover, vigorous vetting of intelligence personnel, with strict human rights 
criteria, should be undertaken. 
</p>
<p>27. In October, DAS was officially closed and the new National Intelligence Directorate 
was established, together with a specific mechanism to oversee its functioning.11 This 
change is too recent to permit an analysis of its effectiveness in preventing further abuses.  
</p>
<p>28. The military intelligence services require public regulations to define and limit their 
actions. Their internal control mechanisms and public accountability need to be 
substantially strengthened, particularly in view of the increased allocation of military 
intelligence service resources planned for in the 2011 Comprehensive Security and Defence 
Policy for Prosperity.  
</p>
<p>29. The High Commissioner urges the Procurator General to strengthen the exercise of 
its preventive and disciplinary responsibilities related to the intelligence services and in the 
purging of their files.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Extrajudicial executions 
</b></p>
<p>30. Extrajudicial executions have not been totally eradicated. OHCHR-Colombia 
observed cases with elements that may indicate the occurrence of extrajudicial executions 
in Arauca, Bogot&#225;, Cauca and Cesar. For example, in June an indigenous person was 
reported as &#8220;killed in combat&#8221; by the Army in Arauca but, following pressure from his 
community, the death was classified as a &#8220;military error&#8221;.

 11 Decrees 4057 and 4179.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>31. In several cases, inconsistencies were noted in the military officials&#8217; versions of the 
events; a trend of discrediting and stigmatizing victims and efforts by some officials to 
obstruct justice were also observed. This was the case for five civilians killed in June by 
members of the Army in Cesar. 
</p>
<p>32. These cases should alert the authorities about the need to redouble their efforts to 
prevent this serious human rights violation, with an emphasis on effectively implementing 
the measures introduced in 2008 for that purpose. OHCHR-Colombia noted that some 
Army officers continue to deny the occurrence of extrajudicial executions and to discredit 
the judicial system when convictions are handed down. These attitudes are in blatant 
disregard of Ministry of Defence policies and do not contribute to creating a culture of 
reprobation, thus jeopardizing the guarantee of non-repetition. They also increase risks to 
judicial officials, victims and their families, and the organizations that support them. 
</p>
<p>33. By August, the National Human Rights Unit of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office had 
been assigned a cumulative total of 1,622 cases of alleged homicides attributed to State 
agents, involving 3,963 members of the security forces. A total of 148 convictions had been 
handed down. Especially noteworthy was the June ruling against a retired colonel who 
accepted his responsibility in 57 extrajudicial executions committed between 2007 and 
2008 when he was commander of the Sucre Task Force. He is the highest ranking military 
official convicted for this crime to date.  
</p>
<p>34. A special mechanism was established in February to review cases involving conflict 
between civilian and military jurisdictions. This facilitated the transfer of 220 investigations 
of homicides attributed to members of security forces to the ordinary justice system. The 
mechanism could further include the search for solutions to allow the revisiting of cases 
that were closed by the military justice without proper investigation.   
</p>
<p>35. OHCHR-Colombia reiterates the obligation of military justice to abstain from 
investigating or claiming jurisdiction over cases that may involve human rights or 
international humanitarian law violations. When in doubt, the ordinary, and not the military 
justice system, should be competent, as the former is the general rule and the latter the 
exception, in conformity with international standards and national jurisprudence of the 
Constitutional Court. OHCHR-Colombia considers it essential that in these cases the 
ordinary system undertake the initial investigations without exceptions. This should be 
reflected in the discussions on justice reform that are currently taking place in Congress. 
The death of a 17-year-old in Bogot&#225; last August after being shot in the back by a Police 
agent, the investigation of which was voluntarily transferred by the Attorney General&#8217;s 
Office to military justice, illustrates the need for a firm policy by the Ministry of Defence 
that fully respects the limits of military jurisdiction.12  
</p>
<p>36. Illegal granting of benefits to members of the Army detained in military facilities or 
convicted for extrajudicial executions can become a form of impunity and implicate the 
responsibility of the military-facility commander and his superiors.13 OHCHR-Colombia is 
confident that the measures recommended by the Temporary Verification Commission 
created in April to study these allegations will be promptly implemented.  
</p>
<p>  
 12 In November, the Superior Council of the Judiciary decided that the Attorney General, not the 
</p>
<p>military justice system, should investigate the case.   
 13 In the Tolemaida military base, Tolima, convicted military personnel obtained permission to leave 
</p>
<p>jail, hold parties or even take promotion courses to continue their military career.  </p>

<p><b> D. Illegal armed groups that emerged after demobilization of paramilitary 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations 
</b></p>
<p>37. In 2011, OHCHR-Colombia noted with concern the continuous expansion of illegal 
armed groups that emerged after the demobilization of paramilitary organizations. These 
groups, which are deeply involved in drug trafficking and other criminal activities, 
generally avoid confrontation with security forces and have a devastating impact on the 
population.  
</p>
<p>38. The High Commissioner expresses her great concern about the increasing violence 
caused by these groups, including against social leaders and public officials. The number of 
massacres and victims attributed to such groups continues to rise, especially in Antioquia 
and C&#243;rdoba.14 This violence occurs during confrontations between groups or within the 
same group, occasionally against guerrilla groups, and in several instances during direct 
attacks against the population. The Police reported that 53 per cent of the members of these 
groups who have been captured or killed to date were demobilized paramilitaries.  
</p>
<p>39. These illegal armed groups are present in most departments and have significant 
capacity to recruit, including children and adolescents, and use criminal structures and 
<i>sicarios</i> to support their activities. To carry out their criminal activities, these groups 
control territory, restrict the freedom of movement of the population, and perform a &#8220;social 
</p>
<p>control&#8221;, imposing their code of conduct and public sanctions, and &#8220;resolving&#8221; social 
</p>
<p>conflicts, often brutally. In the case of ERPAC, due to the absence of &#8220;opposing&#8221; groups 
and the limited State presence in the area, there is little, if any, outside public awareness of 
the group&#8217;s impact on the population. 
</p>
<p>40. In February, the Government convened its first National Security Council to address 
threats posed by these groups. It prioritized inter-institutional coordination in order to 
advance in the investigation, prosecution and dismantling of their support structures.  
</p>
<p>41. Combating these groups should be part of an integrated strategy, and not be limited 
to the use of armed force by the Police and the Military, which must strictly adhere to 
human rights law in performing their task. The strategy to dismantle these groups should 
include policies to overcome poverty and marginalization, in particular for children and 
adolescents, as well as protection measures for local authorities and judicial officials.  
</p>
<p>42. OHCHR-Colombia continues to be concerned about indications that these groups 
benefit from the collusion of some local authorities and members of security forces, due 
primarily to corruption, intimidation and threats. In May, agents of the Technical 
Investigation Unit and the Attorney General&#8217;s Office arrested 37 officials in Nuqu&#237; and 
Bah&#237;a Solano, Choc&#243;, including members of the Police, the judicial system and local 
administrations, for collaborating with these groups. 
</p>
<p>43. To support their criminal activities, groups have forcibly appropriated or retained 
properties previously stolen by paramilitary groups and their networks, which may be 
included in the Government&#8217;s land restitution policies. Thus, the increased violence by 
these groups represents an undeniable risk for people seeking to recover their land and for 
the sustainability of the overall restitution process. An illustration of this is the killing and 
threats against leaders and other people involved in land restitution processes in the region 
of Urab&#225;.  
</p>
<p>  
 14 From January to November, 32 massacres were registered; 15 occurred in Antioquia.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b> E. Transitional justice  
</b></p>
<p>44. In 2011, the Government publicly recognized the need to reform Law 975 of 2005,15 
given that the realization of victims&#8217; rights continued to be insufficient: the right to truth 
</p>
<p>has not been fully upheld, the political and economic structures used by paramilitary 
organizations have not been completely dismantled in order to guarantee non-repetition, 
and only six sentences have been handed down. The High Commissioner welcomes the 
revision of the law and reiterates that it should lead not only to procedural changes, but also 
to structural reforms in the context of all possible transitional justice mechanisms, in 
particular the Victims&#8217; and Land Restitution Law. 
</p>
<p>45. In March, OHCHR-Colombia submitted to relevant authorities a proposal for the 
amendment of Law 975. This proposal includes, inter alia, the following recommendations: 
voluntary depositions, which could also be collective, should be provided during an 
established time frame; efforts should be focused on the most serious crimes and the 
identification of those most responsible; conciliations between victims and perpetrators 
should be avoided given the seriousness of the crimes under investigation; crimes 
committed by children and adolescents should be attributed to the persons over 18 years of 
age who recruited them; and compliance with reduced sentences should start from the date 
of sentencing.   
</p>
<p>46. Law 1424, urgently adopted in December 2010 to resolve the situation, in exchange 
for truth, of demobilized persons who were not considered under Law 975, has not led to 
concrete results. Decree 2601 of 19 July regulating this Law provides that only in January 
2012 will the process begin to verify the prerequisites such demobilized persons must fulfil 
in order to sign an &#8220;Agreement to Contribute to the Historical Truth and Reparations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>47. In 2011, the Supreme Court sentenced 15 parliamentarians in so-called 
&#8220;<i>parapol&#237;tica</i>&#8221; proceedings. The Court has a total of 120 cases under preliminary 
</p>
<p>investigation, 9 under investigation, and 14 on trial. The Attorney General has opened 270 
investigations against local authorities, most of which are under preliminary investigation, 
and only 12 convictions had been obtained by November. 
</p>
<p>48. Debates about judicial reform have addressed, among other issues, the right to 
appeal in <i>parapol&#237;tica</i> proceedings. OHCHR-Colombia reiterates the need to legitimize, 
reinforce and maintain the role of the Supreme Court in such proceedings, and to fully 
respect the right to due process. Furthermore, it is important for the Supreme Court and the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office to establish common investigation criteria to ensure consistency 
in their efforts against these crimes.  
</p>
<p><b> F. </b>Victims&#8217; and Land Restitution Law<b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. On 10 June, President Santos signed the Victims&#8217; and Land Restitution Law, in the 
presence of the Secretary-General. This could be considered as the most important law 
enacted in recent years for the peace and reconciliation process in Colombia, facilitating an 
approach based on the recognition, promotion and protection of and respect for victims&#8217; 
rights. 
</p>
<p>50. The law applies to all victims of the armed conflict, regardless of the perpetrator. It 
is a step forward in developing a concept of comprehensive reparations, including land 
restitution, and provides for integrated protection for all, incorporating a gender approach. 
</p>
<p>  
 15 Law 975 provides for reduced prison time for demobilized persons in exchange for their contribution 
</p>
<p>to truth and reparation.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>It has, however, some flaws, such as not considering as victims members of illegal armed 
groups, who may have suffered human rights violations, or recruited children who had not 
left illegal armed groups before turning 18. 
</p>
<p>51. As stated by the Secretary-General, &#8220;a good law is not enough; it needs to have a 
real transforming effect on the ground&#8221;.16 The implementation of the law will then be 
crucial and its success will depend, to a high degree, on adequate and coordinated execution 
of responsibilities by the competent State entities. The role of the National Ombudsperson&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Office will be especially important in this process.  
</p>
<p>52. The regulation of the Law has raised some questions about the participation of 
victims and their organizations and their protection. Such participation is an essential 
condition of a human rights-based approach and for building a legitimate, sustainable and 
effective reparations process.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Land restitution 
</b></p>
<p>53. Estimates of the scale at which land was abandoned or otherwise illegally or forcibly 
appropriated as a result of conflict-related violence vary. Official sources, limited to land 
lost by displaced persons, indicate about 3 million hectares.17 Civil society surveys indicate 
that at least 6.5 million hectares of land were illegally appropriated by various means, not 
including collective land.18 This occurred primarily in Antioquia, Bol&#237;var, Caquet&#225;, Cauca, 
Cesar, Choc&#243;, C&#243;rdoba, Meta, Nari&#241;o, Putumayo, Sucre and Tolima. 
</p>
<p>54. The protection of judges who will be responsible for ruling on land restitution cases 
will require special attention, in order to guarantee their independence and impartiality; 
their competence and honesty should also be ensured. If these judges do not perform their 
duties adequately, the mechanisms may have a re-victimizing effect and the law would run 
the risk of legalizing illegal land appropriation, rather than providing justice for victims. 
</p>
<p>55. This process of restitution of illegally appropriated lands is unprecedented in recent 
Colombian history. There are, and have been in the past, other land restitution mechanisms, 
but the scope, aspirations and impact of the processes provided for in the Law are 
unparalleled. It is important that land restitution efforts be part of a holistic strategy for 
development, which includes strengthening income-generating programmes to ensure a 
sustainable and dignified standard of living for victims. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Protection  
</b></p>
<p>56. One of the main challenges to the implementation of the law, especially in land 
restitution proceedings, is to protect all those involved, including State officials, and in 
particular judges.  
</p>
<p>57. OHCHR-Colombia observed that land restitution leaders face high levels of risk and 
vulnerability, given the criminal interest in the lands that are subject to restitution. The 
murders committed in 2011, such as the death of the founder of a victims&#8217; rights 
organization from Antioquia, and those reported in 2010, as well as a number of threats and 
attacks, confirm the risks and conflict associated with land issues. Authorities must give 
priority to guaranteeing the life and integrity of those claiming their lands and their 
representatives.

</p>
<p>58. OHCHR-Colombia reiterates the need to adopt comprehensive protection measures 
that include rigorous risk assessments in which victims can participate. Police efforts to 
expand risk-assessment criteria are recognized and valued. However, protection measures 
must be enhanced, for example, by incorporating in practice a differential and gender 
approach, and strengthening relevant local institutions. It is also necessary to bolster 
political and public support to community and victims&#8217; organizations and strengthen 
criminal investigations. 
</p>
<p>59. The sustainability and integrity of the process in some areas of the country, such as 
the Urab&#225; region in Antioquia, will depend to a large extent on the implementation of 
robust criminal and disciplinary investigations. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>60. In August, Law 1418 of December 2010 adopting the International Convention for 
the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was declared constitutional by 
the Constitutional Court.19 The High Commissioner reiterates the importance of Colombia 
becoming a State party as soon as possible, and accepting the additional competence of the 
Committee under article 31.  
</p>
<p>61. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes the transparent and participatory process undertaken 
by the Ministry of Interior to regulate the &#8220;Law to Pay Homage to Victims of Enforced 
Disappearance&#8221;.20 This is an example of how victims can engage in the formulation of 
public policy. OHCHR-Colombia further recognizes the significance of the legislative 
initiative currently being debated in Congress that would enable victims to submit 
&#8220;declarations of absence&#8221; rather than require them to &#8220;declare the presumed death&#8221; of 
disappeared persons. 
</p>
<p>62. Despite the existence of a legal framework that is rights-based and provides for 
protection against enforced disappearance, the magnitude of the phenomenon and the level 
of impunity are disturbing. By October, the National Registry of Disappeared Persons 
cumulatively recorded 62,745 disappeared persons (13,470 women), of which 16,884 are 
alleged enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p>63. By July, the Attorney General had registered over 16,000 cases of disappearance. 
Most are in the investigation phase and almost half took place in Antioquia and Meta. By 
September, 2,546 cases had been registered under Law 975, out of a total of 26,026 
recognized crimes.  
</p>
<p>64. In April, a judge sentenced a retired Army general to 35 years in prison for enforced 
disappearances related to the 1985 Palace of Justice events. Political and media pressure 
against this verdict and other court decisions poses a threat to judicial independence and 
can increase the vulnerability of judicial officials and victims&#8217; families and their 
representatives. 
</p>
<p>65. Further efforts are required to ensure the dignified handing over of remains to 
families. Under the 2009 Agreement between the Ministry of Interior, the Institute of Legal 
Medicine, and the Registrar&#8217;s Office, 9,968 persons were identified, but only 49 bodies 
were handed over to families. By October, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office had exhumed 
</p>
<p>4,703 bodies, of which close to 30 per cent (1,442) have been fully identified and handed 
over to families. 
</p>
<p>  
 19 Decision C-620/11.  
 20 Law 1408 of 2010.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>66. OHCHR-Colombia recognizes the efforts of local authorities to assist victims of 
enforced disappearance. However, inter-institutional coordination and the participation of 
victims and their organizations must be improved, and the level of knowledge of response 
protocols and norms must be improved among local officials.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Conflict-related sexual violence  
</b></p>
<p>67. In 2011, acts of conflict-related sexual violence attributed to illegal armed groups 
continued to be reported, some of which were particularly cruel. For example, in March, 
OHCHR-Colombia registered the case of a 17-year-old girl from Nari&#241;o who was stripped 
naked, beaten and forced to publicly eat manure, after which she was killed, allegedly by 
Los Rastrojos. Repeated acts of sexual violence by illegal armed groups against indigenous 
girls in Guaviare were also reported. In another reported case, a girl was subjected to 
continuous sexual abuse for three days in March by someone identified as a member of Las 
&#193;guilas Negras.  
</p>
<p>68. OHCHR-Colombia also registered cases of sexual violence attributed to members of 
security forces, including the rape, allegedly by a member of the Army, of a woman in 
Nari&#241;o in April, and the rape of an 18-year-old girl attributed to a member of the Police in 
Bol&#237;var in May. The authorities took corrective actions in these cases.  
</p>
<p>69. The fight against impunity in cases of conflict-related sexual crimes continues to 
require additional efforts by the justice system. For example, by November, only four cases 
were on trial out of the 183 that the Constitutional Court, in its Order 92 of 2008, instructed 
the Attorney General to investigate without delay. Judicial proceedings in the killing of 
three child victims of sexual abuse, allegedly by a member of the Army, in 2010, in Arauca, 
have progressed slowly. 
</p>
<p>70. The new Attorney General has taken positive steps on this issue. Noteworthy are her 
willingness to establish dialogue with non-governmental organizations, the creation of a 
working group on gender, and the adoption of a policy of equality and non-discrimination 
aimed at incorporating a gender focus into the institution&#8217;s procedures.  
</p>
<p>71. Prejudice continues to have a negative impact on legal processes. For example, the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office did not investigate the alleged case of sexual abuse in May of a 
14-year-old girl by a member of the Police in Valle del Cauca, arguing that it was a 
consensual sexual relation, disregarding the fact that acts of sexual violence against 
children should be punished, irrespective of the consent of the child.  
</p>
<p>72. The Ministry of Defence moved forward in its review of Directive No. 11 of 2010, 
which is aimed at preventing all forms of violence against women and girls. This 
instrument should be part of a comprehensive policy of zero tolerance of sexual violence by 
members of security forces, which should include measures to strengthen command 
responsibility and impose corresponding sanctions. Involvement in such crimes should lead 
to disqualification from public service or to a freeze on promotions, especially to positions 
of command or control, and &#8220;due obedience&#8221; cannot justify failing to report or covering up 
such crimes. 
</p>
<p>73. In 2011, the Procurator General took action to strengthen the supervision of cases of 
sexual violence, such as issuing Directive No. 006 of 17 May, the impact of which had not 
been evaluated at the time of writing. 
</p>
<p>74. The High Commissioner reiterates her 2010 suggestion to the Government that an 
invitation be extended to the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on sexual violence 
in conflict to assess the situation of women in Colombia (A/HRC/16/22, para. 64). In </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>addition, the High Commissioner invites the Government to use the Team of Experts 
established by the Secretary-General following Security Council resolution 1888 (2009) to 
promote an integrated approach to address sexual violence. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Conflict-related violations of the rights of the child 
</b></p>
<p>75. In 2011, OHCHR-Colombia registered a disturbingly high number of crimes 
committed against children in Antioquia, Arauca, Bogot&#225;, Bol&#237;var, Caquet&#225;, Cauca, Cesar, 
Choc&#243;, C&#243;rdoba, Guajira, Guaviare, Meta, Nari&#241;o, Norte de Santander, Putumayo, Sucre 
and Valle del Cauca. 
</p>
<p>76. Cases of recruitment and threats of recruitment; death and injuries caused by 
explosive artefacts; occupation of and attacks against schools; displacement; homicide; and 
injuries were attributed to FARC-EP and the National Liberation Army (ELN). A 
significant number of cases were also attributed to illegal armed groups that emerged after 
the demobilization of paramilitary organizations.  
</p>
<p>77. Children and adolescents, including indigenous and Afro-Colombian, most between 
12 and 17 years of age, continue to be the victims of recruitment. In two specific cases, 
FARC-EP was allegedly responsible for threatening to recruit 7-year-old boys in Norte de 
Santander. FARC-EP was also accused of recruiting 15 boys in Campamento, Antioquia, in 
May, and ELN allegedly recruited 13 boys in the same municipality, also in May. There 
have been cases of recruitment or threats of recruitment of children that led to the forced 
displacement of their families and even entire communities. 
</p>
<p>78. Several initiatives to prevent child recruitment have been undertaken by national and 
local authorities.21 However, further measures are required to stop these practices and 
combat the high levels of impunity. Under Law 975, by September, 1,448 cases of child 
recruitment had been registered, out of a total of 26,026 recognized crimes, and a 
conviction had been obtained for the recruitment, between 1997 and 2002, of 309 children 
in Choc&#243; and Antioquia.  
</p>
<p>79. The Child and Adolescent Code, as well as several directives by the Ministry of 
Defence, prohibit the use of children and adolescents in &#8220;military activities, psychological 
operations, civic-military campaigns, among others&#8221;. However, OHCHR-Colombia verified 
that members of the Army continued to carry out activities of this nature, for example, in 
Caquet&#225; and Cesar. The office registered cases of the use of children for intelligence work 
and use of school premises by members of the Army. An example of these situations is the 
alleged use of a 9-year-old indigenous boy as an informant in Valle del Cauca in March.  
</p>
<p>80. The High Commissioner calls on the Government to effectively implement Security 
Council resolution 1612 (2005), to collaborate with the Task Force established for this 
purpose, and to comply with the recommendations formulated by the Secretary-General 
(see S/2009/434) and the Security Council Working Group on Children in Armed Conflict 
(see S/AC.51/2010/3).  
</p>
<p>  
 21 In addition to regional efforts, national programmes focused on 29 municipalities, media campaigns 
</p>
<p>by the High Council for Reintegration, and initiatives of the Ministry of Defence.  </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> J. International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Ministry of Defence&#8217;s municipal security index, which divides the country into 
&#8220;red, yellow, and green zones&#8221;, provides evidence that over 50 per cent of the total 
population lives in conflict-related areas.22  
</p>
<p>82. In the areas where the conflict was the most intense in 2011, such as Antioquia, 
Arauca, Caquet&#225;, Cauca, Choc&#243;, Meta, Nari&#241;o, Putumayo and Valle del Cauca, serious 
violations of international humanitarian law were observed. Perpetrators, primarily guerrilla 
groups, disregarded the principles of distinction, limitation and proportionality. The most 
severe humanitarian needs and consequences are located in these areas. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Guerrilla groups 
</b></p>
<p>83. FARC-EP and ELN continued to systematically violate international humanitarian 
law.  
</p>
<p>84. Although ELN reiterated that it adhered to humanitarian law, its actions revealed the 
opposite: indiscriminate attacks, recruitment of children and adolescents, attacks against 
protected property, kidnappings, and restrictions to freedom of movement of civilian 
populations. Illustrative cases are the attack in May on a hospital in Sucre, Cauca, which 
also affected civilian homes and endangered civilian lives, and the conduct of an &#8220;armed 
strike&#8221; in Arauca in September.  
</p>
<p>85. On a greater scale, cases of homicide of protected persons, forced displacement, 
recruitment of children and adolescents, restrictions to freedom of movement, 
indiscriminate attacks and kidnapping were attributed to FARC-EP. For example, of great 
concern was the case in November, in Solano, Caquet&#225;: in the midst of an armed 
confrontation with the Army, FARC-EP killed four members of security forces who had 
been held in captivity for between 12 and 14 years. FARC-EP commanders seem to have 
received a standing order to kill hostages before allowing a military rescue. In another 
example, in Anor&#237;, Antioquia in January, FARC-EP forcibly displaced nearly 5,000 people, 
almost half of whom were children.  
</p>
<p>86. Both guerrilla groups violated the principle of distinction by carrying out hostilities 
without differentiating between civilian and military spheres. The pressure exercised by 
FARC-EP along the Guaviare River throughout the year has mostly affected the civilian 
population; this has included serious obstructions to the free movement of civilians and 
national and international humanitarian organizations, attacks against medical missions, and 
the isolation of entire communities, such as the one in Puerto Alvira, Meta, to where a 
number of Sikuani and Jiw families had been displaced. ELN was accused of the massacre 
of eight peasants in Col&#243;n G&#233;nova, Nari&#241;o in June. 
</p>
<p>87. By planting anti-personnel mines, both groups disregarded the principle of 
limitation, which prohibits causing superfluous and unnecessary harm. These weapons have 
an indiscriminate effect, which is prohibited, and violate the principle of humanity which 
seeks to prevent and alleviate human suffering under any circumstances. From January to 
October, the total number of incidents related to such mines increased by 33 per cent 
compared with the same period in 2010 (from 1,165 to 1,550).23  
</p>
<p>  
 22 Comprehensive Security and Defence Policy for Prosperity. Out of a population of close to 45 
</p>
<p>million, approximately 2 million live in &#8220;red&#8221; zones and close to 22 million in &#8220;yellow&#8221; zones.   
 23 Information provided by the Presidential Human Rights Programme.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>88. The principle of proportionality, which prohibits attacks when excessive harm to 
civilians can be foreseen, was also violated by both guerrilla groups. In June, an ELN attack 
in Popay&#225;n, Cauca killed one civilian and injured 15, including two children. In July, an 
attack attributed to FARC-EP, allegedly directed against a Police station in Torib&#237;o, Cauca, 
took place on market day, close to the municipal plaza where approximately 1,500 civilians 
had gathered. A total of 3 civilians were killed and 122 injured.  
</p>
<p>89. OHCHR-Colombia notes the 76.5 per cent increase in the number of kidnappings 
attributed to FARC-EP and the reduction of 38.1 per cent in those by ELN during the first 
quarter of the year.24  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Security forces 
</b></p>
<p>90. Most of the violations attributed to members of the Army registered by OHCHR-
Colombia refer to the principle of distinction, including the need to take precautions when 
conducting attacks or during hostilities.  
</p>
<p>91. In some cases, the presence of military units in or around civilian premises, in 
violation of the principle of distinction, placed civilians at risk. This was the case in Cauca, 
in April, when 300 children were caught, while at school, in crossfire between FARC-EP 
and the Army, which had set up camp in the school&#8217;s football field.  
</p>
<p>92. In other cases, members of the Army did not take due care to respect the principle of 
precaution, causing unnecessary harm to civilians. An example is the attack, in May, on a 
truck carrying 14 civilians that resulted in several children injured in Caquet&#225;. The principle 
of precaution was also violated in cases of attacks without adequate information about the 
target, which in principle may have been legitimate. This was the case in March, where four 
boys were killed and another seriously injured in an attack on an alleged FARC-EP camp at 
an indigenous reservation in Tacuey&#243;, Cauca.  
</p>
<p>93. OHCHR-Colombia received information on irregularities in dealing with the civilian 
population, such as acts of abuse and intimidation. In some cases, members of the Army 
took video and photos of civilians in meetings, such as in Valdivia, Antioquia in 
September. Similarly, civilians were subject to abuse and arbitrary restrictions to freedom 
of movement. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes the efforts of the Ministry of Defence to 
prevent these acts.  
</p>
<p>94. No significant progress has been made in drafting a bill to regulate the right to 
conscientious objection to military service; and debate on this topic has been stalled in 
Congress since July. Illegal practices in military recruitment procedures continued without 
effective control in several cities, such as Bogot&#225;, Bucaramanga, Cali and Medell&#237;n.25 
</p>
<p><b> K. Indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian communities 
</b></p>
<p>95. Obstacles persisted with regard to conducting consultations to obtain prior, free and 
informed consent from indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian communities. OHCHR-
Colombia observed a lack of understanding by some local authorities of the scope of the 
consultations and confirmed the risks and pressure ethnic groups face when carrying out 
</p>
<p>  
 24 Information provided by the Pa&#237;s Libre Foundation.  
 25 In its decision C-879/11, the Constitutional Court confirmed that certain military recruitment 
</p>
<p>procedures are illegal. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>some of these processes. The most effective protection of the right to consultation has been 
provided by the Constitutional Court when resolving legal actions (<i>acciones de tutela</i>).26 
</p>
<p>96. In some cases, authorities have violated the principle of good faith, such as when 
departmental authorities of Cauca excluded the educational centre at the P&#225;ez de la Gaitana 
indigenous reservation from the consultation on ethno-education.27 The procedures 
provided for in Decree 1320 of 1998 continue to be used as a point of reference for 
conducting consultation processes, although the Constitutional Court has reiterated that it is 
an inappropriate instrument.28 
</p>
<p>97. Moreover, the ethnic and cultural identity and survival of several indigenous peoples 
and Afro-Colombian communities continue to be threatened by the internal armed conflict, 
violence, the lack of enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, and by continued 
social marginalization and exclusion.  
</p>
<p>98. By October, 79 indigenous people had been killed in the context of the armed 
conflict, representing an increase of 54.9 per cent over the same period in 2010.29 The 
National Indigenous Organization of Colombia had registered the killings of 107 
indigenous persons by November. At least 12 per cent of displaced people belong to an 
ethnic group. There have been 328,000 displaced Afro-Colombians and 93,000 indigenous 
people registered cumulatively to February 2011.  
</p>
<p>99. The situation of the Aw&#225; people in Nari&#241;o and Putumayo was of particular concern, 
since they continue to be exposed to actions by illegal armed groups, including 
displacement, threats of recruitment, intimidation, disappearances, killings and retaliation 
after security forces enter into contact with the population. The Constitutional Court 
ordered the Government to take urgent action to address the &#8220;serious negligence by 
omission of the duty to protect&#8221; the Aw&#225; people.30 Moreover, the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights granted them precautionary protection measures in March.  
</p>
<p>100. Twenty-one families from the Nonan community of the Wounaan indigenous 
people, who live along the San Juan River, Choc&#243;, were also granted precautionary 
protection measures in June by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>101. The situation of the Afro-Colombian population on the Pacific coast must also be 
given special attention. Urban displacement in Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca increased, 
due to deteriorating security conditions, the population in Medio Atrato, Choc&#243; was 
isolated in several instances, and confrontations between illegal armed groups over control 
of Tumaco, Nari&#241;o resulted in forced displacement, killings, kidnappings and 
disappearances.  
</p>
<p><b> L. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>102. Despite increasing Government efforts, rural areas31, where the armed conflict is 
more intense, continue to reflect the greatest gaps in terms of the Millennium Development 
Goals. These areas have high levels of poverty and extreme poverty, in addition to 
inequality. The gross education coverage in these municipalities is 2.7 times lower than in 
</p>
<p>  
 26 See, for example, decisions T-129/11 and T-1045-A/10.

<p>urban centres, institutional childbirth care is 19 points below that in urban areas, and there 
are qualitative shortfalls in terms of housing and access to water and sewage services, 
compared to the average in urban zones.32  
</p>
<p>103. Given the persistence of poverty and extreme poverty revealed by the 
Multidimensional Poverty Index adopted by Colombia in 2011, Government efforts should 
strengthen income generation programmes, moving beyond subsidies, and promote health, 
education and standard of living improvements for the rural population. 
</p>
<p>104. Disregard for legal obligations, corruption within the companies that provide health 
services and weak controls over the use of public resources have led to violations of the 
right to health. This is of greater concern in the case of people living in poverty, children, 
internally displaced persons, and people living with HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p><b> M. Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>105. In September, Congress approved Law 1482, aimed at punishing acts of 
discrimination. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes this Law and suggests that it be 
complemented with actions to eradicate any discriminatory practices that may be embedded 
in Colombian society. 
</p>
<p>106. In May, Colombia became a party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, but the Optional Protocol thereto has yet to be considered. 
</p>
<p>107. The Police formulated an anti-discrimination policy to protect lesbians, gays, 
bisexuals and transgender persons. However, this community continues to face a great deal 
of intolerance and discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Summary of the activities of OHCHR-Colombia 
</b></p>
<p>108. Between January and November, OHCHR-Colombia received 630 complaints about 
human rights and international humanitarian law violations, of which 500 were followed 
up. A total of 298 missions were undertaken, which represented 946 days in the field. 
OHCHR-Colombia participated in 3,025 working sessions: 1,381 with public institutions, 
947 with civil society representatives, 327 with United Nations agencies, and 370 with the 
international community.  
</p>
<p>109. OHCHR-Colombia provided advice during legislative debates on the Victims&#8217; and 
Land Restitution Law, as part of a collective effort by the United Nations system. This 
effort included technical and active participation in discussions and presentation of 
proposals based on international standards and best practices. OHCHR-Colombia organized 
public events promoting the participation of victims and their organizations and addressed 
Congress on this matter. The office also provided analyses on the Intelligence Law and the 
draft law on technical defence for members of armed forces accused of human rights 
violations.  
</p>
<p>110. OHCHR-Colombia provided further advice on the draft Ministry of Defence 
directive to prevent sexual violence and for the formulation of a comprehensive zero-
tolerance policy. Moreover, as a member of the monitoring and reporting mechanism 
established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), OHCHR-Colombia 
participated in its activities. It fostered, with other organizations, debate and analysis on 
matters of transitional justice, children&#8217;s rights, and enforced disappearance.

</b></p>
<p>111. As part of its technical cooperation programme, OHCHR-Colombia supported the 
Ministry of Education in implementing the National Plan for Education on Human Rights 
The cooperation with the Ministry of Defence included a project to monitor the 
effectiveness of Government actions to overcome extrajudicial executions. Another 
important initiative of OHCHR-Colombia was a community-based process on the right of 
indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian communities to consultation to obtain their prior, 
free, and informed consent. Furthermore, the office prepared a report with 
recommendations to the relevant authorities on the situation of the prison in Valledupar, 
Cesar. 
</p>
<p>112. In compliance with its mandate to advise the Government on the establishment of a 
national human rights centre, OHCHR-Colombia supported a working group created by the 
Vice-President, including by providing information on comparative experiences. This 
facilitated discussions on the centre&#8217;s basic functions, including serving as a space to reach 
consensus and promoting compliance with international recommendations.  
</p>
<p>113. OHCHR-Colombia continued to participate in United Nations interagency initiatives 
and mechanisms. During the visit of the Secretary-General it organized a meeting with 
victims of human rights violations and presented agreements with the Government on the 
expected rule-of-law results from the United Nations Development Assistance Framework. 
</p>
<p>114. OHCHR-Colombia developed a campaign to support victims involved in land 
restitution processes, in collaboration with the Catholic Church, the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural 
Development. OHCHR created a web page dedicated to the International Year for People 
of African Descent.33  
</p>
<p>115. OHCHR-Colombia issued 20 press releases and presented 19 public speeches, 
distributed 90,000 copies of publications and participated in workshops for the promotion 
of human rights.  
</p>
<p>116. OHCHR-Colombia was audited by United Nations external auditors in June with 
positive results and carried out a participatory internal planning process with a results-based 
management approach for the period 2012-2014. 
</p>

<p><b>Appendices 
</b></p>
<p><b>Appendix I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Illustrative cases of violations of human rights and of 
international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>1. As a complement to the High Commissioner&#8217;s report on the situation of human 
rights in Colombia, and by way of illustration, a number of cases of violations of human 
rights and of international humanitarian law that have come to the attention of the office in 
Colombia of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (&#8220;OHCHR-Colombia) during the 
reporting period are described below.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>2. The following are illustrative cases of homicides, disappearances, threats, detentions 
apparently without proper investigation and information theft, among others, against human 
rights defenders.  
</p>
<p> (a) In Buenaventura (Valle del Cauca), on 2 March, the President of the Board of 
the Rio Cajambre Community Council and her husband were kidnapped and allegedly 
murdered by the FARC-EP. These acts, which provoked the displacement of other 
members of the Board, are related to illegal mining activities in the region.  
</p>
<p> (b) In Tierralta (C&#243;rdoba), on 5 October, the leader of CORPOCODESA, an 
organization of internally displaced persons, was murdered, allegedly by the FARC-EP.  
</p>
<p> (c) In rural South of Bol&#237;var, on 9 and 12 October, 25 persons were arrested and 
accused of rebellion and criminal association with guerrilla groups. They were released in 
February 2011 due to failure by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to investigate or prosecute 
</p>
<p>before the expiration of terms. 
</p>
<p> (d) In the rural zones of El Tame (Arauca), on 14 March, the President of the 
Community Action Board was detained and accused of criminal association with a guerrilla 
group. He was released five days later.  
</p>
<p> (e) On 17 February, several human rights organizations working in different 
departments and regions around the country, as well as six journalists, received a 
threatening e-mail from the <i>&#193;guilas Negras</i>. The Attorney General&#8217;s Office does not appear 
to have a special investigative procedure for this type of crimes and its investigation of the 
facts had not, by the close of this report, produced satisfactory results.  
</p>
<p> (f) In Cartagena (Bol&#237;var), on 4 April, 20 women&#8217;s organizations that form the 
Committee to Monitor Constitutional Court Order 092, received threatening e-mails signed 
by the Revolutionary Popular Anti-communist Army (ERPAC). OHCHR-Colombia is not 
aware of any results obtained by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office investigation of this threat.  
</p>
<p> (g) In Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), on 27 May, the leader of an LGBT organization 
received threats after denouncing the sale of drugs and child prostitution in the area where 
he lives.  
</p>
<p> (h) In Chigorod&#243; (Antioquia), on 28 June, indigenous authorities of the Polines 
Reservation received threats from <i>Los Urabe&#241;os</i> after opposing the planting of coca leaf 
and the involvement of indigenous youth in this group.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p> (i) In Sincelejo (Sucre), between March and June, members of the Sucre section 
of Victims of State Crimes organization (MOVICE), including its spokeswoman, received 
numerous and repeated death threats by e-mail. One of the e-mail messages included threats 
against the 15-year-old daughter of one of the victims. 
</p>
<p> (j) In Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), on 10 March, a journalist covering the disturbances 
at the Antioquia University to protest against the Government initiative to reform education 
was attacked and her camera and mobile phone were stolen by unknown persons. Days later 
her Facebook page was unlawfully intercepted and she received threatening telephone calls 
accusing her of subversive activities.  
</p>
<p> (k) In Apartad&#243; (Antioquia), on 11 July, a SAT analyst for Urab&#225; received 
threats on her mobile phone after preventing a 20-year-old from joining <i>Los Urabe&#241;os</i>. The 
analyst was forced to leave the area.  
</p>
<p> (l) In Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), on 21 February, unknown persons entered the home 
of a member of the &#8220;Gustavo Marulanda&#8221; Human Rights Committee during the day and 
</p>
<p>stole two computers containing information on his activities in defence of human rights.  
</p>
<p> (m) In Bogot&#225; (D.C.), on 13 May, unknown persons entered the home of a 
member of the Inter-Ecclesiastic Justice and Peace Commission during the day and stole 
two USB memory sticks containing information on its work defending human rights. By 
August these events had not been investigated.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Intelligence services 
</b></p>
<p>3. Cases were reported of interception of e-mails, surveillance, information theft and 
harassment against members of different organizations and social and political figures, 
attributed to unlawful and clandestine actions by members of the State intelligence 
agencies. This conclusion was reached after the comprehensive analysis of different 
elements, including the type of victims, the correlation between the persons being 
investigated by the intelligence agencies and by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the 
connections between victims and specific social organizations or with previously 
documented cases, the <i>modus operandi</i> or the links between time and place of certain 
events.  
</p>
<p>(a) In Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), on 15 April, a student leader from the Antioquia 
University who was conducting extra-academic research on alleged extrajudicial executions 
in Ituango was the victim of illegal interception of e-mails, surveillance, illegal search of 
his home, threats and theft of a hard drive and research documents. The similarity with 
other situations and the <i>modus operandi</i> suggest the involvement of State intelligence 
personnel in these acts. 
</p>
<p>(b) In Cali (Valle del Cauca), on 23 August, several members of the Committee 
for Solidarity with Political Prisoners Foundation received threats to their mobile phones on 
the day after their participation in a judicial hearing where members of the public security 
forces were accused of the acts that occurred in La Reforma in 2007. During the hearing, 
several soldiers were taking photos of the persons who were later threatened. 
</p>
<p>(c) In Ituango (Antioquia), on 12 June, a blog appeared called &#8220;Colombia Libre 
Siempre&#8221; (Colombia Forever Free), which accused a large group of people, including 
members of social organizations, of sympathizing with the guerrilla. The blog published 
reserved or confidential information and documents from public entities. This could be 
considered an indication of the possible involvement of State agents in these acts.  
</p>
<p>(d) In Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), on 21 May, the alternative newspaper &#8220;Periferia&#8221; 
received an e-mail with threats against one of its directors. As in the case above, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>similarity with other acts against the victim and the <i>modus operandi</i> suggest the 
involvement of State intelligence agents. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Extrajudicial executions 
</b></p>
<p>4. In 2011 the practice of extrajudicial executions was not fully eradicated. The 
military justice system has continued to claim jurisdiction over cases of human rights and 
international humanitarian law violations and the expansion of the military jurisdiction is 
currently being debated.  There have also been reports of situations where Police agents 
have killed persons in situations where there was no combat, no armed resistance or any 
other reason to use force in such proportions.  
</p>
<p>(a) In Argelia (Cauca), on 20 December 2010, a police agent shot and killed a 
person who, while intoxicated, had kicked a piece of wood that served to mark the 
perimeter of the Police station in the village of El Mango. The investigation is ongoing.  
</p>
<p>(b) In Tamalameque (Cesar), on 28 July, soldiers from the Army Energy and 
Highways Battalion No. 3 allegedly committed an extrajudicial killing of five persons 
accused of belonging to <i>Los Rastrojos</i>. The military justice pressured the competent official 
of the Attorney General&#180;s Office to transfer jurisdiction of this case.  
</p>
<p>5. OHCHR-Colombia has monitored the prosecution of several cases of extrajudicial 
executions attributed to members of the Army, in which the safety of the families of 
victims, witnesses and lawyers of the victims is a matter of concern. 
</p>
<p>(a) In Cali (Valle del Cauca), on 2 June, a lawyer representing the family of a 
victim of an alleged extrajudicial execution that occurred in January 2007 received death 
threats on his mobile phone in the proceedings against members of the GAULA (Army 
Unified Action Groups for Personal Freedom) and the AFEUR (Urban Anti-Terrorist 
Special Forces Group) registered to the Army Third Brigade. Five days later the death 
threats were repeated by e-mail and this time also included the family of the victim.  
</p>
<p>(b) In Barranquilla (Atl&#225;ntico), on 26 March, the lawyer of the victims of several 
cases of alleged extrajudicial executions attributed to members of the Army received death 
threats by text message to his mobile phone. He had previously been the victim of 
surveillance and other acts of intimidation.  
</p>
<p>(c) In Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), on 13 October, a family member of a victim of an 
alleged extrajudicial execution attributed to members of the Army Fourth Brigade, who is 
also a witness in a trial, suffered an attempt against his life. The victim had previously 
received death threats by phone.  
</p>
<p>(d) In Granada (Antioquia), on 14 January, personnel from the Military Defence 
(DEMIL), who posed as officials of the Attorney General&#180;s Office, intimidated several trial 
witnesses and family members of victims of alleged extrajudicial executions that occurred 
in 2004 and were attributed to soldiers from the Army Coronel Jorge Eduardo S&#225;nchez 
Rodr&#237;guez Artillery Battalion No. 4 (BAJAS).  
</p>
<p><b> D. Illegal armed groups that emerged after demobilization of paramilitary 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations 
</b></p>
<p>6. The expansion and the intensity of the acts of violence perpetrated against the 
population by these groups in 2011 is a matter of concern.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>(a) In Dibulla (Guajira), on 13 February, three persons were murdered, including 
one girl, as a consequence of disputes between <i>Los Urabe&#241;os</i> and <i>Los Rastrojos</i> in that 
area.  
</p>
<p>(b) In El Bagre (Antioquia), on 15 March, 10 persons were victims of a massacre 
as a consequence of disputes between members of <i>Los Rastrojos</i> in that area.  
</p>
<p>(c) In Sopetr&#225;n (Antioquia), on 24 April, 10 persons were murdered as a 
consequence of disputes between two groups in Medell&#237;n, and the perpetrators attempted to 
disappear the bodies.  
</p>
<p>(d) In Villa del Rosario (Norte de Santander), on 31 May, five persons were 
murdered as a consequence of disputes between members of <i>Los Rastrojos</i>. 
</p>
<p>(e) In Zaragoza (Antioquia), on 8 July, four persons, including a boy, were 
murdered by <i>Los Rastrojos</i> when they were pursuing the boy, who was the &#8220;<i>campanero</i>&#8221; 
(guard) of <i>Los Urabe&#241;os</i>. The boy entered the home of a family in order to evade his 
pursuers and <i>Los Rastrojos </i>murdered everyone they found in the house. 
</p>
<p>(f) In San Bernardo del Viento (C&#243;rdoba), on 27 July, three persons accused of 
collaborating with <i>Los Paisas</i> were murdered by <i>Los Urabe&#241;os</i>. The area where the acts 
occurred is under dispute between these two groups to control drug trafficking. 
</p>
<p>(g) In San Antero (C&#243;rdoba), on 25 September, five persons were murdered as a 
consequence of disputes between members of <i>Los Paisas</i>.  
</p>
<p>(h) In Tierralta (C&#243;rdoba), on 5 May, members of <i>Los Paisas</i> entered the village 
of Quebrada Bonita, murdered one person and looted the houses in the community, 
accusing the villagers of supporting <i>Los Urabe&#241;os</i>. This appears to be an area of dispute 
between <i>Los Urabe&#241;os</i> and<i> Los Rastrojos </i>for control of drug trafficking.  
</p>
<p>(i) In Policarpa (Nari&#241;o), on 27 August, members of <i>Los Rastrojos</i> fired shots 
against the president of the Community Action Board of the village of Madrigal, who they 
accused of being an informant for the authorities. Timely police intervention saved the life 
of the community leader. Two members of this group had been arrested in this village the 
day before.  
</p>
<p>(j) In Cumbitara (Nari&#241;o), on 12 September, four persons were kidnapped by 
<i>Los Rastrojos,</i> including two children, in the village of El Desplayado. One of the victims 
was accused of being an informant for the authorities and another refused to have a 
sentimental relationship with a member of <i>Los Rastrojos</i>. After 17 days in captivity, the 
four persons were liberated by the Army.  
</p>
<p>(k) In Barranca de Loba (Bol&#237;var), on 21 March, 18 families dedicated to mining 
were displaced from their village to the urban center as a consequence of extortion by <i>Los 
Urabe&#241;os</i>.  
</p>
<p>(l) In Bajo Baud&#243; (Choc&#243;), on 15 February, an indigenous community was 
displaced due to threats from <i>Los Rastrojos</i>, who blamed the community for the loss of a 
drug shipment.  
</p>
<p>(m) In Bah&#237;a Solano (Choc&#243;), on 25 September, the municipal ombudsman 
received threats from <i>Los Rastrojos</i> after he denounced drug trafficking and the use of 
children by this group.  
</p>
<p>(n) In Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), on 22 June, a journalist received threats after 
publishing the identity of the head of one of the groups that operates in that city.  
</p>
<p>(o) In Antioquia, in April, four children between 14 and 16, involved with <i>Los 
Rastrojos</i>, were captured by the Police together with other members of this group. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>children joined this group after they were offered money to serve as &#8220;<i>campaneros</i>&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(guards).  
</p>
<p>(p) In C&#243;rdoba, in January, one 10-year-old boy involved with <i>Los Urabe&#241;os</i> 
surrendered to the Army. Another 10 members of this group surrendered at the same time.  
</p>
<p>(q) In Necocl&#237; (Antioquia), in the area of La Reforma, <i>Los Urabe&#241;os</i> forced the 
villagers to stay in their homes while drugs were being transferred through the area. 
</p>
<p>7. Also, some members of the public security forces and other public officials acted, 
mainly because of corruption, in collusion with some of these groups.  
</p>
<p>(a) In C&#250;cuta (Norte de Santander), on 2 May, several police officers and agents, 
who were in charge of coordinating drug trafficking and fuel contraband in the area, were 
arrested after an operation of the Judicial Intelligence and Investigation Section (SIJIN), 
when authorities dismantled a group of <i>Los Rastrojos</i> in that city.  
</p>
<p>(b) In Cartago (Valle del Cauca), on 19 May, a prosecutor and three police 
agents accused of selling information to <i>Los Rastrojos</i> were arrested.   
</p>
<p>(c) In C&#225;ceres (Antioquia), on 25 July, after handing over two members of <i>Los 
Rastrojos</i>, the authorities obtained a USB with information on payments by <i>Los Rastrojos 
</i>to municipal officials and members of the Police in several municipalities of Bajo Cauca.  
</p>
<p>(d) In Bello (Antioquia), on 25 August, three police and one municipal official 
from the land registry office were arrested, accused of collaborating with one of these 
groups.  
</p>
<p>(e) In Roldanillo, Tulu&#225;, Riofr&#237;o, Bol&#237;var and Trujillo (Valle del Cauca) 12 
members of the Police, including seven station commanders, were arrested for collaborating 
with <i>Los Rastrojos</i> in exchange for a monthly payment. 
</p>
<p><b> E. </b>Victims&#8217; and Land Rest<b>itution Law 
</b></p>
<p>8. During the formulation and adoption of Law 1448, known as the &#8220;Victims&#8217; and 
Land Restitution Law&#8221;, cases were reported of threats, aggression, and murder of leaders 
</p>
<p>and persons involved in land restitution processes, as well as their legal representatives.  
</p>
<p>(a) In San Onofre (Sucre), on 23 March, Eder Verbel Rocha, a victims&#8217; leader 
involved in the Sucre Chapter of the section of MOVICE was murdered. His brother and 
son were wounded during the crime. In 2004, the victim&#8217;s brother had also been murdered 
and members of his family have been victims of continuous threats and intimidation.  
</p>
<p>(b) In Necocl&#237; (Antioquia), on 16 November, Alejandro Padilla, a leader 
involved in land restitution processes was murdered in Urab&#225;. He had been supporting a 
process for the restitution of 170 hectares of land in the village of Nueva Esperanza since 
</p><p>2008.  
</p>
<p>(c) In Monter&#237;a, (C&#243;rdoba), on 26 November, Leoncio Mendoza, father of two 
land restitution leaders and also involved in processes for the restitution of lands in Urab&#225;, 
was murdered. The victim had protection measures under Law 975 protection program. 
</p>
<p>(d) In Turbo (Antioquia), on 20 March, Alfranio Solana Morales, leader of the 
Tierra y Vida Association was threatened. As part of his functions, he was working with a 
group of victims that were claiming lands in southern Turbo. After receiving these threats, 
the leader was forced to leave the area.  
</p>
<p>(e) In La Jagua de Ibirico (Cesar), in April and June, a lawyer for land restitution 
claimants of the El Prado de Mechoacan property received death threats.  </p>

<p><b>26</b> 
</p>

</p>
<p><b> F. Conflict-related sexual violence  
</b></p>
<p>9. The following cases illustrate how women and girls are victims of the sexual 
violence generated by all parties to the conflict, as well as by illegal armed groups that 
emerged after the demobilization of paramilitary organisations.  
</p>
<p>(a) The trial for the rape of two girls and the subsequent murder of one of them 
and her brothers, ages 14, 9 and 6, which was committed in October 2010 in Arauca 
allegedly by a member of the Army, had not yet concluded by 2011. The accused had 
changed his defense attorney at least seven times, which delayed the process and may have 
affected the evidence. The judge originally in charge of trial, Gloria Constanza Gaona, was 
murdered in March, but it has not been established with certainty whether the crime was 
related to the trial of the murder of the three children.  
</p>
<p>(b) In Ipiales (Nari&#241;o), on 3 April, a woman was raped and then seriously 
wounded with a knife by an Army soldier, who subsequently accepted the charges during

</p>
<p>(c) In Campamento (Antioquia), on 12 September, information was received

rape and five forced abortions.  
</p>
<p>(d) In Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), on 14 July, a 17-year-old girl was murdered in the 
presence of another two girls, 17 and 14 years old, by the head of an illegal armed group

sexual relations with him. One of them was also subsequently murdered and the other was 
wounded.  
</p>
<p>(e) In Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), on 11 June, a 12-year-old girl was drugged and 
raped by adolescent members of two illegal armed groups that emerged after the 
demobilization of paramilitary organisations made up of children and adolescents. Despite 
the medical evidence of the consequences of the violence committed against the girl, the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office did not make progress in the investigation. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Conflict-related violence against children  
</b></p>
<p>10. The following cases illustrate the consequences for children and adolescents of 
conflict-related acts of violence, including those attributed to illegal armed groups that

<p>(d) In Santa Rita de Ir&#243; (Choc&#243;), on 11 February, a member of the ELN who had 
demobilized used a 10-year-old Afro-Colombian boy as a guide. Following this incident, 
the ELN blamed the community to which the boy belonged for the demobilization, and 
threatened them, causing the displacement of 20 families.  
</p>
<p>(e) In Anor&#237; (Antioquia), on 8 February, reports were received that the FARC-EP 
had been occupying the school at the village of Concha Medio and carried out political

signs of torture.  
</p>
<p>(j) In Puerto Caicedo (Putumayo), on 4 April, a 14-year-old indigenous boy
