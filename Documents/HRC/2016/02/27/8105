</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of

</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1<b> </b>and paragraph 5 of

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of delegation expressed Bahrain&#8217;s appreciation to the Council and to the 
international organizations of the United Nations for the support provided to the kingdom. 
He especially thanked OHCHR for the programme resulting from the universal periodic 
review (UPR) over the past four years, which contributed effectively to enhancing the 
capacity of the concerned authorities regarding the implementation of commitments and 
recommendations of the UPR, and hoped that this fruitful cooperation and support would 
continue in the future. 
</p>
<p>6. Bahrain recalled that it was the first member State to undergo the Human Rights 
Council review in 2008. Having 565 non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as of early 
2012, Bahrain initiated the review for its second report, including its achievements, with the 
partnership of all concerned entities, including governmental and non-governmental 
organizations, as well as civil society actors. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation stated that the past four years had been full of events and 
developments. Much has been documented with regard to the advancement of human rights 
at various levels, and the kingdom does not claim to be perfect nor free from obstacles that 
hinder the implementation of the recommendations and commitments. However, with 
determination and the will to accomplish honest work, Bahrain will overcome these 
constraints. </p>


<p>8. Major achievements were reviewed over the past four years, starting with education. 
Bahrain pays full attention to this sector, is committed to providing educational and cultural 
services to its citizens as a right that is prescribed in its Constitution and Education Law. 
The Education for All (EFA) Global Monitoring Report for 2011 indicated that Bahrain is 
among the high-performance States for achieving the EFA's goals. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation reported on the National Strategic Plan for Human Rights Education, 
which was reviewed based on the commitment in 2008, and a plan was developed to foster 
a human rights culture. A special subject on human rights has been included in the 
citizenship course for all classes at different levels of education. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stated that the Constitution of Bahrain provided for the right of all 
citizens to enjoy equal health standards without discrimination. In support of that right, the 
Ministry of Health has prepared development programmes and plans in collaboration with 
the World Health Organization. The Government bears the full cost of treatment whenever 
it is inaccessible locally. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation stated that women in Bahrain have assumed leading positions, and 
proactive steps have been taken to involve them in activities alongside men. Women in 
Bahrain are being empowered to be further involved in decision-making, leadership and 
ministerial positions, as well as in the private sector, civil society institutions and political 
associations. The establishment of the Supreme Council for Women is a milestone in the 
empowerment process of women. The Council is in the process of studying the removal or 
amendment of reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, so as to be consistent with national legislation and laws, 
while preserving the sovereignty of the State. 
</p>
<p>12. In respect of nationality, the delegation mentioned the discussions currently 
underway on proposed amendments to the Nationality Law, in order to grant Bahraini 
nationality to children of Bahraini women who are married to foreign husbands, in 
conformity with the regulations and constructive standards preserving their rights. 
</p>
<p>13. In the same context, the delegation reported on the gains of women, such as Law 
No. 35 of 2009, which was promulgated to treat non-Bahraini wives of Bahraini husbands 
in the same manner as Bahraini citizens, with regard to fees for Government-provided 
services. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation stated that the Supreme Council for Women had played an effective 
role in the promulgation of the provisions of the Family Law, of which part one pertains to 
the Sunni school section implemented as part of Bahrain's obligations under the 2008 UPR. 
Efforts are underway to expedite the promulgation of the second part of the Family Law 
pertaining to the Ja&#8217;afari school section as an urgent and significant need requested by the 
community. 
</p>
<p>15. The head of delegation pointed out that the Government is striving to finalize the 
adoption of two laws that are still under discussion by the legislative authority, namely, the 
Child Protection Law and the Law on the Protection of Victims of Family Violence. 
</p>
<p>16. With regard to workers, the delegation stated that Bahrain has issued a series of new 
laws. The Ministry of Labour, in collaboration with the relevant authorities conducts 
periodical inspections of workers&#8217; accommodations and their work places in order to ensure 
the adequacy of health and safety conditions. In addition, a special office has been 
established to receive and investigate workers&#8217; complaints, and take necessary action to 
redress the situation or retrieve the worker&#8217;s rights. The new revised Labour Law which is 
expected to be adopted very soon also includes a special chapter regulating issues 
pertaining to domestic workers. </p>


<p>17. The delegation stated that a general strategy has been adopted to upgrade the 
security apparatus and personnel. Work is underway to revise applicable security 
procedures in order to ensure maximum human rights. Furthermore, Bahrain has retained 
international experts on security and human rights to ensure professional policing, with 
assurances from the Interior Ministry to apply all of the recommendations of the Bahrain 
Independent Commission of Inquiry. 
</p>
<p>18. Regarding the events in Bahrain during the months of February and March 2011, the 
delegation stated that they had prompted Bahrain to realize significant human rights 
reforms and achievements in favour of its citizens. The delegation also stated that the King 
had initiated a number of drastic, but gradual, steps aimed at restoring the situation to 
normal in the aftermath of the events, beginning with the conducting a National Consensus 
Dialogue including various components of Bahraini society. The dialogue enabled a 
complete review of a series of important local issues, and resulted in a number of demands 
for reform in political, social, economic and human rights areas, the most important being 
the adoption of a number of constitutional amendments and modifications of a number of 
bills. 
</p>
<p>19. The delegation provided information on the Bahrain Independent Commission of 
Inquiry (BICI), established by a Royal order, which had formulated a number of 
recommendations; all have been accepted by the Government. A National Commission, 
chaired by the President of the National Assembly, was also formed to follow up the 
implementation of BICI's recommendations, in collaboration with governmental and non-
governmental bodies. A large number of BICI's recommendations has been fully 
implemented, and others are currently being implemented. 
</p>
<p>20. On the issue of accountability, the delegation stated that a number of officials who 
had committed violations during the unrest events of 2011 have been referred for 
accountability. In the meantime, 142 ongoing investigations have resulted in nine 
prosecutions so far. A special investigation unit was established in the Public Prosecution 
Office to consider and investigate reports and complaints of alleged torture, cruel and 
inhuman treatment. The unit is supported by highly qualified human rights investigators, 
forensic and criminology experts. The unit operates in compliance with international 
standards, in particular the Istanbul Protocol. 
</p>
<p>21. The delegation recalled that the trials relating to the 2011 events have been 
conducted before civil courts in compliance with international standards. Each prosecuted 
person has been allowed access to a lawyer. It stated that a lawyer is usually appointed for 
each person accused in a criminal case who does not have his/her own lawyer. The court 
provides the accused person with all guarantees to enable him/her to defend himself/herself. 
All court trials are held in public. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation explained that charges related to the right to freedom of expression 
and opinion have been dropped, as well as the confessions related to those charges. 
Procedures have also been adopted for cases against medical personnel, so that more than 
1,185 out of 1,416 cases referred from the national safety courts have been dropped. The 
Supreme Judiciary Council had adopted a resolution to establish a judicial committee to 
review all conviction verdicts issued by the national safety courts; the committee has 
ordered the release of a number of convicted persons, and the rest of the verdicts are 
currently being reviewed by the fully independent judicial authority. 
</p>
<p>23. The delegation stated that the King had call for the establishment of an Arab Human 
Rights Court to deal with all human rights-related cases. The King&#8217;s call came from his 
firm belief in the political leadership of such a court, given the successive changes and 
events the Arab world was witnessing. Bahrain has also established a Special 
Compensation Fund for victims and relatives of victims affected by the recent incidents. </p>


<p>24. The Government has recently endorsed, in principle, and taken constitutional and 
legal action with a view to ratifying the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance. The Government of Bahrain also intends to finalize 
a bill pertaining to the creation of a national human rights institution (NHRI), as a fully 
independent mechanism, in compliance with the Paris Principles. The relevant bodies have 
been instructed to take the necessary legal and constitutional action to refer the bill to the 
legislative authority; both chambers of the legislature have endorsed a number of crucial 
constitutional amendments approved by the King on 3 May 2012. 
</p>
<p>25. The delegation stated that the Government had considered the constitutional 
amendments resulting from the views gathered during the National Consensus Dialogue. It 
has since rearranged the relationship between the executive and the legislative authorities, 
giving full supervisory powers to the Council of Representatives over the Shura 
(Consultative) Council, so that the role of the later has been reduced and more balance has 
been created between the two councils.
