For the Quarter Ended June 30, 2016
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.Significant Accounting Policies
Organization
Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the “Corporation” or “Martin Marietta”) is engaged principally in the construction aggregates
business. The aggregates product line accounted for 56% of consolidated net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2016
(55% of full-year 2015 consolidated net sales) and includes crushed stone, sand and gravel, and is used for construction of
highways and other infrastructure projects, and in the nonresidential and residential construction industries. Aggregates
products are also used in the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental industries. These aggregates products, along with
the Corporation’s aggregates-related downstream product lines, which accounted for 29% of consolidated net sales for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 (27% of full-year 2015 consolidated net sales) and include asphalt products, ready mixed
concrete and road paving construction services, are sold and shipped from a network of more than 400 quarries, distribution
facilities and plants in 26 states, Nova Scotia and the Bahamas. The aggregates and aggregates-related downstream product
lines are reported collectively as the “Aggregates business”.
The Corporation currently conducts the Aggregates business through three reportable segments: the Mid-America Group, the
Southeast Group and the West Group.

The Corporation has a Cement segment, which accounted for 8% of consolidated net sales for the six months ended June 30,
2016 (11% of full-year 2015 consolidated net sales).  The Cement segment has production facilities located in Midlothian,
Texas, south of Dallas-Fort Worth and Hunter, Texas, north of San Antonio.  The Cement business produces Portland and
specialty cements. Similar to the Aggregates business, cement is used in infrastructure projects, nonresidential and
residential construction, and the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental industries. The high calcium limestone
reserves, used as a raw material, are owned by the Cement business and are adjacent to each of the plants.
The Corporation has a Magnesia Specialties segment with manufacturing facilities in Manistee, Michigan, and Woodville,
Ohio. The Magnesia Specialties segment, which accounted for 7% of consolidated net sales for the six months ended June
30, 2016 (7% of full-year 2015 consolidated net sales), produces magnesia-based chemicals products used in industrial,
agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry.

FORM 10-Q
For the Quarter Ended June 30, 2016
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
1.Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Corporation have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q and in Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The Corporation has continued to follow the accounting policies set forth in the
audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, the interim consolidated financial information
provided herein reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair statement of the results of
operations, financial position and cash flows for the interim periods. The consolidated results of operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 are not indicative of the results expected for other interim periods or the full year. The consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but
does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Debt Issuance Costs
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2015-03, “Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs” (“ASU 2015-03”), which amends the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial
statements.  The ASU requires an entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, and does not impact
the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. The Corporation adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1,

Revenue Recognition Standard
The FASB issued an accounting standard update that amends the accounting guidance on revenue recognition. The new
standard intends to provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improve comparability of revenue
recognition practices and improve disclosure requirements. The new standard is effective January 1, 2018 and can be applied
on a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach. The Corporation will not early adopt this standard.  The Corporation
is currently evaluating the impact the provisions of the new standard will have on its financial statements and expects to
complete its evaluation by the end of 2016.

Lease Standard
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, Accounting Standards Update 2016-2 – Leases, intending to
improve financial reporting of leases and to provide more transparency into off-balance sheet leasing obligations.  The
guidance requires virtually all leases, excluding mineral interest leases, to be recorded on the balance sheet and provides
guidance on the recognition of lease expense and income.  The new standard is effective January 1, 2019 and must be
applied on a modified retrospective approach.  The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact the new standard will have
on its financial statements.
Share-based Payment Standard
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies certain aspects of accounting guidance and requirements for
share-based transactions.  The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2017.  The Corporation is
evaluating the impact of the ASU on its financial statements.

Earnings per Common Share
The numerator for basic and diluted earnings per common share is net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.
reduced by dividends and undistributed earnings attributable to certain of the Corporation’s stock-based compensation. If
there is a net loss, no amount of the undistributed loss is attributed to unvested participating securities. The denominator for
basic earnings per common share is the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per common share are computed assuming that the weighted-average number of common shares is increased by
the conversion, using the treasury stock method, of awards to be issued to employees and nonemployee members of the
Corporation’s Board of Directors under certain stock-based compensation arrangements if the conversion is dilutive. For the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the diluted per-share computations reflect a change in the number of
common shares outstanding to include the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially
dilutive common shares had been issued.
The following table reconciles the numerator and denominator for basic and diluted earnings per common share:
Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to

The Corporation, through a wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary, has a $250,000,000 trade receivable securitization
facility (the “Trade Receivable Facility”), which matures on September 30, 2016.  Management intends to renew the Trade
Receivable Facility beyond September 30, 2016.  The Trade Receivable Facility, with SunTrust Bank, Regions Bank, PNC
Bank, N.A. and certain other lenders that may become a party to the facility from time to time, is backed by eligible trade
receivables, as defined, and is limited to the lesser of the facility limit or the borrowing base, as defined, of $391,600,000,
$282,258,000 and $450,791,000 at June 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015, respectively.  These receivables
are originated by the Corporation and then sold to the wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary by the Corporation.  The
Corporation continues to be responsible for the servicing and administration of the receivables purchased by the wholly-
owned special-purpose subsidiary.  Borrowings under the Trade Receivable Facility bear interest at a rate equal to one-month
LIBOR plus 0.7%.  The Trade Receivable Facility contains a cross-default provision to the Corporation’s other debt
agreements.

3.Long-Term Debt (continued)
The Corporation’s Credit Agreement, which provides a $250,000,000 senior unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan Facility”)
and a $350,000,000 five-year senior unsecured revolving facility (the “Revolving Facility”), requires the Corporation’s ratio of
consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (“EBITDA”), as
defined by the Credit Agreement, for the trailing-twelve months (the “Ratio”) to not exceed 3.50x as of the end of any fiscal
quarter, provided that the Corporation may exclude from the Ratio debt incurred in connection with certain acquisitions for a
period of 180 days so long as the Corporation, as a consequence of such specified acquisition, does not have its rating on
long-term unsecured debt fall below BBB by Standard & Poor’s or Baa2 by Moody’s and the Ratio calculated without such
exclusion does not exceed 3.75x. Additionally, if no amounts are outstanding under both the Revolving Facility and the Trade
Receivable Facility, consolidated debt, including debt for which the Corporation is a co-borrower, may be reduced by the
Corporation’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50,000,000, such reduction not to exceed $200,000,000,
for purposes of the covenant calculation.
In accordance with the amended Credit Agreement, the Corporation adjusted consolidated EBITDA to add back any
integration or similar costs or expenses related to the TXI business combination incurred in any period prior to the second
anniversary of the closing of the TXI business combination, not to exceed $70,000,000. The Corporation was in compliance
with this Ratio at June 30, 2016.
Available borrowings under the Revolving Facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit issued by the Corporation
under the Revolving Facility. At June 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015, the Corporation had $2,507,000 of
outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Facility.
Current debt maturities consist of borrowings under the Trade Receivable Facility as well as the current portions of the Term
Loan Facility and other notes.  The increase in current debt maturities as of June 30, 2016 is attributable to the balance drawn
on the Trade Receivable Facility.  The Floating Rate Notes have been classified as a noncurrent liability as the Corporation
has the intent and ability to refinance on a long-term basis before or at its maturity of June 30, 2017.
Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes the unamortized value of terminated forward starting interest rate swap
agreements. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation recognized $340,000 and $672,000,
respectively, as additional interest expense. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Corporation recognized
$317,000 and $624,000, respectively, as additional interest expense. The ongoing amortization of the terminated value of the
forward starting interest rate swap agreements will increase annual interest expense by approximately $1,400,000 until the
maturity of the 6.6% Senior Notes in 2018.
4.Financial Instruments
The Corporation’s financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, bank overdraft,
accounts payable, publicly-registered long-term notes, debentures and other long-term debt.
Cash equivalents are placed primarily in money market funds, money market demand deposit accounts and Eurodollar time
deposits. The Corporation’s cash equivalents have original maturities of less than three months. Due to the short maturity of
these investments, they are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value.

For the Quarter Ended June 30, 2016
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
4.Financial Instruments (continued)
Accounts receivable are due from a large number of customers, primarily in the construction industry, and are dispersed
across wide geographic and economic regions. However, accounts receivable are more heavily concentrated in certain states
(namely, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa and Georgia). The estimated fair values of accounts receivable approximate
their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of the receivables.
Notes receivable are classified in the line items Other current assets and Other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance
sheets and are not publicly traded. Management estimates that the fair value of notes receivable approximates the carrying
amount due to the variable interest rates of the receivables.
The bank overdraft represents amounts to be funded to financial institutions for checks that have cleared the bank. The
estimated fair value of the bank overdraft approximates its carrying value due to the short-term nature of the overdraft.
Accounts payable represent amounts owed to suppliers and vendors. The estimated fair value of accounts payable
approximates its carrying amount due to the short-term nature of the payables.
The carrying values and fair values of the Corporation’s long-term debt were $1,779,217,000 and $1,890,319,000,
respectively, at June 30, 2016; $1,568,774,000 and $1,625,193,000, respectively, at December 31, 2015; and $1,653,338,000
and $1,729,511,000, respectively, at June 30, 2015. The estimated fair value of the publicly-registered long-term notes was
estimated based on Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of other
borrowings, which primarily represents variable-rate debt, was based on Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy using quoted
market prices for similar debt instruments, and approximates their carrying amounts as the interest rates reset periodically.
5.Income Taxes
The Corporation’s effective income tax rates for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were 30.4% and 30.2%,
respectively.  The estimated effective income tax rates reflect the effect of federal and state income taxes and the impact of
differences in book and tax accounting arising from the net permanent benefits associated with the statutory depletion
deduction for mineral reserves and the domestic production deduction.
The Corporation records interest accrued in relation to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Penalties, if
incurred, are recorded as other expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive earnings.

7.Commitments and Contingencies
Legal and Administrative Proceedings
The Corporation is engaged in certain legal and administrative proceedings incidental to its normal business activities. In the
opinion of management and counsel, based upon currently-available facts, it is remote that the ultimate outcome of any
litigation and other proceedings, including those pertaining to environmental matters, relating to the Corporation and its
subsidiaries, will have a material adverse effect on the overall results of the Corporation’s operations, its cash flows or its
financial position.
Borrowing Arrangements with Affiliate
The Corporation is a co-borrower with an unconsolidated affiliate for a $25,000,000 revolving line of credit agreement with
BB&T Bank. The affiliate has agreed to reimburse and indemnify the Corporation for any payments and expenses the
Corporation may incur from this agreement. The Corporation holds a lien on the affiliate’s membership interest in a joint
venture as collateral for payment under the revolving line of credit.
In addition, the Corporation has a $6,000,000 outstanding loan due from this unconsolidated affiliate as of June 30,
2016, December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015.
Employees
Approximately 10% of the Corporation’s employees are represented by a labor union.  All such employees are hourly
employees.  The Corporation maintains collective bargaining agreements relating to the union employees with the
Aggregates business and Magnesia Specialties segments.  For the Magnesia Specialties segment located in Manistee,
Michigan and Woodville, Ohio, 100% of its hourly employees are represented by labor unions. The Manistee collective
bargaining agreement expires in August 2019, and the Woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in May 2018.
8.Business Segments
The Aggregates business contains three reportable business segments: Mid-America Group, Southeast Group and West
Group. The Corporation also has Cement and Magnesia Specialties segments. Corporate loss from operations primarily
includes depreciation on capitalized interest, expenses for certain corporate administrative functions, business development
and integration expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and other nonrecurring and/or non-operational adjustments.
Intersegment sales represent net sales from one segment to another segment.

8.Business Segments (continued)
The decline in the Cement business’s total and net sales is primarily attributable to the California cement operations, included
in the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and divested as of September 30, 2015.  For the three months ended June
30, 2015, total revenues, net sales and loss from operations for the California cement operations were $35,318,000,
$34,160,000 and $485,000, respectively.  For the six months ended June 30, 2015, total revenues, net sales and loss from
operations for the California cement operations were $69,674,000, $67,267,000 and $7,906,000, respectively.
Cement intersegment sales, which are to the aggregates and ready mixed concrete product lines in the West Group, were
$27,649,000 and $54,637,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and $20,854,000 and
$38,955,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively.
The Aggregates business includes the aggregates product line and aggregates-related downstream product lines, which
include asphalt, ready mixed concrete and road paving products. All aggregates-related downstream product lines reside in
the West Group. The following tables, which are reconciled to consolidated amounts, provide net sales and gross profit by line
of business: Aggregates (further divided by product line), Cement and Magnesia Specialties.

10.Business Combination
During the first quarter 2016, the Corporation acquired the outstanding stock of Rocky Mountain Materials and Asphalt, Inc.,
and Rocky Mountain Premix Inc.  The acquisition provides more than 500 million tons of mineral reserves and expands the
Corporation’s presence along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, home to 80% of Colorado’s population.  The acquired
operations are reported through the West Group.  The Corporation has recorded preliminary fair values of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed; however, certain amounts are subject to change as additional reviews are performed, including asset
and liability verification and review of seller’s final tax return.  Specific accounts subject to ongoing purchase accounting
include property, plant and equipment; goodwill; accrued expenses and deferred income taxes.  The acquisition was not
financially material; therefore, pro forma information is not required.

11. Stock-Based Compensation
During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Corporation awarded its annual grant of stock-based compensation, which
included 75,421 of performance stock units and 68,720 of restricted stock units.  The grant-date fair value of each award is
$142.02 for the performance stock units and $124.41 for the restricted stock units.  No stock options are expected to be
awarded in 2016.  In past years, annual stock-based compensation awards were primarily made in the second quarter of the
year.  The change in the composition of the awards and the timing of the annual grant resulted in higher expense recorded in
the first half of the year compared with prior years.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, stock-based
compensation expense was $12,801,000 and $7,524,000, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2016
Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
OVERVIEW
Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the “Corporation” or “Martin Marietta”) is a leading supplier of aggregates products (crushed
stone, sand and gravel) and heavy building materials for the construction industry, including infrastructure, nonresidential,
residential, railroad ballast, agricultural and chemical grade stone used in environmental applications. The Corporation’s
annual consolidated net sales and operating earnings are predominately derived from its Aggregates business, which mines,
processes and sells granite, limestone, sand, gravel and other aggregates-related downstream products, including ready
mixed concrete, asphalt and road paving construction services for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure, environmental
industries, nonresidential and residential construction industries, as well as agriculture, railroad ballast, chemical, utility and
other uses. The Aggregates business shipped and delivered aggregates, ready mixed concrete and asphalt products from a
network of more than 400 quarries, underground mines, distribution facilities and plants in 26 states, Nova Scotia and the
Bahamas. The Aggregates business’ products are used primarily by commercial customers principally in domestic
construction of highways and other infrastructure projects and for nonresidential and residential building development.
Aggregates products are also used in the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental industries.
The Corporation currently conducts its Aggregates business through three reportable business segments: Mid-America
Group, Southeast Group and West Group.

The Cement business produces Portland and specialty cements. Similar to the Aggregates business, cement is used in
infrastructure projects, nonresidential and residential construction, and the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental
industries. The production facilities are located in Midlothian, Texas, south of Dallas-Fort Worth and Hunter, Texas, north of
San Antonio. Limestone reserves used as a raw material are owned by the Corporation and located on property adjacent to
each of the plants. In addition to the manufacturing facilities, the Corporation operates cement distribution terminals.
The Corporation also has a Magnesia Specialties segment that produces magnesia-based chemicals products used in
industrial, agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Corporation outlined its critical accounting policies in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. There were no changes to the Corporation’s critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Except as indicated, the comparative analysis in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations is based on net sales and cost of sales. Gross margin and operating margin calculated as percentages
of total revenues represent the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”). However, gross margin as a percentage of net sales and operating margin as a percentage of
net sales represent non-GAAP measures. The Corporation presents these ratios calculated based on net sales, as it is
consistent with the basis by which management reviews the Corporation’s operating results. Further, management believes it
is consistent with the basis by which investors analyze the Corporation’s operating results given that freight and delivery
revenues and costs represent pass-throughs and have no profit mark-up. The following tables present the calculations of
gross margin and operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 in accordance with GAAP
and reconciliations of the ratios as percentages of total revenues to percentages of net sales.

Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (“EBITDA”) is a widely accepted financial
indicator of a company’s ability to service and/or incur indebtedness.  EBITDA is not defined by generally accepted
accounting principles and, as such, should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings or operating cash flow.  EBITDA
is as follows:

Incremental consolidated gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) is a non-GAAP measure.  The Corporation
presents this metric to enhance analysts’ and investors’ understanding of the impact of increased net sales on
profitability.  Due to the significant amount of fixed costs, gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) typically
increases at a disproportionate rate in periods of increased shipments.  The following shows the calculation of incremental
consolidated gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) for the period ended June 30:

Aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure market comprised 43% of quarterly volumes and increased
1.3%.  Growth was led by the Southeast Group, which increased 8.9%. The Mid-America and West Groups were impacted by
significant rainfall and project delays in April and May, which deferred shipments and led to flat public-sector volumes. Growth
in the Southeast was primarily attributable to large projects in Georgia, a state that is benefitting from legislation passed in
2015 increasing near- and long-term state infrastructure spending. In a January 2016 study, SC Market Analytics, Inc.
estimated the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (“FAST Act”) could allow

state departments of transportation to purchase and use an additional 114 million tons of aggregates over the 5-year tenor of
the FAST Act.  The analysis further indicates certain areas of the United States – including the Southeast, West, Mountain and
Northeastern regions – are expected to reap the benefits under the FAST Act.
The nonresidential market represented 33% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and increased 2.8%.  The Mid-
America Group achieved a 13.7% increase, followed by an increase of 1.6% in the Southeast Group.  Notably, a broader
improving economy is driving business investment in office and retail development, which are experiencing a rebound in
markets not seen in the past several years.  The West Group noted a decline in nonresidential activity, primarily related to
weather deferrals and further reductions in shale energy demand.
The residential market accounted for 17% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments. Volumes to this segment increased
10.8%, due to the continued and expanding housing recovery, notably in the southeastern region of the country.  While
housing activity in the United States generally remains well below historic averages, strong growth in permits, starts and
completions among the Corporation’s top states reflects steady momentum in housing construction and indicates additional
future gains from increased residential investment.  In fact, Dallas and Atlanta, key Martin Marietta markets, are ranked first
and second in the country, respectively, in permits growth. Further, during the second quarter, North Carolina, Iowa, Florida
and South Carolina all reported double-digit growth in housing starts.  The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the
remaining 7% of aggregates product line volumes. The volume decline to this segment reflects reduced ballast driven by
reduced coal demand, which impacts transportation and results in lower capital and maintenance activity by railroads.
Overall, aggregates product line shipments increased 1.3%.  Geographically, growth was led by the Mid-America Group,
which increased 4.9%, while the Southeast Group achieved a 1.9% increase.  This growth offset the weather-impacted
decline in the West Group.
The average per-ton selling price for the heritage aggregates product line was $12.78 and $11.94 for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The heritage aggregates product line pricing increase of 7.0% reflects growth in all
reportable groups, led by the 10.4% increase in the West Group. The most significant improvement was achieved in the north
Texas/Oklahoma region.  The Southeast Group and Mid-America Group reported increases of 6.2% and 4.2%, respectively.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 the average per-ton selling price for the acquired aggregates product line was
$10.21.  The acquired locations, which are in the Colorado market, have a lower average selling price due to its inherent
trucking market compared to the Corporation’s overall aggregates business.

The decline in asphalt pricing is primarily attributable to the divestiture of the San Antonio Asphalt operations sold in third
quarter 2015, which had a higher average selling price.  Additionally, asphalt and paving contracts in the Rocky Mountain
Division contain accelerator clauses to reflect cost fluctuations in the raw materials.  Liquid asphalt, a key raw material in the
manufacturing process, declined during the quarter, resulting in a lower average selling price.

The heritage ready mixed concrete product line benefitted from strong demand and improved operating conditions, driving a
reported 20% increase in shipments and a 15% increase in average selling price, resulting in a 39% increase in net sales and
a 570-basis-point improvement in gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues).
Cement Business
For the quarter, the Cement business generated $59.8 million of net sales and $24.0 million of gross profit. Cement shipments
increased 2.2% while pricing was slightly down (excluding the impact of the California cement operations sold in 2015). The
business’ reported quarterly gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) of 40.1% was flat compared to prior year
(excluding the impact of the California cement operations sold in 2015).
During the second quarter 2016, the business incurred $5.7 million in planned cement kiln maintenance costs, and expects to
incur $2.0 million and $7.8 million in the third and fourth quarters, respectively.  Kiln maintenance costs in 2015 for the Texas
plants were $3.5 million, $3.2 million and $9.3 million for the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.

The decline in 2016 shipments is attributable to the prior-year divestiture of the California operations, which accounted for

The Portland Cement Association, or PCA, forecasts continued favorable supply/demand imbalance in Texas over the next
several years and growth each year through 2019.
Magnesia Specialties Business
Magnesia Specialties continued to deliver strong performance and generated second-quarter net sales of $58.9 million. Gross
margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) of 36.8% in the quarter expanded 170 basis points. Second-quarter earnings
from operations were $19.2 million compared with $18.8 million.  Expansion in gross margin is primarily due to lower energy
and maintenance costs compared to the prior year.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2016
(Continued)
The consolidated heritage gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) for the quarter was 27.3%, a 380-basis-
point improvement compared with the prior-year quarter.  The increase reflects pricing growth, management’s cost-disciplined
approach and divesting the California cement operations in the third quarter of 2015.
Consolidated Operating Results
Consolidated SG&A was 6.7% of net sales, flat compared with the prior-year quarter.
Among other items, other operating income and expenses, net, includes gains and losses on the sale of assets; recoveries
and writeoffs related to customer accounts receivable; rental, royalty and services income; accretion expense, depreciation
expense and gains and losses related to asset retirement obligations. For the second quarter, consolidated other operating
income and expenses, net, was income of $3.4 million in 2016 and an expense of $4.3 million in 2015.  Operating income and
expenses, net, for 2016 reflects a favorable settlement of commodity contracts assumed in a 2014 acquisition in the Cement
business that were priced above market at that date.
Other nonoperating income and expenses, net, includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, interest and other
miscellaneous income and equity adjustments for nonconsolidated affiliates.  Consolidated other nonoperating income and
expenses, net, was income of $8.1 million and $3.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The
increase in income in 2016 compared to 2015 is attributable to higher earnings by a nonconsolidated affiliate.
The estimated effective income tax rate for the quarter was 30.4%, in line with annual guidance.  For the year, the Corporation
expects to fully utilize the remaining allowable net operating loss carryforwards of $33 million acquired with TXI.
Significant items for the six months ended June 30, 2016 (unless noted, all comparisons are versus the prior-year period):
·Consolidated net sales of $1.6 billion compared with $1.5 billion, an increase of 11%
 ·Aggregates product line volume increase of 6.2%; aggregates product line price increase of 7.4%
 ─Heritage aggregates product line volume increase of 5.4%
 ·Cement business net sales of $129.7 million and gross profit of $56.6 million
 ·Magnesia Specialties net sales of $118.4 million and gross profit of $44.7 million
 ·Consolidated gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) of 23.7%, an increase of 520 basis points
 ·Consolidated SG&A of $121.4 million, or 7.4% of net sales
 ·Consolidated earnings from operations of $271.5 million compared with $162.6 million
 ·Earnings per diluted share of $2.60 compared with $1.30

For 2016, Magnesia Specialties reported net sales of $118.4 million, relatively flat compared with the prior-year
period.  Earnings from operations were $39.8 million compared with $36.5 million.  The increase in earnings from operations
was primarily attributable to lower production costs, specifically related to energy and maintenance expenses.
Consolidated gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) was 23.7% for 2016 versus 18.5% for 2015.  The

Consolidated SG&A expenses were 7.4% of net sales, up 20 basis points compared with the prior-year period, driven by
higher incentive compensation, including share based compensation.
For the first six months, consolidated other operating income and expenses, net, was income of $2.9 million in 2016 compared
with expense of $1.9 million in 2015, predominantly due to a favorable settlement of commodity contracts assumed in a 2014
acquisition in the Cement business that were priced above market at that date.  Additionally, in 2015, the Corporation
reserved two large accounts and wrote-off a customer account who declared bankruptcy.
In addition to other offsetting amounts, other nonoperating income and expenses, net, are comprised generally of interest
income and net equity earnings from nonconsolidated investments.  Consolidated other nonoperating income and expenses,
net, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was income of $9.1 million compared with income of $2.1 million in 2015,
primarily driven by increased income from nonconsolidated affiliates in 2016.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $203.4 million compared with $127.1
million for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion
and amortization expense. Operating cash flow is primarily derived from consolidated net earnings before deducting
depreciation, depletion and amortization, and the impact of changes in working capital. Depreciation, depletion and
amortization were as follows:

The seasonal nature of the construction aggregates business impacts quarterly operating cash flow when compared with the
full year. Full-year 2015 net cash provided by operating activities was $573.2 million compared with $127.1 million for the first
six months of 2015.
During the first six months ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation invested $210.6 million of capital into its business. Full-year
capital spending is expected to approximate $350 million.
In the first quarter of 2016, the Corporation acquired the outstanding stock of Rocky Mountain Materials and Asphalt, Inc., and
Rocky Mountain Premix Inc.  The acquisition included four aggregates plants, two asphalt plants and two ready mixed
concrete operations, and provides more than 500 million tons of mineral reserves and expands the Corporation’s presence
along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, home to 80% of Colorado’s population.
The Corporation can repurchase its common stock through open-market purchases pursuant to authority granted by its Board
of Directors or through private transactions at such prices and upon such terms as the Chief Executive Officer deems
appropriate. During the first six months, the Corporation repurchased 1,244,000 shares of common stock for $190 million.  At
June 30, 2016, 15,471,000 shares of common stock were remaining under the Corporation’s repurchase authorization.
The Credit Agreement (which consists of a $250 million Term Loan Facility and a $350 million Revolving Facility) requires the
Corporation’s ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and
amortization (“EBITDA”), as defined, for the trailing-twelve month period (the Ratio) to not exceed 3.50x as of the end of any
fiscal quarter, provided that the Corporation may exclude from the Ratio debt incurred in connection with certain acquisitions
for a period of 180 days so long as the Corporation, as a consequence of such specified acquisition, does not have its ratings
on long-term unsecured debt fall below BBB by Standard & Poor’s or Baa2 by Moody’s and the Ratio calculated without such
exclusion does not exceed 3.75x. Additionally, if there are no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility, consolidated
debt, including debt for which the Corporation is a co-borrower, will be reduced for

(Continued)
purposes of the covenant calculation by the Corporation’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50 million,
such reduction not to exceed $200 million.
The Ratio is calculated as debt, including debt for which the Corporation is a co-borrower, divided by consolidated EBITDA,
as defined by the Credit Agreement, for the trailing-twelve months. Consolidated EBITDA is generally defined as earnings
before interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for continuing operations.
Additionally, stock-based compensation expense is added back and interest income is deducted in the calculation of
consolidated EBITDA. Certain other nonrecurring noncash items, if they occur, can affect the calculation of consolidated
EBITDA.
In accordance with the amended Credit Agreement, the Corporation adjusted consolidated EBITDA to add back any
integration or similar costs or expenses related to the TXI business combination incurred in any period prior to the second
anniversary of the closing of the TXI business combination, not to exceed $70,000,000.
At June 30, 2016, the Corporation’s ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined, for the trailing-twelve
months EBITDA was 1.98 times and was calculated as follows:

The Trade Receivable Facility contains a cross-default provision to the Corporation’s other debt agreements. In the event of a
default on the Ratio, the lenders can terminate the Credit Agreement and Trade Receivable Facility and declare any
outstanding balances as immediately due. Outstanding amounts on the Trade Receivable Facility have been classified as a
current liability on the Corporation’s consolidated balance sheet. Management intends to renew the Trade Receivable Facility
beyond September 30, 2016.
Cash on hand, along with the Corporation’s projected internal cash flows and availability of financing resources, including its
access to debt and equity capital markets, is expected to continue to be sufficient to provide the capital

resources necessary to support anticipated operating needs, cover debt service requirements, meet capital expenditures and
discretionary investment needs, fund certain acquisition opportunities that may arise, allow for payment of dividends for the
foreseeable future and enable the buyback of shares through the share repurchase program. At June 30, 2016, the
Corporation had $377 million of unused borrowing capacity under its Revolving Facility and Trade Receivable Facility,
subject to complying with the related leverage covenant. The Revolving Facility expires on November 29, 2018 and the Trade
Receivable Facility expires on September 30, 2016.
The Floating Rate Notes have been classified as a noncurrent liability as the Corporation has the intent and ability to
refinance on a long-term basis before or at its maturity of June 30, 2017.
The Corporation may be required to obtain financing to fund certain strategic acquisitions, if any such opportunities arise, or to
refinance outstanding debt. Any strategic acquisition of size for cash would likely require an appropriate balance of newly-
issued equity with debt in order to maintain a composite investment-grade credit rating. Furthermore, the Corporation is
exposed to the credit markets, through the interest cost related to its variable-rate debt, which included borrowings under its
Term Loan Facility and Trade Receivable Facility at June 30, 2016. The Corporation is currently rated by three credit rating
agencies; two of those agencies’ credit ratings are investment-grade level and the third agency’s credit rating is one level
below investment grade. The Corporation’s composite credit rating remains at investment-grade level, which facilitates
obtaining financing at lower rates than noninvestment-grade ratings.
TRENDS AND RISKS
The Aggregates business, both production and demand, and the demand in the Cement business are significantly affected by
erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions. Production and shipment levels for
aggregates, asphalt, ready mixed concrete and road paving materials correlate with general construction activity levels, most
of which occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Thus, production and shipment levels vary by quarter. Operations concentrated
in the northern and midwestern United States generally experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in
the southeast and southwest. Excessive rainfall, and conversely excessive drought, can also jeopardize shipments,
production and profitability in all markets served by the Corporation. Because of the potentially significant impact of weather
on the Corporation’s operations, current-period and year-to-date results are not indicative of expected performance for other
interim periods or the full year.
The Corporation outlined the risks associated with its business in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. Management continues to evaluate its exposure to all operating risks on an ongoing basis.
OUTLOOK
The Corporation is encouraged by positive trends in the markets it serves and its ability to execute its strategic business
plans.  Notably:
·For the public sector, continued modest growth is expected in 2016 as new monies begin to flow into the system, particularly
in the second half of the year.  Additionally, state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects, including support from the
Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (“TIFIA”), are expected to grow and continue to play an expanded
role in public-sector activity.
 ·Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors.  The Dodge
Momentum Index is near its highest level since 2009 and signals continued growth.  Additionally,

For the Quarter Ended June 30, 2016
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

(Continued)
energy-related economic activity, including follow-on public and private construction activities in its primary markets, will be
mixed with overall strength in large downstream construction projects, providing a counterbalance to declines in shale
exploration-related volumes.  
 ·Residential construction is expected to continue to experience good growth metrics, driven by positive employment gains,
historically low levels of construction activity over the previous several years, low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption,
and higher multi-family rental rates.
RISKS TO OUTLOOK
The 2016 outlook includes management’s assessment of the likelihood of certain risks and uncertainties that will affect
performance, including but not limited to: both price and volume, and a recurrence of widespread decline in aggregates
volume negatively affecting aggregates price; the termination, capping and/or reduction of the federal and/or state gasoline
tax(es) or other revenue related to infrastructure construction; a significant change in the funding patterns for traditional
federal, state and/or local infrastructure projects; the volatility in the commencement of infrastructure projects; a reduction in
defense spending, and the subsequent impact on construction activity on or near military bases; a decline in nonresidential
construction; a further decline in energy-related construction activity resulting from a sustained period of low global oil prices
or changes in oil production patterns in response to this decline and certain regulatory or other economic factors; a slowdown
in the residential construction recovery, or some combination thereof; a reduction in economic activity in the Corporation’s
Midwest states resulting from reduced funding levels provided by the Agricultural Act of 2014 and a sustained reduction in
capital investment by the railroads; an increase in the cost of compliance with governmental laws, rules and regulations; and
unexpected equipment failures, unscheduled maintenance, industrial accident or other prolonged and/or significant disruption
to its cement production facilities.  Further, increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or
state issues can affect profitability.  If these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past, construction
spending could be reduced.  Cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations.  The Magnesia
Specialties business essentially runs at capacity; therefore any unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers
introduce volatility to the earnings of this segment.
The Corporation’s principal business serves customers in aggregates-related construction markets.  This concentration could
increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables; however, payment bonds normally posted on public projects,
together with lien rights on private projects, mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables.  The level of aggregates demand in
the Corporation’s end-use markets, production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating
leverage of the Aggregates business and, therefore, profitability.  Production costs in the Aggregates business are also
sensitive to energy and raw material prices, both directly and indirectly.  Diesel fuel and other consumables change
production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energy-related input costs, such as steel, explosives,
tires and conveyor belts.  Fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs, primarily through fuel surcharges in
the Corporation’s long-haul distribution network.  The Cement business is also energy intensive and fluctuation in the price of
coal affects costs.  The Magnesia Specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization as well as
the absolute price and fluctuation in the cost of natural gas.
Transportation in the Corporation’s long-haul network, particularly the supply of rail cars and locomotive power and condition
of rail infrastructure to move trains, affects the Corporation’s efficient transportation of aggregate into certain markets, most
notably Texas, Colorado, Florida and the Gulf Coast.  In addition, availability of rail cars and locomotives affects the
Corporation’s movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals, to both the Corporation’s plant

(Continued)
in Manistee, Michigan, and customers.  The availability of trucks, drivers and railcars to transport the Corporation’s product,
particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand, is also a risk and pressures the associated costs.
All of the Corporation’s businesses are also subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules
and profitability.  The first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather.  Hurricane activity in the Atlantic
Ocean and Gulf Coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters.
Risks to the outlook also include shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the Corporation’s control.  In
addition to the impact on nonresidential and residential construction, the Corporation is exposed to risk in its estimated
outlook from credit markets and the availability of and interest cost related to its debt.
The Corporation’s future performance is also exposed to risks from tax reform at the federal and state levels.

FORM 10-Q
For the Quarter Ended June 30, 2016
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
The Corporation’s operations are highly dependent upon the interest rate-sensitive construction and steelmaking industries.
Consequently, these marketplaces could experience lower levels of economic activity in an environment of rising interest
rates or escalating costs.
Management has considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the Corporation’s business.
Demand for aggregates and cement products, particularly in the infrastructure construction market, is affected by federal and
state budget and deficit issues. Further, delays or cancellations of capital projects in the nonresidential and residential
construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if
consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty.
Demand in the residential construction market is affected by interest rates. The Federal Reserve have maintained the federal
funds rate near zero percent during the six months ended June 30, 2016, unchanged since 2008. The residential construction
market accounted for 17% of the Corporation’s aggregates product line shipments in 2015.
Aside from these inherent risks from within its operations, the Corporation’s earnings are also affected by changes in short-
term interest rates. However, rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results. In fact, since 2007,
the Corporation’s profitability increased when interest rates rose, based on the last twelve months quarterly historical net
income regression versus a 10-year U.S. government bond. In essence, the Corporation’s underlying business generally
serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates.
Variable-Rate Borrowing Facilities. At June 30, 2016, the Corporation had a $600 million Credit Agreement, comprised of a
$350 million Revolving Facility and $250 million Term Loan Facility, and a $250 million Trade Receivable Facility.
Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate. A hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in interest
rates on borrowings of $433 million, which was the collective outstanding balance at June 30, 2016, would increase interest
expense by $4.3 million on an annual basis.
Pension Expense. The Corporation’s results of operations are affected by its pension expense. Assumptions that affect
pension expense include the discount rate and, for the defined benefit pension plans only, the expected long-term rate of
return on assets. Therefore, the Corporation has interest rate risk associated with these factors. The impact of hypothetical
changes in these assumptions on the Corporation’s annual pension expense is discussed in the Corporation’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Energy Costs. Energy costs, including diesel fuel, natural gas, coal and liquid asphalt, represent significant production costs
of the Corporation. The Corporation entered into a fixed price arrangement, which expires December 31, 2016, for
approximately 40% of its diesel fuel to reduce its diesel fuel price risk. The Magnesia Specialties business has fixed price
agreements covering half of its 2016 coal requirements and the cement business has fixed pricing agreements on 100% of its
2016 coal requirements. A hypothetical 10% change in the Corporation’s energy prices in 2016 as compared with 2015,
assuming constant volumes, would change 2016 energy expense by $25.7 million. However, the impact would be partially
offset by the change in the amount capitalized into inventory standards.

Commodity risk. Cement is a commodity and competition is based principally on price, which is highly sensitive to changes in
supply and demand. Prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and
demand, general economic conditions and other market conditions beyond the Corporation’s control. Increases in the
production capacity of industry participants or increases in cement imports tend to create an oversupply of such products
leading to an imbalance between supply and demand, which can have a negative impact on product prices. There can be no
assurance that prices for products sold will not decline in the future or that such declines will not have a material adverse
effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition and results of operations.  Based on forecasted net sales for the
Cement business for full-year 2016 of $300 million to $320 million, a hypothetical 10% change in sales price would impact net
sales by $30 million to $32 million.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
As of June 30, 2016, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the
operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Corporation’s management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016. There were no changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.
