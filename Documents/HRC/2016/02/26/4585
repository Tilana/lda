</p>

<p> 2. <i>Takes</i> <i>note with interest</i> of the latest report of the Working Group,1 including 
the recommendations contained therein; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the States concerned to take account of the Working Group&#8217;s views 
and, where necessary, to take appropriate steps to remedy the situation of persons arbitrarily 
deprived of their liberty and to inform the Working Group of the steps they have taken; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Encourages</i> all States: 
</p>
<p><i>(a)</i> To give due consideration to the recommendations of the Working Group;

practices remain in conformity with relevant international standards and the applicable 
international legal instruments; 
</p>

out its mandate even more effectively; 
</p>

Working Group has been left unanswered, and urges the States concerned to give the 
necessary attention to the urgent appeals addressed to them by the Working Group on a 
strictly humanitarian basis and without prejudging its possible final conclusions, as well as 
to the communication of the same case pursuant to the regular complaint procedure; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> the Working Group, in accordance with its working methods, to 
continue to provide the concerned State with relevant and detailed information concerning 
allegations of arbitrary detention in order to facilitate a prompt and substantive response to 
these communications without prejudice to the need for the concerned State to cooperate 
with the Working Group; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Notes with deep concern</i> that the Working Group has received increasing 
information on reprisals suffered by individuals who were the subject of an urgent appeal or 
opinion or who applied a recommendation of the Working Group, and calls upon the States 
concerned to take appropriate measures to prevent such acts and to combat impunity by 
</p>

<p>investigating promptly and effectively all allegations of intimidation and reprisal in order to 
bring  perpetrators to justice and to provide victims with appropriate remedies; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Expresses</i> <i>its profound thanks</i> to the States that have extended their 
cooperation to the Working Group and responded to its requests for information, and invites 
all States concerned to demonstrate the same spirit of cooperation;
