CAIRN ENERGY PLC ("Cairn" or "Company" or "Group")
Half-Yearly Report Announcement
Simon Thomson, Chief Executive, Cairn Energy PLC said:
"Successful appraisal of the world-class SNE discovery in Senegal has significantly increased
2C oil resources to 473 million barrels with associated 2C oil in place in excess of 2.7 billion
barrels.
Drilling is scheduled to re-commence in Senegal shortly, benefiting from lower costs across the
sector. The programme contains options for multiple wells and in addition to ongoing appraisal of
the SNE field, the Joint Venture continues to assess optimal locations for further exploration
drilling on the acreage.
Cairn's exploration and appraisal focus in Senegal is balanced with development assets in the
UK, with first oil targeted from both Kraken and Catcher during 2017 and in the meantime Cairn
remains fully-funded in respect of all of its capital commitments."

Corporate & Finance Overview
Cairn's strategy is to deliver value for shareholders from the discovery and development of
hydrocarbons within a sustainable, self-funding and balanced business model. We are well-
positioned to deliver on our continued success as we pursue appraisal offshore Senegal where
there is considerable growth potential.
With a strong balance sheet, funding in place through to production and free cash flow coming on
stream from North Sea development assets in 2017, our sustainable model is in a robust
position. Cairn retains the flexibility to leverage success, and we will continue to optimise and
grow the asset base to deliver the best returns from a sustainable business model.
Current sources of funding include cash of US$414m at mid year, a Norwegian tax receivable of
US$45m and the Reserves Based Lending bank facility which remains undrawn and has
expected availability of US$260m by 2017. Current uses of capital include US$315m of
committed capital expenditure on the Kraken and Catcher development projects in the UK to year
end 2017 by which time the projects are expected to be onstream and cashflow generating; and
an envisaged future exploration and appraisal (E&A) expenditure of US$135m across the
portfolio, of which US$55m is current committed activity, with US$80m representing an estimate
of additional activity in Senegal currently being agreed with joint venture partners.
Operational Review
Senegal
Following two basin opening discoveries, SNE-1 and FAN-1, in Senegal in 2014 and approval of
an extensive evaluation plan by the Government of Senegal in 2015, Cairn and its JV partners
completed four successful appraisal and exploration wells in the SNE field in H1 2016. Drilling
operations were completed safely, ahead of schedule and under budget with four wells
completed at the forecast cost of three.
The objective of the appraisal and exploration programme in H1 was to establish the extent of the
field discovered by the SNE-1 well, gather data to determine the hydrocarbon volume and
reservoir deliverability and confirm and evaluate additional nearby prospects. The programme
has substantially improved Cairn's understanding of the aerial extent of the SNE field, confirming
its extension to both the north and south such that it is now interpreted to cover an area of more
than 350km2.  The well results have shown a consistent oil column of just over 100 metres (m) at
approximately the same depth in every well, with good quality, sweet 32° API crude, overlain by
a gas cap.  A comprehensive logging and coring programme has been conducted, with over
600m of core successfully recovered from the four wells, confirming the nature of a stacked series
of upper reservoirs of generally thinner units overlying lower reservoirs of thicker more tabular
sands.  Sand quality throughout is good with porosity and oil saturations very similar across all
wells.  In SNE-2 and 3, a total of four drill stem tests (DSTs), were successfully carried out,
covering both the lower and upper reservoir units to assess reservoir deliverability.  Together
with the combined reprocessed 3D seismic and new 3D broadband seismic dataset, the log, core
and test data are being integrated to build a comprehensive geological reservoir model.
Based on the five well penetrations so far, the current best estimate, independently assessed by
ERCE, for oil in place on the SNE field is more than 2.7 billion bbls gross with estimated gross
recoverable contingent oil resource of 1C 274 mmbbls, 2C 473 mmbbls, 3C 906 mmbbls.  The
2016 drilling campaign consisted of the following sequence of wells:
Ø  The SNE-2 appraisal well was in a central location in the heart of the field, 3 kilometres (km)
north of the SNE-1 discovery. The well results were significant in demonstrating the ability of the
reservoirs to flow at commercially viable rates, with a test in the lower reservoir measured at
>8,000 bopd confirming very high quality reservoir.   Multiple samples of oil and gas were
recovered to the surface.  216m of continuous core was taken across the entire reservoir interval
with 100% recovery and similar oil-down-to and oil-up-to depths (103m gross) as seen in SNE-1
were observed, with initial indications confirming the same 32° API oil quality.
Ø   The SNE-3 appraisal well was aimed at delineating the shape of the structure and defining
the aerial extension of the field to the south, being positioned almost 3km SW of SNE-1. The
reservoirs were found slightly shallower than expected, yet further extending the field area. Two
DSTs were conducted in the upper reservoirs, each flowed at maximum rates of >5,000 bopd,
confirming the deliverability of these units, and validating the scale and growth potential of the
field. Some pressure depletion was observed following each test, confirming that reservoir
connectivity in the upper reservoirs is not as good as the lower reservoirs. Multiple samples of oil
and gas were recovered to the surface, confirming the same 32° API fluid qualities as the
previous wells.  Reservoir quality and correlation of principal reservoir units between SNE-1, 2
and 3 was confirmed by log and bio stratigraphic analysis.  Continuous core of 144m was taken
across the entire oil bearing reservoir interval with 100% recovery.  There was similar oil-down-to
and oil-up-to depths (101m gross) seen in SNE-1 and 2 and initial indications confirmed oil
quality. Gauges were set in the well to allow for future interference testing.  Above the main SNE
appraisal targets as encountered in SNE-1 and 2, a further two shallower gas bearing sands
were encountered in SNE-3.
Ø    BEL-1 was primarily an exploration well targeting the Bellatrix prospect in shallower reservoir
targets above the main SNE field but was also deepened as an appraisal well to evaluate the
Northern Flank of the field, some 3km to the north of SNE-2.  The principal shallower ("Buried
Hill") exploration reservoir targets were found to be impermeable and gas bearing.  Two slightly
deeper gas bearing sand zones, similar to those seen in SNE-3 were encountered above the
main SNE targets. In deepening the well, the SNE appraisal results confirmed the northern extent
of the high quality reservoirs seen in the other SNE wells and demonstrated a similar consistent
oil column (~100m gross) in this area of the field. The same reservoir units were encountered as
in the previous wells, as confirmed by well log, pressure data and bio stratigraphic analysis.
 Continuous core of 144m was taken across the entire oil bearing reservoir interval with 100%
recovery.  As planned, no DSTs were conducted in this well.
Ø   SNE-4: Following the positive campaign results from the first three "firm" wells, the JV
continued the evaluation programme with a fourth well location, SNE-4, some 5km to the east of
SNE-3 with the intent of evaluating the nature and structural position of the upper reservoirs in
the oil zone to the eastern side of the field.   The well results confirm the extension of the
reservoirs to the eastern area of the field, finding oil bearing upper reservoir sands of similar
quality and correlating predictably to those encountered elsewhere, with essentially the same
gross 100m oil column.    A continuous core of 108m was taken across the entire oil bearing
reservoir interval with 100% recovery.  No DSTs were conducted in this well, although gauges
were set in anticipation of possible future interference testing.  The shallower gas-bearing sands
encountered in SNE-3 and BEL-1 were also encountered as gas bearing in SNE-4.
The four well appraisal campaign results have been highly positive in confirming the increased
size of accumulation, gathering a significant database of information, demonstrating excellent
operational and budgetary performance and being carried out safely.  As we plan future activity,
we can see clear potential to access additional cost savings from the current lower cost operating
environment. A rig tender and services process is well advanced as we prepare for stage three of
the campaign and is benefiting from the lower cost environment and significant availability of
high quality rigs.
The JV is working to determine how best to phase the development of the large resource base. 
We are also consolidating our views on how the changes in industry pricing will impact the
capital expenditure cost estimates of development including the economic field size.
In the current JV, Cairn (Operator) has a 40% WI in the three blocks offshore Senegal (Sangomar
Deep, Sangomar Offshore, Rufisque Offshore) and is working with partners: ConocoPhillips
(35% WI); FAR Ltd (15% WI) and Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company (10%).
In mid-July 2016, Woodside Petroleum Limited (Woodside) announced that it had entered into a
Purchase and Sale Agreement with ConocoPhillips to acquire all of ConocoPhillips' interests in
Senegal subject to all necessary approvals based on the effective date of 1 January 2016.  We
look forward to working with Woodside which will bring expertise in development, operation of
subsea infrastructure and FPSOs principally in Australasia.
UK and Norway Exploration
Cairn has built a strong position in the UK and Norway by acquiring exploration, appraisal and
development assets and participating in licencing rounds. Cairn now has 22 licences in Norway
including two operated licences and is a partner in the Skarfjell discovery. In addition, Cairn has
15 licences in the UK, including one as Operator.
Cairn pre-qualified as an Operator in Norway in late 2015 and in H1 2016 was awarded the
company's first operated licence, PL 842 with the Storhaug prospect, in the Norwegian North Sea
(Cairn 40% WI).  In addition to the non-operated interests in four exploration licences awarded in
the APA 2015 Licensing Round, Cairn was awarded three licences, including one as Operator,
in the Barents Sea in the 23rd Licensing Round.  Cairn believes that the Barents Sea has high
potential for commercial oil discoveries. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate state the yet to
find potential in the Barents Sea at 8.8 billion boe and only ~100 wells drilled to date.  We look
forward to working with partners, Statoil, Lundin and PGNIG in the coming years.
In the UK North Sea, the Laverda exploration well, adjacent to the Catcher field, encountered 14
feet net oil bearing Tay sands, but did not encounter any indications of hydrocarbons in the
deeper, high risk Slough prospect.  The well was plugged and abandoned ahead of the rig
continuing development drilling in the Catcher area (Premier Operator, Cairn 20% WI).
Morocco
In Q2 2016, Cairn (20% WI) and Kosmos (Operator, 55% WI) signed an agreement with ONHYM,
(25% WI carried) on behalf of the Government of Morocco, regarding a new Petroleum
Agreement for contract area offshore Boujdour Maritime with a commitment for 3D seismic to be
acquired by Q2 2020.
Mauritania
Alongside Operator Chariot Oil & Gas, Cairn elected not to enter into the First Renewal Phase of
the C-19 licence which had drilling commitments.  The work undertaken to de-risk the asset
resulted in industry interest, with a number of partnering discussions reaching advanced stages,
however these did not lead to a firm transaction within the defined timeframe (Cairn 35% WI).
Ireland
Cairn was awarded one Licence Option (LO) in the 2015 Atlantic Margin Oil and Gas Exploration
Licensing Round - Phase 2 Awards - Porcupine Basin LO16/18 (1,500 km2) (Cairn Operator,
100% WI) with an initial work programme aimed at evaluating the petroleum potential of this area
offshore Ireland.
A planned appraisal/exploration well on FEL 2/04 (Cairn Operator, 38% WI) (Spanish Point)
offshore West of Ireland is deferred, pending further discussions with partners and the
Government of the Republic of Ireland.
Malta
Cairn (Operator, 60% WI) is continuing 2D seismic and geological evaluation work ahead of a
potential decision later in 2016 to proceed to the next stage of the licence, which would involve
commitment to a 3D seismic survey to be acquired prior to end of 2018.
Cyprus
Cairn has submitted an application for Block 8 offshore Cyprus in a tender for oil and/or gas
exploration rights with a consortium which includes Delek Drilling and Avner Oil Exploration.
UK Development
The Catcher and Kraken developments in the UK North Sea are targeting first oil 2017; targeted
peak production net to Cairn of ~25,500 boepd.
Kraken
Kraken development remains on schedule with first oil anticipated in H1 2017.  The latest capex
estimate is >US$300m or over 10% lower than the sanction estimate.
In H1, Cairn acquired an additional 4.5% working interest in the Kraken development from First
Oil plc bringing Cairn's total working interest to 29.5%.
Good progress is being made on the FPSO in Singapore. All the topsides modules have been
lifted onto the vessel and the completion and integration works are well underway. Sail away
from the shipyard is expected before the end of 2016.
The 2016 subsea installation programme is nearing completion. The Drill Centre 2 (DC2) and
DC3 production and water injection manifolds, DC3 flowlines, and all flexible risers have been
successfully installed.
The drilling programme continues to make excellent progress. A total of three producer and four
injector wells have now been safely drilled and completed, with results meeting or exceeding
pre-drill predictions.
Catcher
Catcher is targeting first oil in H2 2017. Further cost savings have been secured against the
project estimates, with the release of contingencies as work scopes are finished and drilling
activities are completed below budget. The Operator now forecasts capex to first oil of US$1.3bn
and total project capex of US$1.8bn, a ~20% reduction on the original sanctioned estimates.
The subsea installation campaign remains on schedule for completion by Q4 2016: the flowline
towheads and bundles, as well as the buoy and its mooring system are installed, and good
progress is being made installing the risers. Six wells have now been safely drilled in the
Catcher area, including most recently the first Burgman production well, with all meeting or
exceeding pre-drill expectations for reservoir and fluid properties. Well sequencing has also
been modified to avoid costly winter rig moves and work continues to evaluate the potential to
reduce overall well count without impacting production.
The FPSO hull has now been delivered to the Keppel yard in Singapore while fabrication of the
topsides modules is progressing well.
Skarfjell
Partners are currently investigating the best option for the development of the field and the
decision on concept selection is expected to be made in Q4 2016. (Wintershall Norge AS,
Operator 35% WI, Cairn 20% WI).
Cairn India
Cairn is currently unable to access the value of its ~10% residual shareholding in Cairn India
Limited (CIL) valued at US$383m at 30 June 2016 or accrued dividends with a value of US$50m.
International arbitration proceedings have commenced in respect of Cairn's claim under the UK-
India Bilateral Investment Treaty.  Cairn is seeking restitution for losses resulting from the
attachment of its shares in CIL and failure to treat Cairn and its investments fairly and equitably.
Financial Review
Overview
The Group's North Sea development projects remain on track for delivery of first oil in 2017.  A
successful four well appraisal programme in Senegal was completed at the start of the year and,
subject to joint operator approval, the Group is planning a further exploration and appraisal
campaign commencing later this year.
Cash
At 30 June 2016, Cairn had cash balances of US$414m, down from US$603m at 31 December
2015.  The significant cash outflows in the period include total exploration costs of US$90m, of
which Senegal exploration and appraisal costs were US$70m, and Kraken development costs of
US$87m.
Committed expenditure from 30 June 2016 to year end 2017 comprises US$315m development
capital expenditure of the Catcher and Kraken projects and US$55m committed exploration and
appraisal expenditure.  A further US$80m of currently non-committed expenditure is envisaged
for future activity in Senegal based on current planning estimates.
Oil and Gas Assets
Exploration and Appraisal
In the six months to 30 June 2016, Cairn completed four successful appraisal wells in Senegal
and a dual target exploration well in the Greater Catcher Area in the UK North Sea.
Senegal
Cairn has now completed six successful exploration and appraisal wells in Senegal with
capitalised costs to 30 June of US$317m.  Additions in the year-to-date were US$89m; US$78m
of drilling costs primarily on the SNE-3, SNE-4 and BEL-1 appraisal wells completed in the
period, and US$11m other exploration costs and development studies.
UK and Norway
A dual target exploration well drilled in the UK North Sea Greater Catcher Area targeted the
Laverda and Slough prospects.  The Laverda prospect encountered hydrocarbons, the deeper
Slough prospect was dry.  Work continues to conclude on the commerciality of the Laverda
discovery.  The asset was tested for impairment at 30 June 2016 within the Catcher cash
generating unit, but no impairment was identified.
International
In Mauritania, the C19 licence was relinquished and costs to date of US$32m written off.
Development
UK North Sea
The Group's UK development projects, Kraken and Catcher, remain on track to deliver first oil in
2017.
In February 2016, Cairn increased its working interest in Kraken by 4.5% to 29.5%.  Cairn
acquired the increased interest from First Oil plc for a nominal amount and assumed working
capital liabilities of US$16m, including outstanding January and February cash calls due.
Cairn's current year costs relating to the Catcher development continue to be carried.
Cairn's UK development assets are held in a GBP functional subsidiary.  The sharp fall in the
value of GBP against USD triggered by the EU referendum reduces the carrying value of the
Group's assets by U$68m at 30 June 2016.  This translation loss is included in exchange
differences in other comprehensive income on consolidation.
Impairment tests were conducted on the Group's development assets at 30 June 2016 with no
impairment identified.  No changes were made to the Group's corporate assumptions from those
disclosed at 31 December 2015.   Sensitivity analysis is included in note 2.5 of the Financial
Statements.  There would be no tax impact on any impairment.
Available for Sale Financial Asset - Cairn India Limited Investment
The valuation of the Group's ~10% residual holding in Cairn India Limited (CIL) at 30 June 2016
of US$383m is largely unchanged from 31 December 2015, thus no further impairment arises.
Cairn continues to disclose a contingent liability for the final tax assessment issued by the
Government of India.  Further details are provided in note 5.4 to the financial statements.  Cairn
remains unable to access the value of its residual shareholding or accrued dividends of US$50m
including US$8m declared in July 2016.

The charge for the six month period comprises costs incurred on the Group's Mauritanian licence
of US$32m and US$2m of other licences relinquished in the North Sea.
Administrative Expenses
The year-on-year increase in administration expenses reflects costs incurred on the CIL
arbitration and an increase in non-cash share-based payment charges.
Taxation
Tax credits comprise US$16m of deferred tax credits on UK development assets and US$3m of
Norwegian net tax credits.
The UK deferred tax credit represents deferred tax assets recognised to offset deferred tax
liabilities arising on Group's development asset additions.  Deferred tax assets are currently only
recognised to the extent that they offset deferred tax liabilities.
At 30 June 2016, Cairn had total UK ring fence trading losses of US$632m.  US$383m of losses
are recognised as deferred tax assets to fully offset deferred tax liabilities of US$181m. The
remaining US$269m of losses represent an unrecognised deferred tax asset of US$135m.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Managing the risks and opportunities is essential to Cairn's long-term success and sustainability.
The Group endeavours to pursue investment opportunities which offer an appropriate level of
return whilst ensuring the level of associated political, commercial and technical risk remain
within the risk appetite of the Group.
Cairn's system for identifying and managing risks is embedded from the top down in its
organisational structure, operations and management systems and accords with the risk
management guidelines and principles set out in ISO 31000, the International Standard for Risk
Management. The Group's risk management framework supports Cairn's approach to business
and enhances the chances of safely engaging in successful business opportunities and
delivering value to shareholders and other stakeholders.
Responding to Changing Risks during H1 2016
Cairn has assessed the principal risks and uncertainties at the end of H1 2016 and concluded
that the principal risks identified at 2015 year end remain relevant. These are:
·      Sustained low oil price. The continuing low oil price is both a risk and opportunity for the
Group. The low oil price is driving down industry costs. However, it has also reduced the amount
of debt available under the Group's Reserve Based Lending facility and may impact on the
availability of other sources of funding for the Group.
·      Restriction on ability to sell Cairn India Limited Shareholding. International arbitration
proceedings have commenced in respect of Cairn's claim under the UK-India Bilateral
Investment Treaty.
·      Kraken and Catcher development activities and production start-up not executed on
schedule and budget. The Group continues to actively work with partners, and influence where
appropriate, to ensure both projects are executed on schedule and budget.
·      Lack of exploration and appraisal success. In 2016, the Group completed its initial appraisal
programme offshore Senegal building on the success of the 2014 discoveries. The joint venture
has commenced planning for the third phase drilling programme commencing in Q4 2016/Q1
2017 with further evaluation of the SNE discovery.
Further detail on the principal risks and uncertainties can be found in the Cairn Energy PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015.

·      the Group Statement of Changes in Equity for the period then ended; and
·      the explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.
The interim financial statements included in the half-yearly report have been prepared in
accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted
by the European Union and the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules of the United
Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
As disclosed in note 1.1 to the interim financial statements, the financial reporting framework that
has been applied in the preparation of the full annual financial statements of the Group is
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union.
Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
The half-yearly report, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, and has
been approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly report
in accordance with the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's
Financial Conduct Authority.
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the half-yearly
report based on our review. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only
for the company for the purpose of complying with the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules
of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and for no other purpose.  We do not, in
giving this conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What a review of interim financial statements involves
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements
(UK and Ireland) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity' issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A
review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures.
A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly report and considered whether it
contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the
interim financial statements.

a)   The maintenance and integrity of the Cairn Energy PLC website is the responsibility of the
directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters
and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to
the interim financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
b)   Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Section 1 - Basis of Preparation
1.1    Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
The half-yearly condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June
2016 have been prepared in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the
Financial Conduct Authority and with IAS 34, 'Interim financial reporting', as adopted by the
European Union. They should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the
year ended 31 December 2015, which have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') as adopted by the European Union.
The disclosed figures, which have been reviewed but not audited, are not statutory accounts in
terms of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31
December 2015, on which the auditors gave an audit report which was unqualified, which did not
contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and which did not contain any statement under section
498 of the Companies Act 2006 have been filed with the Registrar of Companies.
This half-yearly report has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies
expected to be applied for the year ending 31 December 2016, and uses the same accounting
and financial risk management policies and methods of computation as those applied for the year
ended 31 December 2015, other than changes to accounting policies resulting from the adoption
of new or revised accounting standards.  Changes to IFRS effective 1 January 2016 have no
significant impact on Cairn's accounting policies or financial statements.
Significant key estimates and assumptions are unchanged from those applied in the year ended
31 December 2015 and the same have accordingly been applied here.
This half-yearly report was approved by the Directors on 15 August 2016.
1.2     Going concern
The directors have considered the factors relevant to support a statement of going concern.
In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Board and Audit
Committee considered the Group cash flow forecasts under various scenarios, identifying risks
and mitigants and ensuring the Group has sufficient funding to meet its current commitments as
and when they fall due.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operational
existence for a period of 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements and have
therefore used the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Cairn completed four exploration/appraisal wells during the six months to June 2016. The BEL-1
exploration and appraisal well encountered hydrocarbons in the exploration target and
successfully appraised of the SNE-1 discovery. The additional SNE-2, SNE-3 and SNE-4
appraisal wells confirms the resource base of the world-class SNE-1 discovery made in 2014. 
Capitalised costs of US$89.0m include the costs associated with these wells and costs of
preparing for future drilling in Senegal.
UK and Norway
One exploration well was completed in the period in the Greater Catcher Area in the UK North
Sea.  The dual prospect well encountered hydrocarbons in the upper Laverda prospect while the
deeper Slough prospect was dry. Assessment of the commerciality of the Laverda discovery is
ongoing.  At 30 June 2016, costs associated with this prospect were tested for impairment, within
the Catcher cash generating unit.  No impairment was identified.
International
Unsuccessful exploration costs of US$33.2m primarily relate to the C-19 Mauritania licence
which was relinquished in June 2016.  Exploration costs of US$31.4m remaining at the period
end include US$25.6m and US$5.8m respectively on licences in Ireland and Malta.

Additions in the year include US$15.8m as Cairn increased its working interest in Kraken by
4.5% on 22 February 2016.  The additional interest was acquired from First Oil plc for nominal
consideration with Cairn liable for working capital liabilities relating to interest acquired at the
date of the agreement.  Further additions on the Kraken development were US$104.2m,
including an increase of US$16.0m in the decommissioning asset.
Remaining additions in 2016 include US$25.8m spend on the Catcher development, settled on
Cairn's behalf by Dyas under the carry agreement following the 2015 farm-down, and an
increase in the decommissioning asset recognised of US$21.3m.

2.5     Impairment Testing - Sensitivity Analysis
At 30 June 2016, impairment tests were conducted on the Group's UK Catcher and Kraken
exploration/appraisal and development assets.  No impairment was recorded.
Impairment tests were conducted using the Group's key estimates and assumptions consistent
with those disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts. This includes a short/medium
term oil price assumption based on a three-month average forward curve for three years from the
balance sheet date followed by a long-term oil price assumption of US$80 per barrel.
Cairn has run sensitivities, disclosed below, on the long-term oil price assumption of US$80,
using alternate prices ranging from US$75 per barrel to US$60 per barrel.  All other assumptions,
including costs and discount rate, remain unchanged.

Section 4 - Results for the Period
4.1     Segmental Analysis
Operating Segments
Cairn's business model is to create, add and realise value from a balanced portfolio. To ensure
focus on Senegal, while actively managing the balanced portfolio, from 1 January 2016 Cairn
implemented a new organisational structure based around three groups of Senegal, UK &
Norway and International.
Geographical regions are combined into regional business units which form the Group's
operating segments. Each business unit is headed by its own regional director (a regional
director may be responsible for more than one business unit) and management monitors the
results of each separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and
performance assessment.
Senegal is monitored and forms a business unit. UK & Norway consists of exploration and
development activities in the North Sea and Barents Sea. The international business unit is the
aggregate of all other regions including Greenland, Ireland, Morocco, Mauritania and the
Mediterranean.
"Other Cairn Energy Group" exists to accumulate the activities and results of the holding
company and other unallocated expenditure and net assets/liabilities including amounts of a
corporate nature not specifically attributable to any of the business units.
The segmental results for the six months ended 30 June 2016 are as follows:

5.4    Contingent Liability - Indian Tax Assessment
Cairn UK Holdings Limited ("CUHL"), a direct subsidiary of Cairn Energy PLC,  is in receipt of an
assessment order from the Indian Income Tax Department ("IITD") relating to the intra-group
restructuring undertaken in 2006 prior to the IPO of CIL in India, which cites a retrospective
amendment to Indian tax law introduced in 2012.  Cairn strongly contests the basis of this attempt
to retrospectively tax the group for an internal restructuring.
The assessment order is in the amount of INR102billion (approximately US$1.5bn) plus interest
back dated to 2007 totalling INR 188bn (approximately US$2.8bn). The total assets of CUHL
have a current value of US$475.2m (comprising principally the group's 9.8% shareholding in CIL)
and any recovery by the Indian authorities would be limited to such assets.
CUHL is pursuing its rights under Indian law to appeal the assessment, both in respect of the
basis of taxation and the quantum assessed.  CUHL's 9.8% shareholding in CIL was originally
attached by the IITD in January 2014 and CUHL continues to be restricted by the IITD from
selling such shares. See section 3.1.
Furthermore, Cairn has also commenced international arbitration proceedings against
the Republic of India under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (the "Treaty"), on the basis
that India's actions have breached the Treaty by (1) expropriating Cairn's property without
adequate and just compensation, (2) denying fair and equitable treatment to Cairn in respect of
its investments and (3) restricting Cairn's right to freely transfer funds in connection with its
investment. Based on detailed legal advice, Cairn is confident that it will be successful in such
arbitration.
The seat of arbitration has been agreed as The Hague in the Netherlands and Cairn has filed its
Statement of Claim which clearly demonstrates that applying the retrospective amendment to
Cairn and seizing US$1bn worth of CIL shares was in breach of the UK-India Investment Treaty
obligations of fair and equitable treatment and its protections against expropriation.  The
Republic of India's Statement of Defence is expected to be filed in Q4 2016 with evidential
hearings in 2017.
