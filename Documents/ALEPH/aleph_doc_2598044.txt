CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
This Corporate Governance Statement is current as at 30 June 2016 and has been approved by the Board of the Company.
This Corporate Governance Statement discloses the extent to which the Company will, as at the date it is re-admitted to the official list of the 
ASX, follow the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council in its publication Corporate Governance Principles and 
Recommendations, 3rd Edition (Recommendations). The Recommendations are not mandatory, however the Recommendations that will not 
be followed have been identified and reasons provided for not following them along with what (if any) alternative governance practices the 
Company intends to adopt in lieu of the recommendation.
The  Company  has  adopted a  Corporate  Governance Plan  which provides the  written terms  of  reference  for the  Company’s  corporate 
governance duties.
Due to the current size and nature of the existing Board and the magnitude of the Company’s operations, the Board does not consider that 
the Company will gain any benefit from individual Board committees and that its resources would be better utilised in other areas as the Board 
is of the strong view that at this stage the experience and skill set of the current Board is sufficient to perform these roles. Under the Company’s 
Board Charter, the duties that would ordinarily be assigned to individual committees are currently carried out by the full Board under the 
written terms of reference for those committees.
The Company’s Corporate Governance Plan is available on the Company’s website at www.linius.com/corporate-governance/ .
