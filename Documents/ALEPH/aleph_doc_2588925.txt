“We are pleased to have delivered a strong operational quarter while also making material
progress in meeting our goals of reducing MEMP’s outstanding debt and generating free cash,”
said John Weinzierl, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MEMP GP. “Our focus on
operational efficiencies was reflected in a 30% year-over-year reduction in operating costs as
measured by LOE/Mcfe, which is also reflected in MEMP’s updated guidance for full year
2016. Further, MEMP used free cash generated from operations and proceeds from its recently
completed Permian and non-core Rockies divestitures to repurchase $84 million of its senior
notes and to reduce its revolver balance by $113 million from year-end.”
Review of Second Quarter 2016
•  Average daily production decreased 5% to 231.5 MMcfe for the second quarter 2016,
compared to 243.3 MMcfe for the first quarter 2016, primarily due to a scaled back
development program, a planned maintenance turnaround of MEMP’s Bairoil facility, and
the loss of volumes attributable to the divestiture of Permian assets.
•  Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales, excluding commodity derivatives settlements,
were $67.8 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $60.6 million in the first
quarter of 2016. On an Mcfe basis, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs represented 27%,
56% and 17%, respectively, of sales volumes. On a revenue basis, crude oil, natural gas
and NGLs sales represented 54%, 34% and 12%, respectively, of total oil and natural gas
revenues.
•  Average realized prices, excluding commodity derivatives settlements:

•  Averaged realized prices, including commodity derivatives settlements, were $6.43 per
Mcfe in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $6.36 per Mcfe in the first quarter of
2016.

•  Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased to $79.0 million for the second
quarter of 2016 from $77.0 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to lower cash
operating expenses.
•  Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased to $84.1 million for the second quarter of 2016 from $81.3
million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to lower operating
expenses.
•  Distributable cash flow(1) available to limited partners was $44.9 million for the second
quarter of 2016, compared to $29.1 million for the first quarter of 2016.
•  Total lease operating expenses decreased 18% to $29.4 million in the second quarter of
2016 compared to $35.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily
due to further service provider cost discounts, optimization of compression facilities in
East Texas, prudent management of discretional activities such as well workovers, better
than expected performance of the saltwater disposal system in East Texas, and the sale
of the Permian assets in June. On a per unit basis, despite the lower production rate in
the second quarter, total lease operating expenses decreased 14% to $1.39 per Mcfe in
the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.61 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2016
•  Total gathering, processing and transportation fees were $0.42 per Mcfe in the second
quarter of 2016 and in line with the $0.42 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2016.
•  Taxes other than income were $0.17 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2016 compared to
$0.18 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2016.
•  General and administrative expenses (“G&A”) were $15.2 million for the second quarter of
2016 compared to $13.5 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in G&A was
largely attributable to a non-cash recognition of $1.6 million in non-recurring bad debt
expense primarily related to the divestitures in the Permian and Rockies regions. The
$15.2 million also included $2.7 million of non-cash unit-based compensation expense,
compared to $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2016.
•  Losses of $124.6 million on commodity derivatives were recorded during the second
quarter of 2016, which included a $106.9 million gain on cash settlements received on
expired or terminated positions. This compared to total gains of $51.7 million recorded
during the first quarter of 2016, which included $80.2 million of cash settlements received
on expired positions. Total hedged production in the second quarter of 2016 was 20.3
Bcfe, or 96% of second quarter production of 21.1 Bcfe, at an average hedge price of
$7.21 per Mcfe.
3
•  Net interest expense was $32.1 million during the second quarter of 2016, including $1.9
million of non-cash amortization of deferred financing fees and accretion of senior notes
discount.
•  Total capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2016 were $10.4 million.
Divestitures Update
MEMP recently closed non-core divestitures in the Permian and Rockies for aggregate proceeds
of approximately $55.3 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. Total proved
reserves as of December 31, 2015 associated with these divestitures was 44.1 Bcfe (47% oil,
48% natural gas and 5% NGLs) and average net daily production was 17.9 MMcfe/d for the first
three months of 2016. Proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down a portion of the
amount outstanding under MEMP’s revolving credit facility.
The Permian divestiture, which represented a complete exit of the basin for MEMP, closed on
June 14, 2016 for approximately $37.2 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments,
and included assets with total proved reserves of 18.6 Bcfe (99% oil, 1% gas) and average net
daily production of 7.3 MMcfe/d. The Rockies divestitures closed in July 2016 for approximately
$18.1 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, and included assets in Wyoming
and Colorado with total proved reserves of 25.5 Bcfe (9% oil, 82% natural gas and 9% NGLs)
and average net daily production of 10.6 MMcfe/d.
Hedging Update
Consistent with its hedging policy, MEMP has entered into natural gas, crude oil and NGL
derivatives contracts covering the period from 2016 through December 2019. MEMP’s hedging
policy is designed to reduce the impact to cash flows from commodity price and interest rate
volatility.

The following table reflects the volumes of MEMP’s expected production covered by commodity
derivative contracts and the average fixed or floor prices at which that production is
hedged. Targeted average net production estimate represents the mid-point of the annual
production range in MEMP’s updated 2016 full year guidance.

Since the last hedging update on May 5, 2016, MEMP has liquidated certain crude oil and NGL
hedges for the period July 2016 – December 2016 and utilized the proceeds to buy back senior
notes. Subsequent to these transactions, MEMP partially re-hedged the oil volumes with swaps
and puts for the period July 2016 – December 2016. The swap contracts were executed at strip
pricing and cover approximately 2,000 Bbls/d. The put contracts are at a floor price of $40.00 and
also cover approximately 2,000 Bbls/d. In addition, basis hedges related to the divested
properties in 2016 and 2017 have been terminated and settled.
Financial Update
As of July 29, 2016, MEMP had total debt of $1.8 billion, which included $1.1 billion of senior
notes and $723 million under its revolving credit facility. The borrowing base on the revolving
credit facility is $925 million with available borrowing capacity of $200 million (including $2.1
million in letters of credit).
5
During the second quarter, MEMP retired approximately $84.2 million in aggregate principal
amount of senior notes for total consideration of $41.5 million, which included $1.0 million of
accrued interest, at a repurchase price of approximately 48% of par value. This was partially
funded by $1.6 million from sales of common units under MEMP’s at-the-market program. The
balance of $39.8 million in senior notes repurchases was funded through the monetization of
2016 oil and NGL hedges.
MEMP’s total debt outstanding as of each of the respective dates are as follows:
(Amounts in $000s)
Credit Facility due 2018
7.625% Senior Notes due 2021
6.875% Senior Notes due 2022

   $2,032,990     $1,852,110     $1,835,752
As of June 30, 2016, MEMP was in compliance with the financial covenants under its revolving
credit facility. These covenants include a first lien coverage test of 3.25x, an interest coverage
ratio of 2.5x and a current ratio of 1.0x.
Updated 2016 Guidance (1)
6
The updated 2016 guidance included in this press release is subject to the cautionary statements
and limitations described under the “Forward-Looking Statements” caption at the end of this
press release. MEMP’s updated 2016 guidance is based on its current expectations regarding
capital expenditure levels and on the assumption that market demand and prices for oil and
natural gas will continue at levels that allow for economic production of these products. It reflects
the impact of forecasted capital spending as well as the impact of the oil and natural gas
producing properties divested through today. A summary of the guidance, assuming no
additional divestitures or acquisitions, is presented below:

Financial Measures” for a description of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow and the reconciliation to

(5) On June 1, 2016 MEMP acquired its general partner from Memorial Resource Development Corp. In connection
with that acquisition, the MEMP general partner interest was converted into a non-economic interest and the
MEMP incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”) were cancelled. Prior to that acquisition, MEMP’s calculation of
quarterly distributions required the calculation of Operating Surplus under the MEMP partnership agreement,
which required the use of “estimated maintenance capital expenditures” for such calculation. Accordingly, in
previous periods MEMP used estimated maintenance capital expenditures to calculate Distributable Cash Flow
for each period. Beginning with its acquisition of its general partner and cancellation of the IDRs, Operating
Surplus is no longer relevant to the calculation of distributions. Accordingly, MEMP no longer uses estimated
maintenance capital expenditures to calculate Distributable Cash Flow. In addition, in the current commodity
price environment all of MEMP’s capital expenditures are maintenance capital expenditures. Accordingly, MEMP
presents Distributable Cash Flow as using capital expenditures rather than estimated maintenance capital
expenditures in such calculation. Distributable Cash Flow has been recalculated for the historical periods
presented in this press release for consistency.
These estimates reflect management’s best judgment based on current expectations about the
future and anticipated market conditions based upon both stated and unstated assumptions and
other factors. Although management believes such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable,
they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks that are beyond MEMP’s
control. Actual conditions and assumptions may change over the course of the year.
Second Quarter 2016 Cash Distribution
As announced on July 27, 2016, the board of directors of MEMP’s general partner approved and
declared a cash distribution of $0.03 per unit for the second quarter of 2016. This distribution
represents an annualized amount of $0.12 per unit and will be paid on August 12, 2016 to
unitholders of record as of the close of business on August 5, 2016.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes “forward-looking statements.” All statements, other than statements
of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments
that MEMP expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking
statements. Terminology such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,”
“project,” “intend,” “estimate,” “believe,” “target,” “continue,” “potential,” the negative of such
9
terms or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about MEMP’s future
capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), expectations regarding cash
flows, distributions and distribution rates, and expectations of plans, goals, strategies (including

the circumstances, but such assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Such statements are also
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of MEMP,
which may cause MEMP’s actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by
the forward-looking statements. These include risks and uncertainties relating to, among other
things, the uncertainty inherent in the development and production of oil, natural gas and natural
gas liquids and in estimating reserves; drilling activities; volatility in the prices for, oil, natural gas
and natural gas liquids, including a further or extended decline in commodity prices; potential
difficulties in the marketing of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; competition in the oil and
natural gas industry; potential failure or shortages of, or increased costs for, drilling and
production equipment and supply materials for production; risks related to acquisitions, including
MEMP’s ability to integrate acquired properties; risks related to MEMP’s ability to generate
sufficient cash flow to pay distributions, to make payments on its debt obligations and to execute
its business plan; MEMP’s ability to access funds on acceptable terms, if at all, because of the
terms and conditions governing MEMP’s indebtedness or otherwise; and the risk that MEMP’s
hedging strategy may be ineffective or may reduce its income. Please read MEMP’s filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including “Risk Factors” in MEMP’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K, and if applicable, MEMP’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current
Reports on Form 8-K, which are available on MEMP’s Investor Relations website at

discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those in such
forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-
looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. All forward-looking
statements in this press release are qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.
Except as required by law, MEMP undertakes no obligation and does not intend to update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future results or
otherwise.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and accompanying schedules include the non-GAAP financial measures of
Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow. The accompanying schedules provide a
reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial
measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. MEMP’s non-GAAP financial
measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures such as net income,
operating income, net cash flows provided by operating activities or any other measure of
financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. MEMP’s non-GAAP
financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies
because they may not calculate such measures in the same manner as MEMP does.
Adjusted EBITDA. MEMP defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss, plus interest
expense; income tax expense; depreciation, depletion and amortization; impairment of goodwill
and long-lived assets; accretion of asset retirement obligations; losses on commodity derivative
instruments; cash settlements received on expired commodity derivative instruments; losses on
sale of assets; unit-based compensation expenses; exploration costs; acquisition and divestiture
related costs; bad debt expense; and other non-routine items, less interest income; gain on
extinguishment of debt; income tax benefit; gains on commodity derivative instruments; cash
settlements paid on expired commodity derivative instruments; gains on sale of assets and other,
net; and other non-routine items. Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a supplemental
financial measure by management and external users of MEMP’s financial statements, such as
investors, research analysts and rating agencies, to assess: (1) its operating performance as
compared to other companies and partnerships in MEMP’s industry without regard to financing
methods, capital structures or historical cost basis; (2) the ability of its assets to generate cash
sufficient to pay interest, support MEMP’s indebtedness and make distributions on its units; and
(3) the viability of projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.
Since Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or loss and
because these measures may vary among other companies, the Adjusted EBITDA data
presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net cash
provided by operating activities.
11
Distributable Cash Flow. MEMP defines distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA, less cash
income taxes; cash interest expense; and total capital expenditures. Management compares the
distributable cash flow MEMP generates to the cash distributions it expects to pay MEMP’s
partners. Using this metric, management computes MEMP’s distribution coverage ratio.
Distributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for MEMP’s limited partners
since it serves as an indicator of MEMP’s success in providing a cash return on investment.
Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not MEMP is generating
cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in its quarterly cash distributions.
Distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with
respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is, in part,
measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay
to a unitholder. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net
cash provided by operating activities. On June 1, 2016 MEMP acquired its general partner from
Memorial Resource Development Corp. In connection with that acquisition, the MEMP general
partner interest was converted into a non-economic interest and the MEMP incentive distribution
rights (“IDRs”) were cancelled. Prior to that acquisition, MEMP’s calculation of quarterly
distributions required the calculation of Operating Surplus under the MEMP partnership
agreement, which required the use of “estimated maintenance capital expenditures” for such
calculation. Accordingly, in previous periods MEMP used estimated maintenance capital
expenditures to calculate Distributable Cash Flow for each period. Beginning with its acquisition
of its general partner and cancellation of the IDRs, Operating Surplus is no longer relevant to the
calculation of distributions. Accordingly, MEMP no longer uses estimated maintenance capital
expenditures to calculate Distributable Cash Flow. In addition, in the current commodity price
environment all of MEMP’s capital expenditures are maintenance capital expenditures.
Accordingly, MEMP presents Distributable Cash Flow as using capital expenditures rather than
estimated maintenance capital expenditures in such calculation. Distributable Cash Flow has
been recalculated for the historical periods presented in this press release for consistency.
