<p><b>Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p> In its decision 2/102, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in 
accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to 
update the relevant reports and studies. Pursuant to Commission resolution 2005/64, a 
comprehensive annual report was submitted to the Commission at its sixty-second 
session (E/CN.4/2006/14). 
</p>
<p> A note by the Secretariat (A/HRC/4/52) was submitted to the Council informing it on the 
progress of the mandate entrusted to the High Commissioner with regard to the possibility of 
developing a racial equality index. The guidance of the Council was also requested in order for 
the High Commissioner to proceed with the mandate. 
</p>
<p> The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is 
honoured to inform the Council that the report submitted to the Commission at its sixty-second 
session was a comprehensive report established pursuant to Commission resolution 2005/64, in 
which the Commission requested the High Commissioner to expedite the consultative process on 
examining the possibility of the development of a racial equality index and to submit a draft 
basic document on the proposed index. The report contains information on the consultations 
conducted by OHCHR. That information is still relevant and the guidance of the Council would 
be appreciated in order for the consultation process to continue.
