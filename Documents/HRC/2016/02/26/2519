<p><i>Guided also</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International

</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the commitment reached at the World Conference on Human Rights in

</p>
<p>elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,

<p>the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on the elimination of 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and on the right to

</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the human right of everyone to education, which is enshrined in, inter

<p>the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training, and other relevant international 
</p>
<p>instruments,  
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action recognizes 
</p>
<p>that education at all levels and all ages, including within the family, in particular human 
</p>
<p>rights education, is a key to changing attitudes and behaviour based on racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and to promoting tolerance and respect 
</p>
<p>for diversity in societies, and affirms that such education is a determining factor in the 
</p>
<p>promotion, dissemination and protection of the democratic values of justice and equity, 
</p>
<p>which are essential to prevent and combat the spread of racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the important role played by the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Organization in relation to education against racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance, in particular the Slave Route Project and the Teaching 
</p>
<p>Respect for All initiative,  
</p>
<p><i>Encouraging</i> all States, in cooperation with the United Nations, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other relevant international 
</p>
<p>organizations, to initiate and develop cultural and educational programmes aimed at 
</p>
<p>countering racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to 
</p>
<p>ensure respect for the dignity and worth of all human beings and to enhance mutual 
</p>
<p>understanding among all cultures and civilizations,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the efforts made by Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and by the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
</p>
<p>Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in this regard,  
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that the realization of the right to education, including for girls and 
</p>
<p>persons belonging to vulnerable groups, contributes to the eradication of poverty and of 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Underlines</i> the necessity for increased political will and commitment in using 
</p>
<p>education as a tool to prevent and combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
</p>
<p>related intolerance; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Reaffirms</i> that education, development and the faithful implementation of all 
</p>
<p>international human rights norms and obligations, including enactment of laws and 
</p>
<p>political, social and economic policies, are crucial to combat racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Recognizes</i> that quality education, the elimination of illiteracy, access to free 
</p>
<p>primary education for all can contribute to more inclusive societies, equity, stable and 
</p>
<p>harmonious relations and friendship among nations, peoples, groups and individuals, and a 
</p>
<p>culture of peace, fostering mutual understanding, solidarity, social justice and respect for all 
</p>
<p>human rights for all; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Underlines</i> the essential role of education, including human rights education 
</p>
<p>and education that is sensitive to and respects cultural diversity, especially among children 
</p>
<p>and young people, in the prevention and eradication of all forms of intolerance and 
</p>
<p>discrimination, and welcomes the catalytic role that non-governmental organizations play in 
</p>
<p>promoting human rights education and raising awareness about racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; </p>


<p>5. <i>Urges</i> States, in particular: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To adopt and implement laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of 
</p>
<p>race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, at all levels of education, both formal and 
</p>
<p>non-formal; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To take all appropriate measures to eliminate obstacles limiting the access of 
</p>
<p>children to education; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To ensure that all children have access without discrimination to education of 
</p>
<p>good quality; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To support efforts to ensure safe school environments, free from violence and 
</p>
<p>harassment motivated by racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia or related intolerance;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also</i> <i>urges</i> States to introduce and, as applicable, to reinforce anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination and anti-racism components in human rights programmes in school 
</p>
<p>curricula, to develop and improve relevant educational material, including history and other 
</p>
<p>textbooks, and to ensure that all teachers are effectively trained and adequately motivated to 
</p>
<p>shape attitudes and behavioural patterns based on the principles of non-discrimination, 
</p>
<p>mutual respect and tolerance; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Draws attention</i> to the potential of increasing the use of the new information 
</p>
<p>and communications technologies, including the Internet, to create educational and 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising networks against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance, both in and out of school, as well as to the ability of the Internet to promote 
</p>
<p>universal respect for human rights and also respect for the value of cultural diversity; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Stresses</i> <i>the need</i> for States parties to implement fully their obligations under 
</p>
<p>the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as 
</p>
<p>the principal convention in the fight against racism, and in particular their obligations 
</p>
<p>thereunder with respect to the elimination of racial discrimination, the right to education 
</p>
<p>and training and the obligations to adopt immediate and effective measures in the fields of 
</p>
<p>teaching, education, culture and information;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Recalls</i> the importance of international cooperation in promoting education as 
</p>
<p>a tool to prevent racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and to 
</p>
<p>share good practices; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to continue to address the role of 
</p>
<p>education to prevent racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in his 
</p>
<p>next reports as appropriate and, in this context, encourages all States and other stakeholders 
</p>
<p>to provide information on good practices to the Special Rapporteur to be made publicly 
</p>
<p>available on his website.
