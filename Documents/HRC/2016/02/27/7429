<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 9 September 2014, pursuant to paragraph 14 of its resolution 25/19, the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council held at its twenty-seventh session a panel discussion on history teaching and 
</p>
<p>memorialization processes, with a view to, inter alia, contributing to the sharing of good 
</p>
<p>practices in this area. 
</p>
<p>2. The panel discussion was chaired by Baudelaire Ndong Ella, President of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, and moderated by Farida Shaheed, Special Rapporteur in the field of 
</p>
<p>cultural rights. The United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Flavia 
</p>
<p>Pansieri, delivered an opening statement. The panellists were Dubravka Stojanovic, 
</p>
<p>Professor of History at the University of Belgrade; Sami Adwan, Professor of Education 
</p>
<p>and Teacher Training at Hebron University in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; Marie 
</p>
<p>Wilson, Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada; and Pablo 
</p>
<p>de Greiff, Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees 
</p>
<p>of non-recurrence. 
</p>
<p>3. The present summary was prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, pursuant to paragraph 15 of Council resolution 25/19, in 
</p>
<p>which it requested the High Commissioner to prepare a summary report on the panel 
</p>
<p>discussion.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening statement by the Deputy High Commissioner for 
Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>4. In her opening statement, Ms. Pansieri noted the timeliness of the panel discussion 
</p>
<p>taking place in 2014, which marks 100 years since the start of the First World War. She 
</p>
<p>emphasized that the way the past was viewed, interpreted and sometimes distorted guided 
</p>
<p>people&#8217;s understanding of the present and shaped relationships between and within 
</p>
<p>communities. In particular, the urge for revenge, the denial of other peoples&#8217; narratives, the 
</p>
<p>exclusion of groups from official memories and the negative portrayal of some 
</p>
<p>communities in history textbooks pitted peoples against one another and incited 
</p>
<p>discrimination, hate and persecution. Conversely, providing space for different 
</p>
<p>communities to present their perspectives on history fostered mutual understanding and 
</p>
<p>helped to develop a sense of common humanity. 
</p>
<p>5. The Deputy High Commissioner noted that most or perhaps all societies faced 
</p>
<p>challenges in addressing the past. That included in particular societies that had suffered 
</p>
<p>conflict, civil wars or authoritarian regimes; post-colonial and post-slavery societies; and 
</p>
<p>societies that were challenged by divisions based on ethnic, national or linguistic 
</p>
<p>backgrounds, or on religion, belief or political ideology. 
</p>
<p>6. The Deputy High Commissioner stressed the essential part played by justice and 
</p>
<p>remedy, through the pursuit of truth and respect for human rights, in putting an end to what 
</p>
<p>she called the churning cycle of massive human rights violations. Reconciliation processes 
</p>
<p>clearly needed to weave new and inclusive historical narratives. The Deputy High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner noted that official genuine apologies had the vital effect of recognizing 
</p>
<p>victims as rights-holders and granting them respect within the community. She added that 
</p>
<p>commemorations and memorials that were thoughtfully designed with a multi-perspective 
</p>
<p>approach could also offer recognition to various groups and give them space to articulate 
</p>
<p>their experiences and perceptions. </p>


<p>7. The Deputy High Commissioner stated that history teaching should stimulate and 
</p>
<p>promote civic engagement, critical thinking and discussion, in order to help us to 
</p>
<p>understand not only the past but also contemporary challenges, such as discrimination and 
</p>
<p>violence. She concluded that even when it was too soon or too painful to reach a shared 
</p>
<p>narrative of past events, a first achievable step was to acknowledge and understand that a 
</p>
<p>diversity of views existed about why and how the events had occurred. The challenge was 
</p>
<p>to distinguish manipulations of history for political ends from the legitimate continuous 
</p>
<p>reinterpretation of the past.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Contributions of the panellists 
</b></p>
<p>8. In her introductory remarks as moderator of the panel, Ms. Shaheed recalled that she 
</p>
<p>had devoted two consecutive reports to the issue of historical and memorial narratives in 
</p>
<p>divided societies, relating to history textbooks (A/68/296) and memorials and museums 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/49). In those reports, Ms. Shaheed sought to identify the circumstances under 
</p>
<p>which narratives of the past, promoted either by governmental or non-governmental actors, 
</p>
<p>could be or become problematic from a human rights perspective. She stressed that, too 
</p>
<p>often, stakeholders failed to acknowledge cultural diversity and the multiplicity of historical 
</p>
<p>and memorial narratives between and within communities. Unacknowledged wars also 
</p>
<p>raged in the area of culture and education, in which deep misunderstandings between 
</p>
<p>communities were cultivated, thereby preparing the grounds for discrimination, violence 
</p>
<p>and even future revenge.  
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Shaheed noted that people constantly strived on the one hand to retrieve, 
</p>
<p>validate, make known and have acknowledged by others their own history, and on the other 
</p>
<p>hand to contest dominant interpretations. She underlined the essential role of historical and 
</p>
<p>memorial narratives, as components of cultural heritage, in shaping collective identities. 
</p>
<p>Noting the lack of common narrative of the past between or within countries, she stressed 
</p>
<p>the importance of ensuring a multi-perspective approach to history teaching and 
</p>
<p>memorialization processes, and of fostering critical thought, analytical learning and debate, 
</p>
<p>so as to allow a better understanding of the contemporary challenges of exclusion and 
</p>
<p>violence.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur emphasized that academic and artistic freedoms, 
</p>
<p>unfortunately too often restricted, were important in this process. Academics and artists, in 
</p>
<p>particular, could help us to understand that neither written history nor remembrance of the 
</p>
<p>past ever produced final, never-to-be-changed outcomes. The past has always been subject 
</p>
<p>to interpretation, discussion and reinterpretation. The Special Rapporteur noted the need to 
</p>
<p>open space for diverse narratives to be articulated in culturally meaningful ways for all. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, self-expressions through artistic creativity were indispensable to make victims 
</p>
<p>visible. 
</p>
<p>11. Ms. Shaheed observed that enabling a plurality of narratives of past events was 
</p>
<p>particularly crucial in post-conflict and deeply divided societies, because it allowed insights 
</p>
<p>into the experience of the other, whoever it may be, and a glimpse of people&#8217;s common 
</p>
<p>humanity beyond the fractured identities that are especially prominent in conflict. She 
</p>
<p>concluded that such a plurality was crucial for reconciliation processes to be sustainable. 
</p>
<p>12. Ms. Stojanovic stressed the timeliness of the panel. She indicated that there was 
</p>
<p>most often no common narrative of the past. For example, numerous debates took place 
</p>
<p>shortly after the First World War on how to consider the man who killed Archduke Franz 
</p>
<p>Ferdinand, Gavrilo Princip, whom some qualified as a criminal and others as a hero or a 
</p>
<p>freedom fighter. Every historical situation has been the subject of diverging interpretations 
</p>
<p>depending on the angle from which events were analysed. Post-conflict societies, whether </p>


<p>after civil wars, dictatorships or decolonization processes, have produced parallel 
</p>
<p>interpretations that have resulted in parallel realities for people, thus preventing 
</p>
<p>reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>13. Ms. Stojanovic stated that, although it was almost impossible for two States that 
</p>
<p>were once at war with each other to develop a common narrative of past events, the 
</p>
<p>publication of a Franco-German history textbook provided a successful example of an 
</p>
<p>attempt to do just that. She specified, however, that this success was in large part due to 
</p>
<p>fortunate and rare circumstances, namely, the role of the European Union as a political 
</p>
<p>umbrella for the discussion and the highly developed state of historical and social sciences 
</p>
<p>in France and Germany. 
</p>
<p>14. However, alternatives to developing a common narrative could be recommended, 
</p>
<p>such as adopting a multi-perspective approach that enabled all voices to be heard. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Stojanovic explained that, as a result of this methodology, four books had been 
</p>
<p>published on controversial issues relating to the wars that took place in the 1990s in the 
</p>
<p>former Yugoslavia, and that Serbia had started a project involving sixty historians with the 
</p>
<p>aim of writing a book on that part of history. Ms. Stojanovic stressed the particularly 
</p>
<p>interesting role that multiple perspectives could play in turning a controversy into a debate 
</p>
<p>in which all sides could express their interpretation. She underlined the importance of 
</p>
<p>changing the way that history as a subject was taught in schools, from hiding controversies 
</p>
<p>to showing them and opening discussion about the various existing narratives. She 
</p>
<p>recognized that, while it was often impossible to reach a consensus on past events, a 
</p>
<p>fundamental first step was for pupils to be informed about other groups&#8217; perspectives. 
</p>
<p>15. Ms. Stojanovic noted that history curricula tended to deal solely with political 
</p>
<p>history, which overstressed conflicts, whereas there would be large scope for learning 
</p>
<p>important historical events within social history, for example, including gender-related 
</p>
<p>history. 
</p>
<p>16. Mr. Adwan co-authored &#8220;<i>Side by Side: Parallel Histories of Israel-Palestine</i>&#8221;, a 
</p>
<p>history textbook written by a group of Israeli and Palestinian teachers. He specified that the 
</p>
<p>publication of the book, the result of seven years of rigorous collaboration, followed the 
</p>
<p>failure by both sides to implement certain terms of the 1993 Oslo Accords relating to the 
</p>
<p>review of the education systems to make them peace-oriented, which had directed both 
</p>
<p>sides to develop a history textbook in the spirit of the Accords. Instead, each side continued 
</p>
<p>to teach its own narrative only. The aim of the history textbook elaborated by Mr. Adwan 
</p>
<p>and his counterparts was to introduce both narratives side by side, giving them equal space. 
</p>
<p>This became possible by choosing to present the textbook in the form of columns, one for 
</p>
<p>each narrative, with an empty space between them for students to write their comments. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Adwan stated that it not only created a sense of equality in terms of the space allocated 
</p>
<p>to each narrative, but also brought a certain symmetry between the teachers despite the 
</p>
<p>existing asymmetry of power between the two States. 
</p>
<p>17. The main effect of the textbook was to provide Israeli and Palestinian pupils with an 
</p>
<p>opportunity to study each other&#8217;s history as well as their own. Mr. Adwan noted that, in 
</p>
<p>doing so, the project fitted into a democratic framework by, inter alia, integrating the right 
</p>
<p>of children to gain access to information and the academic freedoms of teachers and 
</p>
<p>researchers. He expressed the need to move education from being a means of perpetuating 
</p>
<p>the conflict to a means of building peace and stressed that there was scope to learn from 
</p>
<p>each other&#8217;s trauma. 
</p>
<p>18. Mr. Adwan elaborated on some of the difficulties that he and other teachers had 
</p>
<p>encountered during the development and implementation of the project and the challenges 
</p>
<p>that lay ahead. In the developing phases of the project, the ongoing nature of the Israeli-
</p>
<p>Palestinian conflict made the collaborative process harder than expected, including in terms </p>


<p>of willingness to set each other&#8217;s differences aside. Mr. Adwan stressed that it was, 
</p>
<p>however, important that such textbooks be drafted by teachers and not by historians, 
</p>
<p>because the drafting process would itself re-educate the teachers to some extent and train 
</p>
<p>them in a way that they could then pass on to their pupils the new parallel narratives and 
</p>
<p>multi-perspectives of teaching history. Today&#8217;s main challenge was to ensure that teachers 
</p>
<p>felt comfortable and enjoyed in practice the freedom to teach both narratives. This should 
</p>
<p>be seen not as a frightening experience but as an empowering one. Such freedom should be 
</p>
<p>guaranteed by the State. 
</p>
<p>19. Mr. Adwan insisted on the strong role played by families in educating younger 
</p>
<p>generations about past events. However, the teaching that children received from their 
</p>
<p>family relations was often biased and contributed to fuelling ongoing tensions and 
</p>
<p>misunderstandings. While teachers should be in charge of delivering a more inclusive, 
</p>
<p>multi-perspective and impartial account of historical events, they must feel secure in doing 
</p>
<p>so and be convinced of the advantages of the multi-perspective approach. Mr. Adwan 
</p>
<p>emphasized the need to give children access to a variety of materials and resources in 
</p>
<p>addition to a multiplicity of textbooks and to train teachers accordingly. Also on the issue 
</p>
<p>of curriculum content, he stated that agreed criteria based on human rights should be abided 
</p>
<p>by, and that historical research should continue on the reasons that led to certain historical 
</p>
<p>events. 
</p>
<p>20. Despite the arduous experience, Mr. Adwan stated that he would recommend such a 
</p>
<p>project to other nations that were experiencing conflicting relations, political or otherwise, 
</p>
<p>with regards to historical narratives. 
</p>
<p>21. Ms. Wilson contributed as a Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation 
</p>
<p>Commission of Canada. That Commission had published as mandated a history book on the 
</p>
<p>Indian residential schools system, which had affected many generations of indigenous 
</p>
<p>children of Canada and had created a legacy of societal and personal harms. She said that 
</p>
<p>the aim of the book had been to capture part of Canada&#8217;s history that had been not only 
</p>
<p>unknown to many but also denied by others, including victims of these painful events. 
</p>
<p>These past events had had the effect of creating distorted or non-existent relationships 
</p>
<p>between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples in Canada, amplified by the teaching of 
</p>
<p>different narratives, generation after generation, and by the fact that history textbooks 
</p>
<p>themselves had included negative stereotypes. That is why the history book had been 
</p>
<p>published as part of a wider educational challenge, which, once overcome, would 
</p>
<p>eventually result in a better informed adult population capable in turn of teaching a more 
</p>
<p>honest narrative of Canada to their own children. Ms. Wilson underlined the need for 
</p>
<p>citizens to be informed by actions taken by the State, but also the media, to reshape 
</p>
<p>societies beyond given narratives.  
</p>
<p>22. Commissioner Wilson added that the impact of the history book would begin to be 
</p>
<p>felt when its contents became part of the history of Canada that all children would learn. 
</p>
<p>She underlined that provinces and territories in Canada could use it as a starting point in 
</p>
<p>view of developing more tailored narratives of the events that had taken place in their 
</p>
<p>respective jurisdictions. Two provinces and territories had already made the book part of a 
</p>
<p>compulsory new course of study for all students. Ms. Wilson emphasized, however, that 
</p>
<p>one crucial element was political will, and expressed her appreciation for the leadership that 
</p>
<p>some ministers of education had demonstrated in prioritizing the drafting of a new 
</p>
<p>curriculum in just a year and a half. The production of the curriculum was also the fruit of 
</p>
<p>hard and collaborative work between education experts and survivors of the residential 
</p>
<p>school system, including the use of artistic expressions. Further steps had included the 
</p>
<p>training of teachers themselves, who needed to learn a historical narrative that they had not 
</p>
<p>been taught at university, as well as health supports to ensure that teaching painful history 
</p>
<p>did not have a counterproductive effect by creating further harm.  </p>


<p>23. Ms. Wilson stressed that, in memorialization processes, priority should focus on 
</p>
<p>creating the conditions necessary for a constant ongoing dialogue, with lesser importance 
</p>
<p>accorded to the nature of the memorialization activity itself. Part of this dialogue has taken 
</p>
<p>place within the family context, where the impacts of injustice have often been carried 
</p>
<p>forward to the next generation of children. Ms. Wilson concluded that these questions must 
</p>
<p>be considered as urgent, not only as a tool to prevent recurrence but also as a means to stop 
</p>
<p>the continuation of similar injustices. It was also urgent to learn from elders while they 
</p>
<p>were still available to teach some of the most valued things that had been endangered by the 
</p>
<p>residential schools, especially language, cultural knowledge and spiritual ceremonies. Such 
</p>
<p>things helped to heal past harms, restore indigenous pride and enrich Canadian identity. 
</p>
<p>24. Mr. de Greiff stressed that issues relating to history teaching and memorialization 
</p>
<p>processes were central to his mandate. In his view, &#8220;cultural interventions&#8221; could 
</p>
<p>significantly contribute to the cause of transitional justice. Such interventions included 
</p>
<p>activities that take place outside of institutions formally responsible for policymaking, such 
</p>
<p>as memorials, cultural expressions and opinion articles, in various media and in museums, 
</p>
<p>for example. The Special Rapporteur underlined that there was a basic distinction to be 
</p>
<p>made between three spheres of intervention: at the cultural level, through social institutions 
</p>
<p>and by individuals. Overcoming racism, discrimination, cultures of deep fear and 
</p>
<p>underlying causes of massive human rights violations required interventions in those three 
</p>
<p>spheres. He added that oppressive and authoritarian regimes were very successful at 
</p>
<p>controlling cultural productions and that conflicts could be stopped by &#8220;cultural 
</p>
<p>entrepreneurs&#8221; who were deeply aware of the importance of cultural interventions.  
</p>
<p>25. Mr. de Greiff added that, while in many conflicts victims were considered as a threat 
</p>
<p>to the national economy and the basic interests of the ruling elites, cultural interventions 
</p>
<p>greatly contributed to making victims visible and remembering the debt owed to them. 
</p>
<p>Cultural interventions played an important part in understanding, including from an 
</p>
<p>intergenerational point of view, how violations were perpetuated in space and time.  
</p>
<p>26. Mr. de Greiff stressed that States should keep in mind that their options were not 
</p>
<p>either to forget or to remember the past but rather to discuss what kind of public space 
</p>
<p>should be made available for remembering the past and for allowing the expression of a 
</p>
<p>plurality of views. He noted that one way to open such a space was to support civil society, 
</p>
<p>financially but also by enabling the conditions for it to operate effectively. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur emphasized that transitional justice instruments, including truth commissions, 
</p>
<p>could be much more effective when they explicitly integrate cultural elements and citizen 
</p>
<p>participation. He illustrated his argument by giving examples, such as photograph or art 
</p>
<p>exhibitions set up in Peru, Timor-Leste or Sierra Leone, and the educational reforms 
</p>
<p>proposed by the Equity and Reconciliation Commission of Morocco. 
</p>
<p>27. Mr. de Greiff urged States to not only refrain from interfering with the work of civil 
</p>
<p>society for memorialization, but also to take positive steps, for example, by supporting 
</p>
<p>more strongly cultural interventions; guaranteeing effectively the freedom and 
</p>
<p>independence of actors involved in this process, including by liberalizing the establishment 
</p>
<p>of civil society organizations; facilitating access to archives; and supporting an education 
</p>
<p>regime that was sympathetic to history teaching on the basis of a multi-perspective 
</p>
<p>approach. He added that, while States should also take the reports of truth and 
</p>
<p>reconciliation commissions more fully into account, the reports themselves could perhaps 
</p>
<p>be more explicit in directing States towards the right steps to be taken. Mr. de Greiff 
</p>
<p>reminded civil society organizations of their role as participants in debates to promote 
</p>
<p>rights for all and not just a few. 
</p>
<p>28. Mr. De Greiff pointed out the gap between theory and practice in the area of history 
</p>
<p>teaching and memorialization processes. He stressed that this gap was still widely visible 
</p>
<p>through the denial, on the part of various States, of violations, including massacres and </p>


<p>genocide; common manipulation of history for narrow political purposes; obstacles to the 
</p>
<p>work of artists, academics and historians, including for gaining access to archives; 
</p>
<p>limitations of freedoms of expression and association; limited financial investment in 
</p>
<p>education in comparison with other sectors, such as the military; constraints on access to 
</p>
<p>the media; memorialization and education policies designed without adequate consultation 
</p>
<p>of stakeholders; and selective attention to certain topics to the detriment of others. He 
</p>
<p>stressed that these malpractices were regrettably more common than the expressions of 
</p>
<p>support for memorialization and history teaching. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Video projection on the role of theatre artists  
in building peace 
</b></p>
<p>29. At the end of the first round of the interactive discussion, a ten-minute video<b>1</b> was 
</p>
<p>projected, containing excerpts from a documentary film by Cynthia Cohen and Allison 
</p>
<p>Lund entitled &#8220;Acting together on the world stage: performance and the creative 
</p>
<p>transformation of conflict&#8221;. The documentary was the result of a collaboration between the 
</p>
<p>programme on peacebuilding and the arts at Brandeis University, United States of America, 
</p>
<p>and the organization Theatre Without Borders, and was screened by courtesy of the authors.  
</p>
<p>30. The video included stories about and scenes from performances that had changed 
</p>
<p>communities in conflict, and presented diverse views about the role of theatre artists in 
</p>
<p>building peace. It contained interviews with a number of theatre artists, professionals and 
</p>
<p>academics across the world on the capacity of theatre to open spaces for voicing stories, 
</p>
<p>bridging differences, dignifying memories and forging new paths to peace, providing a 
</p>
<p>context for conversation and dialogue. The video underscored the power of theatre to put to 
</p>
<p>the stage issues and questions that were taboo and to create a thought-provoking process in 
</p>
<p>the spectator&#8217;s mind, encouraging critical analysis of a certain situation. Not only did 
</p>
<p>theatre provide for an alternative means of expressing narratives in imaginative ways, it 
</p>
<p>also had proved to be a manner in which survivors of human rights violations could 
</p>
<p>exteriorize the pain that they had perhaps failed to express in an official, political context. 
</p>
<p>Theatre therefore had the potential to influence social transformation by providing grounds 
</p>
<p>for victims to reconstruct their lives. One of the theatre groups stressed the role of theatre as 
</p>
<p>a non-violent form of opposition to violence itself.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Summary of the interactive discussion

<p>33. Delegates expressed their appreciation for the organization of the panel discussion, 
</p>
<p>which represented a favourable context for sharing experiences and good practices in the 
</p>
<p>area of history teaching and memorialization processes. 
</p>
<p><b> A. General remarks 
</b></p>
<p>34. Most delegations stressed that it was essential for States to acknowledge and learn 
</p>
<p>from past wrongs in order to prevent the recurrence of human rights violations, and to set 
</p>
<p>the foundations for trust between formerly opposed groups. Some States spoke of 
</p>
<p>memorialization processes as an absolute precondition for justice and as an indispensable 
</p>
<p>element for achieving peace, noting that reconciliation could not occur when the memories 
</p>
<p>and pains of victims were despised. 
</p>
<p>35. It was noted that remembrance was part of human nature and that memories shaped 
</p>
<p>identities. As part of the array of transitional justice instruments, symbolic measures of 
</p>
<p>reparation could take the form of commemorative events and monuments in symbolic 
</p>
<p>places, with the objective of honouring the memory of the victims of a troubled past and 
</p>
<p>demonstrating recognition on the part of the authorities. Many participants underlined that 
</p>
<p>victims had to be at the centre of memorialization processes, with a focus on their plight for 
</p>
<p>protection and reparation. Indeed, victims would be unable to participate in the 
</p>
<p>reconstruction of the social fabric of a country unless they were granted minimal 
</p>
<p>recognition, including through moral or symbolic redress.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Multi-perspective approach to history teaching and memorialization 
</b></p>
<p><b>processes  
</b></p>
<p>36. Many States emphasized the importance of understanding and analysing elements 
</p>
<p>that contributed to terrible historical events, so as to provide useful grounds for 
</p>
<p>reconciliation and work towards building a better future. Some States warned that biased 
</p>
<p>historical narratives coupled with a lack of shared memories of past events could result in 
</p>
<p>further atrocities. 
</p>
<p>37. It was noted that the diversity of historical narratives had often resulted in tensions 
</p>
<p>within societies composed of groups that each held and perpetuated their own version of 
</p>
<p>historical events. Consequently, social divides between communities hindered efforts by 
</p>
<p>Governments or civil society organizations to bridge gaps.  
</p>
<p>38. Most States mentioned how crucial it was to recognize the legitimacy of diverging 
</p>
<p>narratives. This was to be considered as a first step towards opening up a dialogue in which 
</p>
<p>all sides could express their perspective and experience of past events and have the 
</p>
<p>opportunity, conversely, to listen to alternative interpretations. In this respect, of particular 
</p>
<p>note was the role of the State to make public spaces available for such discussions, on the 
</p>
<p>basis of the principle of non-discrimination, mutual tolerance and respect, thus allowing 
</p>
<p>views of all social categories to be voiced. Several delegations recognized the necessity of 
</p>
<p>cooperation between all stakeholders, including politicians, historians and other academics, 
</p>
<p>artists and communities, for the success of these public multi-perspective discussions. 
</p>
<p>39. Many States agreed that this multi-perspective approach had to be carried out 
</p>
<p>through all spheres of society, especially in the sector of education, and had to be at the 
</p>
<p>core of history teaching. Some delegations insisted on the role of history teaching as a 
</p>
<p>vector for long-term peace and stability: by acting on the younger generations and by 
</p>
<p>creating an adequate environment to foster tolerance and mutual understanding, history 
</p>
<p>teaching using a multi-perspective approach could provoke changes in attitudes and 
</p>
<p>behaviours that were currently too often grounded on stereotypes and prejudice towards </p>


<p>certain groups of people. It was also noted that commemorations could serve as useful tools 
</p>
<p>to unite people in the face of future challenges. 
</p>
<p>40. Furthermore, many States agreed that history teaching should not focus solely on 
</p>
<p>facts but should aim, through a multi-perspective approach, at developing critical and 
</p>
<p>analytical thinking and a democratic, tolerant and responsible civic attitude in relation to 
</p>
<p>social diversity. For this, classrooms should be a space for open discussion and debate on 
</p>
<p>different historical narratives, which should be drawn up following rigorous scientific 
</p>
<p>research that strived for accuracy, objectivity, inclusiveness and impartiality. 
</p>
<p>41. It was noted that it was the role of States to support academia and civil society in 
</p>
<p>their efforts to reach a collective but diverse historical narrative.  
</p>
<p>42. Several States supported the view that multi-perspective history teaching not only 
</p>
<p>was a central element to democratization processes, but also contributed to the right of 
</p>
<p>people to have access to their own heritage as well as to the heritage of others.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Challenges and related recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>43. Many States pointed out some existing malpractices in history teaching and 
</p>
<p>memorialization processes, identified as potential threats to efforts for the prevention of 
</p>
<p>recurring violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>44. Several delegates condemned the imposition of unjustified restrictions on academic 
</p>
<p>freedom and the promotion of a single, State-drafted, history textbook, which were seen as 
</p>
<p>worrying obstacles to peace and human rights. It was pointed out that some populations 
</p>
<p>were negatively portrayed in history textbooks and often presented in relation to what they 
</p>
<p>did not have as opposed to what they did have. Textbooks were often used for pupils to 
</p>
<p>learn by heart, which regrettably caused the internalization of false information. Many 
</p>
<p>history textbooks also continued to vehicle racial and gender stereotypes, which should be 
</p>
<p>eradicated as soon as possible. In this last respect, many delegations expressed the essential 
</p>
<p>role that memorialization played as a means of combating injustice and racist tragedies and 
</p>
<p>of promoting reconciliation, in line with the third World Conference against Racism, Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in 2001, and the Durban 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>45. Many States expressed their concern at the use of history teaching to stir hatred, 
</p>
<p>reinforce prejudices, spread propaganda or create hierarchies among victims. It was also 
</p>
<p>noted that, given the humanitarian catastrophe of the First World War, States should be 
</p>
<p>urged to adopt a human rights-based approach to history teaching and memorialization 
</p>
<p>processes in order to facilitate mutual understanding and ensure the non-recurrence of 
</p>
<p>serious human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>46. Concern was expressed by some States at historical distortions, such as denials of 
</p>
<p>the Holocaust. Also of concern were certain historical labels that were used by some 
</p>
<p>government officials to designate unrelated persons or groups, such as the flagrant and 
</p>
<p>unwarranted use of the term &#8220;Nazi&#8221; in an attempt to disparage a person or group. Some also 
</p>
<p>observed a noticeable rise in neo-Nazism, recalled that the promotion of anti-Semitism and 
</p>
<p>Holocaust denial should not benefit from claims for absolute protection of freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression and information and asked States to intensify their efforts against such cases, 
</p>
<p>including through the prosecution of persons involved in the destruction of memorials and 
</p>
<p>cemeteries.  
</p>
<p>47. Some delegations mentioned that memorialization processes could result in deeper 
</p>
<p>social problems if not carried out adequately. Delegations also noted with concern the 
</p>
<p>glorification of atrocities and their perpetrators that was still commonly practiced in some </p>


<p>States. They stressed that the international community should explicitly condemn such 
</p>
<p>glorification and that States should instead ensure the accountability of perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was stressed that cultural diversity could not be used a means to justify 
</p>
<p>human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>48. With regards to the conditions and recommendations for successful memorialization 
</p>
<p>processes and history teaching activities, it was observed that freedom of expression, 
</p>
<p>including freedom of the press, were regrettably not guaranteed in some countries. Many 
</p>
<p>delegations insisted on States&#8217; obligations to respect the rights to have access to 
</p>
<p>information, to freedom of opinion and expression and to freedom of association and 
</p>
<p>assembly. States should ensure access to archives and libraries, and all social sectors should 
</p>
<p>be given the opportunity to participate freely in historical debate, including academia, 
</p>
<p>whose role was of paramount importance in leading the debate by carrying out independent 
</p>
<p>research. In this regard, some participants stressed that Governments should guarantee the 
</p>
<p>autonomy of universities and research institutes, collaborate with and promote the 
</p>
<p>participation of civil society in debates and ensure access to library funds and archival 
</p>
<p>materials of public interest, including to researchers from other States. States were 
</p>
<p>encouraged to undertake an inclusive collaborative approach with regards to history 
</p>
<p>teaching and memorialization processes, respectfully taking into consideration the 
</p>
<p>contributions of all ethnic, national, religious, linguistic and cultural identities.  
</p>
<p>49. Some delegations recommended that human rights and peace education be 
</p>
<p>incorporated into history teaching, in accordance with the Basic Principles and Guidelines 
</p>
<p>on the Right to a Remedy and Reparations for Victims of Gross Violations of International 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, and 
</p>
<p>emphasized how important it was for history curricula to encompass not only the history of 
</p>
<p>the country in question but also international history. Various other delegations stressed the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of States to ensure that memorialization processes, as a form of history 
</p>
<p>teaching, were implemented in the long term. One delegation in particular encouraged all 
</p>
<p>States to publicize commemorations so as to raise awareness of historical events and their 
</p>
<p>significance. Finally, delegations underlined on several occasions that democracy and the 
</p>
<p>rule of law were the best guarantors for reconciliation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. National experiences in the area of history teaching and 
</b></p>
<p><b>memorialization processes  
</b></p>
<p>50. During the interactive dialogue, most delegations highlighted the importance of 
</p>
<p>convening a panel discussion to serve as a platform for sharing examples of good practices 
</p>
<p>in the area of history teaching and memorialization and processes. Statements of the 
</p>
<p>delegations that provided examples to illustrate their respective national experience are 
</p>
<p>summarized below.  
</p>
<p>51. Ireland stated that for the decade of commemorations 2012-2022, which was 
</p>
<p>important for the country, the Government had adopted an approach to memorialization that 
</p>
<p>was based on the principles of full acknowledgement of the totality of history of the island, 
</p>
<p>the legitimacy of all traditions, mutual respect and historical accuracy. The delegation 
</p>
<p>explained that, through a reconciliation fund, Ireland was providing support to a number of 
</p>
<p>commemorative projects, some of which might challenge the notion of separate histories 
</p>
<p>and explore how shared experiences could affect contemporary societal relationships. 
</p>
<p>52. Morocco presented some of the components of its transitional justice experience, 
</p>
<p>mentioning in particular the work undertaken by the Equity and Reconciliation 
</p>
<p>Commission. Initiatives undertaken by Morocco included the launch of the Archives 
</p>
<p>Institute of Morocco and the inventory of Moroccan public and private archives. Morocco </p>


<p>also created the Royal Institute for Moroccan History and Research and established a 
</p>
<p>research study centre on modern history, along with a specific master's degree in that area. 
</p>
<p>Finally, Morocco had established three museums of regional history aimed at the promotion 
</p>
<p>of the country&#8217;s regional and linguistic diversity. Various memory-related projects had also 
</p>
<p>been set up, and certain detention centres, known for being former places of torture and 
</p>
<p>execution, had been converted into memorial sites. 
</p>
<p>53. Algeria stated that it was commemorating, through a multi-dimensional process, its 
</p>
<p>resistance to colonization and the war of national liberation. Museums had been built, 
</p>
<p>monuments had been erected and streets, towns and buildings had been named after martyrs 
</p>
<p>and national heroes. Gatherings also continued to be organized to commemorate major 
</p>
<p>events from that period of Algerian history. A similar approach had been adopted and was 
</p>
<p>being concretized to honour the victims of terrorism and the courageous choice of the 
</p>
<p>Algerian people for national reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>54. Estonia stressed that the multi-perspective approach was a leading philosophy in 
</p>
<p>history education and stressed the highly valued role played by associations in that regard, 
</p>
<p>such as the Estonian History and Civic Teachers Association, the European Association of 
</p>
<p>History Educators and the History Network for Young Europeans. It mentioned some 
</p>
<p>international initiatives, such as the Memory of the World Register of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), to which in 2009 was 
</p>
<p>inscribed the Baltic Way, or Chain, a landmark protest that took place for the first time in 
</p>
<p>1989 to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet 
</p>
<p>Union and Nazi Germany. The delegation also referred to the establishment of the Museum 
</p>
<p>of Occupations in Estonia, the aim of which was to organize exhibitions and carry out 
</p>
<p>studies on Estonia&#8217;s recent and complex history. In addition, Estonian students were made 
</p>
<p>aware of various memorial sites, including those geographically close to their schools, 
</p>
<p>throughout the history curriculum. 
</p>
<p>55. China indicated that it had introduced a memorial day to remember the victims of 
</p>
<p>the Nanjing massacre and added that the historical archives in relation to the massacre had 
</p>
<p>been sent to the UNESCO Memory of the World Register. 
</p>
<p>56. Colombia reported that its Law on Victims and Land Restitution of 2011 established 
</p>
<p>a duty for the State to undertake memory reconstruction with the participation of a wide 
</p>
<p>range of actors, as a means to fulfilling the right to truth. Colombia&#8217;s National Centre for 
</p>
<p>Historical Memory was created to reconstruct past events and establish the truth by carrying 
</p>
<p>out studies and issuing publications. The Centre was also in charge of public policy 
</p>
<p>regarding archives on violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, of 
</p>
<p>carrying out symbolic reparation actions and of running the National Memory Museum. 
</p>
<p>57. Lithuania referred to the network of tolerance education centres, which was created 
</p>
<p>at the initiative of the International Historical Commission and engaged students, teachers, 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations and others to discuss and reflect upon political and social 
</p>
<p>reasons for historical events and on the consequences of human rights violations. The 
</p>
<p>Lithuanian delegation added that such initiatives could contribute to the multi-voice 
</p>
<p>narrative of history teaching, and thereby promote tolerance in society. 
</p>
<p>58. Sierra Leone explained that there was a societal culture of silence in the country 
</p>
<p>about the civil war, but that the Government was committed to promoting measures to 
</p>
<p>ensure a full and lasting peace. Of particular note, the delegation stressed that the premises 
</p>
<p>of the Special Court for Sierra Leone had been converted into a peace museum in 2012, 
</p>
<p>with exhibition rooms containing historical documentation and objects as well as archives 
</p>
<p>and a memorial garden that had yet to be developed.  </p>


<p>59. Armenia referred to the Armenian Genocide Museum and Monument. It stated that 
</p>
<p>the aim of the Museum, which opened in 1995, was to document all materials related to the 
</p>
<p>Armenian genocide.  
</p>
<p>60. France spoke of activities undertaken in the context of the seventieth anniversary of 
</p>
<p>the Normandy and Provence landings and of the liberation of Paris, and of the start of a 
</p>
<p>four-year cycle to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First World War. It was also 
</p>
<p>stressed that France, in 2007, had inaugurated the Museum of the History of Migration to 
</p>
<p>recognize the important role that migration had played in the development of the country.  
</p>
<p>61. In Italy, activities commemorating the 100th anniversary of the First World War 
</p>
<p>took the form of a census of all monuments that had been erected between 1917 and 1940, 
</p>
<p>the number of which stood at approximately 6,000 so far, with the objective of maintaining 
</p>
<p>and restoring them so as to perpetuate collective memory. 
</p>
<p>62. South Africa highlighted the positive effect that the Truth and Reconciliation 
</p>
<p>Commission and truth seeking activities had had on the country&#8217;s understanding of the past 
</p>
<p>and especially on lessening the burden for an easier future. The delegation also mentioned 
</p>
<p>that a monument had been built next to the remnants of Old Fort prison. 
</p>
<p>63. Turkey referred to events that had occurred in 1915 and indicated that it had offered 
</p>
<p>in 2005 the establishment of a joint historic commission.  
</p>
<p>64. Brazil referred to its National Commission on Victims of Enforced Disappearances, 
</p>
<p>created in 1995, the National Commission on Amnesty, created in 2002, and the National 
</p>
<p>Truth Commission of 2012, which was soon to publish its report. 
</p>
<p>65. In Argentina, a number of initiatives by the Government included the conversion of 
</p>
<p>former detention centres into memorial sites and museums, as well as the creation, in 2006, 
</p>
<p>of the Federal Network of Memorial Sites, which carried out national, provincial and local 
</p>
<p>memorialization and investigation policies with the National Memory Archives. 
</p>
<p>66. Romania stated that it was currently re-evaluating its own history, 25 years after the 
</p>
<p>fall of the dictatorial regime. It added that, although controversies had arisen, the re-
</p>
<p>evaluation had made it possible to discuss freely facts that had been previously unknown to 
</p>
<p>generations of citizens. Monuments had been erected to honour the memory of the victims 
</p>
<p>of totalitarian regimes. Finally, the history of the Holocaust and that of national minorities 
</p>
<p>were now taught in public schools. 
</p>
<p>67. Israel recalled that major conferences in the 1990s and 2000s on the Holocaust had 
</p>
<p>contributed to firmly establishing reparation as an integral part of the international agenda. 
</p>
<p>The Israeli delegation further stressed that Holocaust denial had been made illegal in some 
</p>
<p>countries and that Holocaust education had been instituted in many schools in order to 
</p>
<p>ensure that, despite the efforts of deniers, people would learn lessons of the past and have a 
</p>
<p>better understanding of contemporary challenges. 
</p>
<p>68. In Rwanda, new history textbooks and a new curriculum had been developed based 
</p>
<p>on scientific research. Politically motivated distortions had been eliminated. The Rwandan 
</p>
<p>delegation also referred to the creation of a national commission to preserve and protect the 
</p>
<p>memory of genocide; broad and regular education programmes on history and memory, 
</p>
<p>adapted for all categories of the population; and regular commemorations of the genocide 
</p>
<p>and preservation of genocide memorial sites across the country. 
</p>
<p>69. Japan delivered a statement in response to a presentation made by another 
</p>
<p>delegation, in which it stated that, since the war, it had been consistent in its efforts to build 
</p>
<p>a free, democratic nation that respects human rights and the rule of law.  </p>


<p><b> VI. Concluding observations 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>In their concluding remarks, the panellists reaffirmed that a lack of attention to 
</b></p>
<p><b>past wrongs and historical events inevitably resulted in a recurrence of violations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>They welcomed the fact that so many delegations supported the recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>made in the reports of the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights relating to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the multi-perspective approach in teaching history and memorialization processes, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and encouraged States to effectively implement such an approach on the ground.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Despite the expressed widespread support from delegations, there remained 
</b></p>
<p><b>much to be done in practice with regards to education and memorialization for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>sake of non-recurrence, on both the national and international levels, but also to put 
</b></p>
<p><b>an end to the continuation of injustice. In particular, it was stressed that these issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>required urgent attention and that is was never too soon to adopt a multi-perspective 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach in history teaching and memorialization processes, as without facing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>past, people could not reconcile. Furthermore, narratives of the past were in any case 
</b></p>
<p><b>carried out within families and communities, most often in a partial way. It was 
</b></p>
<p><b>therefore recommended that States open spaces and opportunities for the expression 
</b></p>
<p><b>of a diversity of historical narratives and interpretations. Of particular note was the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendation to ensure that a diversity of history textbooks and additional 
</b></p>
<p><b>materials and resources be made available to teachers and students. Panellists further 
</b></p>
<p><b>underlined that history was neither a religion nor a single truth to believe, but 
</b></p>
<p><b>something to discuss.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>It was stressed that truth commissions should foster a more inclusive account of 
</b></p>
<p><b>history and increasingly take into account the role and the plight of women in conflict. 
</b></p>
<p><b>More generally, it was underlined that other aspects of history than political history 
</b></p>
<p><b>could be usefully introduced, such as history of sciences, economy and culture, leading 
</b></p>
<p><b>to a change of attitude towards the past. A good approach was to teach social history, 
</b></p>
<p><b>reflecting on the diversity of societies and including the contributions of women to 
</b></p>
<p><b>history.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Panellists stressed that more attention had to be paid to victims of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights violations. Their participation in policies relating to history teaching and 
</b></p>
<p><b>memorialization processes had to be promoted. In order to eradicate the perpetuation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of harmful stereotypes, history teaching should encourage analytical learning, critical 
</b></p>
<p><b>thinking and debate. The panellists also noted that such an approach was a way to 
</b></p>
<p><b>counter cultural relativism and denial: while there might be various interpretations 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the causes and consequences of events, there was also a need to recognize, at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>very least, that facts were facts. This is why it was important to approach history as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>science and academic discipline with a methodology, and to respect and protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>academic freedom. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>It was noted that where there was no public acknowledgement of past events on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the part of the State, artistic events and manifestations could allow people, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular victims, to express their narrative. For this, artistic freedom had to be fully 
</b></p>
<p><b>respected and protected. Panellists stressed that States had to ensure that no reprisals 
</b></p>
<p><b>would be conducted against those who expressed alternative narratives, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>teachers who adopted a multi-perspective approach to history teaching. In this 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard, it was important that teachers be trained adequately to feel confident and safe 
</b></p>
<p><b>in teaching history from a multi-perspective angle. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Finally, the panellists encouraged the Human Rights Council to continue to address 
</b></p>
<p><b>the issue of history teaching and memorialization processes in its future work. 
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
