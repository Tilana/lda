<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 9 to 16 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
its causes and consequences, carried out an official visit to Kyrgyzstan at the invitation of 
the Government. During the course of this mission, consultations were held in Bishkek with 
the Ministries of Labour, Employment and Migration; Education; Health; and Foreign 
Affairs, as well as the National Agency on Local Self-governance, the Parliamentary 
Committee on Social Policy, the National Statistical Committee, the Deputy Chairperson of 
the Supreme Court, the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the State Commission on Religious 
Affairs and the Office of the Ombudsman. While in Osh, the Special Rapporteur met with 
the Deputy Governor of the province, the Vice-Mayor of the city and a member of 
Parliament. She also met with representatives of civil society organizations, including 
women&#8217;s groups, United Nations agencies and the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to speak with the staff and 
women survivors of violence at a women&#8217;s shelter in Bishkek and children and the staff of 
a child rehabilitation centre for street children in Osh, and to visit the Stepnoe women&#8217;s 
prison and Pretrial Detention Facility No. 5 in Osh.  
</p>
<p>2. This report examines the impact and challenges of transition on women and girls in 
Kyrgyzstan, followed by a discussion of the most prevalent forms of violence encountered 
by women and the factors aggravating their vulnerability to violence. An assessment of the 
response to violence against women by governmental and non-governmental actors will 
also be provided, together with conclusions and recommendations.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Kyrgyzstan, the 
Regional Office of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), as 
well as the United Nations country team in Kyrgyzstan for facilitating the mission. She is 
especially grateful to the women who shared their experiences with her.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to a fruitful and continued dialogue with the 
Government and other stakeholders on the implementation of the recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. The challenges of transition 
</b></p>
<p>5. Kyrgyzstan gained its independence in 1991 upon the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union, and embarked on a transition from a command economy to a market economy and 
democratic system of governance. During this transition the country experienced severe 
economic difficulties as a result of the loss of Soviet subsidies, depletion of assets and the 
loss of vast export markets under the Soviet trading bloc. By 1999, poverty had reached a 
critical level of 55 per cent of the population.1 The recovery of the economy from the late 
1990s, allowed the country to make considerable progress towards achieving 
macroeconomic stability, with an average growth of gross domestic product (GDP) of 
around 5.5 per cent a year since 2003, thereby contributing to a decline in poverty rates.2

(UNDP), 2005), p. 16.

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>6. Despite these developments in poverty reduction, Kyrgyzstan continues to figure 
among the poorest countries in the world, with an estimated 35 per cent of the population 
living below the poverty line.3  
</p>
<p>7. The country lags behind in a number of social indicators. With a human 
development index (HDI) of 0.689, Kyrgyzstan was ranked eighty-second in 1992. Over 
the last few years, this figure has dropped to its current rank of 120th, indicating a 
consistent downward trend, and pointing to regional and urban/rural disparities and 
growing inequalities between men and women.4  
</p>
<p>8. Rising inflation in 2007 and 2008, together with global price increases and the 
economic crisis, have affected the country significantly, including through a decline in 
trade and remittances.5 The latter represented 27 per cent of the total GDP in 2007 and 
continue to contribute significantly to alleviating poverty in the country.6  
</p>
<p><b> A. The changing status of women 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Government of Kyrgyzstan has undertaken some important initiatives to raise 
the status of women. Most notably, legislation setting out the principles of gender equality 
and an agenda for achieving gender parity were passed. The introduction in 2006 of 
temporary special measures in electoral legislation, which set a target of 30 per cent for 
women deputies in Parliament, has resulted in an increase of women deputies in the 
<i>Jogorku Kenesh</i> (National Parliament) from 0 to 26.6 per cent since 2005.7 Women 
constitute 35 per cent of legislators, senior officials and managers.8 Furthermore, 8.6 per 
cent more girls than boys attend school past the ninth grade, and more women than men are 
now attending university.9  
</p>
<p>10. A number of challenges, however, are undermining the impact of these successes in 
raising the overall status and day-to-day living conditions for the majority of women in 
Kyrgyzstan. While some young women have better prospects today, a large percentage of 
Kyrgyz women continue to be significantly disadvantaged.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Livelihoods and the growing feminization of poverty  
</b></p>
<p>11. Both the transition to a market economy and the current poverty ratios in Kyrgyzstan 
have had a distinct impact on women. Women were granted a number of social guarantees 
and services during the Soviet era which provided a social safety net, protecting many from 
the worst effects of poverty. However, the new market economy and social policies reveal 
in practice a trend towards a deepening feminization of poverty and gender inequality.

<p>12. Vulnerable rural women, such as divorced, single and low-income women are now 
the groups facing the most difficult situations of poverty.10 In rural areas, this is due in part 
to limited employment opportunities. However, a number of other factors appear to be 
leading to a feminisation of poverty which is affecting all groups of women.  
</p>
<p>13. Trends in tertiary education and the job market reflect the growing sexual division of 
labour, with women accounting for the vast majority of students in the educational sector, 
vocational training and the humanities. This segregation has resulted in a traditional gender 
division in the labour market, where women dominate at over 70 per cent in the sectors of 
education, health care and social services; sectors in which the salaries are 2.5 times lower 
than salaries in traditional male sectors (e.g. communications and construction).11 
Moreover, even in the traditionally female sectors, women are rarely found at the higher 
management levels, which offer higher salaries. At present, women working in these 
sectors are only able to afford 86 per cent of the minimum consumer budget,12 and cannot 
be considered economically independent.  
</p>
<p>14. The gendered nature of care work is also a causal factor in pushing women out of 
the labour market. Nearly 25 per cent of women have said that housekeeping and care of 
children and the elderly kept them out of the labour market.13 Legislation intended to 
improve the situation of women (e.g. introducing maternity benefits) has in fact acted as a 
disincentive for employers to hire women,14 and has also contributed to a declining share in 
the number of economically active women. While in 1998, 60.4 per cent of women were 
economically active, by 2007 this rate had dropped to 53.6 per cent, meaning women 
accounted for 42.2 per cent of the total economically active population.15 The level of 
unemployment among women is 1.5 times higher than that of men.16  
</p>
<p>15. As a result, various forms of self-employment (e.g. in a family business) and female 
labour in the shadow economy are becoming widespread. This &#8220;disproportionate 
participation of women in the unpaid sector&#8221;, in areas which have little or no social 
protection systems, makes them economically and socially vulnerable, thereby increasing 
their risk of experiencing violence.17 
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to public services and social security 
</b></p>
<p>16. Besides the current forces of the labour market, insufficient budgetary allocations 
for social security and lack of access to services are also leading to the deterioration in 
women&#8217;s social condition. Government spending on social assistance has steadily declined 
from 15.3 per cent in 2003 to 10.5 per cent in 2007.18 Therefore, persons who rely on the 
small amount of State benefits live below the poverty line.

<p>17. This has resulted in a decline in the quality and number of services and benefits 
available to women. It is estimated that only a quarter of kindergartens which operated in 
1990 currently remain open, with a capacity to enroll only 11 per cent of all preschool 
children.19 Such drastic cuts in affordable childcare services for women severely limit 
women&#8217;s livelihood options, while State welfare and childcare support remain too minimal 
to rely on.  
</p>
<p>18. Similarly, the Government has been unable to maintain other services such as health 
care.  
</p>
<p>19. The low levels of the State budget allocated to health in general and to maternal 
health in particular, combined with the deteriorating material conditions of women, have 
resulted in a dramatic rise in maternal mortality. According to data provided by the 
Ministry of Health, the maternal mortality rate in 2009 was 69.1 per 100,000 live births,20 
as compared to a rate of 43 in 1988. This places Kyrgyzstan among the countries with the 
highest maternal mortality rates of the 12 countries of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States. 
</p>
<p>20. The reasons for this rise in maternal mortality over the last two decades are related 
to the deteriorating social conditions of women in the country. High rates of anaemia which 
in 2009 affected 45.5 per cent of pregnant women21 are due to poor nutrition and iron 
deficiency. The high rate of complications during pregnancy, resulting largely from the lack 
of good-quality prenatal/antenatal care and referral system and a poor system of emergency 
obstetric care, results in many women dying before reaching the oblast obstetric facilities 
and in hospitals.22 Nearly 80 per cent of maternal deaths were registered in rural areas.23  
</p>
<p>21. Women and girls in rural areas in particular are further affected by the deterioration 
in access to other basic public services, such as running water and public sewerage systems, 
over the past 18 years.24  
</p>
<p><b> D. The resurgence of patriarchy and tradition 
</b></p>
<p>22. Particularly in rural areas, in which two thirds of the country&#8217;s population lives, few 
employment opportunities exist and women face difficulties in securing an independent 
livelihood. According to recent reports, chronic poverty and gender discrimination has led 
to a return to traditionalism and patriarchy where women view and depend on the family as 
the centre of their life and adopt a position of obedience and submissiveness.25 A further 
consequence of the high levels of poverty is that some women have become vulnerable to 
unregistered early, polygamous and religious marriages.

</p>
<p><b> III. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>23. Violence against women in Kyrgyzstan is gradually gaining increased visibility and 
attention. However, the laudable efforts by the Government and civil society to address this 
problem have been insufficient to reach the majority of the population. Various forms of 
violence against women such as domestic violence, bride-kidnapping, trafficking, custodial 
violence, sexual violence and harassment and violence against lesbians, bisexuals and 
transgender persons remain unreported and unpunished.  
</p>
<p>24. Marriage practices undermining women&#8217;s rights, the growing feminization of 
poverty, economic dependence, social acceptance of certain forms of violence and the 
resurgence of patriarchal practices are rendering women increasingly vulnerable to violence 
in the community, abroad and within the home.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Forms of violence and prevalence 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Domestic violence  
</b></p>
<p>25. During this mission, individuals and organizations working with victims of domestic 
violence confirmed research findings indicating that domestic violence is widespread and 
on the rise, and affects women of all social strata.26 Although disaggregated general 
statistics are available on crimes committed against women and men, such statistics do not 
indicate the scale of the problem of domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>26. Official figures emanating from other sources indicate that approximately 8,000-
10,000 emergency calls regarding family crises are registered with the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs annually, and 40-50 victims of domestic violence are hospitalized at the Bishkek 
City Hospital every month.27 According to one study, one in four women interviewed had 
suffered physical violence in the home. Furthermore, approximately 40 per cent had been 
denied the right to work outside the home or to seek an education, thereby having had their 
freedom of movement and other fundamental rights violated.28 The same study also notes 
some of the corollary effects of domestic violence: approximately 70 per cent of women 
convicted of murdering their husbands or other family members were the victims of a 
longstanding pattern of physical abuse or forced economic dependence.29 During the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to the Stepnoe women&#8217;s prison, a staff member of the State Penal 
Service working in the prison explained such acts of murder as follows: &#8220;traditionally, 
women should not reveal their problems within the family, so they wait until they cannot 
stand it anymore.&#8221; 30  
</p>
<p>27. At a societal level, violence within the family and between intimate partners is not 
generally perceived as a crime or a problem warranting legal intervention. According to one

 29 Ibid., p. 8. According to information provided by the Government on 26 April 2010, women 
</p>
<p>convicted under article 97 of the Criminal Code make up approximately 37 per cent of women 
serving their sentence in penitentiary institutions.  
</p>
<p> 30 Interview at Stepnoe Women&#8217;s Prison, 11 November 2009.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>survey, 38 per cent of women between 15 and 49 years of age believe that a husband has 
the right to beat his wife in various situations &#8211; which include leaving the home without 
permission, disagreeing with the husband, refusing to have sex, burning the food or taking 
inadequate care of the children.31 
</p>
<p>28. Some studies indicate that certain groups of women are more likely to be the victims 
of domestic violence. These groups include women aged between 25 and 44 years, women 
with no children and women with three children or more.32 During the mission, other 
vulnerable categories of women also came to light, such as elderly women and young, 
economically dependent women living with their in-laws where their husbands have 
migrated.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Bride-kidnapping  
</b></p>
<p>29. The term bride-kidnapping refers to the &#8220;act of taking a woman or girl against her 
will through deception or force and using physical or psychological coercion to force her to 
marry one of her abductors&#8221;.33 The kidnapping is usually performed by a group of men, 
who can either be men known to the victim or complete strangers. The woman is then taken 
to the home of the intended groom, where his female relatives exercise different forms of 
physical and psychological coercion to get her to &#8220;agree&#8221; to the marriage, usually indicated 
by allowing the women to place a marriage scarf on her head. The process can last for 
hours or days, depending on her level of resistance. During this period, her abductor may 
rape her, often to shame her into agreeing to the marriage rather than facing disgrace at 
home.  
</p>
<p>30. During the mission, some interviewees dismissed this practice of &#8220;bride-kidnapping&#8221;<b> 
</b>as an inoffensive tradition that is either purely symbolic or a way to avoid family objections 
to the couple&#8217;s wish to marry. This perception is strengthened by the fact that the same term 
is used for both involuntary kidnappings and those which are purely symbolic and 
consensual imitations of a kidnapping based on tradition. The cultural dimension and the 
misunderstandings surrounding this phenomenon have impeded efforts to recognize, 
combat and punish genuine cases of bride-kidnapping.  
</p>
<p>31. Although Kyrgyzstan is recognized as the country with the highest prevalence of 
bride-kidnappings,34 existing data on the extent of this practice varies considerably. 
Government statistics in 2007 on abductions in general recorded 7 kidnappings of women 
and girls and 31 cases of compulsion to marriage, a related crime.35 This represents a 
significant increase from the previous year&#8217;s statistics of 4 and 7 cases, respectively. 
However, studies estimate that the actual number is much higher. One study estimated that 
30 per cent of all marriages are the result of bride-kidnapping, while others have found that 
in certain areas, predominately at the village level, the prevalence may be as high as 80 per 
cent.36 According to the data collected over a period of eight years by the Association of 
Crisis Centres, they receive an average of 250 reported cases of bride-kidnapping a year.37

<p>32. Interviews reveal that high levels of poverty have been linked to the phenomena of 
bride-kidnapping. Men or families unable to afford the expenses associated with a wedding 
or the dowry given to the bride may conspire to kidnap a suitable woman instead. More 
rarely, the bride&#8217;s own family may conspire in the abduction in order to keep her from 
marrying a man they do not approve of or to receive a bride price from the groom&#8217;s parents. 
Other factors perpetuating this practice include the light penalties imposed for this crime 
and the fact that there is little or no social stigma attached to abduction among many 
sections of the population, who view it as an assertion of one&#8217;s cultural identity and male 
authority over women. The man&#8217;s family also benefits from such a marriage since his new 
bride is expected to take over household duties. Moreover, the girl&#8217;s parents will often 
refuse to accept their daughter back and ultimately accept the marriage in order to avoid the 
shame of having a &#8220;tainted&#8221; daughter.38  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Trafficking and exploitation  
</b></p>
<p>33. Trafficking of women and children for sexual exploitation and forced labour became 
increasingly common during the country&#8217;s transition period and continues to be a problem 
today. According to Government data, women and children are most commonly exported to 
United Arab Emirates, Turkey, China and South Korea,39 although other countries 
including the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia are also trafficking 
destinations.  
</p>
<p>34. While there are no reliable statistics specifically on incidences of human trafficking, 
data is derived from figures provided by different agencies, Government bodies, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and also from statistics on other related crimes (e.g., 
exploitation, illegal border crossing and smuggling of humans). From 2004 to 2006, the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported 309 persons as having been 
returned from slavery, including labour migrants and victims of sexual exploitation, who 
were most likely also the victims of trafficking.40 Documented calls to the State trafficking 
hotline service and NGO records identified approximately 400 victims of trafficking over a 
one year period in 2006-2007. A Government report further noted that 98 per cent of 
trafficking victims are women and girls, the majority of whom are between 15 and 30 years 
of age.41  
</p>
<p>35. Young woman and girls in Kyrgyzstan are often deceived by false offers of 
employment, either in large cities such as Bishkek or abroad. One young woman 
interviewed during the mission, described how she went to the market in Bishkek to seek 
employment only to be lured to a house in the outskirts of the city under the pretence of 
securing a job as a nanny. She was locked up for months and forced to have sex with clients 
brought to the house. After becoming pregnant, she was finally able to escape with another 
girl who was similarly imprisoned. She was living in a shelter with her infant baby and said 
she would not go to the police for fear of retaliation from her kidnappers and was even 
afraid to walk the streets of the city for fear they may recognize her. Some experts have 
argued that internal trafficking of young girls is more common than cross-border 
trafficking.42 Adolescent girls can be especially vulnerable to forced employment as

</p>
<p>36. Another young woman interviewed during the mission recounted how she had been 
convinced by a friend to travel to Saudi Arabia to find a job. Upon arrival, she had her 
passport taken, was beaten and locked up at a hotel where she was forced to prostitute 
herself by the persons who met her upon her arrival. The owner of the hotel eventually 
helped her escape. She had a child and lived with him for some time before he also began 
beating her. She was able to secure assistance to leave Saudi Arabia with her baby and is 
currently living in a shelter.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Attacks against lesbians, bisexuals and transgender persons 
</b></p>
<p>37. A high level of societal homophobia, discrimination and violence against lesbian, 
bisexual and transgender people exists in Kyrgyzstan, according to organizations working 
in this sector. One study indicates that 23 per cent of lesbian and bisexual women have had 
forced sexual contacts; 35 per cent believe that their sexual orientation or identity creates 
problems for them and society; and 56 per cent have had their families try to force them to 
change their sexual identity or orientation.44 They face discrimination in employment and in 
society. They report that the media has increased intolerance towards them with the 
homophobic tone of their press reports and issues relevant to them &#8211; including human rights 
violations &#8211; are generally overlooked by the Government and civil society. They are 
particularly concerned by discriminatory provisions in the Kyrgyz Criminal Code and the 
discriminatory implementation of other laws and policies. Transgender persons also note 
difficulties in legally changing their gender in official identity papers. 
</p>
<p>38. Many people within this category are compelled to move from rural to urban areas 
and break off ties with their family and communities, because of the pressure or violence 
they have experienced. In a meeting with the Special Rapporteur, interlocutors shared 
accounts of incidents of having been subjected to widespread discrimination and violence 
including brutal gang rapes, &#8220;curative&#8221; rapes and family violence owing to their sexual 
orientation and gender identity.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. State violence in custody 
</b></p>
<p>39. Abuse and torture while in police custody and detention facilities in Kyrgyzstan are 
not uncommon according to many interlocutors interviewed during the mission.45 The time 
of highest risk of ill-treatment is immediately after arrest and during the investigation 
period, when investigating authorities are seeking a confession. According to official 
Government figures, there were 55 official complaints (6 from women) of human rights 
violations by law enforcement officials while in police custody (IVS) or in pretrial 
detention facilities (SIZO) in 2009, as compared to 28 in 2005.46 While this represents an 
increase, the real figures are estimated to be considerably higher. The Government has

<p>stressed, however, that in fact the increase in the number of complaints received is the 
result of the efforts made by State authorities on this issue and of reforms by the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs intended to improve transparency and cooperation with civil society.47 
Despite these efforts, challenges remain with regard to implementation and effective 
remedies to be provided to victims. Beating is the most common form of violence which is 
alleged, but other forms of violence against women by State authorities were also 
mentioned during the mission, including burning with cigarettes, beating of the feet, 
isolation, death threats and sexual violence. In addition, cases of extortion and coercion 
have also been reported, whereby women arrested were forced under threat of physical 
violence, to provide money or sign over property titles. People, who have been abused by 
police after their arrest, report that they had no opportunity to make a complaint during 
their detention and that the detention was often prolonged to allow sufficient time for the 
injuries to heal and for the scars to fade. Organizations and several women victims provided 
accounts during the mission of extortion and bribery while in police custody, as well as 
being chained to a radiator, having a gun held to their head, beatings and burns.  
</p>
<p>40. According to the Office of the Ombudsman, in one incident alone, 32 persons were 
arrested during the mass riots in Nookat on 1 October 2008 and were beaten and tortured. 
One pregnant woman was shaved twice, forced to hold a heavy object for long periods, had 
her fingers beaten and was placed in a cold cell filled with water and bleach, which resulted 
in a miscarriage on 12 November 2008. A review of the results of formal complaints 
brought against law enforcement officials reveals that criminal proceedings against them 
are seldom initiated, the majority of such proceedings are subsequently thrown out and that 
disciplinary measures are rare (three in 2009). According to this same Government review, 
one criminal procedure under article 305-1 (torture) of the Criminal Code brought in 2007 
was closed, one case from 2008 is currently under judicial review and one case brought in 
2009 is under investigation.48  
</p>
<p>41. The Government has paid insufficient attention to this issue and failed to develop 
either a comprehensive strategy or proper standards of investigation into such cases. The 
lack of convictions and the absence of mechanisms providing guarantees against retaliation 
and enabling complaints to be lodged at an earlier stage, i.e., during pretrial detention or 
custody, thus perpetuate a climate of impunity. Moreover, during the mission the Special 
Rapporteur also received reports that judges frequently ignore allegations of torture, 
considering them simply a means by the accused of escaping a conviction.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Sexual harassment and sexual violence  
</b></p>
<p>42. Sexual violence, including sexual harassment in the workplace, is still largely 
unacknowledged as a significant problem in Kyrgyzstan, even though statistics indicate that 
the ratio of crimes of a sexual nature, as a proportion of the overall number of crimes 
against women, is increasing.49 There were approximately 4,210 crimes against women and 
adolescent girls officially registered in 2007, of which 283 were reported rapes and other 
violent actions of a sexual nature.50 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
 47 For example, the Government noted in its comments to this report provided on 26 April 2010, the 
</p>
<p>creation of a civilian body (which includes representatives of civil society) by the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs in 2009, mandated to monitor police activities and to independently collect complaints of 
human rights violations by members of the police force.

</b></p>
<p>43. Public awareness of sexual violence as a crime continues to be very low. According 
to a survey by the National Statistical Committee, 35 per cent of urban women and 25 per 
cent of rural women indicated that they did not believe sexual abuse to be a crime. Of the 
women who had experienced sexual abuse, most said it happened at home, near their place 
of residence or at work (in the latter case, for 12 per cent of urban women). Perpetrators, 
according to the survey, were a spouse or partner in an overwhelmingly proportion of cases 
(81 per cent) or a former spouse or boyfriend (11 per cent), with colleagues, relatives or 
strangers being rarely mentioned (3 per cent).51 
</p>
<p>44. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has expressed 
concern about the lack of detailed information on sexual violence against women in the 
report of the State party and requested information on whether there is a plan to review 
existing laws in relation to this, as well as what efforts the Government is undertaking to 
eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace.52 
</p>
<p><b> B. Aggravating factors 
</b></p>
<p>45. A number of factors in Kyrgyz society are contributing to significantly increasing 
women&#8217;s vulnerability to violence. These include a resurfacing of &#8220;traditional&#8221; and 
patriarchal practices and structures and negative marriage practices which are threatening to 
undermine the status and rights of women. At the same time, the feminization of poverty 
and deteriorating social conditions make it increasingly difficult for women to both avoid 
and leave violent situations.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Resurfacing of traditions, patriarchal practices and gender stereotypes 
</b></p>
<p>46. Gender stereotypes promoting the subordinate roles of women in the family and in 
communities and the revival of discriminatory traditions and customs appear to be gaining 
increasing support among many sections of the population. While, for some, this is 
supported by religious beliefs, others view some of these traditions as part of a unique 
Kyrgyz culture and use them in the articulation of a national identity. These factors together 
with the lack of awareness-raising campaigns among the population about the harmful 
consequences of gender-based based violence and discrimination, including in marriage 
practices, has reduced the effectiveness of legal measures for the prevention and 
prosecution of family violence.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Marriage practices 
</b></p>
<p>47. While precise data remains elusive, many experts believe that marriage practices 
such as early and forced marriage, polygamy and unregistered marriages are on the rise. 
These discriminatory practices undermine the rights and economic position of women and 
girls and are closely tied to the prevalence of domestic violence. Despite the existence of 
legal prohibitions against child marriage, forced marriages and polygamy, they have 
continued to be practiced without systematic monitoring or punishment.53

</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Early and forced marriage 
</b></p>
<p>48. The minimum legal age of marriage in Kyrgyzstan is 18, although in certain 
circumstances, local State bodies may authorize a marriage if a girl has reached 16 years of 
age.54 Approximately 12.2 per cent of women in the country get married before their 
eighteenth birthday, with early marriage being more common in rural areas and among the 
poorest households (16.5 per cent, as compared to 9.1 per cent in the richest ones).55  
</p>
<p>49. Official Government statistics also reveal a sustained increase in birth rates among 
women in the 15&#8211;17 age group since 2005, as well as a steady increase in the number of 
births to women who are officially unmarried. According to official statistics, 
approximately one third of children in Kyrgyzstan are born into marriages which are not 
officially registered,56 possibly indicating an increase in early religious marriages, which 
are not recognized under Kyrgyz law. 
</p>
<p>50. The phenomenon of early marriage in the country is often attributed to rising 
unemployment and poverty, as well as the resurfacing of patriarchal traditions and religious 
conservatism. Others contend that the lack of state effort on the issue, and more specifically 
the lack of a clear public awareness strategy to overcome patriarchal stereotypes is the 
primary reason for the increase in this practice.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Polygamy 
</b></p>
<p>51. According to a UNICEF survey data, approximately 1.7 per cent of respondents of 
fertile age (15&#8211;49 years) stated that they were in a polygamous marriage or union, with 
location and income levels being key determining factors. Polygamous marriages were 
registered more often in the Batken (3.6 per cent) and Chui (3.1 per cent) regions and 
among the richer strata of the population.57 Despite the fact that polygamy is illegal, there 
are reports that the practice is flourishing in other regions as well, particularly in the 
southern regions of Osh and Jalal-Abad.  
</p>
<p>52. Moreover, while some find polygamy to be most pervasive among the wealthier 
strata of the population, other experts see the rampant poverty, especially female poverty, 
as a major factor in the rise of the practice. Poor women may agree to become a second or 
third wife and forgo the formal rights of marriage if the husband is able to support them, 
while first wives will usually agree to their husband taking subsequent wives from fear that 
he will divorce them otherwise. Heavy labour migration of Kyrgyz men has also resulted in 
polygamous relations, as married men may enter into extramarital relations, get married and 
establish a new family while abroad.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Unregistered marriages 
</b></p>
<p>53. Under Kyrgyz law, only properly registered civil marriages are legally recognized. 
Common law and religious marriages do not benefit from any legal status or the rights and 
protections provided to persons who are legally married. Women&#8217;s organizations and 
Government officials express concern about the rate of unregistered marriages, both 
monogamous and polygamous. While some attribute this to a rise in the influence of 
religion in society, other factors must be taken into consideration, such the feminization of 
poverty and the possible motivation for the husband and his family to deny the wife 
matrimonial property rights.

<p>54. State officials with whom the Special Rapporteur met recognized the practice of 
unregistered marriage practices, generally celebrated as Islamic wedding ceremonies, as a 
growing problem in Kyrgyzstan, and were envisaging possible legislative reforms to 
address it. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Responses to violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>55. This section focuses on the legal and policy frameworks, existing practices and 
community-based response mechanisms currently in place to address women&#8217;s rights and 
violence against women. The section also highlights existing gaps in laws and practices.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Government of Kyrgyzstan has ratified numerous international human rights 
instruments,58 including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, on which it has already reported three times. Within a relatively short 
period, and in particular since 2002, the Government has taken steps to integrate these 
international standards into the national legal system by adopting numerous laws, policy 
frameworks and action plans which seek to further the advancement of women and have the 
potential to provide comprehensive human rights protection to women and girls.  
</p>
<p>57. Among others, the Law on State Guarantees of Equal Rights and Equal 
Opportunities for Men and Women, first passed in 2003 and revised in 2008, establishes the 
framework for achieving gender equality. It is complemented by the National Plan of 
Action for Achieving Gender Equality (2002-2006 and 2007-2010), which is a part of the 
country development strategy. A significant achievement was the adoption of temporary 
special measures which establish the target of 30 per cent of women among parliamentary 
deputies. Other human rights initiatives also seek to promote gender equality and 
empowerment, such as the National Programme on Human Rights (2002-2010) which 
prescribes a number of practical measures to eliminate gender inequality.  
</p>
<p>58. The adoption in 2003 of the Law on Social and Legal Protection from Domestic 
Violence represents a practical step towards defining and addressing violence in the family. 
The law defines &#8220;family violence&#8221; as &#8220;any deliberate action of one member of a family 
against another, if that action infringes legal rights and freedoms of the family member, 
causes him/her physical or psychological suffering and moral loss or poses a threat for 
physical or personal development of a minor member of the family&#8221; (art. 1). The law 
provides for a number of remedies for victims of family violence, including filing a 
complaint, obtaining a protection order, and addressing the local court of elders (<i>Aksakals</i>). 
It further specifies that victims have the right to such services as transportation to a medical 
institution for care, accommodation in a safe place and information on personal safety and 
legal aid.  
</p>
<p>59. Provisions relating to the possibility of obtaining an interim or court protection order 
are especially noteworthy. An interim protection order, valid for a period of up to 15 days, 
can be issued by a local law enforcement officer to a person who has committed or 
threatened to commit an act of family violence. Among others, this order prohibits the 
perpetrator from committing any acts of violence or having contact with the victim and 
</p>
<p>  
 58 Kyrgyzstan has ratified over 50 international human rights instruments; instruments which are an 
</p>
<p>integral part of Kyrgyz law as per the Constitution (arts. 12, para. 3, 17, para. 1 and 18). See 
http://treaties.un.org/Pages/Treaties.aspx?id=4&amp;subid=A&amp;lang=en  </p>

</p>
<p>obliges him to pay for related medical treatment. In addition, victims may apply for a court 
protection order, which can be issued for a longer period of between one and six months 
and lead to administrative or criminal proceedings if violated.59  
</p>
<p>60. Despite the existence of a law on domestic violence, the Criminal Code of 
Kyrgyzstan itself does not specify domestic violence as a category of crime and does not 
provide for a specific penalty. Rather, domestic violence is addressed through provisions 
relating to crimes involving the infliction of violence contained in the Criminal Code or the 
Administrative Code. Relevant crimes include, inter alia: &#8220;inflicting physical or 
psychological suffering through systematic beatings or through other violent means&#8221; (three 
to seven years&#8217; imprisonment); and &#8220;purposeful infliction of light damage to health having 
resulted in a short-term health disorder or in a minor permanent loss of the ability to work&#8221; 
(six months&#8217; to one year&#8217;s imprisonment). 60 Marital rape is not specifically included as a 
criminal offence in the Criminal Code. The Kyrgyz Administrative Code also contains a 
specific provision on domestic violence which provides for an administrative penalty, i.e., a 
fine, in cases where the abuse does not justify criminal proceedings.61  
</p>
<p>61. At the time of the visit by the Special Rapporteur, reforms to the Law on Social and 
Legal Protection from Domestic Violence were being considered, including possible 
changes aiming to refine and expand the definition of family violence and render protection 
orders more operational. 
</p>
<p>62. Marriage practices such as under-age and forced marriage, polygamy and bride-
kidnapping are illegal under Kyrgyz law. According to article 155 of the Criminal Code, 
forcing a woman to marry or to continue a marriage or kidnapping her in order to marry 
without her consent is punishable by a fine of 100&#8211;200 times the measurement indicators or 
imprisonment for the period of up to 3 years.62 Article 154 of the Criminal Code also 
envisages criminal liability for de facto marriage with a person under the minimum legal 
age of marriage, forcing this person into marriage and kidnapping a person under 16 years 
of age with the purpose of establishing a de facto marriage. Polygamous marriages and 
bigamy are punishable by a prison sentence of up to 2 years under article 153 of the 
Criminal Code. Persons such as religious clerics or staff of registry offices who knowingly 
formalize such a marriage are also criminally liable. Enforcement and prosecution for 
polygamy is very rare, however, in Kyrgyzstan. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
visit, officials &#8211; who were also concerned by these marriage practices &#8211; stated that they 
would be considering a number of reforms to address these problems, including requiring 
that a civil marriage be performed before any religious marriage is undertaken.  
</p>
<p>63. On 9 August 2003, amendments to the Criminal Code, and particularly to article 124 
on trafficking in human beings, brought the law into line with international standards, 
including the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, to which Kyrgyzstan is a State party. The country has also ratified the Protocol 
against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. Other provisions in the Criminal 
Code are also relevant to trafficking, including provisions on child trafficking, rape, violent 
acts of a sexual nature and involvement in the prostitution business.63 The Law on 
Preventing and Combating Human Trafficking, No. 55 (of March 17, 2005) details 
measures for the prevention of human trafficking and specifies the assistance to be provided

liability of persons guilty of involving children in trafficking in human beings, child 
prostitution and child pornography (art. 25).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>64. National women&#8217;s machinery was established in 1996 in the form of the National 
Commission on Family and Women Affairs. However, since its inception, the national 
women&#8217;s machinery has undergone a significant number of changes. A tendency towards 
political marginalization and the lack of sufficient resources have affected its capacity to 
work effectively towards realizing the country&#8217;s gender goals and commitments. 
</p>
<p>65. The National Commission was subsequently abolished in 1999 and replaced by the 
National Council on Women, Family and Gender Development under the President of the 
Republic, with its own Secretariat. This Secretariat was in turn dismissed in 2007 and its 
functions assigned to the Social and Gender Development Division of the Economic and 
Social Development Department attached to the Office of the President of Kyrgyzstan. In 
addition to its broader responsibilities, this Division assumed responsibility for gender-
related issues, as well overseeing the implementation of the National Action Plan for 
Gender Development (2002&#8211;2006 and 2007&#8211;2010).  
</p>
<p>66. In practice, each ministry and agency is responsible, through a designated gender 
focal point,64 for elaborating sectoral plans for achieving gender equality. This strategy has 
not been considered successful, however, since gender focal points have lacked decision-
making authority or the capacity to influence the agenda of their institutions. Other 
impediments include insufficient institutional capacity, the absence of a specific gender 
entity in the Government which could facilitate coordination and the limited cooperation 
between the national gender machinery and civil society organizations and gender experts.  
</p>
<p>67. In December 2007, the Parliamentary Committee for Physical Education, Sport, 
Youth and Gender Policy, was established by Parliament, with responsibility for gender 
analysis of draft laws and the organization of parliamentary hearings on gender-related 
issues. 
</p>
<p>68. The latest changes to the structure of the national women&#8217;s machinery were being 
undertaken at the time of this visit. Under the new structure, gender equality and youth 
issues have come under the responsibility of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and 
Migration. Simultaneously, the Parliamentary Committee on Social Policy has also 
replaced the Parliamentary Committee for Physical Education, Sport, Youth and Gender 
Policy. An encouraging development was the establishment of a small unit within the 
Office of the Ombudsman specifically tasked with tackling gender equality and domestic 
violence issues and complaints addressed to that office.  
</p>
<p>  
 64 According to information provided by the Government subsequent to the mission, on 26 April 2010, 
</p>
<p>an exception to this was the creation by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of a gender commission in 
order to better coordinate its work on domestic violence and gender equality issues. In 2009, the 
Government carried out a functional review of all ministries and agencies on gender issues, which 
among other things, stressed the efforts made over the last two years by the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. See &#8220;Functional Review of the national institutional mechanism to implement the gender

<p>69. In the light of the very recent nature of these structural changes, the exact division of 
responsibilities was still unclear at the time of this visit. Nonetheless, there is concern that 
these frequent structural changes and the decision to subsume gender issues into the broad 
mandates of large Government structures may further delay implementation of gender 
commitments and weaken the status of the institutional mechanisms promoting gender 
equality. This could be remedied by adopting a twin-track approach which could ensure 
mainstreaming of gender issues, while also benefiting from the focus and expertise of a 
specialized structure dedicated to gender issues.  
</p>
<p>70. In 2008, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
recommended that the Government urgently establish a body specifically responsible for 
gender issues, which would be provided with a clearly defined mandate and sufficient 
resources in order to be able to develop, coordinate and draw accountability from all 
ministries.65 This would further be consistent with Kyrgyz law, which also requires the 
establishment of a State gender policy body invested with a clear sphere of responsibilities 
and authority.66  
</p>
<p><b> C. Reporting and prosecution of violence 
</b></p>
<p>71. During the mission, interviewees stated that violence against women and girls is 
underreported. Some of the reasons which make it difficult for women to reveal domestic 
abuse and seek help include: convention, which dictates that domestic problems should not 
be revealed to the outside world; economic dependency; fear of retaliatory violence by their 
partner; the lack of sufficient support services and legal clinics; and a low level of 
awareness of their rights. Those who have been kidnapped for the purpose of marriage fear 
stigmatization and rejection by their families should they elect to report the kidnapping 
instead of marrying the perpetrator. Victims of trafficking will often fear the police rather 
than seek their help, as they may have been forced into illegal activities, and fear retaliation 
by traffickers and those conspiring with them.  
</p>
<p>72. Police practices create significant obstacles to the reporting and prosecution of 
violence against women. These include the frequent bias of police officers towards 
reconciliation of the couple, police inaction based on the belief that it is a private matter or 
the assumption that the woman will ultimately withdraw her complaint, and a tendency to 
apply administrative fines or short detention periods, even in cases that would warrant 
criminal prosecution. Moreover, experts believe that acts of domestic violence are often 
classified by police as incidences of &#8220;minor hooliganism&#8221;, or &#8220;disorderly conduct&#8221;, which 
means that appropriate protection is not provided and the real figures on domestic violence 
are distorted.67  
</p>
<p>73. Women&#8217;s low level of confidence in the police and discomfort with undertaking 
legal action for these types of crimes means that they often prefer to rely on their families, 
village elders (<i>Aksakals</i>) or women&#8217;s crisis centres to resolve the issue or provide 
temporary assistance. According to a Government study, women victims of violence have 
expressed overall dissatisfaction with how the police handled their cases. The majority of 
women, 65 per cent, were displeased because the police did not find or arrest the 
perpetrator (41.7 per cent), did not demonstrate interest in the case or failed to report on the 
investigation.68

<p>74. These practices and the lack of sufficient police training on relevant legislation and 
the nature of violence against women result in a failure to register and investigate 
complaints, take meaningful protective measures (e.g. protection orders) and support 
prosecutions for such crimes. Practical problems relating to the lack of printed forms used 
to issue protection orders also means that some police are not aware of and do not have 
access to these orders in their day-to-day work.69  
</p>
<p>75. The number of protection orders issued annually varies considerably. There is a 
notable increase in usage as indicated in statistics: 95 were issued within the first four 
months of 2008, as compared to a total of 62 in 2004.70 According to information received 
from the Ministry of Internal Affairs subsequent to the mission, there has been an even 
greater increase in the number of protection orders issued by district police in 2008&#8211;2009 
and relevant departments in all districts were issued with the necessary forms for this 
purpose. The Ministry further highlighted other notable efforts undertaken during 2008&#8211;
2010, including training of staff of the Ministry, the production of guidelines and 
informational notes for the police as well as the general population, participation in 
parliamentary hearings devoted to the implementation of the Law on Social and Legal 
Protection from Domestic Violence and the conduct of an independent monitoring of the 
implementation of that law.71 While these initiatives are indeed encouraging, they require 
sustained implementation over time, as well as more outreach to both the police and the 
general population so as to address negative practices and a general lack of information. 
Despite a rise in the numbers of temporary orders issued, many believe that, in the context 
of the large number of cases of domestic violence in Kyrgyzstan, the figures are still very 
low.  
</p>
<p>76. Judicial hearings of cases of domestic violence are also rare.72 The reluctance of 
women to approach the courts in domestic violence cases was explained to the Special 
Rapporteur by a State official in the General Prosecutor&#8217;s office, who believed that women, 
particularly in rural areas, still found it psychologically difficult to have recourse to the 
courts, especially if children are involved. They may also be economically dependent on 
their husband and lack the resources to undertake legal proceedings.  
</p>
<p>77. While coercion and abduction for the purposes of forced marriage is illegal, the light 
penalties imposed and the reluctance of victims, families and authorities to report and 
prosecute acts of bride-kidnapping, has resulted in widespread impunity for this crime. It is 
estimated that the majority of women victims do not refer the case to law enforcement 
bodies or other State bodies. Moreover, when there is a report, law enforcement authorities 
are often reluctant to investigate and prosecute cases of bride-kidnapping and often wait to 
see whether the complainants change their mind.73  
</p>
<p>78. In 2006 and 2007, judicial authorities received 67 criminal cases brought under 
article 124 (on human trafficking) of the Criminal Code, 23 indictments were issued (all 
resulting in convictions), 1 criminal case was discontinued and 37 cases were returned to 
the prosecutor. By the end of the above reporting period, there were 6 incomplete cases and 
a total of 29 completed cases.74 Many cases of human trafficking, however, do not reach the

<p>courts, while others are allegedly reclassified as lesser crimes such as &#8220;fraud&#8221;. Many 
victims turn instead to crisis centres. Of the 368 persons to whom SEZIM, a crisis centre in 
Bishkek, provided shelter, 128 were trafficking victims.75  
</p>
<p>79. A department to combat human trafficking and crimes involving foreign citizens 
was created within the General Directorate for Criminal Investigations of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs in May 2004.76 Discussions with the Ministry of Labour, Employment and 
Migration confirmed that figures on trafficking are difficult to ascertain, indicating that 
reports on trafficking are primarily based on complaints and investigations undertaken, 
information collected by IOM, and figures provided by crisis centres. It was further 
highlighted that approximately 60 per cent of Kyrgyz labour migrants abroad (of whom 
there are estimated to be half a million) are currently women, some of whom are potentially 
also victims of trafficking for labour or sexual exploitation. As such, the Ministry has 
undertaken preventive work, cooperated with international organizations on this issue and 
established bilateral agreements with Governments of destination countries such as 
Kazakhstan. A national hotline for victims of trafficking has also been set up with eight 
regional networks, where victims can seek help and make a complaint.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Support services 
</b></p>
<p>80. According to a Government survey, 85 per cent of women were not aware of the 
existence of specialized institutions such as crisis centres and shelters which could provide 
them with information, support and temporary shelter.77 There are no State-run crisis 
centres or shelters for women victims of violence in Kyrgyzstan, despite the fact that the 
legislation on family violence provides for the establishment of such centres.78  
</p>
<p>81. There are a total of eight crisis centres in the country, mainly supported by 
international organizations, although a few, such as the SEZIM crisis centre, receive some 
limited State assistance which provides them with the use of a building and utilities. These 
centres are underfunded and rely mainly on international funds which are typically for 
short-term activities rather than operating expenses. Despite their meagre resources, 
according to Government statistics, the number of women referred to these crisis centres 
has been steadily increasing, from 2,072 in 2004 to 3,731 in 2007.79  
</p>
<p><b> E. Community mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>82. Rather than reporting domestic violence cases to the police, many women turn to 
<i>Aksakals</i>, courts of community elders which function as a community justice system and 
are more accessible to rural populations in particular. According to Government statistics, 
451 women were referred to <i>Aksakal</i> courts in 2007.80 While Kyrgyz law provides that 
some domestic disputes may be handled by <i>Aksakal</i> courts,81 many believe that police refer 
to this mechanism too often and inappropriately, including when the cases should more 
properly be investigated as a criminal matter. Article 15 of the Law on Aksakal Courts 
grants elders jurisdiction to hear cases related to family conflicts of a civil nature,

<p>reprimand the perpetrator and impose compensation for damages and a fine. They may hear 
cases addressed to them by individuals, the courts and the procuracy, as well as by the 
police &#8211; but only if latter have been authorized to do so by the procuracy. In practice, it 
appears that police frequently do not observe this requirement and refer the case to 
<i>Aksakals</i> upon receiving the complaint.82  
</p>
<p>83. This raises concerns that cases of violence against women which potentially fall 
under the scope of the Criminal Code are brought instead to a community dispute 
mechanism whose task is to promote reconciliation, often at the expense of the woman&#8217;s 
wellbeing and which cannot issue protection orders, detain or imprison the abuser. This 
reconciliation role played by <i>Aksakal</i> courts is praised by some Government and non-
governmental organizations, who view saving the marriage as the priority. In addition to 
domestic conflicts, <i>Aksakal</i> courts also address land and property issues, another area of 
concern to rural women.83  
</p>
<p><b> F. Statistics and data 
</b></p>
<p>84. The Law on State Guarantees of Equal Rights and Equal Opportunities for Men and 
Women (2008) provides for the collection of gender-disaggregated statistics,84 as does the 
National Plan of Action for Achieving Gender Equality (2007&#8211;2010), which calls for the 
development of a gender evidence base and related statistical information.85 Since 2000, the 
National Statistical Committee has produced an annual compilation of gender 
disaggregated statistics entitled &#8220;Women and Men in the Kyrgyz Republic&#8221;. While this is a 
useful tool, including for assessing progress on the Millennium Development Goals, 
statistics pertaining to violence against women are insufficient.  
</p>
<p>85. Evidence-based policies and programmes to address the prevailing forms of violence 
against women and girls in Kyrgyzstan require more detailed statistics, notably with regard 
to domestic violence. The absence of this category of crime in statistics on crimes against 
women and children and in police reporting methodologies impedes both efforts to 
ascertain the extent of the problem and information which would support improved 
responses and strategies to address the issue. Statistics on referrals to crisis centres, <i>Aksakal</i> 
courts and other institutions could be further strengthened by details on who provides the 
referral, the number of referrals by police officers and the type of case concerned. Statistics 
on various forms of trafficking in humans, both internal and abroad, are necessary in order 
to ensure better diagnosis and response to this problem. 
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for the survey it conducted in 
the form of an opinion poll on women&#8217;s current status in society, gender equality and 
violence against women, which appeared in the 2007 edition of <i>Women and Men in the 
Kyrgyz Republic</i> and encourages further efforts in this regard.

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Government of Kyrgyzstan has secured formal legal achievements in the 
areas of gender equality, protection from domestic violence and political 
representation, in the context of difficult social and economic challenges faced by the 
country since its independence. However, these formal commitments have not 
translated into practical actions and improvements in the lives of the majority of 
women. The deteriorating social condition of women is evident in a deepening 
feminization of poverty, sharp declines in the participation of women in the formal 
labour market and poor access to public services.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Insufficient social welfare provisions have further eroded women&#8217;s economic 
and social position, resulting in increasingly inferior negotiating positions within 
society and in the family. This is reflected in the rise of marriage practices such as 
bride-kidnapping, polygamous unions, early marriage and the rise in unregistered 
religious marriages, which undermine the rights of women and increase their 
vulnerability to all forms of violence. Their access to justice and protection is impeded 
by limited numbers of shelters, legal aid services and awareness of their rights, as well 
as by economic dependency and the reluctance by law enforcement structures and 
society at large to recognize numerous forms of violence as crimes requiring serious 
attention.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Patriarchal articulations of a national and cultural identity and a reported rise 
in the influence of religious conservatism further undermine the position of women in 
Kyrgyz society. In addition, the marginalization of the national women&#8217;s machinery 
and the lack of budgetary allocations and concrete measures to implement gender-
related commitments have all impeded efforts to advance gender equality and 
eliminate violence against women.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>In light of the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the following 
recommendations to the Government of Kyrgyzstan. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Women&#8217;s empowerment and gender equality: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish an independent State body specifically responsible for women&#8217;s rights 
and gender equality issues. This body should be invested with a clear mandate, 
authority and sufficient resources and able to develop national gender policies, 
undertake coordination activities and solicit accountability from all ministries. 
Policy development and monitoring should be its core responsibilities, while 
implementation remains the separate responsibility of other bodies.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Provide clear terms of reference on women&#8217;s rights and gender equality issues 
for the new Parliamentary Committee on Social Policy, including a strong 
advocacy and monitoring role as regards the gender dimensions of policies and 
legislation.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Support the new gender unit within the Office of the Ombudsman with 
sufficient resources to conduct education, advocacy and legal and research 
work.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Use the media to promote public awareness campaigns on women&#8217;s human 
rights, violence against women and gender stereotypes.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Undertake a gender analysis of school books and curriculums at the primary 
and high-school levels, with a view to eliminating gender stereotypes and 
promoting gender equality and non-violence. Relevant teacher training should 
be provided.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Consider the establishment of positive temporary measures to encourage 
increased participation of women in local political and decision-making 
structures, including the local <i>Aksakal</i> courts.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Develop a new National Action Plan for Gender Development which takes into 
account the body of information available on the status of women, including the 
situation of rural women. Effective mechanisms to ensure accountability in the 
implementation of the plan should be instituted.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish a sustainable mechanism for the systematic gender analysis of 
legislation and programmes, as required under Kyrgyz legislation.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Examine and adopt measures to address the different factors impeding 
women&#8217;s position and opportunities in the labour market, including that of 
rural women.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Make specific budgetary commitments towards the implementation of 
programmes related to gender equality, the socio-economic position of women 
and violence against women and girls.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Elimination of violence against women and girls: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Treat violence against women as a criminal offence and investigate and 
prosecute cases within the formal justice system.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish specialized female law enforcement units, including in rural areas.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Develop mechanisms, both legal and social, to combat internal trafficking and 
sexual exploitation of women and girls. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Commit sustainable State support to women and girls&#8217; crisis centres, including 
in areas currently not serviced.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish information and assistance centres for women and girls at risk who 
have moved from rural to urban centres.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish effective monitoring systems of decisions by <i>Aksakal</i> courts, a policy 
of strengthened cooperation and engagement with them and promote female 
participation.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Support awareness-raising campaigns on domestic violence and women&#8217;s rights 
which specifically target community leaders and local populations.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Undertake reforms with regard to temporary and court protection orders and 
adopt practical measures to facilitate their implementation.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Take measures to ensure the protection of women who are victims of 
discrimination and violence on account of their sexual orientation or gender 
identity, and simplify procedures for changing the sexual identity of 
transgender persons in their identity cards.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Implement a comprehensive strategy to address abuse, torture and extortion 
while in police custody and detention, including: a complaint procedure that 
can be activated any time upon arrest; investigation procedures which meet 
international standards of impartiality, thoroughness and efficiency; and 
training to accompany a zero-tolerance policy.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Support the establishment of legal aid clinics, including in rural areas, which 
provide free legal services for women in need.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.2

</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Allow for a defence based on a prior history of being a victim of domestic 
violence as a mitigating factor in the sentencing of women who have killed their 
partners and/or other family members.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Marriage practices: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Amend legislation to set a uniform minimum legal age for marriage at 18 for 
both women and men, in line with international standards.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Impose as a legal requirement, subject to specific sanctions, that religious 
marriages may only be performed where proof of a civil marriage has been 
made available and promote awareness-raising among religious leaders and 
communities on this issue. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Undertake research on the prevalence of unregistered marriages and its 
consequences for women and children, and consider the adoption of regulations 
to protect their legal and property rights both during the de facto union and 
upon its dissolution.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Raise the penalty for polygamy and cooperate with Kyrgyz migrant-receiving 
countries in taking measures to prevent polygamous marriages across borders. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Increase the criminal penalty for bride abduction and coercion into marriage, 
withdraw the possibility of imposing only a fine and provide stringent penalties 
for conspiracy and aiding and abetting in this crime.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Undertake awareness-raising campaigns, including through the media, on 
forced bride-kidnapping, early marriage, polygamy and unregistered 
marriages.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Statistics and research:

compile statistics on violence against women, including economic and 
occupational indicators, access to public services and reproductive health.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Gather data on the prevalence and types of abuses faced by girls under 18. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Conduct a study on human trafficking patterns and dynamics, both internal 
and abroad, to gather statistics and information on the methods of trafficking 
networks, better monitor the situation of migrant women and identify and

sexual harassment in the workplace, with a view to formulating appropriate 
responses.

<p><b> The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the support provided to date by 
international organizations and donor agencies in the promotion of gender equality
