</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in June 1993 
by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/24), the World Conference 
encouraged the Commission on Human Rights to continue the examination of optional protocols 
to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the 2005 World 
Summit Outcome and General Assembly resolution 60/251 establishing the Human Rights 
Council all affirm that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and 
mutually reinforcing and must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and 
with the same emphasis,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> previous resolutions of the Council and the Commission on Human Rights 
on the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, and in particular Council resolution 1/3 
on the Open-ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the report of the Working Group (A/HRC/8/7) and the decision to transmit the 
draft optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to 
the Council for its consideration,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Adopts</i> the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights annexed to the present resolution;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recommends</i> that the General Assembly, in accordance with paragraph 5 (<i>c</i>) of its 
resolution 60/251, adopt the following draft resolution: 
</p>

</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the adoption by the Human Rights Council, through its resolution ..., of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p> 1<i>. Adopts</i> and opens for signature, ratification and accession the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the text of which is annexed to the present 
</p>
<p>resolution; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recommends</i> that the Optional Protocol be opened for signature at a signing ceremony in 
Geneva in March 2009 and requests the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to provide the necessary assistance.&#8221; </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b>Annex  
</b></p>
<p><b>OPTIONAL PROTOCOL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT  
ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Preamble 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The States Parties to the present Protocol</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, 
recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family 
</p>
<p>is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free 
</p>
<p>and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein, 
</p>
<p>without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
</p>
<p>national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human 
Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be 
achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy civil, cultural, economic, political and social 
rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that each State Party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(hereinafter referred to as the Covenant) undertakes to take steps, individually and through international 
assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, 
</p>
<p>with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by all 
</p>
<p>appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that, in order further to achieve the purposes of the Covenant and the implementation of 
its provisions, it would be appropriate to enable the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</p>
<p>(hereinafter referred to as the Committee) to carry out the functions provided for in the present Protocol, 
</p>
<p> <i>Have agreed</i> as follows: </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b>Article 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>Competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. A State Party to the Covenant that becomes a Party to the present Protocol recognizes the competence 
</p>
<p>of the Committee to receive and consider communications as provided for by the provisions of the present 
Protocol. 
</p>
<p>2. No communication shall be received by the Committee if it concerns a State Party to the Covenant 
</p>
<p>which is not a Party to the present Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 2 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications 
</b></p>
<p> Communications may be submitted by or on behalf of individuals or groups of individuals, under the 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of a State Party, claiming to be victims of a violation of any of the economic, social and cultural 
rights set forth in the Covenant by that State Party. Where a communication is submitted on behalf of 
individuals or groups of individuals, this shall be with their consent unless the author can justify acting on 
their behalf without such consent.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 3 
</b></p>
<p><b>Admissibility 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall not consider a communication unless it has ascertained that all available 
</p>
<p>domestic remedies have been exhausted. This shall not be the rule where the application of such remedies is 
</p>
<p>unreasonably prolonged. 
</p>
<p>2. The Committee shall declare a communication inadmissible when: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) It is not submitted within one year after the exhaustion of domestic remedies, except in cases 
where the author can demonstrate that it had not been possible to submit the communication within that time 
</p>
<p>limit; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The facts that are the subject of the communication occurred prior to the entry into force of the 
present Protocol for the State Party concerned unless those facts continued after that date; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The same matter has already been examined by the Committee or has been or is being 
examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) It is incompatible with the provisions of the Covenant; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) It is manifestly ill-founded, not sufficiently substantiated or exclusively based on reports 
disseminated by mass media; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) It is an abuse of the right to submit a communication; or when 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) It is anonymous or not in writing. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 4 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications not revealing a clear disadvantage 
</b></p>
<p> The Committee may, if necessary, decline to consider a communication where it does not reveal that 
</p>
<p>the author has suffered a clear disadvantage, unless the Committee considers that the communication raises a 
</p>
<p>serious issue of general importance. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 5 
</b></p>
<p><b>Interim measures 
</b></p>
<p>1. At any time after the receipt of a communication and before a determination on the merits has been 
</p>
<p>reached, the Committee may transmit to the State Party concerned for its urgent consideration a request that 
</p>
<p>the State Party take such interim measures as may be necessary in exceptional circumstances to avoid 
possible irreparable damage to the victim or victims of the alleged violations. 
</p>
<p>2. Where the Committee exercises its discretion under paragraph 1 of the present article, this does not 
</p>
<p>imply a determination on admissibility or on the merits of the communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 6 
</b></p>
<p><b>Transmission of the communication 
</b></p>
<p>1. Unless the Committee considers a communication inadmissible without reference to the State Party 
</p>
<p>concerned, the Committee shall bring any communication submitted to it under the present Protocol 
</p>
<p>confidentially to the attention of the State Party concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. Within six months, the receiving State Party shall submit to the Committee written explanations or 
</p>
<p>statements clarifying the matter and the remedy, if any, that may have been provided by that State Party. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 7 
</b></p>
<p><b>Friendly settlement 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall make available its good offices to the parties concerned with a view to reaching 
a friendly settlement of the matter on the basis of the respect for the obligations set forth in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>2. An agreement on a friendly settlement closes consideration of the communication under the present 
</p>
<p>Protocol. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b>Article 8 
</b></p>
<p><b>Examination of communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall examine communications received under article 2 of the present Protocol in the 
</p>
<p>light of all documentation submitted to it, provided that this documentation is transmitted to the parties 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. The Committee shall hold closed meetings when examining communications under the present 
</p>
<p>Protocol. 
</p>
<p>3. When examining a communication under the present Protocol, the Committee may consult, as 
</p>
<p>appropriate, relevant documentation emanating from other United Nations bodies, specialized agencies, 
</p>
<p>funds, programmes and mechanisms, and other international organizations, including from regional human 
</p>
<p>rights systems, and any observations or comments by the State Party concerned. 
</p>
<p>4. When examining communications under the present Protocol, the Committee shall consider the 
</p>
<p>reasonableness of the steps taken by the State Party in accordance with Part II of the Covenant. In doing so, 
</p>
<p>the Committee shall bear in mind that the State Party may adopt a range of possible policy measures for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the rights set forth in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 9 
</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to the views of the Committee 
</b></p>
<p>1. After examining a communication, the Committee shall transmit its views on the communication, 
</p>
<p>together with its recommendations, if any, to the parties concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. The State Party shall give due consideration to the views of the Committee, together with its 
recommendations, if any, and shall submit to the Committee, within six months, a written response, including 
</p>
<p>information on any action taken in the light of the views and recommendations of the Committee. 
</p>
<p>3.  The Committee may invite the State Party to submit further information about any measures the State 
Party has taken in response to its views or recommendations, if any, including as deemed appropriate by the 
</p>
<p>Committee, in the State Party&#8217;s subsequent reports under articles 16 and 17 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 10 
</b></p>
<p><b>Inter-State communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. A State Party to the present Protocol may at any time declare under this article that it recognizes the 
competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications to the effect that a State Party claims 
</p>
<p>that another State Party is not fulfilling its obligations under the Covenant. Communications under this article 
</p>
<p>may be received and considered only if submitted by a State Party that has made a declaration recognizing in </p>

 <p></p>
<p>regard to itself the competence of the Committee. No communication shall be received by the Committee if it 
</p>
<p>concerns a State Party which has not made such a declaration. Communications received under this article 
</p>
<p>shall be dealt with in accordance with the following procedure: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) If a State Party to the present Protocol considers that another State Party is not fulfilling its 
obligations under the Covenant, it may, by written communication, bring the matter to the attention of that 
</p>
<p>State Party. The State Party may also inform the Committee of the matter. Within three months after the 
</p>
<p>receipt of the communication the receiving State shall afford the State that sent the communication an 
explanation, or any other statement in writing clarifying the matter which should include, to the extent 
</p>
<p>possible and pertinent, reference to domestic procedures and remedies taken, pending or available in the 
</p>
<p>matter; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) If the matter is not settled to the satisfaction of both States Parties concerned within six months 
after the receipt by the receiving State of the initial communication, either State shall have the right to refer 
</p>
<p>the matter to the Committee, by notice given to the Committee and to the other State; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The Committee shall deal with a matter referred to it only after it has ascertained that all 
available domestic remedies have been invoked and exhausted in the matter. This shall not be the rule where 
</p>
<p>the application of the remedies is unreasonably prolonged; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (<i>c</i>) of the present paragraph the Committee shall 
make available its good offices to the States Parties concerned with a view to a friendly solution of the matter 
on the basis of the respect for the obligations set forth in the Covenant;  
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The Committee shall hold closed meetings when examining communications under the present 
article;  
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) In any matter referred to it in accordance with subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of the present paragraph, the

information; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) The States Parties concerned, referred to in subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of the present paragraph, shall

<p> (<i>h</i>) The Committee shall, with all due expediency after the date of receipt of notice under 
subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of the present paragraph, submit a report, as follows: 
</p>

reached, the Committee shall confine its report to a brief statement of the facts and of 
</p>
<p>the solution reached; </p>

 <p></p>
<p>(ii) If a solution within the terms of subparagraph (<i>d</i>) is not reached, the Committee shall, in 
its report, set forth the relevant facts concerning the issue between the States Parties 
</p>
<p>concerned. The written submissions and record of the oral submissions made by the 
States Parties concerned shall be attached to the report. The Committee may also 
</p>
<p>communicate only to the States Parties concerned any views that it may consider 
</p>
<p>relevant to the issue between them. 
</p>
<p>In every matter, the report shall be communicated to the States Parties concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. A declaration under paragraph 1 of the present article shall be deposited by the States Parties with the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall transmit copies thereof to the other States Parties. A 
</p>
<p>declaration may be withdrawn at any time by notification to the Secretary-General. Such a withdrawal shall 
</p>
<p>not prejudice the consideration of any matter that is the subject of a communication already transmitted under 
the present article; no further communication by any State Party shall be received under the present article 
</p>
<p>after the notification of withdrawal of the declaration has been received by the Secretary-General, unless the 
</p>
<p>State Party concerned has made a new declaration. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>Inquiry procedure 
</b></p>
<p>1. A State Party to the present Protocol may at any time declare that it recognizes the competence of the 
</p>

Party of the rights set forth in Parts II and III of the Covenant, the Committee shall invite that State Party to 
</p>
<p>cooperate in the examination of the information and to this end to submit observations with regard to the 
</p>
<p>information concerned. 
</p>
<p>3. Taking into account any observations that may have been submitted by the State Party concerned as 
well as any other reliable information available to it, the Committee may designate one or more of its 
</p>
<p>members to conduct an inquiry and to report urgently to the Committee. Where warranted and with the 
</p>
<p>consent of the State Party, the inquiry may include a visit to its territory. 
</p>
<p>4. Such an inquiry shall be conducted confidentially and the cooperation of the State Party shall be 
</p>
<p>sought at all stages of the proceedings.

State Party concerned together with any comments and recommendations.

</p>
<p>summary account of the results of the proceedings in its annual report provided for in article 15.

inquiry. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 13 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protection measures 
</b></p>
<p> A State Party shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that individuals under its jurisdiction are 
not subjected to any form of ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of communicating with the 
Committee pursuant to the present Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 14 
</b></p>
<p><b>International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall transmit, as it may consider appropriate, and with the consent of the State Party 
</p>

</p>
<p>or assistance, along with the State Party&#8217;s observations and suggestions, if any, on these views or 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>2. The Committee may also bring to the attention of such bodies, with the consent of the State Party 
</p>
<p>concerned, any matter arising out of communications considered under the present Protocol which may assist 
</p>
<p>them in deciding, each within its field of competence, on the advisability of international measures likely to 
contribute to assisting States Parties in achieving progress in implementation of the rights recognized in the 
</p>
<p>Covenant. </p>

 <p></p>
<p>3. A trust fund shall be established in accordance with the relevant procedures of the General Assembly, 
</p>
<p>to be administered in accordance with the financial regulations and rules of the United Nations, with a view 
</p>
<p>to providing expert and technical assistance to States Parties, with the consent of the State Party concerned,
