<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression paid an official visit to the Republic of Honduras from 7 to 14 
August 2012. During that visit, he met with government representatives and senior 
officials, representatives of the legislative and judicial branches of government, 
representatives of United Nations agencies and international donors, and a number of 
representatives of civil society and the media, including journalists, social communicators 
and human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p> The purpose of his visit was to observe and investigate how the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression is being exercised in the Republic of Honduras within the context 
of the current human rights situation following the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of June 2009. 
</p>
<p> In this report the Special Rapporteur describes the recent political situation together 
with the legal and institutional frameworks as they relate to freedom of opinion and 
expression. In the following four chapters, he discusses the most important challenges that 
he identified during his mission. He begins by discussing his concerns regarding the 
frequency of violent attacks targeting members of the press and social communicators, and 
he underscores the importance of putting an end to the widespread impunity that prevails in

means that they are accountable to the people. This principle applies not only to the 
material and financial resources of the State, but also to decision-making and policymaking. 
If government officials are under an obligation to work for the common good, then there is 
no reason why information about what they are doing and the decisions that they are taking

information and receive it from any public office or civil servant. </footnote>1 15

<p><b>4</b> GE.13-12539 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of the Republic of Honduras, the Special 
Rapporteur paid an official visit to the country from 7 to 14 August 2012 in follow-up to 
the mission carried out by his predecessor, Mr. Ambeyi Ligabo, in November 2007 (see 
A/HRC/11/4/Add.2). 
2. The purpose of his visit was to observe and investigate how the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression is being exercised in the Republic of Honduras within the context of 
the current human rights situation. The Special Rapporteur defines freedom of expression, 
as set forth in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as the 
right to seek and receive information of all kinds and to impart information, ideas and 
opinions through any medium. This applies to persons involved in the distribution of 
information, such as journalists and social communicators, but it also applies to all persons, 
social groups and peoples of Honduras, who should be able to exercise this right on an 
equal footing and without being subject to any sort of discrimination whatsoever. 
3. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the unsolicited invitation extended by the 
State party and wishes to highlight the cooperation and collaboration that it demonstrated in 
helping to establish all the necessary conditions to enable him to conduct the visit. He 
wishes to thank all the government authorities, representatives of civil society organizations 
and journalists and social communicators with whom he met during this visit. Particular 
mention should be made of the work of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, the 
Office of the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations in Honduras and the Human 
Rights Adviser of the United Nations country team in Honduras. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur travelled to Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. His mission 
included meetings with the President of Honduras, Mr. Porfirio Lobo Sosa, with a number 
of government ministers and senior officials of government agencies and institutions, 
representatives of the legislative and judicial branches of government, the United Nations 
Resident Coordinator and the United Nations country team, and representatives of the 
International Donors Group (G-16). He also met with members of various sectors within 
civil society and the media, including journalists, social communicators and human rights 
defenders. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Recent political and historical context 
</b></p>
<p>5. On 28 June 2009, Honduran military forces apprehended the then President Manuel 
Zelaya and forced him to leave the country, supposedly because he had planned to organize 
a poll on the possibility of holding a referendum on constitutional changes in conjunction 
with the November 2009 elections. On that same day, Congress met in an emergency 
session at which it declared that Zelaya was no longer the president and then swore in the 
Speaker of Congress, Roberto Micheletti, as the new President of Honduras. The 
Organization of American States (OAS), the General Assembly of the United Nations and 
the international community at large condemned these events as a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat. 
</p>
<p>6. The de facto authorities issued a series of decrees in which they declared a state of 
emergency despite the fact that the situation was not serious enough to warrant the 
imposition of emergency measures. In addition, these measures were not in keeping with 
the principle of necessity or the principle of proportionality (see the report of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the violations of human rights in 
Honduras since the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat on 28 June 2009 (A/HRC/13/66), para. 14). Under this state 
of emergency, a number of provisions were put in place that limited fundamental rights </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12539 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>(including curfews, the suppression of demonstrations and the closure of media outlets). 
These measures were applied in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner and were targeted, 
in particular, at members of the anti-coup National Resistance Front. They were used to 
cover up or justify the use of excessive force, illegal and arbitrary arrests, torture, political 
persecution and other human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>7. The emergency measures placed tight restrictions on freedom of expression. The 
media sided with one or the other end of the political spectrum, and reporting was therefore 
biased. Many journalists resorted to self-censorship in order to avoid restrictions or 
sanctions. The premises of several media outlets were occupied by military personnel, and 
broadcasting frequencies were often jammed or interrupted in order to prevent the media 
from reporting on the crisis. Opposition media, such as Radio Globo, TV Channel 36 and 
Radio Progreso, were specifically targeted and their programmes cancelled. 
</p>
<p>8. Some journalists were subjected to ill-treatment or were arbitrarily and illegally 
detained by police officers or members of the armed forces while covering demonstrations. 
Many journalists saw their right to freedom of opinion and expression curtailed and were 
victims of harassment, including harassment by the courts, and intimidation by police 
officers and military personnel. Most of these attacks targeted media that opposed the coup, 
but some media that were considered to be supporters of the de facto Government were also 
victims of unknown assailants. 
</p>
<p>9. The imposition of curfews, use of excessive force and arbitrary detentions also 
undermined the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly. Although some demonstrations 
did turn violent, the great majority of demonstrators were peaceful and unarmed 
(A/HRC/13/66, para. 30), and the use of force by government authorities was therefore 
unjustified in most cases. 
10. Porfirio Lobo was elected President of Honduras on 29 November 2009 and took 
office on 27 January 2010. On 26 January 2010, Congress approved a decree establishing 
an amnesty with regard to the events that occurred between 1 January 2008 and 27 January 
2010. The decree states that the amnesty does not apply to human rights violations, but its 
ambiguous wording has raised concerns in a number of human rights oversight bodies, 
including the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.1 
</p>
<p>11. In sum, the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat gave rise to a series of human rights violations, most of 
which have gone unpunished, in many cases because the institutions that are supposed to 
protect human rights and ensure that the rule of law prevails did not fulfil their mandate on 
an independent basis but instead sided with the de facto Government. As a result, in 
addition to exposing and deepening existing structural problems that have an impact on the 
exercise of human rights, the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat exacerbated what was already a difficult, tense 
political and social situation and heightened the polarization that already existed in most 
State institutions and in Honduran society at large.

</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.13-12539 
</p>
<p><b> III. The legal and institutional framework for freedom of opinion 
and expression 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>12. The right to freedom of opinion and expression is enshrined in article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in other fundamental international human 
rights instruments to which Honduras is party, such as the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (art. 19) and the American Convention on Human Rights (arts. 13 and 
14). 
13. In its general comment No. 34 on article 19 of the Covenant, the Human Rights 
Committee states that restrictions on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression 
&#8220;must be &#8216;provided by law&#8217;; they may only be imposed for one of the grounds set out in 
subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 3; and they must conform to the strict tests of 
necessity and proportionality&#8221; (CCPR/C/GC/34, para. 22). 
14. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has said that the right to freedom of 
expression is not an absolute right and that it can therefore be subject to restrictions that are 
in proportion to the reason for their imposition and are closely aligned with that objective. 
The Court has also said that the right to freedom of expression has two dimensions: an 
individual dimension (the right to express one&#8217;s opinion and receive information) and a 
social dimension (the collective right to receive and seek information). The exercise of 
freedom of expression may also be a means of securing the enforcement of other rights 
(A/HRC/17/27/Add.<footnote name="3">4. Violence directed at the press constitutes a limitation on freedom of expression and, 
hence, a limitation on public participation and an assault on democracy. This is why the 
Special Rapporteur feels that, rather than being seen as an attack on the rights of an 
individual, violence against journalists should be seen as an attack against one of the rights 
of society as a whole, i.e., the right to be informed and to seek information. He therefore 
wishes to emphasize that the State is under an obligation to provide special protection to 
those who work to defend and promote the rights of others, such as human rights defenders 
and journalists. Persons who work to protect the human rights of others deserve special 
protection from the State. 
</footnote>, para. 6). 
</p>
<p><b> B. National legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>15. At the national level, the right to freedom of expression is set forth in article 72 of 
the Constitution of Honduras. Article 73 of the Constitution stipulates that the media used 
for the expression and dissemination of thoughts may not be seized or confiscated, nor may 
they be closed down or have their work interrupted on the grounds that a major or minor 
offence has been committed in the course of the expression of thoughts or ideas. 
</p>
<p>16. The fact that freedom of expression is protected by the Constitution is of vital 
importance in protecting the exercise of this right. However, the Special Rapporteur feels 
obliged to reiterate the concern expressed by his predecessor as to the fact that, in 
accordance with article 75 of the Constitution, the law governing the expression of thought 
may provide for prior censorship; this is in direct contradiction to article 13, paragraph 2, of 
the American Convention on Human Rights, which states that the exercise of the right to 
freedom of thought and expression &#8220;shall not be subject to prior censorship but shall be 
subject to subsequent imposition of liability&#8221;. 
17. The right to freedom of association and assembly is set forth in article 78 of the 
Constitution, which states that these freedoms are guaranteed so long as they do not disturb 
the public order and do not run counter to public decency. 
</p>
<p>18. The Expression of Thought Act contains more specific provisions on freedom of 
opinion and expression in Honduras. Article 2 of this law establishes the inviolability of the  </p>
<p>freedoms of expression of thought and information. Article 5 states that all inhabitants of  </p>
<p>Honduras may freely express their thoughts, give and receive information and discuss their 
or other persons&#8217; opinions in writing or orally or by any other graphic, oral or visual means 
without prior censorship. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12539 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Telecommunications Framework Act, along with the amendments that have 
been introduced to update that law, govern the telecommunications sector in Honduras and 
establish the requirements for obtaining a broadcasting licence and permission to use a 
given radio frequency. The law authorizes the Government to revoke or cancel such 
licences for reasons of national security. As also noted in the report on the mission to 
Honduras conducted in 2007, the Special Rapporteur is concerned by the fact that this law 
and its accompanying regulations have limited the development of alternative media, 
including, in particular, the country&#8217;s many community radio stations (see 
A/HRC/11/4/Add.2, para. 22). In the previous mission report, the Special Rapporteur went 
on to recommend that the legislation on telecommunications be amended in order to bring it 
into line with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>20. The Press Association Act governs the registration and work of journalists. The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned by the fact that, under this law, a person must become a 
member of the Press Association before he or she can work as a journalist. This 
requirement is at variance with the free exercise of the right to freedom of expression. This 
law&#8217;s incompatibility with the international obligations of the State of Honduras was also 
pointed out by the preceding Special Rapporteur in his report on his 2007 mission to 
Honduras (ibid., para. 28). 
21. Civil society played an important role in winning passage of the Transparency and 
Access to Public Information Act, which embodies international standards regarding the 
right to have access to public information. According to the preceding Special Rapporteur, 
the passage of that law was one of the most significant social and political events of 2006 
and represented a major stride forward in enabling citizens to find out what goes on inside 
public institutions (ibid., para. 30). As will be noted later on in this report, however, the 
Special Rapporteur is very concerned by reports that point to a lack of impartiality and 
independence on the part of the Public Information Institute (IAIP) and its commissioners 
and to a failure to apply the Public Information Act systematically. 
</p>
<p>22. Certain provisions in the Criminal Code of Honduras (arts. 155, 157, 160 and 345) 
also restrict freedom of expression inasmuch as they establish slander, libel and defamation, 
including even the disparagement of a public authority, as criminal offences. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about the fact that, in contradiction to 
the Constitution and international human rights standards, slander, libel and defamation are 
criminal offences which could be used to muzzle the press and place excessive restrictions 
on the right to freedom of expression. Under these circumstances, criminal proceedings 
could be brought against anyone who voices an opinion that may be considered to 
disparage a public authority, which would undermine the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression. 
</p>
<p>24. Legal measures dealing with freedom of opinion and expression should be in place 
that will do away with legal obstacles to the free exercise of this fundamental right and 
provide for the punishment of persons who violate that right. Legal measures should not 
unduly restrict the exercise of the right to freedom of expression, nor should they be used to 
censor or punish persons who avail themselves of their right to freedom of expression. The 
State of Honduras is also under an obligation to take steps to prevent crimes against 
freedom of expression from taking place.2 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.13-12539 
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur wishes to commend the President and the State of Honduras 
on the creation of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, an important institution that is 
needed in this time of crisis in Honduran society that has followed in the wake of the 2009 
coup d&#8217;&#233;tat. It stands as a sign of the mature stage reached by the country in its political 
development, inasmuch as the stature of all democracies is measured by the extent of their 
respect for human rights. The Special Rapporteur has also witnessed with satisfaction how 
ably and keenly the Ministry is going about its work. 
</p>
<p>26. This initiative will only be successful if the work and the policies of the Ministry are 
based on a broad consensus and enjoy the full support of the President of Honduras and his 
entire cabinet, including the heads of the Ministry of Security and other State agencies. It is 
important for this Ministry to take on the task of coordinating human rights policies, 
together with the programme for the protection of human rights defenders, journalists and 
other vulnerable groups that is now being developed. This means that the Ministry will 
need to coordinate with the national police force, promote human rights training for its 
members and promote the creation of a specialized in-house protection unit. 
</p>
<p>27. There must be an independent State agency charged with receiving complaints from 
members of the public concerning human rights violations. This task cannot be assumed by 
a government ministry, since, given the very nature of these institutions, they cannot be 
assured of having the necessary independence to register and properly investigate human 
rights violations, especially in cases where such violations have allegedly been committed 
by government authorities. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur finds it regrettable that the National Commissioner for 
Human Rights has lost his credibility as a result of its actions during the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat. In 
light of that situation, the Special Rapporteur proposes that, in order to restore the 
institution&#8217;s authority, credibility and independence, the State of Honduras convert the 
Office of the National Commissioner into a national human rights commission in line with 
the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights (the Paris Principles).  
29. The Special Rapporteur understands that, because of the public&#8217;s distrust of the 
national police force, the Office of the Attorney General and the National Commissioner 
for Human Rights, individual cases regarding violations have been taken up by the Ministry 
of Justice and Human Rights as a means of filling the institutional vacuum that has taken 
shape. However, the Special Rapporteur recommends that, rather than asking the Ministry 
to shoulder responsibilities that fall outside its purview, institution-building measures be 
adopted in order to strengthen the national police force, the Office of the Attorney General 
and a national human rights commission and that steps be taken to promote and reinforce 
inter-agency coordination under the supervision of the Ministry. The role of each of these 
institutions should be clearly defined in order to avert any duplication of effort and any 
avoidable overlapping allocations of human and/or financial resources. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violence and impunity  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violence directed at members of the press 
</b></p>
<p>30. Violence directed at journalists and social communicators was one of the first 
problems that the Special Rapporteur looked into during his visit, given the fact that 
Honduras is the country with the highest index of murders of journalists (measured as a 
percentage of the country&#8217;s population) in the region.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12539 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>31. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur wishes to underscore the fact that the 
profession of journalism is defined as the function of informing society, and this activity 
must not be limited by the establishment of requirements with respect to certification, 
mandatory membership in an association or government registration. The Special 
Rapporteur considers academic studies and the professionalization of journalism as positive 
developments and believes that it is important to set up professional associations that can 
maintain high standards and establish voluntary codes of ethics, as well as to provide the 
opportunity for journalists to register with government authorities and obtain accreditation 
to cover official events. None of these things should be established as a condition for 
practising the profession of journalism, however. 
32. The Special Rapporteur was informed at the time of writing that seven killings 
connected with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression had already been 
committed in 2012. According to information provided to the Special Rapporteur by 
official and unofficial sources, between 2003 and the time of writing, at least 32 journalists 
and social communicators had been murdered. The Special Rapporteur would like to pay 
homage to those journalists and social communicators by naming them here: Germ&#225;n

33. According to the Human Rights Unit of the Ministry of Security, at the time of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, 61 journalists and/or social communicators were benefiting from 
protective measures. Many more journalists and social communicators were being 
threatened and/or attacked or being subjected to other human rights violations every day, 
but not all of them reported these acts either because they were afraid of the police or 
because they assumed that these incidents would not be investigated. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.13-12539 
</p>
<p>administration of justice. It is imperative that such a mechanism be institutionalized. The 
Special Rapporteur would sound a note of caution, however, regarding the drawbacks of 
hastening the passage of a text in whose development representatives of civil society, 
including journalists and social communicators, have not played a significant and informed 
role.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur recommends, in particular, that this mechanism take the 
form of a high-level commission made up of representatives of the State (including the 
Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence), the different sectors of the press and 
civil society organizations working in the areas of human rights or freedom of expression. 
This commission should have direct access to the highest government authorities, including 
the President, and to law enforcement agencies and should have a budget of its own for the 
funding of effective protection measures. 
</p>
<p>37. This mechanism must be able to provide a range of practical protective measures, 
including peripheral protection, versatile communications devices such as radios or mobile 
phones, the installation of video cameras, the use of armoured vehicles to evacuate people 
and the capability to move persons under threat and their families to another region in the 
country or to another country. If this protection mechanism is to work properly, it is of 
paramount importance for it to have strong political support from all government ministries, 
the President and all the political parties of Honduras. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>38. In cases in which the State does not succeed in preventing acts of violence against 
journalists, whether in the form of threats, harassment, attacks and/or murders, the most 
important factor is for it to at least investigate the incident and to arrest and punish the 
persons who actually committed the acts in question and those who instigated or planned 
them. A failure to bring such people to justice gives rise to an atmosphere of impunity, 
which is one of the main factors that breeds continued violence. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his concern about the fact that, during 
his visit, some of the authorities with whom he met and a number of journalists speculated 
as to the reasons why certain acts of violence were committed against members of the press 
in individual cases. This would appear to be a dangerous practice; what is important is to 
place emphasis on the obligation to investigate and prosecute, while refraining from prior 
speculation that could undermine the objectivity and effectiveness of the investigation. 
Government authorities should not prejudge what causal factors were involved. 
40. In all cases of violence directed at journalists or human rights defenders, the initial 
presumption &#8212; until proven otherwise &#8212; should be that the incident occurred as a result of 
the person&#8217;s profession or activities. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
all cases involving violence against journalists, social communicators or human rights 
defenders should be immediately referred to the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Human 
Rights for investigation and the prompt initiation of proceedings. 
</p>
<p>41. To put an end to impunity in this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
the staff and budget of the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights be increased 
substantially and that an effort be made to provide the staff with technical training in 
efficient methods for investigating these types of grave human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12539 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>put a halt to impunity. One of the problems is that the Public Prosecution Service does not 
have detectives of its own but must instead rely on the national police force to carry out 
investigations. 
</p>
<p>43. Another problem is that the Office of the Prosecutor does not have an effective or 
appropriate witness protection system. The Special Rapporteur was told that, in most cases, 
all it can do is provide some measure of protection while a trial is going on, but it has 
neither the resources nor the means of providing witnesses with protection after the trial, if 
indeed there is one. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur also received reports about a lack of impartiality on the part 
of officials responsible for the administration of justice. According to these reports, murder 
cases are only seriously investigated and brought to trial if the victim had ties to persons in 
positions of power. 
</p>
<p>45. Mention was made on a number of occasions of the difference in the way the cases 
of Alfredo Villatoro and Nah&#250;m Palacios were handled. Mr. Villatoro was working for 
HRN radio in Tegucigalpa when, on 15 May 2012, he was killed despite the fact that he had 
a police escort. Mr. Villatoro&#8217;s death is one of the rare cases in which the police force was 
mobilized on a large scale, and some 10 persons were arrested. Nah&#250;m Palacios was 
working for Channel 5 in Agu&#225;n when he was killed in Tocoa on 14 March 2010, even 
though the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had requested that precautionary 
measures be taken on his behalf. The investigation has made no progress to date. All 
killings of journalists and social communicators should be investigated and prosecuted with 
the same diligence and appropriate resources as appear to have been employed in the case 
of the murder of Mr. Villatoro. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned by the fact that the general public and, 
in particular, human rights defenders say that they do not trust the national police. This is a 
serious problem, since the police are responsible for carrying out investigations. Unless 
murders, other acts of violence and threats are properly investigated, prosecutors have no 
solid information that would serve as a basis for filing charges or bringing cases to trial, 
much less winning them. 
</p>
<p>47. Law enforcement officials with whom the Special Rapporteur met indicated that the 
factor that places the greatest constraint on the work of the national police force is its 
budget. In addition, because there is a lack of trust, many human rights defenders reject the 
courses of action proposed to them by the police. 
</p>
<p>48. The Minister of Security is in charge of providing protection to 388 persons for 
whom the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has requested precautionary 
measures and over 180 persons who are entitled to national protection measures. This is a 
large workload to coordinate, and there is no risk assessment mechanism in place. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends that an inter-agency protocol based on clear, transparent 
rules be developed for the implementation of precautionary and protective measures. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur received information from a variety of sources concerning 
widespread corruption in State institutions in Honduras, particularly the police force. The 
security commission which the President created to clean up the police force on 1 June 
2012, following the passage of the relevant law by Congress in January 2012, represents a 
step forward. However, this initiative should figure as one element in an integrated policy 
package focusing on combating corruption and impunity in all sectors of the State, 
including the highest levels of the Government. There are as yet no results to be evaluated. 
</p>
<p>50. The training customarily given to police officers does not prepare them to provide 
suitable protection and should therefore be supplemented with specialized training in 
human rights and personal protection methods. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.13-12539 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur would strongly discourage the State party from choosing the 
option, which has recently been under discussion, of creating a paramilitary police force, 
since such a step would not lead to the creation of a separate, specialized police force but 
rather to the militarization of police functions. If the penetration of existing law 
enforcement agencies by illegal and corrupt elements is not stopped, then any new forces 
that might be created would be subject to the same sort of infiltration. 
52. The Special Rapporteur regards the establishment of supposed &#8220;development&#8221; 
programmes that are not part of the country&#8217;s territorial system or under the jurisdiction of 
the courts (such as &#8220;charter cities&#8221;, which also displace population groups and are governed 
by a distinct institutional and legal regime that is autonomous from the State) to be in 
violation of national sovereignty and the right to access to justice and in breach of the 
State&#8217;s guarantees that, within its territory, its population&#8217;s human rights will be respected, 
promoted and protected. The Special Rapporteur takes note with satisfaction that on 18 
October 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that Legislative Decree No. 283-2010, under which 
the charter cities were created, is unconstitutional and that it is in violation of the country&#8217;s 
sovereignty, territory and form of government. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Honduras to strengthen its existing 
institutions, furnish them with appropriate budgets, provide human rights training and 
combat rampant corruption. This should be accomplished by means of coordinated 
measures and policies, rather than by simply renouncing its sovereignty and thereby failing 
to fulfil its obligations to the people living in these territories. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Freedom, pluralism and diversity in the democratic debate 
</b></p>
<p>54. A truly democratic, pluralistic society must have freedom of the press so that 
journalists will be free to keep the public informed while upholding the fundamental 
principle of diversity and pluralism, which calls for the presence of a range of different 
media and different perspectives and ways of thought. This gives the members of the 
different sectors of society and of society as a whole the information that they need to form 
their own opinions and to play an active role at all levels, thereby strengthening the 
democracy. 
</p>
<p>55. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, he heard the press being severely criticized 
not only by public officials but also by journalists and press associations. In that regard, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to make it clear that protecting freedom of the press and 
expression does not imply being in agreement with the content of a message; what is 
involved is simply the ability to practise the profession freely. It is also important to 
emphasize that under no circumstances should any State authority be the one to define the 
professional quality or objectivity of journalists&#8217; work or to restrict the exercise of the 
profession in any way other than as provided for by law. It is the prerogative of the public 
at large to analyse the professionalism and ethical conduct of the press and social media and 
to make them aware of its views. In addition, each medium or association of journalists, as 
well as each individual journalist, should voluntarily and actively use a code of professional 
ethics as a frame of reference for self-assessment. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12539 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur also observed that much of the media is concentrated in the 
hands of economic interests. The corporate press is owned by powerful economic groups 
and, as a result, the journalists in this sector of the press can be &#8220;modulated&#8221; by the media 
owners who employ them. This situation can undermine freedom of expression, since the 
economic power wielded by media owners can easily be used to convince journalists to 
practise self-censorship, to corrupt them or to punish those who do not follow the editorial 
line laid down by their employers. These economic interests have also penetrated political 
circles, where they have given rise to even more corruption and used their economic power 
to co-opt political interests. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur was also told that government procurement of advertising 
services is not conducted on a transparent or equitable basis, with the result being that 
government money is concentrated in just a few media channels which, because it is in their 
economic interests, never criticize the Government&#8217;s actions for fear of losing revenue. As 
a result, government advertising has become a readily available means of censorship. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends that regulations be developed that will help to ensure that 
government spending on advertising is allocated in a transparent, equitable manner so that 
it cannot be used by any given department or official to favour like-minded journalists or to 
punish those who are critical of the Government. These regulations should be such as to 
prevent government advertising from leading to self-censorship and from being used to 
corrupt officials and media employees.  
</p>
<p>60. It is also important to exercise caution and good judgement when making use of 
nationwide simultaneous (or &#8220;chain&#8221;) broadcasts, which should be reserved for national 
emergencies or events of crucial importance for the country or a region within it. They 
should not be systematically misused as a form of government control or be abused by any 
government official to boost his or her image or political campaign. These simultaneous 
broadcasts have been misused as a form of government control in violation of the articles of 
the Constitution concerning freedom of expression. The new regulations on such broadcasts 
are apparently designed with the sole aim of defining offences that would carry such heavy 
fines that independent media, which do not have the same economic backing as major 
broadcasters do, would be forced to close down. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Peoples, ethnic groups and freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>61. Freedom of expression can be exercised by individuals, groups or peoples, since 
distinct peoples have the right to possess and to publicly express their own culture, 
language, history, traditions and values and to reproduce them for coming generations. The 
State must defend the right of the Afro-Honduran people, the Mayan-Honduran people, the 
Miskito people and any other ethnic group to publicly express their culture and values 
freely and, in particular, without being subject to discrimination of any sort. 
62. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that 
indigenous peoples have the right to establish their own media. The Special Rapporteur 
therefore recommends that the State guarantee freedom of expression, promote bilingual 
education in each of these areas and grant licences for the use of radio frequency bands to 
organizations and communities in these regions. In order for this to be done, as noted later 
on in this report, the Telecommunications Act will have to be amended. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.13-12539 
</p>
<p><b> B. Telecommunications 
</b></p>
<p>64. Since the frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum that are used for 
telecommunications are the property of the State, and it is the duty of the State to seek the 
common good for all, the Special Rapporteur recommends that regulations be developed to 
ensure that the use of these frequencies is distributed equitably. These regulations should be 
designed to ensure that all sectors of the population have access to transmission 
bandwidths, rather than having them concentrated in the hands of a few or monopolized, in 
violation of the principle of diversity and plurality that should underpin freedom of 
expression and the media. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Government of Honduras urge 
Congress to amend the Telecommunications Framework Act with a view to redefining 
society&#8217;s use of bandwidths and the way in which they are distributed and affording 
recognition to community telecommunications networks. The practice of auctioning off 
bandwidths is an essentially discriminatory procedure that favours sectors that wield 
economic power; therefore, auctions should be used only for the allocation of commercial 
frequencies, not for the bandwidths used for community or public non-profit purposes, 
including those used by different peoples and ethnic groups in the country. Commercial 
uses should not prevail over public service applications. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur proposes that the Government of Honduras look at the 
model laws recently passed in Argentina and Uruguay that divide up the spectrum into 
commercial, community and public basic-service frequencies. It is important to give 
recognition to the category of community media and to grant bandwidth permits using non-
economic criteria. Community or public frequency permits should confer the same rights 
and obligations as commercial permits do, and it should therefore not be presumed that the 
frequencies assigned for these purposes should necessarily be weaker or have a shorter 
range. 
</p>
<p>67. According to statements made by a number of sources, many of the bandwidths that 
have been allocated are going unused and the persons who have the permits for those 
bandwidths are holding them in reserve. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government of Honduras make the issuance of a permit conditional upon the immediate 
and ongoing use of the bandwidth in question. In addition, it would be useful for the 
National Telecommunications Commission (CONATEL), which is authorized by law to 
coordinate and implement telecommunications policies, to draw up an inventory and map 
of bandwidths throughout the country so that those that are not in use can be identified and 
the corresponding permits can be withdrawn. 
</p>
<p>68. The digitization of analogue communications services would increase the number of 
usable frequencies in each band. This would provide the State with an opportunity to create 
a strategic reserve of radio frequencies. 
</p>
<p>69. The Internet has become the most user-friendly medium for seeking and receiving 
information and for imparting information and ideas. The Internet is a technology that plays 
a vital role not only in connection with freedom of expression (including access to 
information, especially public information) but also in the exercise of the right to education, 
the right to freedom of association and assembly, the right to cultural diversity and the right 
to development. This is why the proposal is made in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2011 report 
to the General Assembly (A/66/290) that all States should undertake to guarantee access to 
the Internet for all sectors of the population, particularly the poorest of its members and 
those living in rural and/or remote locations. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12539 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>world. The Government of Honduras should guarantee two-fold access to the Internet: 
access to pluralistic, diverse, uncensored content; and access to connections and 
infrastructure, including the appropriate hardware. This can be accomplished by setting up 
community centres that are equipped with Internet connections and computers and by 
providing wifi in public areas. This also means that the State should guarantee access to 
quality equipment at a reasonable price, even if it has to subsidize some services or 
equipment in order to do so. The One Laptop Per Child project, which is backed by the 
United Nations Development Programme, is one example of this type of initiative. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Peaceful protests 
</b></p>
<p>71. Freedom of expression can be exercised through any sort of medium. This includes 
the right to participate in demonstrations and peaceful protests staged by social sectors or 
organizations that wish to show their discontent with public policies, natural resource 
development contracts, the attitudes adopted by civil servants or some other situation. 
</p>
<p>72. The right to engage in peaceful protests is guaranteed by the Constitution. It is not 
necessary to obtain a permit or prior authorization to exercise this right; the only 
requirements are that the protest must be peaceful and that the rights of others must be 
protected. Article 78 of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of association and 
assembly, is unclearly worded and could be used to place arbitrary restrictions on the right 
to assemble and protest, depending on how the authorities interpret the words &#8220;public 
order&#8221; and &#8220;public decency&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>73. In times of crisis, State authorities should first make every effort to engage in 
dialogue and should resort to force &#8212; while observing the principle of proportionality &#8212; 
only if the situation turns violent. According to this principle, the minimum level of force 
required to re-establish order is to be used and no one is to be detained arbitrarily simply 
because he or she is a protester.  Nor is it acceptable for government agents to confiscate, 
damage or destroy photographic or audiovisual equipment being used by the press or 
members of civil society organizations or to confiscate their contents, as this material is 
also protected under the right to freedom of expression as historical, documentary or press 
material; it may also be useful in any criminal investigations that may be undertaken. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur was told about a number of instances in which, although a 
person&#8217;s right to engage in peaceful protests had been violated, no investigation was 
undertaken and the perpetrators of those violations, whose identities were known, were not 
punished.  
</p>
<p>75. Police officers or members of the armed forces performing police work who use 
excessive force should be punished. Members of security forces should also be trained to 
take appropriate action in crisis situations rather than resorting to a disproportionate use of 
force. 
</p>
<p>76. The use of private security agents in demonstrations and legal evictions in which the 
police are called upon to play a part is unacceptable, since this would shift the State&#8217;s 
responsibilities on to third parties and put the State in a position where it could not protect 
people&#8217;s human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Legal actions relating to the exercise of the right to freedom 
of expression 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.13-12539 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights. Such restrictions should be established by law prior to their 
introduction, should have as their purpose the protection of the human rights of others and 
should be both necessary and proportional to the protection to be afforded to those rights. 
</p>
<p>78. Some restrictions are also set forth in international human rights instruments. For 
example, article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination prohibits the use of language which propounds the superiority of one 
race or ethnic group over others; the Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the 
Crime of Genocide prohibits incitement to hate and incitement to commit genocide for 
reasons of race, nationality or religion; the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
explicitly provides that States parties must prohibit the production, distribution, 
dissemination and marketing of child pornography and punish those responsible for such 
acts; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
includes a series of recommendations concerning the elimination of language that could 
lead to gender discrimination or violence against women. 
</p>
<p>79. There are also provisions that prohibit the use of language to promote organized 
crime or to instigate violence or terrorism. All hate speech that incites or justifies violence 
against given sectors of the population, including the LGBT population, should be 
eradicated. The State should not, however, place restrictions on freedom of expression that 
are not based on human rights standards or principles, since such restrictions will inevitably 
become tools of political censorship. 
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur wishes to underscore the need to decriminalize defamation, 
slander and libel and to convert them into matters regulated by civil law. This would be a 
more effective way to protect people&#8217;s honour and reputations without resorting to 
intimidation through the use of force or imprisonment, which could undermine freedom of 
expression, especially when used by public officials to muzzle criticism. The Special 
Rapporteur regards the statements on this subject made by President Porfirio Lobo Sosa to 
be signs of progress in this respect. 
</p>
<p>81. Nor is it acceptable to intimidate members of the press by inundating them with 
unfounded suits that are tantamount to judicial harassment. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Access to public information and transparency 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-12539 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>84. The passage of the Transparency and Access to Public Information Act and the 
establishment of the Public Information Institute (IAIP) are steps forward. The Special 
Rapporteur has received numerous complaints from members of civil society, however, 
who assert that the three IAIP commissioners were simply designated, rather than being 
selected in an open, transparent manner in consultation with the various sectors of civil 
society; this works to the detriment of that institution&#8217;s independence and credibility. 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Honduras set up a 
transparent procedure for the selection of the three IAIP commissioners that will allow the 
populace to have confidence in their independence and professionalism. In addition, having 
10 years of experience in the civil service should not be one of the eligibility requirements 
for these posts. That requirement is not relevant to this kind of position and would appear to 
lend itself to conflicts of interest and vision. 
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur also received reports concerning discrimination and a failure 
to enforce the Transparency and Access to Public Information Act, especially in rural areas. 
He has therefore expressed a desire to return to the country in order to learn more about the 
practices of the Public Information Institute and its new commissioners. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions 
</b>87. <b>The 2009 coup d&#8217;&#233;tat seriously exacerbated the polarization of Honduran 
society and its political parties. The institutional shortcomings that were already in 
evidence grew worse as well. This led the people of Honduras to lose much of their 
trust in the State and its representatives, including the institutions responsible for 
upholding human rights, such as the national police force, the Office of the Attorney 
General and the National Commissioner for Human Rights.</b>  
</p>
<p>88. <b>The Government of Honduras has taken the initiative in promoting and 
protecting human rights by, for example, establishing the Ministry of Justice and 
Human Rights. These kinds of initiatives have thus far not received the full support of 
the Government and institutions of Honduras, however, and the country therefore 
continues to suffer from an unpardonable degree of impunity.</b> 
</p>
<p>89. <b>Widespread impunity and a failure to investigate human rights violations 
effectively continue to stymie any initiative undertaken or any effort made to protect 
human rights, uphold the rule of law, establish the truth or provide redress.</b> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur observed with great concern that the exercise of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression continues to be misinterpreted by certain 
State institutions and authorities. The Special Rapporteur was informed of daily 
violations of the right to freedom of expression in different regions of the country. 
These violations include, but are not limited to, attacks on journalists and/or the 
media, the excessive use of force against peaceful protestors, judicial harassment, and 
the prosecution of people on charges of libel, slander or defamation. The Special 
Rapporteur is deeply concerned about the fact that, in most cases in which violence is 
committed, the perpetrators go unpunished owing to a lack of political will, human 
and financial resources, and training for the persons responsible for investigating such 
incidents and prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators.</b> 
</p>
<p>91. <b>Finally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to underscore the need to give serious 
consideration to the recommendations presented in the report of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission and to put them into actual practice, with the 
recommendations concerning human rights violations and impunity in such cases 
being given first priority.</b> </p>

<p><b>18</b> GE.13-12539 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur has drawn up the following recommendations based on 
the above conclusions and the recommendations put forward in his predecessor&#8217;s 
report on the visit paid to Honduras in 2007. He would like to remind the State party 
that he stands ready to provide any assistance it may need in order to put these 
recommendations into practice.</b>

<p><b> A. Violence and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends the following: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The importance of journalists&#8217; work should be recognized and attacks on 
journalists and social communicators should be condemned by senior government 
authorities, including the Ministry of Defence and the officials who direct the security 
forces; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) A mechanism should be created for the protection of journalists, social 
communicators, human rights defenders and people responsible for the 
administration of justice. The Special Rapporteur recommends, in particular, that 
this mechanism should take the form of a high-level committee composed of 
representatives of the State &#8212; including representatives of the Ministry of the Interior 
and the Ministry of Defence &#8212; and representatives of the various sectors of the press 
and civil society organizations working in the areas of human rights or freedom of 
expression. This committee should have direct access to the most senior government 
authorities, including the Office of the President and the agencies responsible for the 
country&#8217;s security forces, and should have a budget of its own for the implementation 
of protective measures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) This protection mechanism should have two subcommittees: one to 
assess risks and the other to determine what protective measures should be taken; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The range of protective measures should include peripheral protection, 
versatile communications devices such as radios or mobile phones, the installation of 
video cameras, the use of armoured vehicles to evacuate people and the capability to 
move persons under threat and their families to another region in the country or to 
another country; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) This mechanism should be sited in the coordinating office of the Ministry 
of Justice and Human Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) A personal protection bureau should be established within the national 
police force and staffed with police officers who have been especially trained for the 
job; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) All cases involving violence directed at journalists, social communicators 
or human rights defenders should immediately be referred to the Office of the Special 
Prosecutor for Human Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) The staffing table and budget of the Office of the Special Prosecutor for 
Human Rights should be increased substantially, and the staff members responsible 
for conducting investigations and court proceedings should be provided with 
appropriate technical training; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) The penalties for people who commit crimes against members of the 
press and freedom of expression should be increased, especially in cases in which the 
offenders are agents of the State. </b></p>

<p><b> B. Freedom, pluralism and diversity in democratic debate 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends the following:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Each organ of the media and association of journalists should actively 
embrace a professional code of ethics that can provide a frame of reference for self-
assessments; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Regulations should be developed that will help to ensure that 
government spending on advertising is allocated in a transparent, equitable manner so 
that it cannot be used by any given department or official to favour like-minded 
journalists or to punish those who are critical of the Government; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Nationwide simultaneous (&#8220;chain&#8221;) broadcasts should not be 
systematically misused as a form of government control or be abused by any 
government official to boost his or her image or political campaign; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The Government should amend the Telecommunications Framework 
Act, in line with international human rights standards, to ensure that permits for the 
use of telecommunications frequencies are awarded on an equitable basis to 
organizations and communities of indigenous peoples, persons of African descent and 
others; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) A national institute should be established for the furtherance of the 
languages of the different ethnic groups and peoples in Honduras; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Legal and political recognition should be given to community-based 
media and to the principle that users of community frequencies should have the same 
rights and obligations as users of commercial frequencies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) An inventory and a map of bandwidths throughout the country should 
be drawn up so that those that are not in use can be identified and the corresponding 
permits can be withdrawn; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Analogue communications services in the country should be digitized so 
that the State can create a strategic reserve of radio frequencies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) The State should guarantee access to the Internet for all sectors of the 
population, particularly the poorest of its members and those living in rural and/or 
remote locations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Human rights training should be provided to all national police forces, 
together with training in the use of proportionate levels of force during peaceful 
demonstrations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Members of the Armed Forces should be educated about the role played 
by journalists and human rights defenders in monitoring the situation during 
demonstrations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Units of the Armed Forces (Navy, Air Force or Army) should not be used 
to provide protection services or to perform police functions, especially the policing of 
public demonstrations or evictions. All police functions should be performed by 
civilian forces only.</b> </p>

into matters regulated by civil law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Journalists and social communicators should be protected from frivolous 
litigation.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> D. Access to public information and transparency 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends the following:</b> 
</p>

applied on a non-discriminatory basis by all State institutions without exception, 
including the department responsible for investigations and police oversight; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) An independent assessment should be made of the work of the Public 
Information Institute (IAIP) and its application of the Transparency and Access to

three IAIP commissioners which will ensure their independence and professionalism;

contribute to the effort to put an end to impunity and to strengthen the justice system; 
</b></p>

provide financial and especially technical support for initiatives to reinforce freedom 
of opinion and expression and for the establishment of a mechanism for providing 
protection for journalists, social communicators, human rights defenders and persons 
responsible for the administration of justice; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Consideration should be given to the possibility of signing an agreement 
with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for the 
establishment of a country office that could provide assistance in bringing about legal 
and public policy changes relating to human rights.</b>
