</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq 
and the Levant 
</b></p>
<p>10. In recent years, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has emerged as a key 
</p>
<p>actor in the Middle East and, reportedly, beyond. One of many radical groups that found 
</p>
<p>fertile ground in the violent environments created by decades of instability in Iraq and the </p>


<p>more recent conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, it has in the past two years become a 
</p>
<p>well-organized, dominant armed force controlling large swathes of populated areas in both 
</p>
<p>Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic.1 A self-proclaimed caliphate, it attracts a significant 
</p>
<p>number of individuals from around the world to join its ranks. Deeply rooted in sectarian 
</p>
<p>distrust and an absence of inclusive, participatory processes,2 ISIL has become a symbol of 
</p>
<p>brutality, extreme violence, cruelty and terror, all of which it has imposed on those living 
</p>
<p>under its rule.  
</p>
<p>11. There is evidence that ISIL has committed serious violations of international law, 
</p>
<p>including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and serious violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights law. The Security Council has determined that ISIL represents a threat to 
</p>
<p>international peace and security, has unequivocally condemned the gross and systematic 
</p>
<p>abuses of human rights by ISIL and has stressed the need to bring perpetrators, including 
</p>
<p>foreign terrorist fighters, to justice, but has failed to take more decisive action or to refer the 
</p>
<p>situation to the International Criminal Court.  
</p>
<p>12. The United Nations human rights bodies, including the Human Rights Council, the 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies, as well as special procedures mandate holders, have addressed various 
</p>
<p>aspects of the situation in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, including ISIL. The present 
</p>
<p>report aims to contribute to this work by addressing the human rights issues linked to the 
</p>
<p>actions carried out by ISIL, the adequacy of the response of the Security Council and the 
</p>
<p>civilian impact of the military action taken by States engaged in combating ISIL.3 
</p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>13. The origins of ISIL can be traced back to the immediate aftermath of the conflict in 
</p>
<p>Iraq in 2004, when Al-Qaida in Iraq was established by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Sectarian, 
</p>
<p>ethnic and religious discrimination had been rife in Iraq. However, the new Government 
</p>
<p>and the &#8220;de-Baathification&#8221; of public service were clear indications that despite new power 
</p>
<p>arrangements, divides along sectarian lines would continue in the post-conflict context. 
</p>
<p>This was heavily exploited by Al-Qaida in Iraq and by its successor, the Islamic State of 
</p>
<p>Iraq (ISI), which was founded following the death of Al-Zarqawi in 2006.  
</p>
<p>14. In 2010, ISI appointed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as its new leader. Under his 
</p>
<p>leadership, ISI regrouped and became increasingly organized. In 2011, with the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic descending into violence, ISI sent a number of operatives to join local 
</p>
<p>radical militants in the Syrian Arab Republic. The Jabhat al-Nusra armed group was 
</p>
<p>formed. In April 2013, Al-Baghdadi announced the merger of ISI and Jabhat al-Nusra into 
</p>
<p>the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. Following a power struggle between the leader of 
</p>
<p>Jabhat al-Nusra and the leader of ISI, the two groups formally split, with Jabhat al-Nusra 
</p>
<p>affiliating itself to Al-Qaida, and the formal disavowal of ISIL by Al-Qaida. Abu Bakr al-
</p>
<p>Baghdadi became the leader of the new armed group, ISIL, which gained control of 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>entitled &#8220;Rule of terror: living under ISIS in Syria&#8221;, para. 5.  
</p>
<p> 2 See the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation in Iraq in the light of the abuses committed by the so-called Islamic State in 
</p>
<p>Iraq and the Levant and associated groups (A/HRC/28/18), para. 2. 
</p>
<p> 3 The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his sincere thanks to Anne Charbord, Senior Legal Adviser 
</p>
<p>to the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering 
</p>
<p>terrorism, for her contribution to the preparation of the present report; and to Chris Woods, who 
</p>
<p>contributed factual research for the present report. </p>


<p>territory in the north of the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq previously controlled by ISI and 
</p>
<p>Jabhat al-Nusra.4  
</p>
<p>15. Since the inception of ISIL, its priority has been the construction of a so-called 
</p>
<p>State.5 In pursuance of this goal, on 29 June 2014, the leader of ISIL renamed the group the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Islamic State&#8221; and declared it a caliphate. ISIL now controls territory in Iraq and the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic in which an estimated 8 million individuals live. At the time of 
</p>
<p>writing, in Iraq, ISIL controlled swathes of territory in the provinces of Anbar, Ninewa, 
</p>
<p>Salah al-Din, Kirkuk, Diyala, Babil and Erbil, with Iraqi forces making gains in several 
</p>
<p>areas, notably recapturing Tikrit in April 2015. In the Syrian Arab Republic, ISIL 
</p>
<p>controlled large swathes of territory in the governorates of Aleppo, Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Al-
</p>
<p>Hasakah and Dayr Az-Zawr. It has also been reported that ISIL directly controls territory in 
</p>
<p>other countries, including Libya.6 In addition, it has been reported that several groups 
</p>
<p>around the globe have pledged allegiance to ISIL,7 and in some cases, there has been an 
</p>
<p>&#8220;extension&#8221; of the territory of the caliphate.8  
</p>
<p>16. ISIL has consolidated its financial capacity by expanding its control over natural 
</p>
<p>resources in both the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq, notably by seizing oilfields in both 
</p>
<p>countries. It has also been alleged that ISIL seized the reserves of the Iraqi Central Bank 
</p>
<p>held in Mosul in June 2014. ISIL has reportedly received substantial financial support from 
</p>
<p>foreign States, wealthy individuals and charitable organizations.  
</p>
<p>17. The military capacity of ISIL has continued to grow, largely as a result of looting 
</p>
<p>weapons and military hardware from other Syrian armed belligerents and from the Iraqi 
</p>
<p>army after its successful military campaign in Iraq. It is believed that arms and support 
</p>
<p>provided to other more moderate armed groups have ultimately fallen into the hands of 
</p>
<p>ISIL. ISIL has also purchased military hardware through local markets.  
</p>
<p>18. The expansion of ISIL has been helped by the inflow of foreign fighters. While 
</p>
<p>figures vary, it is possible that more than 20,000 foreigners have joined the ranks of non-
</p>
<p>State armed groups in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic,9 from at least 80 countries from

</p>
<p> 8 See &#8220;Rule of terror&#8221; para. 17. On 13 November 2014, the leader of ISIL announced the expansion of 
</p>
<p>the Islamic State to &#8220;new lands&#8221; (Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Egypt, Libya and Algeria) following pledges 
</p>
<p>made to him by various groups active in these territories. ISIL created new provinces in these 
</p>
<p>countries and appointed &#8220;governors&#8221;. See Stern and Berger, <i>ISIS: The State of Terror</i>.

<p>all parts of the globe.10 It is reported that most have joined the ranks of ISIL owing to its 
</p>
<p>perceived success,11 the ease with which one can join and its online presence and 
</p>
<p>propaganda.12 The proclamation by its leader of ISIL as a caliphate13 has reportedly 
</p>
<p>galvanized support from radicalized individuals and groups around the world. Individuals 
</p>
<p>join ISIL not only to fight, but also to assist in the building of a &#8220;State&#8221;, with ISIL 
</p>
<p>promoting a sense of religious duty,14 attracting individuals from diverse backgrounds.15 
</p>
<p>Many of these recruits are reportedly experienced fighters, or have the ability to attract 
</p>
<p>others through propaganda.16 Foreign nationals play a prominent role in the religious, 
</p>
<p>educational and judiciary &#8220;systems&#8221; of ISIL, which further radicalizes communities under 
</p>
<p>its authority.17 It has been reported that the military leadership structures of ISIL are largely 
</p>
<p>dominated by foreign fighters.18 
</p>
<p>19. ISIL has consolidated its control over the populations in the territory it holds. By 
</p>
<p>taking advantage of the instability in both Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic,19 its ideology 
</p>
<p>and financial capabilities have found resonance among socially and economically desperate 
</p>
<p>communities. It has exploited the existing social fragmentations among sectarian and tribal 
</p>
<p>lines to secure a new network of alliances.20 Most importantly, through the use of tactics 
</p>
<p>that instil terror in the population, including the calculated use of public brutality and 
</p>
<p>indoctrination, as well as the establishment of monopolistic control over basic services, 
</p>
<p>ISIL has ensured the submission of the communities under its control.21  
</p>
<p>20. ISIL is an organized group22 that functions under a formalized command with an 
</p>
<p>essentially vertical and hierarchical command structure.23 It is composed of an armed force, 
</p>
<p>an administrative wing and a religious wing, all under the control of the self-proclaimed 
</p>
<p>caliph, Al-Baghdadi.24 It operates a harsh, rigid administrative system that is based on 
</p>
<p>provinces and comprises the Al-Hisbah morality police, the general police force, courts and 
</p>
<p>entities managing recruitment, tribal relations and education.25

<p><b> B. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur has previously recalled the criteria for the existence of 
</p>
<p>armed conflicts of a non-international character,26 namely the intensity and protraction of 
</p>
<p>the conflict and the degree of organization of the parties. It is generally accepted that ISIL 
</p>
<p>is a sufficiently organized non-State armed group to be considered as a party to the non-
</p>
<p>international armed conflicts in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic,27 and that the situations 
</p>
<p>in both countries amount to armed conflicts of a non-international character.28 
</p>
<p>22. International humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts of a non-international 
</p>
<p>character is applicable in both Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic.29 All parties to the 
</p>
<p>conflict, including ISIL, are therefore bound by common article 3 of the Geneva 
</p>
<p>Conventions, which establishes minimum standards concerning the treatment and 
</p>
<p>protection of civilians, those no longer actively participating in the hostilities and civilian 
</p>
<p>objects. They are also bound by the customary law norms contained in the protocol 
</p>
<p>additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 relating to the protection of 
</p>
<p>victims of non-international armed conflicts.  
</p>
<p>23. In addition, it is now well established that in a situation of armed conflict, 
</p>
<p>international human rights law continues to apply, and both international human rights law 
</p>
<p>and international humanitarian law frameworks will act in a complementary and mutually 
</p>
<p>reinforcing way.30 Both Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic are parties to the major human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties and a number of optional protocols.31

<p>governmental organizations, have extensively investigated and documented grave and 
</p>
<p>systematic violations of international law by ISIL that could amount to genocide, crimes 
</p>
<p>against humanity, war crimes and gross human rights violations,33 including widespread 
</p>
<p>and systematic attacks on the civilian population.34  
</p>
<p>25. It has been reported that ISIL has specifically targeted religious and ethnic groups in 
</p>
<p>both Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic and has committed acts of violence against civilians 
</p>
<p>because of their affiliation or perceived affiliation to an ethnic or religious group.35 Where 
</p>
<p>ISIL has occupied areas with diverse religious and ethnic communities, minorities36 have 
</p>
<p>been forced to assimilate or flee, ISIL imposing disciplinary sanctions, destroying religious 
</p>
<p>sites and carrying out systematic expulsions. In Iraq, there are reports of a pattern of 
</p>
<p>violence against the Yezidis and, specifically, of men being separated from women and 
</p>
<p>young children, then taken to ditches and summarily executed.37 It has been reported that at 
</p>
<p>least 700 men were killed in August 2014 after being rounded up, separated from the 
</p>
<p>women and forced to convert. Those who refused were taken to a farm and, after being 
</p>
<p>made to hand over their possessions, were ordered to lie face down on the ground and were 
</p>
<p>filmed by members of ISIL before being shot several times.38 These acts may, if confirmed, 
</p>
<p>amount to genocide39 as defined in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
</p>
<p>Crime of Genocide. Other acts, including summary executions,40 abductions on a mass 
</p>
<p>scale41 and forced conversions, may amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. In 
</p>
<p>the Syrian Arab Republic, it has been reported that ISIL may have committed a crime 
</p>
<p>against humanity by forcibly displacing the Kurdish population in Ar-Raqqah 
</p>
<p>governorate.42  
</p>
<p>26. The alleged responsibility of ISIL for unlawful killings, including massacres,43 has 
</p>
<p>also been reported.44 Summary executions and enforced disappearances of individuals ISIL 
</p>
<p>views as challenging its dominance or opposing it, through a policy of declaring them to be 
</p>
<p>heretics or infidels in order to justify the attacks, has also been widely documented in the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic45 and in Iraq.46 Individuals targeted include police officers, public 
</p>
<p>servants, members of parliament, tribal and religious leaders, election candidates and hors 
</p>
<p>de combats fighters. Sometimes, individuals are found guilty by ISIL &#8220;courts&#8221; before being 
</p>
<p>executed,47 in the absence of any due process. In an effort to control the flow of information 
</p>
<p>and limit freedom of expression, journalists and human rights defenders have been

<p> 43 In October 2013, the Commission of Inquiry adopted the following working definition of a massacre: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;an intentional mass killing of civilians not directly participating in hostilities, or hors de combat 
</p>
<p>fighters, by organized armed forces or groups in a single incident, in violation of international human 
</p>
<p>rights or humanitarian law&#8221;. See A/HRC/28/69, annex II, para. 1.

<p>summarily executed, abducted, made to disappear and tortured.48 There are also scores of 
</p>
<p>allegations of torture and ill-treatment of individuals in detention centres, as well as 
</p>
<p>summary punishments for theft, watching football matches, smoking, improper attire, not 
</p>
<p>attending Friday prayers and having tattoos,49 in breach of ISIL edicts.  
</p>
<p>27. ISIL has been particularly brutal and discriminatory against women. Information 
</p>
<p>collected indicates that, in addition to confining women largely to their homes and dictating 
</p>
<p>what they must wear, with whom they may socialize and where they may work,50 ISIS 
</p>
<p>elements have committed sexual and gender-based violence, which may constitute war 
</p>
<p>crimes and amount to crimes against humanity. It is reported that Yezidi women in 
</p>
<p>particular have been the target of killings, widespread and systematic enslavement, 
</p>
<p>including sexual slavery, and rape; women have also been sold and forcibly transferred51 
</p>
<p>from northern Iraq to areas under ISIL control in the Syrian Arab Republic, where many 
</p>
<p>remain in captivity.52 There are also credible reports about the rape of girls as young as 6 
</p>
<p>years old.53 The targeting of homosexual men on the basis of their sexuality has also been 
</p>
<p>highlighted. 
</p>
<p>28. The abuse and violence perpetrated by ISIL against children has been widely 
</p>
<p>documented.54 This includes summary executions, arbitrary detention, torture, cruel and 
</p>
<p>inhuman treatment and kidnapping. In a particularly disturbing development, education is 
</p>
<p>being used as a tool for indoctrination.55 Children are reportedly made to watch videos of 
</p>
<p>beheadings56 and mass executions to desensitize them to forms of violence employed by 
</p>
<p>ISIL. The existence of &#8220;cub camps&#8221; in which children are taught to use weapons and 
</p>
<p>trained to be deployed as suicide bombers has been reported,57 and children have been used 
</p>
<p>as executioners. It is also reported that children as young as 8, and possibly 5, have been 
</p>
<p>trained and used in active combat roles. If true, this would constitute a war crime and a 
</p>
<p>violation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
</p>
<p>involvement of children in armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>29. In summary, ISIL has engaged in widespread and systematic human rights and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law violations of the most serious kinds.58 Such violations have been most 
</p>
<p>thoroughly documented in connection with ISIL actions in the Syrian Arab Republic by the 
</p>
<p>Independent International Commission of Inquiry, but have also been widely reported by 
</p>
<p>reliable sources in Iraq. The methods used include public beheadings, shootings, stoning,59 
</p>
<p>amputations and lashings, with individuals urged to attend executions, following which the 
</p>
<p>corpses are placed on public display, often on crosses, for up to three days.60 In addition, 
</p>
<p>victims&#8217; heads have been placed on spikes alongside park railings, in squares and on the 
</p>

</p>
<p>57&#8211;61. In each case, it would be necessary to determine that the victims were civilians and not 
</p>
<p>members of other armed groups.  </p>


<p>roundabouts of the larger towns.61 The displaying of mutilated bodies serves as a warning to 
</p>
<p>the local population of the consequences of failure to submit to the armed group&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>authority,62 to deter those who may oppose the group&#8217;s rule and to spread terror among the 
</p>
<p>population.63 The attacks perpetrated by ISIL on churches and historic monuments that do 
</p>
<p>not represent military targets are apparently committed to enforce religious and ideological 
</p>
<p>hegemony and to instil fear in minority populations.64 The systematic and targeted 
</p>
<p>assassination and abduction of community, political and religious leaders, government 
</p>
<p>employees, education professionals, journalists and health workers65 also appear to be 
</p>
<p>aimed at demonstrating the supremacy of ISIL in areas it controls. The brutal nature and 
</p>
<p>overall scale of abuses appears to be intended to reinforce the group&#8217;s absolute monopoly 
</p>
<p>on political and social life and to enforce compliance and conformity among communities 
</p>
<p>under its control.66 The result is that civilians who remain in ISIL-controlled areas live in a 
</p>
<p>state of constant and almost unimaginable fear.67  
</p>
<p>30. Some still argue that human rights, as a body of law, can only bind States, and 
</p>
<p>cannot or should not apply to non-State armed groups. However, as the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>has previously highlighted in other contexts, a central tenet of international human rights 
</p>
<p>law is that it must keep pace with a changing world. Human rights apply at all times, 
</p>
<p>inherently belong to individuals and are key to individual dignity. Increasingly, non-State 
</p>
<p>armed groups control parts of territories in which populations live. This is the case with 
</p>
<p>ISIL, which now controls large swathes of territory in which millions of individuals live; it 
</p>
<p>has declared itself a &#8220;State&#8221;, and runs both a civil and a military administration, including 
</p>
<p>the establishment of a &#8220;court&#8221; system. The threshold for ISIL to be bound by human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations has clearly been met.68 This means, at a minimum, that ISIL is bound under 
</p>
<p>international law to respect core human rights obligations, such as the right to life, the 
</p>
<p>absolute prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, the prohibition of 
</p>
<p>slavery and the prohibition of enforced disappearance, as well as the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>thought, conscience and religion.  
</p>
<p>31. In addition, where ISIL engages in violations that are unrelated to the conflict and 
</p>
<p>not direct consequences of it, the governing legal framework should be international human 
</p>
<p>rights law. In practice, this means that ISIL is legally bound to respect freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of movement. These rights should be 
</p>
<p>protected without discrimination on any of the grounds prohibited by international law. The 
</p>
<p>right to a fair trial should also be guaranteed. In areas of substantive overlap between 
</p>
<p>international human rights and international humanitarian law, the principles that provide 
</p>
<p>assistance in determining which framework is applicable are those of <i>lex specialis</i>69 and 
</p>
<p>effective control: the more effective control ISIL has over a territory or individuals, the

<p>greater is the extent to which human rights law will constitute the appropriate legal 
</p>
<p>framework.70 
</p>
<p><b> D. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>32. As the Security Council recalled in its resolution 2170 (2014), accountability for all 
</p>
<p>gross or serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law is essential to ensure justice, provide redress to the victims and prevent future 
</p>
<p>violations. The Governments of Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic bear primary 
</p>
<p>responsibility for protecting persons under their jurisdiction and ensuring accountability for 
</p>
<p>the commission of grave crimes. This implies a duty to take action so that violations are 
</p>
<p>prevented, stopped and not repeated; to investigate alleged violations effectively, promptly, 
</p>
<p>thoroughly and impartially and, where required, to bring alleged perpetrators to justice in 
</p>
<p>accordance with domestic and international law; and to provide adequate remedy and 
</p>
<p>redress to victims. Domestic courts in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic have jurisdiction 
</p>
<p>over all violations committed in their territories, whether by nationals or foreigners, and 
</p>
<p>they should exercise their jurisdiction where it is possible to do so.  
</p>
<p>33. However, in the light of the operational obstacles to the effective exercise of 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and bearing in mind concerns regarding respect for the right to a fair trial that 
</p>
<p>have been expressed regarding the judicial systems in both Iraq71 and the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic,72 the involvement of the International Criminal Court or the creation of an ad hoc 
</p>
<p>international tribunal to investigate and prosecute the crimes allegedly committed by, inter 
</p>
<p>alia, ISIL must be regarded as a priority.73 The Special Rapporteur joins the call made by 
</p>
<p>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Independent International 
</p>
<p>Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic and others for the involvement of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court regarding the situation in both Iraq and the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic. The failure of the Security Council to refer the situation in the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic to the Court has contributed to crimes continuing to be committed unabated.74 As 
</p>
<p>neither Iraq nor the Syrian Arab Republic are parties to the Rome Statute, the Court has no 
</p>
<p>territorial jurisdiction over crimes committed on their soil. The Prosecutor of the Court has 
</p>
<p>reviewed those cases in which the Court could exercise personal jurisdiction over alleged 
</p>
<p>perpetrators who are nationals of a State party to the Rome Statute, but has said that the 
</p>
<p>prospects of the Court investigating and prosecuting those with most responsibility in the 
</p>
<p>ISIL leadership would be remote.75 In the absence of a Security Council resolution referring 
</p>
<p>the situation to the Court, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Governments of Iraq and the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 70 See <i>International legal protection of human rights in armed conflict</i> (United Nations publication, 
</p>
<p>Sales No. E.11.XIV.3), p. 63. On the alleged violations, see, for example, the reports of the 
</p>

</p>
<p> 74 On 22 May 2014, despite the backing of 13 of its members, the Security Council was unable to adopt 
</p>
<p>a resolution that would have referred the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic to the International 
</p>
<p>Criminal Court as a result of vetoes by two permanent members, China and the Russian Federation. 
</p>

<p>Syrian Arab Republic to become parties without delay to the Rome Statute and to accept 
</p>
<p>the jurisdiction of the Court over the current situation under article 12 (3).  
</p>
<p>34. In addition, where it is suspected that returning foreign fighters have committed war 
</p>
<p>crimes or international crimes, courts in the countries of nationality of those fighters should 
</p>
<p>exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction for the crimes committed, where it is available under 
</p>
<p>national law.76 As recommended by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry 
</p>
<p>on the Syrian Arab Republic, the principle of universal jurisdiction should be used in 
</p>
<p>accordance with national law to investigate and prosecute persons and groups implicated in 
</p>
<p>egregious violations.77 In this respect, the Special Rapporteur takes note of the decision of 
</p>
<p>the Commission to share information with States willing to exercise their jurisdiction over 
</p>
<p>the crimes committed in the Syrian Arab Republic.78 As noted by the Commission, every 
</p>
<p>measure should be taken to ensure that individuals responsible for serious violations of 
</p>
<p>international law are held to account.79 
</p>
<p><b> E. Response of the Security Council 
</b></p>
<p>35. As the Security Council was unable to reach consensus on the issue of accountability 
</p>
<p>for international crimes, it has focused on ISIL as a terrorist group. ISIL has been included 
</p>
<p>in the Council&#8217;s comprehensive international counter-terrorism framework, which was 
</p>
<p>adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Court of Justice, and is legally binding on all States Members of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, following a determination that international terrorism associated with Al-Qaida 
</p>
<p>represents a threat to international peace and security. In addition, the Council has taken 
</p>
<p>measures relating to &#8220;foreign terrorist fighters&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>36. On 30 May 2013, the Security Council added ISIL to the Al-Qaida Sanctions List as 
</p>
<p>an alias for Al-Qaida in Iraq (QE.J.115.04). As the Council makes clear in its resolution 
</p>
<p>1989 (2011), any individual or entity designated by the Security Council Sanctions 
</p>
<p>Committee as associated with Al-Qaida, which includes any form of support for the 
</p>
<p>activities of Al-Qaida, or any cell, affiliate, splinter group or derivative thereof, may be 
</p>
<p>listed. Despite the fact that ISIL has severed its ties with Al-Qaida, the Council considers it 
</p>
<p>a splinter group of Al-Qaida.80  
</p>
<p>37. As a consequence of this listing, ISIL is subject to the threefold sanctions regime 
</p>
<p>imposed by the Security Council, namely: assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo. In 
</p>
<p>addition, the Council, in its resolution 2170 (2014), specifically indicates that individuals, 
</p>
<p>groups, undertakings and entities that provide support to ISIL, broadly described as those 
</p>
<p>financing, arming, planning or recruiting for ISIL through information and communications 
</p>
<p>technologies, including the Internet and social media, can also be listed on the Al-Qaida 
</p>
<p>Sanctions List and be subject to the same sanctions.81  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur has already provided a comprehensive overview of the 
</p>
<p>various shortcomings of the sanctions regime that the United Nations has established with 
</p>
<p>regard to Al-Qaida, in particular the quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions 
</p>
<p>performed by the Security Council in administering the regime, in the absence of

<p>regime,82 concerns remain that most of the shortcomings that had been identified still 
</p>
<p>remain valid and that the regime continues to fall short of international minimum standards 
</p>
<p>of due process. In particular, the Ombudsperson&#8217;s comprehensive reports are still not 
</p>
<p>legally binding; the process still lacks transparency; the Ombudsperson still has limited 
</p>
<p>access to confidential information, a challenge she describes as the most significant 
</p>
<p>limitation to the effectiveness of the Ombudsperson process; and the institutional 
</p>
<p>arrangements for the Office of the Ombudsperson still do not afford it proper safeguards for 
</p>
<p>independence.83  
</p>
<p>39. The Security Council has also taken decisive action against ISIL through a number 
</p>
<p>of subsequent resolutions adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>In its resolution 2170 (2014), the Council condemned in the strongest terms the terrorist 
</p>
<p>acts of ISIL and its continued gross, systematic and widespread abuses of human rights and 
</p>
<p>violations of international humanitarian law. The Council emphasized the need to ensure 
</p>
<p>that ISIL is held accountable for abuses of human rights and violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law and stressed the need to bring to justice those within ISIL who commit 
</p>
<p>terrorist acts, as well as foreign terrorist fighters. Recalling that threats to international 
</p>
<p>peace and security caused by terrorist acts must be combated in accordance with 
</p>
<p>international law, including international human rights and humanitarian law, it adopted a 
</p>
<p>number of measures and sanctions to prevent the financing of ISIL, including revenues 
</p>
<p>generated from control of oilfields and related infrastructure, kidnapping for ransom and 
</p>
<p>donations.84  
</p>
<p>40. The threat posed by the influx of foreign fighters, albeit not a new phenomenon,85 
</p>
<p>has gained increasing prominence in the context of the armed conflicts in Iraq and the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic. With States intent on preventing the ranks of ISIL from growing and 
</p>
<p>exacerbating the conflict, as well as on preventing returning nationals from carrying out 
</p>
<p>attacks on their own soil (so-called &#8220;blowback&#8221; attacks) or further radicalizing their 
</p>
<p>nationals, the Security Council took decisive action to address the issue of foreign fighters.  
</p>
<p>41. As already noted, in its resolution 2170 (2014) the Security Council called upon 
</p>
<p>Member States to take national measures to suppress the flow of foreign terrorist fighters 
</p>
<p>joining ISIL and other individuals, groups and entities associated with Al-Qaida in Iraq and 
</p>
<p>the Syrian Arab Republic. In its resolution 2178 (2014), the Council went further, requiring 
</p>
<p>States to adopt a number of measures regarding foreign terrorist fighters, defined as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;individuals who travel to a State other than their States of residence or nationality for the 
</p>
<p>purpose of the perpetration, planning, or preparation of, or participation in, terrorist acts or 
</p>
<p>the providing or receiving of terrorist training, including in connection with armed 
</p>
<p>conflict&#8221;. In that resolution, the Council decided that Member States should prevent the 
</p>
<p>travel of foreign terrorist fighters, that they should bring them to justice and that they 
</p>
<p>should criminalize a number of actions linked to such fighters concerning travel and its 
</p>
<p>funding and organization or facilitation of recruitment.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 82 See Security Council resolutions 1904 (2009), 1989 (2011), 2083 (2012) and 2161 (2014). 
</p>
<p> 83 See S/2015/80, paras. 37&#8211;53.  
</p>
<p> 84 See Security Council resolution 2199 (2015), which builds on resolution 2170 (2014) by refining the 
</p>
<p>range of tools available to block the financing of ISIL.  
</p>
<p> 85 See Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights, &#8220;Foreign fighters under 
</p>
<p>international law&#8221;, Geneva Academy Briefing No. 7 (Geneva, Geneva Academy, 2014).  </p>


<p>42. Resolution 2178 (2014) includes a specific and comprehensive human rights 
</p>
<p>clause.86 Significant concerns have nonetheless been expressed concerning the broad nature 
</p>
<p>of some of the provisions and the lack of definition of the terms &#8220;terrorism&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;extremism&#8221;, which, on the basis of past experience, may lead some Governments to use 
</p>
<p>the resolution to justify repressive measures against political dissenters with the apparent 
</p>
<p>endorsement of the Security Council.87 Similarly, the standard adopted for enforcement 
</p>
<p>action, that is, credible information that the individual will engage in the acts set out in the 
</p>
<p>resolution, arguably provides too much latitude to States and could result in arbitrary 
</p>
<p>enforcement action being taken.  
</p>
<p>43. In the same resolution, the Security Council also calls upon Member States to 
</p>
<p>require airlines to provide advance passenger information to the appropriate national 
</p>
<p>authorities in order to detect when individuals who may fall under the definition of foreign 
</p>
<p>terrorist fighters are travelling by civilian aircraft. While it is clear from the language of the 
</p>
<p>resolution that this should not be done by resorting to profiling based on stereotypes 
</p>
<p>founded on grounds of discrimination prohibited under international law, well-founded 
</p>
<p>concern has been expressed about the practical implementation of the resolution, as it may 
</p>
<p>have a serious impact on a person&#8217;s right to privacy. Measures that interfere with the right 
</p>
<p>to privacy must be authorized by domestic law that is accessible and precise and that 
</p>
<p>conforms to the requirements of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>Those measures must also pursue a legitimate aim and they must meet the tests of necessity 
</p>
<p>and proportionality.88 
</p>
<p>44. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, the approach adopted by the Security Council 
</p>
<p>to the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters could create legal uncertainty in efforts to 
</p>
<p>identify those to whom it is intended to apply, whether to members of all non-State armed 
</p>
<p>groups or those defined as terrorist groups under national law, international law, or both. 
</p>
<p>The Council stresses the urgent need to implement these measures with respect to those 
</p>
<p>fighters associated with ISIL, among others. However, the scope of the resolution is not 
</p>
<p>limited to foreign fighters directly associated with ISIL but, rather, depends on national 
</p>
<p>implementing measures. The Special Rapporteur considers that States should ensure that, in 
</p>
<p>implementing resolution 2178 (2014), they ensure that national measures are applied only 
</p>
<p>to those individuals who are conclusively shown to meet the criteria laid down by the 
</p>
<p>Council. They should also ensure that they strictly observe the human rights provisions 
</p>
<p>contained within the resolution itself, which include the right to independent and impartial 
</p>
<p>adjudication and adequate due process, and, more broadly, the principle of legality 
</p>
<p>enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.89 
</p>
<p>Criminal liability, including any definition provided in the law, must be precisely framed 
</p>
<p>and must respect the principle of legal certainty.  
</p>
<p>45. A number of other rights may also be affected by national measures to implement 
</p>
<p>the resolution.90 Measures such as the seizure and retention of passports or identity cards

<p><b> F. Impact on civilians of the military response to the Islamic State in Iraq 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the Levant 
</b></p>
<p>46. On 8 August 2014, the United States of America carried out air strikes against ISIL 
</p>
<p>positions close to Erbil in Iraq. On 23 September 2014, military action against ISIL started 
</p>
<p>in the Syrian Arab Republic. The international coalition of States led by the United States 
</p>
<p>against ISIL includes over 60 partners,91 with various levels of involvement, from carrying 
</p>
<p>out air strikes to providing advice. The States involved in the coalition are different in Iraq 
</p>
<p>and in the Syrian Arab Republic, with some States active in only one or the other.92 By 27 
</p>
<p>March 2015, the coalition had reported over 3,000 air strikes in which more than 11,000 
</p>
<p>munitions had been released. The United States has been responsible for 92 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>coalition air strikes in the Syrian Arab Republic and 70 per cent of the coalition air strikes 
</p>
<p>in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>47. According to the Government of the United States, the legal basis for the coalition&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>use of force in Iraq is intervention by invitation, or consent. On 18 June 2014, at a hearing 
</p>
<p>of the United States Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, the Chairman of the 
</p>
<p>Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, informed the Subcommittee that the 
</p>
<p>Government of Iraq had requested United States military air strikes to help combat violence 
</p>
<p>in Iraq led by ISIL.93 This request for assistance by the Government of Iraq is solid legal 
</p>
<p>ground on which to determine the legality of the air strikes that take place on Iraqi 
</p>
<p>territory.94  
</p>
<p>48. As the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic did not explicitly provide consent 
</p>
<p>for air strikes against ISIL on its territory, the legal basis for the use of force on Syrian 
</p>
<p>territory lies elsewhere. On 20 September 2014, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq 
</p>
<p>sent a letter to the President of the Security Council in which he explained that ISIL had 
</p>
<p>established a safe haven outside Iraqi borders that was a direct threat to the security of the 
</p>
<p>people and territory of Iraq (see S/2014/691, annex). He also explained that Iraq had 
</p>
<p>requested the United States to lead international efforts to strike ISIL sites and military 
</p>
<p>strongholds with the express consent of Iraq. On 23 September 2014, in a letter to the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General, the Permanent Representative of the United States referred to the

</p>
<p>Australia, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Denmark; in the Syrian Arab

<p>serious threat faced by Iraq of continuing attacks from ISIL coming from safe havens in the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic (S/2014/695). She noted that &#8220;States must be able to defend 
</p>
<p>themselves, in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defence 
</p>
<p>&#8230; when, as is the case here, the government of the State where the threat is located is 
</p>
<p>unwilling or unable to prevent the use of its territory for such attacks&#8221;. She also said that 
</p>
<p>the United States had initiated necessary and proportionate military action in the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic in order to eliminate the ongoing ISIL threat to Iraq, including by protecting 
</p>
<p>Iraqi citizens from further attacks and by enabling Iraqi forces to regain control of Iraqi 
</p>
<p>borders.  
</p>
<p>49. The right to self-defence as an exception to the absolute prohibition on the use of 
</p>
<p>force is enshrined in article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and is contingent on a 
</p>
<p>State facing an imminent risk of an armed attack on its territory. Under orthodox principles 
</p>
<p>of international law, the use of force against an armed group located on the territory of 
</p>
<p>another State is only justified on grounds of self-defence if the territorial State consents, if 
</p>
<p>the actions of the group concerned are legally imputable to the territorial State or if the 
</p>
<p>territorial State is harbouring the armed group concerned. International law may also 
</p>
<p>recognize a right of cross-border pursuit where an armed group uses the territory of a 
</p>
<p>bordering State as a place to which to retreat in order to regroup before recrossing the 
</p>
<p>border for the purpose of returning to engage in armed conflict. In the absence of such a 
</p>
<p>connection, however, the extraterritorial use of force against a non-State armed group 
</p>
<p>located on the territory of another State has traditionally been regarded as a violation of 
</p>
<p>sovereignty.  
</p>
<p>50. However, as the Special Rapporteur has previously noted,95 some States are now 
</p>
<p>taking the view that the right to self-defence can be exercised even where the non-State 
</p>
<p>armed groups have no operational connection with the host State. States adopting this 
</p>
<p>analysis hold that if, after a reasonable opportunity, the territorial State has failed 
</p>
<p>effectively to neutralize a threat that emanates from an armed group operating within its 
</p>
<p>borders, either because it is unable or unwilling to do so, then the State that is threatened 
</p>
<p>with attack is entitled under the law of self-defence to cross the territorial State&#8217;s borders 
</p>
<p>and use military force in self-defence against the group that presents the threat. As the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Representative of the United States noted in her letter to the Secretary-General, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;the Syrian regime has shown that it cannot and will not confront these safe havens [used 
</p>
<p>by ISIL for training, planning, financing, and carrying out attacks across Iraqi borders and 
</p>
<p>against Iraqi people] effectively itself&#8221;. On this analysis, the United States and its coalition 
</p>
<p>partners are entitled to use force in the Syrian Arab Republic at the request of Iraq in order 
</p>
<p>to defend Iraq and its people against attacks by ISIL, which is operating in Iraq but is using 
</p>
<p>Syrian territory for the purpose of planning and preparing its military operations, and they 
</p>
<p>are entitled to enter Syrian territory for this purpose because the Government of the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic has shown itself unable or unwilling to deal with the threat emanating from 
</p>
<p>ISIL.  
</p>
<p>51. Many of the 8 million Iraqis and Syrians who live in ISIL-controlled territory live in 
</p>
<p>urban areas. It has been reported, in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, that ISIL 
</p>
<p>deliberately places its fighters among civilians or in civilian areas, or uses civilian 
</p>
<p>infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, as military bases to conduct operations and 
</p>
<p>shield its fighters from attack, or to ensure civilian casualties in the event of attack.96 Major 
</p>
<p>towns have been frequently targeted by coalition air strikes, for example the heavy 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 95 See A/68/389, paras. 56&#8211;57. 
</p>
<p> 96 See OHCHR/UNAMI, &#8220;Report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict in Iraq: 11 
</p>
<p>September&#8211;10 December 2014&#8221;, pp. 10 and 17.  </p>


<p>bombing of central Tikrit.97 Basing forces among civilians and civilian infrastructure 
</p>
<p>constitutes a serious violation of applicable standards of international humanitarian law and 
</p>
<p>can constitute a war crime. At the same time, however, international humanitarian law is 
</p>
<p>clear that direct attacks against civilian objects are prohibited,98 unless and for such time as 
</p>
<p>they are military objectives.99 There is a presumption of civilian character for objects 
</p>
<p>normally dedicated to civilian purposes. In case of doubt, the principle of distinction and 
</p>
<p>the requirement to do everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives, not 
</p>
<p>civilian objects, prevail.100  
</p>
<p>52. Accurate targeting can be a particular challenge in such an environment. Obtaining 
</p>
<p>accurate intelligence is essential, but it has been reported that only 25 per cent of coalition 
</p>
<p>air strikes in the Syrian Arab Republic, and 5 per cent in Iraq, are pre-planned.101 With few 
</p>
<p>personnel on the ground to provide accurate targeting, crews rely heavily on targets of 
</p>
<p>opportunity. In recognition of this more challenging environment, the United States has 
</p>
<p>confirmed that the recent high standards it demanded of its drone strikes in Pakistan, which 
</p>
<p>required &#8220;a near certainty&#8221; that civilians would not be killed, could not apply to Iraq or the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic given the intense nature of the conflict.102 In such circumstances, the 
</p>
<p>coalition has a particular need for good aerial intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. 
</p>
<p>This would not only allow planners to scout potential targets, but also to conduct battle 
</p>
<p>damage assessments in the wake of strikes to gauge their effect on local populations, and so 
</p>
<p>modify tactics accordingly.  
</p>
<p>53. The accurate identification of those directly participating in hostilities is critical to a 
</p>
<p>proper application of the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur recalls that there is a lack of international consensus on the rules 
</p>
<p>governing direct participation in hostilities.103 According to the International Committee of 
</p>
<p>the Red Cross, an individual may be considered as a member of a non-State armed group, 
</p>
<p>and therefore targeted at any time, only if they have assumed a &#8220;continuous combat 
</p>
<p>function&#8221; within that group.104 If this criterion is not met, an individual who is otherwise 
</p>
<p>affiliated with an armed group can be regarded as having protected civilian status and may 
</p>
<p>be targeted with deadly force only if, and so long as, the individual is playing a direct part 
</p>
<p>in the conduct of hostilities. States that are involved in the military action in both Iraq and 
</p>
<p>the Syrian Arab Republic, including those States carrying out air strikes, should disclose the 
</p>
<p>criteria they adopt for direct participation in hostilities. This is critical to achieving 
</p>
<p>transparency as to the forms of conduct that may expose civilians to deadly force, to 
</p>
<p>evaluating whether any attack is lawful under international law, and for evaluating the 
</p>
<p>number of civilian casualties resulting from an attack.

<p>54. In Iraq, there have been numerous reports of civilian casualties in air strikes and 
</p>
<p>artillery operations attributed to Iraqi and associated forces, which raise serious questions as 
</p>
<p>to the proportionality of those military operations.105 In a welcome development, on 
</p>
<p>13 September 2014, the Prime Minister of Iraq ordered the Iraqi air force to suspend 
</p>
<p>bombardments in civilian areas, including those controlled by ISIL, and expressed his 
</p>
<p>commitment to protecting civilians.106 There are also confirmed instances in which Iraqi 
</p>
<p>forces have dropped leaflets warning civilians to evacuate ISIL-controlled areas owing to 
</p>
<p>impending military action. 
</p>
<p>55. In October 2013, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic intensified its 
</p>
<p>widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Aleppo for allegedly 
</p>
<p>supporting or hosting armed groups. At the time of writing, government forces were 
</p>
<p>employing a similar strategy in Ar-Raqqah, the &#8220;capital&#8221; of ISIL, with apparent disregard 
</p>
<p>for the principle of distinction.107 It has been reported that civilians were killed in 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks by the Government on ISIL-controlled areas of 
</p>
<p>Aleppo, Ar-Raqqah, Dayr az-Zawr and Al-Hasakah governorates.108 On 18 October 2014, 
</p>
<p>in Minbej (Aleppo), government forces reportedly hit a bakery, killing approximately 25 
</p>
<p>civilians. In July 2014, in Al-Mayadin (Dayr az-Zawr), government air strikes seemingly 
</p>
<p>targeted a municipal building being used as an ISIL base, but also hit a market, killing 13 
</p>
<p>civilians. On 3 September 2014, in Al-Shula (Dayr az-Zawr), a government jet struck an 
</p>
<p>ISIL checkpoint and reportedly killed 21 civilians, most of them children.  
</p>
<p>56. The coalition rarely cites casualty data, although the chief of the Air Force of Jordan 
</p>
<p>estimated in February 2015 that the alliance had killed 7,000 ISIL militants.109 In contrast, 
</p>
<p>the coalition has conceded no non-combatant deaths in seven months of air strikes, despite 
</p>
<p>clear indications to the contrary. Verification of fatalities remains difficult. That said, 
</p>
<p>credible monitoring groups and media and social media sites in both Iraq and the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic have recorded casualties. A provisional analysis by the not-for-profit project 
</p>
<p>Airwars.org indicates that an estimated 100 coalition air strikes (out of more than 3,000) 
</p>
<p>had been flagged for concern by 27 March 2015. A non-combatant death toll as high as 
</p>
<p>420, with over 100 additional claimed &#8220;friendly fire&#8221; fatalities, were reported. These figures 
</p>
<p>need to be treated with much caution as many are single-source incidents, are poorly 
</p>
<p>reported or are linked to events in which the cause of death remains contested. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some cases are well-documented with eyewitness testimony, video and 
</p>
<p>photographic evidence, missile fragments, named victims and/or confirmed coalition air 
</p>
<p>strikes at the location. According to the United States Central Command, of the 38 
</p>
<p>incidents of concern it has examined, 34 have been discounted while four civilian casualty 
</p>
<p>allegations are currently being investigated in three separate investigations. Even so, United 
</p>
<p>States Central Command continues to insist that &#8220;no non-combatant deaths from coalition 
</p>
<p>air strikes in either Iraq or Syria have officially been confirmed&#8221;.110 This would appear 
</p>
<p>highly questionable given the intensity of the air war and the accumulating evidence base.

</p>
<p>March 2015. </p>


<p>The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, for 
</p>
<p>example, first reported coalition-inflicted civilian casualties in November 2014.111 
</p>
<p>57. There remains a significant absence of transparency with regard to coalition 
</p>
<p>operations in both Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic. Each nation participating in the air 
</p>
<p>war operates under unique rules of engagement, and transparency levels differ 
</p>
<p>significantly.112 While the United States and Canada routinely report the date and location 
</p>
<p>of each strike, other nations only report weekly or monthly. In the case of Belgium and the 
</p>
<p>Arab members of the coalition, no public reporting of any actions presently occurs. With air 
</p>
<p>strikes being carried out by multiple actors, including the Syrian and Iraqi air forces, as well 
</p>
<p>as by the Islamic Republic of Iran &#8212; often at the same locations as coalition strikes &#8212; it 
</p>
<p>remains impossible for affected civilians to know, in most circumstances, which State was 
</p>
<p>responsible for an event, a concern noted by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq 
</p>
<p>(UNAMI).113 Transparency on the part of coalition States conducting these operations is 
</p>
<p>therefore imperative. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur recalls that, in any case in which civilians have been, or 
</p>
<p>appeared to have been, killed, the State responsible is under an obligation to conduct a 
</p>
<p>prompt, independent and impartial fact-finding inquiry and to provide a detailed public 
</p>
<p>explanation. This obligation is triggered whenever there is a plausible indication from any 
</p>
<p>source that civilian casualties have been sustained, including where the facts are unclear or 
</p>
<p>the information partial or circumstantial, and whether civilian casualties were anticipated or 
</p>
<p>not.114 
</p>
<p><b> G. Role of the Security Council in authorizing the use of force 
</b></p>
<p>59. The actions of ISIL have undermined international peace and security, grossly and 
</p>
<p>systematically abused the fundamental rights of civilians on a wide scale, gravely violated 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law and international human rights law and fractured the 
</p>
<p>territorial integrity of two States. Nonetheless, not all the permanent members of the 
</p>
<p>Security Council are in favour of taking more robust military measures. As noted by the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General, the privileges of tenure and the veto power that the permanent members 
</p>
<p>of the Council have been granted under the Charter entail a particular responsibility to not 
</p>
<p>employ their veto in situations of manifest failure to meet obligations relating to the 
</p>
<p>responsibility to protect civilians.115 The Special Rapporteur notes that, given the reports 
</p>
<p>relating to the possible commission of acts of genocide, Council members may have a more 
</p>
<p>specific responsibility116 given that they are all bound by the obligation to prevent this most

<p>serious of international crimes.117 The Special Rapporteur notes with interest the broad 
</p>
<p>support among many Member States, civil society groups and representatives of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations for initiatives relating to a responsibility to refrain from using veto powers to block 
</p>
<p>action aimed at ending atrocity crimes.

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>States are under an obligation to take measures to protect civilian populations 
</b></p>
<p><b>from widespread and systematic acts of violence and terrorism. It is essential that any 
</b></p>
<p><b>response be grounded in respect for international law, including international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law, international human rights law and refugee law. </b> 
</p>
<p>61. <b>In the light of the grave international crimes and systematic human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations committed by ISIL forces in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur:</b> 
</p>
<p>(a)<b> Recommends to the Security Council that the situation in Iraq and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Syrian Arab Republic be referred to the International Criminal Court as a matter of 
</b></p>
<p><b>urgency, or that an ad hoc tribunal be established promptly to try those responsible; 
</b></p>
<p>(b)<b> Calls on Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic to become parties to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rome Statute and to accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over 
</b></p>
<p><b>the current situation; 
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> Recommends that States prosecute individuals who have committed such 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes where they are able to exercise jurisdiction.  
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>States must ensure that all the measures they adopt at the national level to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address the threat posed by ISIL and other such groups, including measures taken to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement Security Council resolution 2178 (2014), fully comply with their obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>under international human rights law, as outlined in the present report. </b> 
</p>
<p>63. <b>All States engaged in military action against ISIL in Iraq and the Syrian Arab 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic are under an obligation to conduct prompt, independent and impartial fact-
</b></p>
<p><b>finding inquiries in any case where there is a plausible indication that civilian 
</b></p>
<p><b>casualties have been sustained, and to make public the results.</b> 
</p>
<p>    
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 117 All permanent members are bound by art. 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of
