BETWEEN:

Appellant

AND:

THE STATE
Respondent

Coram : Hon. Mr. Justice Goundar
Counsel : Appellant in Person
Ms P. Madanavosa for Respondent

Date of Hearing : 22 July 2014
Date of Ruling : 25 July 2014

RULING

[1]     
This is an application for leave to appeal against a decision of the High Court, refusing bail pending trial to the appellant. Whilst this appeal was pending, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment for robbery with violence by the High Court.

[2]     
Section 35(1) of the Court of Appeal Act gives a single judge power to grant leave to appeal against a bail decision. Section 35(2) gives a single judge power to dismiss a frivolous or vexatious appeal, or an appeal that is bound to fail because there is no right of appeal.

[3]     
Following the appellant's conviction, the issue of bail pending trial is academic. The appellant is no longer in custody on remand. He is now a serving prisoner. In these circumstances, this appeal against refusal of bail by the High Court cannot possibly succeed. The appeal is frivolous.

[4]     
The appeal is dismissed under section 35(2) of the Court of Appeal Act.
