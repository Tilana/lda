<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur visited Romania from 17 to 24 May 2011, at the invitation 
of the Government. The mission included visits to the capital Bucharest and the cities of 
Iasi, Cluj Napoca and Pitesti.  
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit was to examine the policy and legal 
framework related to her mandate; the implementation of the principle of the independence 
of the judiciary; the independence of the legal professions; the predictability of the judicial 
system and issues related to access to justice and legal aid.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur met a wide variety of actors, including the President of the 
High Court of Cassation and Justice; the President of the Constitutional Court; the 
President of the Superior Council of Magistracy (SCM) and several of its elected members; 
the Director of the National Institute of Magistracy; the Deputy Prosecutor General; the 
President of the National Council for Combating Discrimination; the President of the 
Senate Committee for Human Rights, Cults and  Minorities; State secretaries; officials from 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice; as well as from the Office of the 
People's Advocate and the National Integrity Agency (ANI).  
</p>
<p>4. She also consulted various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other 
stakeholders, including judges, prosecutors, lawyers and bailiffs, as well as the United 
Nations Country Team in Romania. She visited the Penitentiary of Rahova near Bucharest 
and interviewed a number of detainees.  
</p>
<p>5. In Iasi, the Special Rapporteur met judges from the Tribunal and the Court of 
Appeal, as well as judges, lawyers and civil society representatives, professors and 
students. In Cluj Napoca, she met judges from the District Court (<i>judecatorie</i>), the Tribunal 
and the Court of Appeal, as well as judges, lawyers, bailiffs, their professional associations 
and civil society actors, including academics. In Pitesti, she met with various stakeholders. 
Throughout her visit, the Special Rapporteur consulted various stakeholders in their 
capacity as users of the system of justice in Romania. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express her appreciation to the Government of 
Romania for the cooperation extended in the organization and conduct of her visit, and in 
general, in the exercise of her mandate. She also expresses appreciation to all stakeholders 
and interlocutors for their cooperation and time.  
</p>
<p>7. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur presents the main findings of her 
mission. She starts by referring to various judicial reform initiatives launched in the 
framework of Romania&#8217;s accession to the European Union (EU). She also analyses various 
</p>
<p>aspects regarding the independence of the judiciary, addressing issues related to the 
independence and impartiality of the courts, independence of the legal professions, 
administration and oversight of the judiciary and the judicial budget.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur further examines the role and functioning of the prosecution 
service; free exercise of the legal profession by lawyers as well as capacity-building and 
training of judges, prosecutors and other legal professionals, including training efforts 
regarding the Civil Code (Law 287/2009), in force since October 2011; the Code of Civil 
Procedure (Law 134/2010), expected to enter into force in September 2012; and the 
Criminal Code (Law 286/2009) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (Law 135 of 2010), 
both expected to enter into force in 2013. She also highlights additional aspects related to 
the administration of justice, notably access to justice and legal aid. The report concludes 
with recommendations for strengthening the judicial system and the independence of 
judges, prosecutors and lawyers.   </p>

</p>
<p><b> II.  Judicial reform 
</b></p>
<p>9. For over a decade, judicial reform efforts have been stimulated in Romania by its 
process of accession to the EU.1 In light of the recommendations made in the framework of 
the accession partnership launched in 1999,2 Romania initiated steps aimed at meeting the 
accession criteria related to the functioning of the judiciary. In 2003, Romania adopted a 
five-year Strategy for the reform of the judiciary3 and in that context, adopted new laws on 
the statute of magistrates, the organization of the judiciary and the Superior Council of 
Magistracy (SCM).  
</p>
<p>10. In 2005, the judicial reform strategy was updated by the biannual Strategy for 
reforming the judicial system and the accompanying Action plan, which included progress 
and evaluation indicators, budgetary implications and international assistance programmes. 
A monitoring commission,4 supported by a technical working group, was created to ensure 
the effective implementation of the Strategy.   
</p>
<p>11. The strategic goals for judicial reform focused on eight areas: (i) independence, 
efficiency and accountability of the judiciary; (ii) quality and transparency of the justice 
administration system; (iii) free access to the justice system; (iv) efficiency of juvenile 
justice; (v) institutional and legislative framework for international judicial cooperation; 
(vi) alignment of the penitentiary system to European standards; (vii) victims&#8217; protection 
and social reintegration of offenders; and (viii) prevention and combat of corruption within 
the judiciary. These goals were complemented by the five-year Information technology 
strategy for the reform of the judiciary, adopted also in 2005, with the objectives of 
modernizing and automating the judicial system; standardizing procedures and ensuring the 
use of indicators in the administration of justice.  
</p>
<p>12. Following the 2005 justice reform, the European Commission acknowledged the 
progress made by Romania in reforming the judiciary, including the implementation of 
measures adopting specialized court sections and panels;  adoption of the system of random 
allocation of cases to judges; improvement of conditions in courts and the increase in 
resources devoted to the justice system, including to the SCM.5      
</p>
<p>13. A number of recent initiatives revisit and update some past goals. As such, the 
Special Rapporteur will refer to certain aspects of the following initiatives: (i) the Action 
plan for meeting the benchmarks established with the cooperation and verification 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The accession negotiations between the European Union and Romania commenced in 2000 and were 
</p>
<p>concluded in December 2004. The accession treaty providing for accession on 1 January 2007 was 
signed in April 2005.  
</p>
<p> 2 The recommendations called on Romania to, inter alia, adopt a new criminal code and a new code of 
criminal procedure; establish safeguards to ensure the independence of the judiciary and introduce 
objective criteria for the recruitment and promotion of judges; reinforce administrative and judicial 
capacity, including through training and the provision of adequate resources and equipment; and take 
steps to prevent and fight against corruption at the legislative and institutional levels. 
</p>
<p> 3 See Government Decision no. 1052/2003 on the approval of the Strategy for the Reform of the 
Judiciary 2003&#8211;2007, published in the Official Journal no. 649 of 12 September 2003. 
</p>
<p> 4 The monitoring commission comprises the Minister of Justice; the presidents of the Superior Council 
of Magistracy and the High Court of Cassation and Justice; the Prosecutor General; the directors of 
the National Institute of Magistracy and the National School of Clerks; and one representative of (i) 
other legal professions (lawyers, notaries, bailiffs); (ii) the magistrates associations, and (iii) the 
Ministry of Public Finances. Representatives of the civil society and international donors attend 
certain meetings. The Commission meets quarterly or on request. The strategy is available at

<p>mechanism of the European Commission; (ii) Law 202 of 2010 known as the &#8220;small 
reform;&#8221; and (iii) the Strategy for strengthening integrity within the judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Action plan for meeting the benchmarks established within the 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation and verification mechanism of the European Commission 
</b></p>
<p>14. At the time of Romania&#8217;s accession to the EU (January 2007), the European 
Commission established the Co-operation and Verification Mechanism (CVM), a system to 
monitor progress made by Romania, after accession, on four benchmarks identified by the 
European Commission.6 The benchmark directly related to judicial reform requires that 
Romania ensure a more transparent and efficient judicial process, notably by reporting and 
monitoring the impact of the new civil and criminal procedure codes, and enhancing the 
capacity and accountability of the SCM, which is the oversight body of the judiciary.7  
</p>
<p>15. Through biannual CVM progress reports, the European Commission determines the 
level of implementation of the benchmarks and makes recommendations to the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>16. Following a recommendation made in the European Commission report of 2007, the 
Government of Romania drafted an Action plan to implement measures to address each of 
the four benchmarks. The Action plan was developed under the coordination of the 
Ministry of Justice and agreed at the technical level and adopted by the Commission for 
monitoring the implementation of the Strategy for the reform of the judicial system (2005-
2007) as well as the implementation of the National anti-corruption strategy.  
</p>
<p>17. The Action plan, adopted in September 2007, prioritizes six areas for judicial 
reform: (i) adoption of new codes of civil and criminal procedure; (ii) unification of 
jurisprudence; (iii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the SCM and enhancing the 
accountability of its members; (iv) increasing the transparency of the administration of 
justice; (v) improving the human resources policy; (vi) enhancing the efficiency of the 
judiciary through improvement of the infrastructure and court management.  
</p>
<p>18. Each of these priority actions is accompanied by a set of activities, performance 
indicators and sources of verification. The sources of funding, together with the responsible 
institutions and the expected deadlines are also included in the Action plan. Under the 
Action plan, a Commission was set up to monitor the implementation of measures aimed at 
reforming the judiciary8 and to propose measures to address shortcomings. The 
Commission meets on a quarterly basis and is assisted by a technical working group. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the cooperation that the European Commission 
has provided to Romania with a view to strengthening its judicial system. In her view, the 
establishment of the CVM has contributed to a collaborative and focused approach in 
clearly-defined areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption.   
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern during her visit about the need to ensure 
a people-centred approach to the reform. Information provided suggested that the decision 
</p>
<p>  
 6 See European Commission, decision 2006/928/EC of 13 December 2006.   
 7 The other three benchmarks are (i) establish an integrity agency with responsibilities for verifying 
</p>
<p>assets; (ii) continue to conduct professional, non-partisan investigations into allegations of high-level 
corruption; and (iii) take further measures to prevent and fight corruption.   
</p>
<p> 8 The Commission is chaired by the Minister of Justice and composed by the presidents of the Superior 
Council of Magistracy and the High Court of Cassation and Justice; the Prosecutor General; the Chief 
of the Department for European Affairs, and a representative of the Ministry of Economy and 
Finances.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.1

</p>
<p>to close a number of tribunals was mostly driven by budgetary and other considerations 
related to the productivity of the courts, particularly regarding the number of cases they 
dealt with. However, the possible impact of the closure of certain courts on the right to 
access to justice could have been considered further. While welcoming the elaboration of a 
series of impact studies by the Government of Romania relating to the different codes, she 
is of the opinion that the issue of perception of the reform by the general public and the 
different legal professions should have been addressed more broadly. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to draw attention to information received 
indicating that, given the concomitant judicial reform efforts, legal professionals, notably 
judges, prosecutors and lawyers were experiencing difficulties associated with the rapid 
change in norms and procedures, some of which were compromising their ability to 
exercise their professional responsibilities in a truly independent manner, especially due to 
the lack of the necessary infrastructure and training. She takes note of the information 
received recently on the consultation and training measures undertaken in Romania in the 
context of the entry into force of the codes mentioned. 
</p>
<p>22. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, such rapid change in norms and procedures 
requires a carefully designed plan for a transitional period. She welcomes the recent 
finalization of the Action plan for the implementation of the Code of Civil Procedure, the 
Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, and hopes that its implementation will 
enable legal professionals to cope appropriately with the legislative changes to be 
introduced.  
</p>
<p>23. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to the need to closely 
monitor the impact of a number of the specific measures adopted to achieve certain 
objectives of the reform. She wishes to illustrate this concern by referring to sanctions to be 
imposed, under the new codes of civil and criminal procedure, on lawyers for not appearing 
either in courtrooms or at hearings when their schedules clash with hearings in different 
courtrooms. According to stakeholders, this is a common challenge due to the dearth of 
mechanisms to ensure coordination between lawyers, prosecutors and judges. She invites 
the Government of Romania, the SCM, the European Commission and other stakeholders 
to reflect on this issue with a view to finding possible avenues for adequate coordination in 
order to guarantee the right of fair trial in the context of the judicial reform, where the right 
to be judged by a competent, impartial and independent tribunal should be balanced with 
the right to defence.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Law 202 of 2010 (the </b>&#8220;<b>small r</b>eform&#8221;) <b> 
</b></p>
<p>24. In 2010, Romania adopted Law 202, known as the &#8220;small reform,&#8221; with a view to 
embarking on a major reform that would introduce substantial changes to the legal 
framework governing civil and criminal law and procedure. The Law is Romania&#8217;s  
response to the observations on judicial reform made in the context of the CVM, as well as 
to a number of cases before the European Court of Human Rights, which brought to the 
fore the need to take steps towards reducing the length of legal proceedings.9 
</p>
<p>25. Law 202 introduced a number of provisions in the future codes of civil and criminal 
procedure aimed at simplifying judicial proceedings and reducing their length, as well as 
the number of appeals for certain categories of cases. It also introduced the principle of 
</p>
<p>  
 9 See, inter alia, European Court of Human Rights, <i>Nicolau v. Romania</i> (application No.1295/02), 
</p>
<p>judgment of 3 July 2006; <i>Stoianova and Nedelcu v. Romania</i> (application 77571/01), judgment of 4 
November 2005.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>opportunity, which provides for the possibility on the part of the prosecution not to pursue 
cases, for example, where existing evidence shows that further investigation is not 
warranted, and the possibility for the prosecution to take over reports submitted by the 
police. 
</p>
<p>26. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed by the Ministry of Justice that 
in the past, the average time taken by the courts to decide cases was between 6 and 8 years 
and that this was reduced to a maximum of 6 months with the implementation of the 
measures introduced by the Law 202 of 2010. She was also informed that the forthcoming 
Code of Civil Procedure foresees the set-up of a mechanism enabling the parties to a case to 
complain of excessive length of legal proceedings.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made by Romania to reduce the length 
of judicial proceedings. However, during the visit, she was concerned about the possible 
detrimental impact that some of these measures may have in the delivery of justice in 
Romania, in particular measures related to the qualification of delays in deciding cases as a 
disciplinary misconduct. She takes note of the provisions of the new law regarding the 
liability of magistrates, which qualify as disciplinary misconduct, repeated non-observance, 
due to imputable reasons, of the legal provisions to solve cases with celerity, as well as the 
repeated delays in carrying out work, due to imputable reasons. In the view of the Special 
Rapporteur, these provisions might add an excessive burden of pressure on the judges and 
possibly limit their capacity to examine cases in depth. 
</p>
<p>28. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur notes the concerns expressed by various 
stakeholders about the reform moving forward too quickly, in the sense that, more steps  
should have been taken so as to ensure an appropriate impact of the four new codes in the 
Romanian context. This appears to be a valid concern in the light of the impact of previous 
legal and judicial reform initiatives in Romania, described by the European Court of 
Human Rights in a judgement under its pilot judgement procedure, which highlighted a 
number of challenges, including the undermining of the practice of the domestic courts by 
the absence of a stable legislative framework, resulting in the lack of a uniform 
interpretation and application of the law; the lack of predictability of judicial decisions and 
the lack of acceptability of judicial decision-making. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur has noted information published by the Government 
indicating that the SCM undertook a perception survey among the judiciary on the impact 
of the small reform in Romania, which showed that 62.5 per cent of prosecutors and 75 per 
cent of judges considered, in 2010, that legislative changes were positive, while only 12.5 
per cent of prosecutors and 18.75 per cent of judges considered those changes as negative. 
This shows the engagement of judges and prosecutors with the judicial reform and how 
they want to and can contribute to it. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur has also noted various independent assessment studies 
undertaken by the Ministry of Justice to analyse both the efficiency of the judicial system 
through the ongoing functional review of the judiciary, as well as the impact of the 
forthcoming main codes. She welcomes the objectives of the impact studies on the codes 
which were also aimed at determining the most suitable dates for the entry into force of 
three of the codes, namely, the Criminal Code (Law 286/2009); the Code of Criminal 
Procedure (Law 134 of 2010) and the Code of Civil Procedure (Law 485/2010).   
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the information gathered through perception 
surveys and wishes to draw the attention of the SCM and the Government of Romania, in 
general, to a number of concerns related to the small reform, that were raised during her 
visit by a number of interlocutors, including judges, prosecutors and lawyers. These 
concern the need to ensure that measures taken to speed up legal proceedings are not 
detrimental to certain courts within the judicial system and that they do not place an </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>excessive burden of pressure on prosecutors and judges. Numerous stakeholders 
highlighted that congestion continues in the courts and, with the reform, has been 
transferred from the tribunals to the courts of appeal. 
</p>
<p>32. In line with some of the structural factors aforementioned, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates the invitation to the SCM to undertake, in close consultation with the judiciary 
and in all regions of the country and at all levels, a mapping exercise of the current needs of 
the judiciary and the possible way to address them in the reform as an internal monitoring 
system, including an assessment of needs in terms of infrastructure, personnel and budget, 
for the effective implementation of the new codes, with a view to contributing to build a 
solid and truly independent judiciary in Romania. She also invited the Executive and the 
legislature to give serious consideration to such a mapping exercise and assessment of the 
judicial reform process and its impact in Romania. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw 
attention to the impact that consistent evaluation, analysis and feedback can have when 
implementing new legislation and assessing its effectiveness, not only in the short term, but 
over long periods of time.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Strategy for strengthening integrity within the judiciary (2011-2016) 
</b></p>
<p>33. In March 2011, the plenum of the SCM decided to draft a strategy to strengthen 
integrity in the judiciary as a follow-up to recommendations made to the Government of 
Romania, inter alia, in the framework of the CVM, as well as in the assessment report on 
the implementation of the 2005-2007 National anti-corruption strategy and the Strategy on 
fighting corruption in vulnerable sectors and local public administration (2008-2010) in 
Romania,10 published in April 2011, which was shared with the Special Rapporteur by the 
National Integrity Agency (ANI).11  
</p>
<p>34. A first draft of the strategy was made public in July 2011, after the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. The strategy was adopted in November 2011, following consultations 
with courts and prosecution offices, as well as civil society and other relevant actors, and 
after considering observations formulated by the Ministry of Justice and the National Anti-
corruption Directorate.   
</p>
<p>35. The strategy aims to prevent and combat the lack of integrity within the judiciary 
and accordingly, seeks to uphold the rule of law and ensure consistency and cooperation in 
matters related to judicial integrity. It addresses both the integrity of the judiciary as a 
system, and the individual integrity of the members of the judiciary, and builds on prior 
strategies, including the Information technology strategy for the reform of the judiciary 
(2005-2009). The strategy includes a set of objectives and priority actions aimed at 
ensuring its effective implementation.   
</p>
<p>36. The SCM is the main body responsible for coordinating the implementation of the 
strategy and its action plan. The SCM is also in charge of monitoring and evaluating the 
strategy, including through its participation in the debates of the Platform of independent 
</p>
<p>  
 10 The assessment report was prepared by independent experts with the assistance of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Development Programme (UNDP) and the support of the Ministry of Justice and relevant 
stakeholders in Romania. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed by ANI that the 
report was approved in April 2011 by the Ministry of Justice of Romania.  
</p>
<p> 11 The National Integrity Agency (ANI), established by Law 144/2007, is an independent body with 
legal personality, created to remedy shortcomings in the monitoring of conflicts of interest and public 
officials assets. ANI is not a law enforcement agency; it functions as a specialized control body with 
administrative investigation functions.   </p>

<p>institutions and anti-corruption agencies, coordination of meetings organized by the 
Ministry of Justice and the undertaking of &#8220;trans-sectoral theme evaluation missions.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this initiative on the part of the SCM in fulfilment 
of its mandate and calls on the Government as well as the judiciary to accord all 
cooperation to the SCM so that the strategy is implemented effectively.  Furthermore, she 
wishes to draw the attention of the SCM to the recommendations made in connection with 
judicial integrity by the CVM in its second report of 2011 on progress made by Romania, as 
well as the recommendations made in this regard in the assessment report on the 
implementation of the 2005-2007 National anti-corruption strategy and the Strategy on 
fighting corruption in vulnerable sectors and local public administration (2008-2010) in 
Romania.  
</p>
<p><b> III.  Independence of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>38. The institution of the judiciary in Romania is comprised of courts and public 
prosecution offices, which are attached to the courts of law. The principle of an 
independent judiciary is recognized in article 124 of the Constitution of Romania,12 which 
also recognizes that justice is to be rendered in the name of the law, and with due respect 
for the principles of impartiality and equality.13  
</p>
<p><b> A.  Structural challenges  
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur received information on a number of challenges that may 
affect the delivery of justice in Romania.  
</p>
<p>40. Judges, and other stakeholders informed the Special Rapporteur that cases are filed 
at a rate considered far in excess of what judges in the jurisdiction of the courts can dispose 
of within reasonable time, and that this is exacerbated by the fast pace of legislative change. 
Stakeholders also reported that some of the measures expected to reduce the length of 
judicial proceedings have in fact placed an additional burden of pressure on judges, who, 
out of their fear of being sanctioned for delays in judicial decisions, are attempting to 
decide cases at a rate that does not allow a thorough analysis of the issues at stake.   
</p>
<p>41. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, these factors may hamper the predictability of 
judicial decisions, uniform interpretation and application of the law and the overall quality 
of the system of administration of justice in Romania. Accordingly, she wishes to draw 
attention to the fact that not only the exercise of the profession of judge, but also the 
predictability and quality of judicial decisions are affected if the law lacks coherence or the 
legal framework is instable, for example, due to the excessive proliferation of laws and lack 
of an adequate implementation plan for the legislation.   
</p>
<p>42. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur shares the findings of the latest CVM report 
that urgent measures are needed in this respect, including adequate training for judges, 
prosecutors and lawyers; reorganization of the court system, in order to balance the 
workload among different courts; and the necessary recruitment of judicial professionals. 14

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>43. In this regard, she recalls that the discretion of judges to interpret and apply the law 
finds its limit in the law itself. In her view, making judicial decisions rendered by the High 
Court of Cassation and Justice and the Court of Appeals public can be an important guide 
for the interpretation of the law by the courts in order to keep the discretion of judges 
within acceptable boundaries. This may also guide prosecutors and lawyers in their 
activities, foster a better understanding of the law by the general public and ultimately 
contribute to strengthening the independence of the judicial decision-making process and 
the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to stress the importance of ensuring that courts 
are adequately resourced so that they are able to function properly and uphold the principles 
of independence, impartiality, integrity, propriety, equality, competence and diligence. In 
her view, challenges relating to the infrastructure of the courts, such as inadequate office 
space and insufficient venues for hearings, including at the level of the High Court of 
Cassation and Justice (HCCJ), seriously hamper the independence of judges and 
prosecutors, and exert a detrimental influence on the performance of their tasks. During her 
meeting with the HCCJ, the Special Rapporteur was able to assess the precarious working 
conditions relating to the structure of the building in which it is housed. She was informed 
that the HCCJ was moved to the current building as a provisional measure while the 
original building was being refurbished. However, after the refurbishment had been 
completed, the building was not given back to the HCCJ. The Special Rapporteur notes the 
information received that the HCCJ was given an additional building in November 2011, 
and hopes that this development will contribute to the smooth and independent functioning 
of the Court.   
</p>
<p>45. In this regard, she recalls that the Basic Principles on the Independence of the 
Judiciary15 recognize that it is the duty of each Member State to provide adequate resources 
to enable the judiciary to properly perform its functions, including adequate workspace. In 
this respect, the Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to the importance of having  
well-maintained court facilities that are adequately equipped with desks, chairs and office 
supplies. Court facilities should also be equipped to allow access and movement by persons 
with disabilities. The Special Rapporteur received information on the total value of 
investments in the infrastructure of the Romanian judiciary since 2007, and encourages the 
Government to further pursue the goal of improving it. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the steps taken by Romania to ensure the random 
assignment of court cases and to modernize and automate the judiciary and the justice 
sector in Romania, in general. In her view, such efforts are crucial for the consolidation of 
an objective and impartial system that ensures the fair and equitable distribution of cases 
among the judges in each court. However, she wishes to draw the attention of the 
Government and the SCM to allegations indicating that the current automated programme 
that facilitates random assignment of cases to judges leaves room for manipulation. She 
calls on the Government to take these allegations seriously and to undertake a thorough and 
independent investigation into the matter, as well as to take all necessary steps, in 
accordance with the findings of the investigation, to improve the integrity of the system.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes efforts made to ensure the smooth flow of 
information among the institutions of the justice chain, including rapid access to legislation, 
jurisprudence and information regarding the trials by the personnel of the courts and 
prosecution offices. She has taken note of the publication of Court of Appeal judgements 
</p>
<p>  
 15  Adopted by the Seventh United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
</p>
<p>Offenders, Milan, Italy, 26 August-6 September 1985. </p>

</b></p>
<p>from 2008, 2009 and 2010 in different platforms.16 In this regard, she encourages the 
Ministry of Justice and the judiciary to ensure that the full jurisprudence of the courts is 
published in a user-friendly and easily searchable database.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur also commends the Government for the priority given to the 
establishment and further improvement of various software programmes available for the 
daily activities of the judiciary and, in particular, the electronic court register information 
system (ECRIS).17 In this regard, she wishes to draw attention to information received 
indicating that a number of challenges remain to ensuring a unified case law system and 
that the ECRIS programme has a functional judicial statistical modulus, as it has been 
reported that the improper correlation of the initial statistical index with the legislation in 
force is yet to be addressed.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Administration and oversight of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Superior Council of Magistracy (SCM) is the guarantor of the independence of 
the judiciary, in accordance with the Constitution of Romania. It appoints, promotes, 
demotes and dismisses judges and prosecutors, and performs the role of disciplinary council 
for judges and prosecutors to ensure their accountability.  
</p>
<p>50. Out of the 19 members of the SCM, 14 are directly elected by the magistrates and 
validated by the Senate, including 9 belonging to the section of judges, and 5 to the section 
of prosecutors. The Minister of Justice, the President of the High Court of Cassation and 
Justice and the General Public Prosecutor are also members.18 The other two members are 
civil society representatives elected by the Senate. The President of the SCM is elected by 
the members of the SCM&#8217;s Council and selected from among the elected magistrates for a 
</p>
<p>non-renewable term of one year. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
highlight that the majority composition of judges and prosecutors in the SCM is a safeguard 
for the independence of the judiciary.  
</p>
<p>51. Concerns were raised by civil society representatives regarding the transparency, 
efficiency and fairness of procedures by the SCM. Some major challenges identified by 
stakeholders included the need to: (i) create effective procedures for addressing potential 
conflicts of interest among its members; (ii) identify and discipline misconduct 
consistently; and (iii) address the practice of assigning judges and prosecutors to non-
judicial positions within the judiciary and appointing them to various Government agencies, 
thereby depleting the already understaffed courts and prosecution offices.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur recalls the importance of the role of the SCM, which should 
carry out its functions properly and independently, avoiding politicization or excessive 
solidarity with its fellow judges, as it should act as a disciplinary body and take measures to 
improve the administration of justice and promote the independence of the judiciary. She 
invites the SCM, together with the judiciary, to help the Government of Romania to uphold 
the rule of law, particularly in all its efforts to combat corruption and organized crime. In 
this respect, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the information that the acceleration of high-
level corruption trials by the High Court of Cassation and Justice seems to have 
circumvented the risk of these cases reaching the prescription period.19 However, some

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>recent investigations involving senior magistrates have cast doubts, including in the public 
opinion, about the SCM&#8217;s resolve to ensure accountability within the judiciary. The Special 
Rapporteur also calls on the Government to undertake efforts to identify ways and means to 
eliminate undue political and external influence on the SCM, as this was a frequently 
reported concern of various stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>53. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts undertaken to increase 
the credibility of the SCM, including the decision of the Constitutional Court to invalidate 
the re-election of some members of the SCM, in accordance with applicable law.20 In 
response to concerns raised regarding the need to find an adequate balance between 
magistrates&#8217; immunity and their accountability, a draft law to amend Law 303/2004 on the 
</p>
<p>statute of judges and prosecutors and Law 317/2004 on the SCM was initiated by the 
Government in 2010. According to information received, this draft law on magistrates&#8217; 
liability was approved by Parliament on 15 December 2011 and deemed fully constitutional 
by the Constitutional Court. The Special Rapporteur stresses the importance of ensuring the 
appropriate safeguards for the immunity of magistrates, which requires the establishment of 
objective criteria for the assessment of misconduct (art. 99) by the SCM, especially in order 
to avoid improper or undue use of disciplinary proceedings and sanctions (art. 100).  
</p>
<p>54. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur highlights the importance of avoiding the 
misuse of disciplinary proceedings against judges and prosecutors as a mechanism for 
imposing improper influence on them and undermining their independence and impartiality. 
She notes in this respect the novelties contained in the new law on magistrates&#8217; liability, 
and stresses that the law must give detailed guidance on the seriousness of the infraction 
and the type of disciplinary measure applicable in the case in question. In this context, she 
reiterates that judges should not be removed from office because of errors in judicial 
decisions or because their decisions have been overturned on appeal or review by a higher 
court (see A/HRC/11/41, paras. 57-58).  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur further invites the SCM to contribute to the implementation 
of the recommendations made to Romania by the EU through the cooperation and 
verification mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Judicial budget 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Ministry of Justice in Romania manages its own budget as well as  the budget of 
the courts, while the HCCJ, the SCM and the Public Ministry manage their own budgets.   
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur has noted information publicized by the Government 
subsequent to her visit to Romania, indicating that the advantages and disadvantages of the 
transfers of budget allocated to the justice sector by the Ministry of Justice have been the 
object of surveys involving foreign experts and that the presidents of the courts participate 
in the drafting of the judicial budget and have the prerogative to take decisions on its 
expenditure. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur has also noted the Government&#8217;s position that the 
management of the judiciary be diversified so that management of the courts is undertaken 
by court managers; management of trials is undertaken by the presidents of the court and 
</p>
<p>  
 20 In December 2010, the Senate validated the election of 11 members to the SCM, of whom, four were 
</p>
<p>re-elected, even though the law prohibits re-election, and two members (representing civil society) 
were deemed to have conflicts of interest. This was challenged in the Constitutional Court, which 
decided in January 2011 to invalidate the elections of some members.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>management of the budget is undertaken by the Executive following professional and 
functional skills within the Government. 
</p>
<p>59. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed of concerns regarding the 
institutional independence of the judiciary, particularly with regard to its de facto financial 
dependency on the Executive branch of Government. In her view, effective control of the 
budget of the judiciary by the Ministry of Justice is a factor that may hamper the 
independence of the judicial system.  
</p>
<p>60. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that entrusting the administration 
of its funds and assets directly to the judiciary or to an independent body responsible for the 
judiciary may reinforce the judiciary&#8217;s independence and help to prevent financial 
dependency as well as avoid tensions between the judicial and other branches of power. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Prosecution service  
</b></p>
<p>61. The Romanian Prosecution Service, known as the Public Ministry, represents the 
interests of society, defends the rule of law and the rights and freedoms of citizens, and 
performs the accusatorial function on behalf of the State in criminal law cases.21   
</p>
<p>62. Pursuant to the Romanian Constitution, the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office is attached to the 
High Court of Cassation and Justice and, together with all prosecutors of the country, is 
under the authority of the Minister of Justice. Such authority, according to the Government, 
is not hierarchical but administrative, as the prosecution service is considered independent 
in its relations with the Executive, the courts and other public authorities. 
</p>
<p>63. The Prosecutor General22 leads the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, and discharges its powers 
through public prosecutors, constituted into public prosecution offices.23  
</p>
<p>64. Public prosecutors are expected to carry out their duties in accordance with the 
principles of legality, impartiality and hierarchical control. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned about the recent powers granted to the Prosecutor General to 
reassign investigations to another prosecution office of the same level without an explicit 
requirement by the law to motivate such a reasoning. She wishes to draw attention to the 
need to ensure that such powers are exercised in conformity with the United Nations 
Guidelines on the role of prosecutors, and the relevant guarantees that should exist in 
societies governed by the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>65. The Public Ministry&#8217;s structure consists of 16 prosecution offices attached to courts 
of appeal, 42 prosecution offices attached to tribunals and 182 prosecution offices attached 
to courts of first instance. There are also six military prosecution offices. The National 
Anticorruption Directorate and the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crimes 
and Terrorism are attached to the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. The Special Rapporteur encourages 
the Government of Romania to redouble its efforts to strengthen the capacity of the 
prosecution service, as information received indicates that it is understaffed.   
</p>
<p>66. The National Institute of the Magistracy undertakes the initial recruitment and 
professional training required to become a prosecutor. Prosecutors are recruited by 
</p>
<p>  
 21 Constitution of Romania, art. 131, para. 1  
 22 The Prosecutor General is appointed by the President of Romania, based on a proposal by the

mandate, renewable once.  
</p>

</p>
<p>competition, based on their professional competence, skills and good reputation. However, 
allegations of politically-motivated appointments were made by stakeholders. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government and the respective anti-corruption 
entities in Romania to look into these allegations. 
</p>
<p><b> V.  Other aspects of the administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>67. In the course of her visit, the Special Rapporteur obtained information through 
individual interviews, indicating serious challenges in access to justice by victims of 
domestic violence and human trafficking, as well as persons of Roma origin.  
</p>
<p>68. In the light of the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the 
Government of Romania to some of the recommendations in her 2011 reports to Human 
Rights Council (A/HRC/17/30) and the General Assembly (A/66/289). In particular, it is 
important to challenge the traditional notions of judging and judicial authority and to 
encourage the representation of women at the top level of the judiciary. At the same time, 
men have the opportunity to play a crucial role, as judges, prosecutors or lawyers, in 
making the criminal justice system more accessible to women, and therefore more equal. In 
this respect, she notes the information provided by the Government that at the end of 2010, 
72 per cent of the judges in Romania were women. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that gender expertise be promoted, valued 
and integrated in all types of legal training and capacity-building for the judiciary and 
members of the legal profession. 
</p>
<p>70. She further invites the Government of Romania to consider conducting a mapping 
exercise to identify barriers to women&#8217;s access to justice, as victims, witnesses or offenders, 
and to take all necessary steps to address gender-based discrimination within the 
administration of justice, particularly regarding the criminal justice system, at all stages of 
the criminal law chain. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal aid    
</b></p>
<p>71. Legal aid is provided in Romania for both criminal and civil cases. For civil cases, 
legal aid is provided ex-officio, as stipulated by law.24 The Government has indicated that 
the legal aid system was established in compliance with Directive 2003/8/EC of the Council 
of European Union to improve access to justice in cross-border civil cases by establishing 
common minimum rules relating to legal aid for such disputes.  
</p>
<p>72. Legal aid is primarily granted on the basis of financial needs in accordance with 
established criteria, including demonstrated low-income earners (below the threshold 
stipulated by law, i.e., approximately 200 EUR) and within a certain limit imposed by the 
financial context (i.e., up to approximately 1400 EUR per year). Public legal aid is provided 
in the following forms: counselling; amount of the fee of the legal expert, translator or 
interpreter; amount of the fee of the bailiff; judicial taxes and/or bails prescribed by the law, 
including taxes and bails required at the forced execution stage. 
</p>
<p>  
 24 See Emergency Ordinance No. 51 of 21 April 2008 on Public legal aid in civil matters. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>73. Asylum seekers are entitled to receive legal assistance and advice from NGO legal 
counsellors, lawyers hired by themselves (or paid through programmes funded by United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the national European Refugee 
Fund) or, at the judicial stage of the procedure, they may request to be represented free of 
charge by ex officio lawyers. The courts usually grant requests for free legal assistance, and 
ex officio lawyers are appointed by the bar associations. It was reported that although NGO 
partners have made efforts to train these lawyers, the quality of free and, in some cases, 
paid legal representation still remains poor, due to lack of specialization in the field of 
refugee law. 
</p>
<p>74. The law also provides for extrajudicial aid in the form of counselling; drafting 
requests, petitions, and notifications; undertaking similar legal proceedings when 
addressing authorities or public institutions other than judicial ones or institutions with 
jurisdictional powers. For criminal cases, parties have the right to have a defence counsel, 
as stipulated in the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p>75. Most of the &quot;users&quot; of the judiciary who met with the Special Rapporteur 
highlighted that pro bono representation in practice is limited to criminal law cases, and that 
the quality of the defence is not adequately ensured. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Lawyers  
</b></p>
<p>76. In Romania the legal profession is free, independent and with autonomous 
organization, functioning and administration, as provided for under Law 51/1995 regarding 
its organization. Romanian lawyers informed the Special Rapporteur that they are able to 
pursue their work freely and without fear of reprisal. However, she was not informed of any 
special measures aimed at providing opportunities for candidates of Roma origin to enter 
the legal professions and ensuring that they receive training appropriate to their needs.25 
</p>
<p>77. Lawyers, prosecutors and judges underscored the importance of appropriate training 
on the new codes, so as to ensure a clear understanding of the changes introduced and a 
smooth transition to a major legal reform. 
</p>
<p>78. Furthermore, aspects needing improvement, such as the lack of harmonization of the 
law, interpretation of the law and judicial decisions, as well as constraints relating to 
resources and infrastructure faced by some courts, have also been affecting the adequate 
exercise of the legal profession. 
</p>
<p>79. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall that the Basic Principles on 
the Role of Lawyers stress that Governments, professional associations of lawyers and 
educational institutions shall ensure that lawyers have appropriate education and training 
and be made aware of the ideals and ethical duties of the lawyer and of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms recognized by national and international law.26 
</p>
<p>  
 25 See Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eight United Nations Congress on the 
</p>
<p>Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders, held in the Havana, Cuba in 1990, principle 11.  
 26 Ibid., principle 9.  </p>

<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Capacity-building and training of judges, prosecutors and 
other legal professionals 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur commends the commitment of the Government of Romania 
to enhance training and continuous education programmes, and welcomes the activities of 
the National Institute of Magistracy (NIM), established in 1992.  
</p>
<p>81. She visited NIM in Bucharest, met with its Director and learned about the different 
programmes it offers. NIM is ascribed to the SCM, which coordinates its activities. NIM 
provides initial vocational training of future judges and prosecutors, as well as continuous 
vocational training for appointed judges and prosecutors. It is a professional school and not 
an extension of university studies, thus it ensures the study of law through practical 
exercise, and in particular through case studies carried out in small groups.   
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the continuous professional training takes 
into account the dynamics of the legislative process and focuses on domestic legislation, the 
legal instruments ratified by Romania, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human 
Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Communities, comparative law and the 
deontological norms related to the profession of magistrates. In 2011, NIM organized five 
seminars on international judicial cooperation and is seeking to find avenues of cooperation 
to ensure that magistrates are able to attend the courses it offers at least once a year. It 
should be noted in this regard that Romania currently counts approximately 6,000 
magistrates, and NIM has the capacity to provide training to up to 3000 magistrates yearly. 
NIM is also exploring the possibility of developing long distance e-learning programmes, 
and has launched a Swiss-sponsored project to provide seminars and conferences for 
magistrates in 2012 and 2013.  
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the positive impact of such programmes on the 
enhancement of the standards of professionalism of judges and prosecutors, as highlighted 
by stakeholders. She also welcomes this encompassing approach and invites NIM to 
consider providing specific training on international human rights law standards, including 
those developed by the United Nations. The Special Rapporteur notes that a proposal to 
harmonize entry exams and to strengthen the initial training provided to magistrates is 
awaiting SCM approval. She welcomes the fact that separate training sessions are provided 
to judges and prosecutors in certain domains, and encourages further consideration to this 
issue in the light of the different roles and functions they perform. 
</p>
<p>84. NIM has started to provide training on the new codes within its initial and 
continuous training programmes, at both central and decentralized levels. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes these activities and underlines the importance of intensifying efforts 
to provide comprehensive training on the new codes before they enter into force, so as to 
prepare the ground and ensure a smooth normative transition among prosecutors and judges 
to enable them to better cope with the legislative changes. Consideration should also be 
given to training opportunities for lawyers in connection with the new codes.  
</p>
<p>85. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur welcomes other efforts undertaken by the 
Government of Romania to raise awareness on major changes that will be introduced by the 
new Criminal Code as well as the Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure, all of which will 
enter into force in 2013. In particular, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the partnerships 
established by the Ministry of Justice with the Public Ministry, the National Union of Bar 
Associations in Romania, the SCM, and the High Court of Cassation and Justice to provide 
a series of professional training seminars on the major changes introduced by the four new 
codes.  
</p>
<p>86. She also welcomes initiatives by the Ministry of Justice which has launched a series 
of lectures designed to raise awareness on the most important changes laid down in the new </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p>codes. These lectures will be attended by some 300 magistrates from courts and prosecution 
offices in Bucharest and are also open to judges, prosecutors and other legal professionals, 
such as lawyers, notaries and bailiffs. 
</p>
<p>87. The National Union of Bar Associations of Romania has also carried out awareness-
raising activities relating to the new codes, and held a national conference in May 2011 that 
was attended by magistrates and lawyers from all over the country. The budget of the High 
Court of Cassation and Justice provides 200,000 RON (or 48,000 EUR) for professional 
training, with a view to ensuring the participation of judges and assistant magistrates in 
seminars and conferences on the new codes. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The legal framework regulating the judiciary in Romania is comprehensive, 
recognizes the importance of the independence of the judiciary and complies with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international norms and human rights standards.   
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Romania has adopted tailor-made strategies and action plans aimed at 
addressing different aspects requiring focused attention, so as to improve the judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>system in areas such as information technology, the benchmarks established through 
</b></p>
<p><b>the cooperation and verification mechanism of the European Commission and 
</b></p>
<p><b>integrity within the judiciary. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends Romania for its continued efforts to 
strengthen the judiciary through various reform initiatives. In her view, recent efforts 
</b></p>
<p><b>illustrate the resolute commitment of Romania to strengthen the judiciary through 
</b></p>
<p><b>tailor-made laws and policies. Some of these efforts include (i) the Action plan for 
</b></p>
<p><b>meeting the benchmarks established through the cooperation and verification 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanism of the European Commission; (ii) law 202 of 2010, known as the </b>&#8220;s<b>mall 
</b></p>
<p><b>reform;</b>&#8221; (iii) the adoption of <b>the new Criminal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Civil Code and Code of Civil Procedure; (iv) the recently adopted Strategy for 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening integrity within the judiciary; and (v) measures intended to enhance 
</b></p>
<p><b>knowledge on the judicial reform in Romania. At the same time, she highlights the 
</b></p>
<p><b>importance of including all concerned actors in the implementation of these reforms. 
</b></p>
<p>91. Romania&#8217;s <b>current strategy for judicial reform seeks to improve the 
management of the judiciary, enhance the delivery of justice, promote </b>citizens&#8217; 
</p>
<p><b>participation in the judicial reform debate and take steps to counter corruption within 
</b></p>
<p><b>the country, including in the judicial system. The action plan of the judicial reform 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategy seeks to measure the performance, integrity, transparency, accountability, 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity as well as the human rights dimension of the judicial system as a pre-
</b></p>
<p><b>condition for the achievement of the goals and priorities of current judicial reform 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Promising initiatives with a positive impact on areas related to the mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur include the training programmes provided by the National 
</b></p>
<p><b>Institute of Magistracy as well as the information campaign launched by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to inform on the main changes introduced by the four new codes.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Despite efforts made, a number of challenges remain. Some of them are related 
to the need to create effective procedures for addressing potential conflicts of interest 
</b></p>
<p><b>among the members of the Supreme Council of Magistracy; identify and discipline 
</b></p>
<p><b>misconduct consistently; and address the practice of assigning magistrates to non-
</b></p>
<p><b>judicial positions within the judiciary and appointing them to various Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies, thereby depleting the already understaffed courts and prosecution offices. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>19</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Efforts to identify ways and means to eliminate undue political and external influences 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the SCM should be made in order to render the SCM independent, as it should be. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Another concern relates to the impact of the judicial reform, notably the 
adoption of the new codes on the work of judges, prosecutors and lawyers. The Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur welcomes the finalization of the Action plan for the implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Code of Civil Procedure, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Criminal Code, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>hopes that its implementation will ensure a smooth transition to the new legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>frameworks.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>In the Special Rapporteur</b>&#8217;<b>s view, efforts should be redoubled to ensure that a 
people-centred approach is adopted in all judicial reform initiatives so that Romania 
</b></p>
<p><b>can successfully achieve its goal of guaranteeing a justice administration system that 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensures independence, impartiality, integrity, equality and transparency, all of which 
</b></p>
<p><b>are prerequisites for the enjoyment of human rights by all in Romania. 
</b></p>
<p><b> IX. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Based on her findings, the Special Rapporteur makes the following 
recommendations with a view to contributing to the development of an effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice administration system that ensures independence, impartiality, integrity, 
</b></p>
<p><b>equality and transparency, as a prerequisite for guaranteeing the enjoyment of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights for all in Romania.  
</b></p>

<p><b>(b) Design and implement a plan for the transition period before the entry 
</b></p>

</b></p>

</b></p>

<p><b>courts, are adequately mainstreamed; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20

<p><b>necessary infrastructure compatible with its important role; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Take the necessary steps to ensure the institutional independence of the

<p><b>judiciary with regard to the judicial budget, by recognizing the right of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p><b>to draft its own budget and to participate in deliberations in the Parliament, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>by entrusting the administration of said budget directly to the judiciary or to an

</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Take all necessary steps to ensure the uniform and equal application of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the law, including by publicizing its decisions. </b></p>
