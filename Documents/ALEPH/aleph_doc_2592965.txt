NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
1. Basis of Presentation
The condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared without audit, pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These
condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
the notes thereto included in San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (the “Trust”) Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of Compass Bank, the trustee of the
Trust (the “Trustee”), all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, have been
included that are necessary to fairly present the assets, liabilities and trust corpus of the Trust at
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the distributable income and changes in trust corpus
for the three-month periods and the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The
distributable income for such interim periods is not necessarily indicative of the distributable
income for the full year.
The financial statements of the Trust are prepared on the following basis and are not intended to
present the financial position and results of operations of the Trust in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”):
•  The net proceeds attributable to the 75% net overriding royalty interest (the “Royalty”) that
burdens certain oil and natural gas interests originally owned by Southland Royalty
Company (the “Subject Interests”) in properties located in the San Juan Basin of
northwestern New Mexico (the “Royalty Income”) recorded for a month is the amount
computed and paid by Southland’s successor, Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company
LP (“Burlington”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, to the Trustee
for the Trust. Royalty Income consists of the proceeds received by ConocoPhillips from
the sale of production less accrued production costs, development and drilling costs,
applicable taxes, operating charges, and other costs and deductions, multiplied by 75%.
The calculation of net proceeds by ConocoPhillips for any month includes adjustments to
proceeds and costs for prior months and impacts the Royalty Income paid to the Trust and
the distribution to the holders of units of the Trust (“Unit Holders”) for that month.
•  Trust expenses recorded are based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established from
Royalty Income for liabilities and contingencies.
•  Distributions to Unit Holders are recorded when declared by the Trustee.
•  The conveyance which transferred the Royalty to the Trust provides that any excess of
production costs applicable to the Subject Interests over gross proceeds from such
properties must be recovered from future net proceeds before Royalty Income is again
paid to the Trust.
The financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with
GAAP because revenues are not accrued in the month of production; certain cash reserves may
be established for liabilities and contingencies which would not be accrued in financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; expenses are recorded when paid instead of
when incurred; and amortization of the Royalty calculated on a unit-of-production basis is
charged directly to trust corpus instead of as an expense. Most accounting pronouncements
apply to entities whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, directing
such entities to accrue or defer revenues and expenses in a period other than when such
revenues were received or expenses were paid. Because the Trust’s financial statements are
prepared on the modified cash basis, as described above, most accounting pronouncements are
not applicable to the Trust’s financial statements. This comprehensive basis of accounting
corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC, as specified by Staff
Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts.
The Trustee routinely reviews its royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. If an impairment event occurs and it is determined that the carrying value of the
Trust’s royalty interests may not be recoverable, an impairment will be recognized as measured
by the amount by which the carrying amount of the royalty interests exceeds the fair value of
these assets, which would likely be measured by discounting projected cash flows. There was
no impairment of the assets as of June 30, 2016.

2.
Federal Income Taxes
For federal income tax purposes, the Trust constitutes a fixed investment trust which is taxed as a
grantor trust. A grantor trust is not subject to tax at the trust level. The Unit Holders are considered
to own the Trust’s income and principal as though no trust were in existence. The income of the
Trust is deemed to have been received or accrued by each Unit Holder at the time such income
is received or accrued by the Trust rather than when distributed by the Trust.
The Trust is a widely held fixed investment trust (“WHFIT”) classified as a non-mortgage widely
held fixed investment trust (“NMWHFIT”) for federal income tax purposes. The Trustee is the
representative of the Trust that will provide tax information in accordance with the applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT
and a NMWHFIT.
The Royalty constitutes an “economic interest” in oil and natural gas properties for federal
income tax purposes. Unit Holders must report their share of the production revenues of the Trust
as ordinary income from oil and natural gas royalties and are entitled to claim depletion with
respect to such income. The Royalty is treated as a single property for depletion purposes. The
Trust has on file technical advice memoranda confirming such tax treatment.
Sales of natural gas production from certain coal seam wells drilled prior to January 1, 1993,
qualified for federal income tax credits under Section 29 (now Section 45K) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), through 2002 but not thereafter. Accordingly,
under present law, the Trust’s production and sale of natural gas from coal seam wells does not
qualify for tax credit under Section 45K of the Code (the “Section 45 Tax Credit”). Congress has
at various times since 2002 considered energy legislation, including provisions to reinstate the
Section 45 Tax Credit in various ways and to various extents, but no legislation that would qualify
the Trust’s current production for such credit has been enacted. No prediction can be made as to
what future tax legislation affecting Section 45K of the Code may be proposed or enacted or, if
enacted, its impact, if any, on the Trust and the Unit Holders.
The classification of the Trust’s income for purposes of the passive loss rules may be important to
a Unit Holder. Royalty income such as that derived through the Trust will generally be treated as
portfolio income that may not be offset or reduced by passive losses.
Tax positions taken by the Trust related to the Trust’s pass-through status and state tax positions
have been reviewed, and the Trustee is of the opinion that material positions taken would more
likely than not be sustained by examination. As of June 30, 2016, the Trust’s tax years 2012 and
thereafter remain subject to examination.
Each Unit Holder should consult his or her own tax advisor regarding tax compliance
matters related to such Unit Holder’s interest in the Trust.
3. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Contingencies related to the Subject Interests that are unfavorably resolved would generally be
reflected by the Trust as reductions to future Royalty Income payments to the Trust with
corresponding reductions to cash distributions to Unit holders. See Note 4 Settlements and
Litigation for a discussion of the status of pending litigation matters.
4. SETTLEMENTS AND LITIGATION
On July 31, 2014, the Trustee filed a lawsuit (the “2014 Litigation”) against Burlington in New
Mexico State Court. The Trust asserts claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and seeks a declaratory judgment arising out of a number
of unresolved revenue and expense audit exceptions asserted by the Trust’s auditors. The case
is currently scheduled for non-jury trial in March 2017. For more information about the 2014
Litigation, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.
5. CERTAIN CONTRACTS
Burlington sells natural gas produced from the Subject Interests under various contracts. During
the second quarter of 2016, Burlington extended the term of its natural gas sales contract with
New Mexico Gas Company, Inc. by two years to March 31, 2019. The contract provides for the
sale of certain winter-only natural gas supplies processed at the Kutz plant at prices that fluctuate
in accordance with published indices for natural gas sold in the San Juan Basin of northwestern
New Mexico. The Trust is not a party to this contract.

Table of Contents
6. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Trustee increased the Trust’s cash reserves for payment of contingent and future obligations
by $13,687 from June 30, 2016 to July 29, 2016 to cover Trust expenses in case of a future
revenue shortfall due to a prolonged decline in oil and natural gas prices that may reduce
Royalty Income.
Item 2. Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.
Overview
The Trust is an express trust created under the laws of the state of Texas by the San Juan Basin
Royalty Trust Indenture entered into on November 1, 1980 between Southland Royalty Company
(“Southland”) and The Fort Worth National Bank. Effective as of September 30, 2002, the original
indenture was amended and restated and, effective as of December 12, 2007, the restated
indenture was amended and restated, which we refer to as the “Indenture.” As a result of a series
of mergers and other transactions, the current Trustee of the Trust is Compass Bank, which is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaira, S.A.
The Conveyance and the Royalty
Pursuant to the Net Overriding Royalty Conveyance (the “Conveyance”) effective November 1,
1980, Southland conveyed to the Trust a 75% net overriding royalty interest (the “Royalty”) that
burdens certain of Southland’s oil and natural gas interests (the “Subject Interests”) in properties
located in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico. Subsequent to the Conveyance of
the Royalty, through a series of assignments and mergers, Southland’s successor became
Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company LP (“Burlington”), which is an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of ConocoPhillips.
The Royalty constitutes the principal asset of the Trust. The beneficial interest in the Royalty is
divided into 46,608,796 units (the “Units”) representing undivided fractional interests in the
beneficial interest of the Trust equal to the number of shares of the common stock of Southland
outstanding as of the close of business on November 3, 1980. Each stockholder of Southland of
record at the close of business on November 3, 1980 received one freely tradable Unit for each
share of the common stock of Southland then held. Holders of Units are referred to herein as
“Unit Holders.”
The Trustee
The primary function of the Trustee is to collect Royalty Income, to pay all expenses and charges
of the Trust and distribute the remaining available income to the Unit Holders. The amount of
income distributable to Unit Holders, which we refer to as “Distributable Income,” depends on the
amount of Royalty Income and interest received by the Trust, as well as the amount of expenses
paid by the Trust and any change in cash reserves. The Trust has no employees, officers or
directors. All administrative functions of the Trust are performed by the Trustee.
ConocoPhillips
Affiliates of ConocoPhillips are the principal operators of the majority of the Subject Interests.
Burlington also is responsible, subject to the terms of an agreement with the Trust, for marketing
the production from such properties, either under existing sales contracts or under future
arrangements, at the best prices and on the best terms it shall deem reasonably obtainable in the
circumstances. A very high percentage of the Royalty Income is attributable to the production and
sale by Burlington of natural gas from the Subject Interests. Accordingly, the market price for
natural gas produced and sold from the San Juan Basin heavily influences the amount of Royalty
Income distributed by the Trust and, by extension, the price of the Units.

(1) Burlington’s revenue adjustment in May for gas revenue reporting for production periods
December 2014 – January 2016.
(2) Reversal of Burlington’s duplicate payment in March 2015 of interest due on granted and
paid audit exceptions.
(3) Includes Burlington’s revenue adjustment in May for gas revenue reporting for production
periods December 2014 – January 2016 and $810 additional revenue received in January
from the August 2015 settlement of a gas imbalance.
The Royalty Income distributed to the Trust for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
was lower than that distributed during the same periods of 2015 primarily due to lower natural
gas prices offset by higher capital expenditures in 2015. The average natural gas price
decreased from $2.38 per Mcf and $2.86 per Mcf for the three and six months ended June 30,
2015, respectively, to $1.43 per Mcf and $1.61 per Mcf for the three and six month ended
June 30, 2016, respectively.
Gross Proceeds from Subject Interests. Gross proceeds decreased $7.8 million or 44% for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 and
decreased $19.3 million or 45% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015. Such decreases for these periods were primarily attributable to
lower natural gas and oil prices along with decreased natural gas volumes.
Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures decreased $4.7 million or 94% for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 and decreased $8.9
million or 91% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2015. Such decreases for these periods were attributable to maintenance and
improvement of production facilities.
Severance Taxes. Aggregate severance taxes decreased $0.7 million or 39% for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 and decreased
$1.8 million or 42% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2015. Such decreases were primarily attributable to lower gross proceeds during these
periods.
Lease Operating Expenses and Property Taxes. Lease operating expenses and property taxes
decreased $1.4 million or 18% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three
months ended June 30, 2015 and decreased $1.9 million or 12% for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. Such decreases were primarily
attributable to Burlington’s efforts to reduce contracted maintenance and repair costs as a result
of declining commodity prices. Property taxes increased $35,551 in the second quarter of 2016
compared to the second quarter of 2015 and $246,838 in the first half of 2016 compared to the
first half of 2015 because actual taxes for 2015 were more than accrued, which resulted in an
increase in the current accruals based on a new estimate of ad valorem taxes for 2016.

Monthly lease operating expenses of the Subject Interests, exclusive of property taxes, in second
quarter 2016 averaged approximately $2.2 million, as compared to $2.6 million in the second
quarter of 2015. Monthly lease operating expenses of the Subject Interests, exclusive of property
taxes, in the first half of 2016 averaged approximately $2.2 million, as compared to $2.6 million in
the first half of 2015. Lease operating expenses averaged lower for these periods primarily
because of reduced maintenance and repair labor.

($0.175483 per Unit) for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Such decreases in Distributable
Income were primarily attributable to a decrease in Royalty Income over these periods and
increased General and Administrative Expenses directly related to audit and legal costs incurred
in the Burlington litigation.
Based on 46,608,796 Units outstanding, the per-Unit distributions during the second quarter of
2016 were as follows:
April
May

$0.003906  
  0.002649

Interest Income. Interest income was higher for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to interest earned on the
increased cash reserve. Interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were lower as
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to the receipt of $78,884 in
interest on the late payment of gross proceeds in 2015.
General & Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million
or 80% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30,
2015 and increased $0.7 million or 58% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the
six months ended June 30, 2015. Such increases were primarily attributable to increased audit
costs and legal costs incurred related to the Burlington litigation.
Cash Reserves. Total cash reserves for current Trust expenses were approximately $1.0 million
as of June 30, 2016 compared to $0.8 million as of March 31, 2016. Cash reserves were
increased by $225,000 during the second quarter of 2016 in order to cover expenses in case of a
future revenue shortfall resulting from lower commodity prices.
Total cash reserves were approximately $0.5 million as of December 31, 2015 and were
increased by $450,000 during the first six months of 2016 in order to cover expenses in case of a
future revenue shortfall resulting from lower commodity prices.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Trust’s principal source of liquidity and capital is Royalty Income. The Trust’s distribution of
income to Unit Holders is funded by Royalty Income after payment of Trust expenses. The Trust
is not liable for any production

costs or liabilities attributable to the Royalty. If at any time the Trust receives more than the
amount due under the Royalty, it is not obligated to return such overpayment, but the amounts
payable to it for any subsequent period are reduced by such amount, plus interest, at a rate
specified in the Conveyance. If the Trustee determines that the Trust does not have sufficient
funds to pay its liabilities, the Trustee may borrow funds on behalf of the Trust, in which case no
distributions will be made to Unit Holders until such borrowings are repaid in full. The Trustee
may not sell or dispose of any part of the assets of the Trust without the affirmative vote the Unit
Holders of 75% of all of the Units outstanding; however, the Trustee may sell up to 1% of the
value of the Royalty (as determined pursuant to the Indenture) during any 12-month period
without the consent of the Unit Holders.
2016 Capital Expenditures
ConocoPhillips’ announced 2016 capital plan for the Subject Interests anticipates capital
expenditures of $4.8 million, of which $3.4 million is allocated to 20 facilities projects and $1.4
million is allocated to 20 facilities projects attributable to the budgets for prior years.
ConocoPhillips reports that based on its actual capital requirements, the pace of regulatory
approvals, the mix of projects and swings in the price of natural gas, the actual capital
expenditures for 2016 are subject to change.
Primarily due to depressed pricing for natural gas, ConocoPhillips has not allocated any capital
expenditures for 2016 to its drilling program in the San Juan Basin. However, ConocoPhillips
reported that it continually monitors natural gas prices and plans to restart the program at some
point in the future, dependent upon such natural gas prices. Existing wells will continue to be
operated.
ConocoPhillips has reported to the Trustee that there was no well activity during the first and
second quarters of 2016. During the first quarter of 2015, eight gross (4.8 net) conventional wells
were completed on the properties underlying the Subject Interests. During the second quarter of
2015, one gross (1.0 net) conventional well was completed on the properties underlying the
Subject Interests.
Oil and Natural Gas Production
Royalty Income for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 is associated with actual oil and natural gas
production during February 2016 through April 2016 from the Subject Interests. Royalty income
for the six months ended June 30, 2015 is associated with actual gas and oil production during
November 2015 through April 2016 from the Subject Interests.
Production of oil and natural gas and related average sales prices attributable to each of the
Subject Interests and the Royalty for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, were as

The Trust recognizes production during the month in which the related net proceeds attributable
to the Royalty are paid to the Trust. Royalty Income for a calendar year is based on the actual
natural gas and oil production during the period beginning with November of the preceding
calendar year through October of the current calendar year. Sales volumes attributable to the
Royalty are determined by dividing the net profits by the Trust from the sale of oil and natural gas,
respectively, by the prices received for sales of such volumes from the Subject Interests, taking
into consideration production taxes attributable to the Subject Interests. Because the oil and
natural gas sales attributable to the Royalty are based upon an allocation formula dependent on
such factors as price and cost, including capital expenditures, the aggregate sales amounts from
the Subject Interests may not provide a meaningful comparison to sales attributable to the
Royalty.
The fluctuations in natural gas production that have occurred during the three-month and six-
month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, generally resulted from changes in
the demand for natural gas during that time, market conditions, and variances in capital spending
to generate production from new and existing wells, as offset by the natural production decline
curve. Also, production from the Subject Interests is influenced by the line pressure of the natural
gas gathering systems in the San Juan Basin. As noted above, oil and natural gas sales
attributable to the Royalty are based on an allocation formula dependent on many factors,
including oil and natural gas prices and capital expenditures.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
For a discussion of significant accounting policies and estimates that impact the Trust’s financial
statements, see Part I, Item 1. Unaudited Financial Statements, Note 1 Basis of Presentation and
Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data contained in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Information Regarding Forward-Looking Information
Certain information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains, and other materials
filed or to be filed by the Trust with the SEC (as well as information included in oral statements or
other written statements made or to be made by the Trust) may contain or include, forward-
looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Such
forward-looking statements may be or may concern, among other things, capital expenditures,
drilling activity, development activities, production efforts and volumes, hydrocarbon prices,
estimated future net revenues, estimates of reserves, the results of the Trust’s activities, and
regulatory matters. Such forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such
as “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “expect,” “predict,” “project,” “anticipate,” “goal,” “should,” “assume,”
“believe,” “plan,” “intend,” or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes.
Such statements are based on certain assumptions of Compass Bank, the Trustee and by
ConocoPhillips, the owner of the working interest, with respect to future events; are based on an
assessment of, and are subject to, a variety of factors deemed relevant by the Trustee and
ConocoPhillips; and involve risks and uncertainties. However, whether actual results and
developments will conform with such expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks
and uncertainties which could affect the future results of the energy industry in general, and the
Trust and ConocoPhillips in particular, and could cause those results to differ materially from
those expressed in such forward-looking statements. The actual results or developments
anticipated may not be realized or, even if substantially realized, they may not have the expected
consequences to or effects on ConocoPhillips’s business and the Trust. Such statements are not
guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from
those projected in such forward-looking statements. The Trust undertakes no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, expect as required by applicable law.

ConocoPhillips Information
As a holder of a net overriding royalty interest, the Trust relies on ConocoPhillips for information
regarding ConocoPhillips and its affiliates, including Burlington; the Subject Interests, including
the operations, acreage, well and completion count, working interests, production volumes, sales
revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses, reserves, drilling plans, drilling results and
leasehold terms related to the Subject Interests, and factors and circumstances that have or may
affect the foregoing. See Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
There have been no material changes to our market risk during 2016. For information on our
exposure to market risk, please see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
The Trust maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Trust’s filings under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Due to the pass-through nature of the Trust, ConocoPhillips provides much of
the information disclosed in this Form 10-Q and the other periodic reports filed by the Trust with
the SEC. Consequently, the Trust’s ability to timely disclose relevant information in its periodic
reports is dependent upon ConocoPhillips’s delivery of such information. Accordingly, the Trust
maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that ConocoPhillips accurately
and timely accumulates and delivers such relevant information to the Trustee and those who
participate in the preparation of the Trust’s periodic reports to allow for the preparation of such
periodic reports and any decisions regarding disclosure.
The Indenture does not require ConocoPhillips to update or provide information to the Trust.
However, the Conveyance transferring the Royalty to the Trust obligates Burlington to provide
the Trust with certain information, including information concerning calculations of net proceeds
owed to the Trust. Pursuant to the settlement of litigation in 1996 between the Trust and
Burlington, Burlington agreed to newer, more formal financial reporting and audit procedures as
compared to those provided in the Conveyance.
In order to help ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information required to be
disclosed in the Trust’s periodic reports, the Trust engages independent public accountants,
compliance auditors, marketing consultants, attorneys and petroleum engineers. These outside
professionals advise the Trustee in its review and compilation of this information for inclusion in
this Form 10-Q and the other periodic reports provided by the Trust to the SEC.
The Trustee has evaluated the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016
and has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the “reasonable
assurance” level (as such term is used in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act), to ensure that
material information related to the Trust is gathered on a timely basis to be included in the Trust’s
periodic reports and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. In reaching its conclusion, the Trustee has considered
the Trust’s dependence on ConocoPhillips to deliver timely and accurate information to the Trust.
Additionally, during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 there were no changes in the Trust’s
internal control over financial reporting (as such term is used in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust’s internal
control over financial reporting. Because the Trust does not have, nor does the Indenture provide
for, officers, a board of directors or an independent audit committee, the Trustee has reviewed
neither the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures nor the Trust’s internal control over
financial reporting in concert with management, a board of directors or an independent audit
committee.
