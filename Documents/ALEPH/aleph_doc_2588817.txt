August&nbsp;2, 2016, Lonestar Resources America, Inc. (&#147;LRAI&#148;), a 
subsidiary of Lonestar Resources US Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), and the 
Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Purchase 
Agreement&#148;) with
Juneau Energy, LLC, as initial purchaser (the &#147;Initial Purchaser&#148;), 
Leucadia National Corporation (&#147;Leucadia&#148;), as guarantor of the 
Initial Purchaser&#146;s obligations, the other purchasers party thereto 
(collectively, along
with the Initial Purchaser, the &#147;Purchasers&#148;) and Jefferies, LLC, in 
its capacity as the collateral agent for the Purchasers, relating to the 
issuance and sale of (i)&nbsp;up to $49,900,000 aggregate principal amount of 
LRAI&#146;s 12%
senior secured second lien notes due 2021 (the &#147;Notes&#148;) and 
(ii)&nbsp;five-year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate 998,000 shares of 
the Company&#146;s common stock at a price equal to $5.00 per share (the 
&#147;Warrants&#148; and,
together with the Notes, the &#147;Securities&#148;). The Company expects the 
initial sale of $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Securities to close on
August&nbsp;4, 2016 (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;). The proceeds from the 
issuance and
sale of the Securities will be used by LRAI for general corporate purposes, 
which may include, but is not limited to, capital expenditures, working capital,
the repurchase from time to time of its 8.75% senior notes due 2019 in one or 
more open
market purchases, and to pay related fees and expenses related to the foregoing.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-
size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Purchase Agreement contains various 
affirmative and
negative covenants and events of default that limit LRAI&#146;s ability to incur
indebtedness, make restricted payments, grant liens, consolidate or merge, 
dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in transactions with
affiliates
and hedge transactions and make certain acquisitions. The Purchase Agreement 
also contains financial covenants that require the satisfaction of certain 
specified financial ratios, including total debt to consolidated EBITDAX of not 
greater than
(i)&nbsp;5.25 to 1.0 for the four quarter period ending June&nbsp;30, 2016, 
(ii)&nbsp;5.00 to 1.0 for the four quarter period September&nbsp;30, 2016, 
(iii)&nbsp;4.75 to 1.0 for the four quarter period ending December&nbsp;31, 2016
and
(iv)&nbsp;4.50 to 1.0 for all periods thereafter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-
top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

of the LRAI&#146;s
and its subsidiaries&#146; assets to the extent such assets secure obligations 
under that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of July&nbsp;28, 2015 (the 
&#147;Credit Agreement&#148;), by and among LRAI, the agents, banks and 
financial institutions
party thereto, as amended to date. Pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor 
agreement, the security interest in those assets that secure the Notes and the 
related guarantees are contractually subordinated to liens that secure
borrowings under the
Credit Agreement and certain other permitted indebtedness. Consequently, the 
Notes and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to the borrowings 
under the Credit Agreement and such other indebtedness to the extent of the 
value of such
assets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-

under the Act and under applicable state securities or blue sky laws, (ii) that 
the holder or
transferee execute and deliver to the Company an investment letter in form and
substance acceptable to the Company and (iii) that the transferee be an
