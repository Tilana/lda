<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The open-ended Working Group on the Right to Development was established by 
the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1998/72 and the Economic and Social 
Council in its decision 1998/269 with a mandate to monitor and review progress made in 
the promotion and implementation of the right to development, as elaborated in the 
Declaration on the Right to Development, at the national and international levels, providing 
recommendations thereon and further analysing obstacles to its full enjoyment, focusing 
each year on specific commitments in the Declaration; to review reports and any other 
information submitted by States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations on the relationship between their 
activities and the right to development; and to present for the consideration of the former 
Commission on Human Rights (subsequently the Human Rights Council) a sessional report 
on its deliberations, including advice to the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with regard to the implementation of the right 
to development, and suggesting possible programmes of technical assistance at the request 
of interested countries with the aim of promoting the implementation of the right to 
development. 
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 9/3, decided to renew the mandate of 
the Working Group until it completes the tasks entrusted to it by the Council in its 
resolution 4/4, and that the Working Group would convene annual sessions of five working 
days and submit its reports to the Council. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group accordingly convened its thirteenth session in Geneva from 7 to 
11 May 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p>4. The High Commissioner for Human Rights opened the session and underlined that 
justice, dignity and freedom from fear and want were the central tenets of the Declaration 
on the Right to Development. Human rights must be regarded as indispensible assets and 
indeed as the foundations of a global partnership for development that aimed at achieving 
the well-being of all people without discrimination. The full integration of the right to 
development into all areas of the work of the United Nations system and of international 
financial and trade institutions, as well as its major processes, such as the follow-up to the 
Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDC IV), the 
thirteenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD 
XIII), the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, the quadrennial 
comprehensive policy review and the post-2015 development agenda, was important. She 
pointed out that the politicization, the polarization and the impasse in the intergovernmental 
debate on the right to development had to end. A common objective should be to create a 
practical and operational framework for the implementation of the right to development, so 
as to realize the potential of that right with open, sustained engagement, including by 
encouraging the participation and input of a wider constituency.1 
</p>

<p>5. At its first meeting, on 7 May 2012, the Working Group re-elected by acclamation 
Tamara Kunanayakam (Sri Lanka) as Chairperson-Rapporteur and adopted its agenda (see 
annex I) as well as its programme of work. 
</p>
<p>6. In her opening statement, the Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled the mandate of the 
Working Group and the deliberations that had taken place at the previous session, and referred 
to the intersessional informal consultations. Expressing the hope that the twenty-fifth 
anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Right to Development would provide 
inspiration to move forward, to confront and eliminate the obstacles in the way of its 
implementation, and to help translate commitments into practical action and enable its 
realization, she underlined the importance of forging a vision and purpose in moving forward 
and making progress in considering, revising and refining the right to development criteria 
and operational sub-criteria. The Chairperson-Rapporteur pointed out that in the light of the 
historical, cultural, social and economic specificities and backgrounds among countries it was 
natural that there would be differences of opinion and interpretation. She appealed to 
delegations to continue the discussions in a constructive spirit and atmosphere with a view to 
adopting conclusions and recommendations by consensus, following past practice. 
</p>
<p>7. Prior to the adoption of the agenda and programme of work, there was discussion 
about the use of the Declaration on the Right to Development as a basis against which to 
evaluate the criteria and operational sub-criteria developed by the high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.2), as well as on 
consideration of the indicators elaborated by the task force in discussions on the criteria and 
operational sub-criteria. In that context, the European Union stated that it would be making 
comments on the indicators when discussing the sub-criteria. Egypt (on behalf of the Non-
Aligned Movement) stated that the mandate of the Human Rights Council referred to the 
criteria and sub-criteria, not to indicators, which should not be on the table for consideration. 
This position was supported by Senegal (on behalf of the African Group) and Cuba.  
</p>
<p>8. In that regard, the Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled her consultation on 30 April 
2012 with the coordinators of the regional and political groups, at which it was agreed that 
the Working Group would commence with consideration of all the criteria, followed by the 
sub-criteria. She added that, on the issue of indicators, one group of States had felt that the 
indicators should be addressed by the Working Group, while another had pointed out that 
the Working Group had no mandate to do so, although it would be open to examining the 
possibility of adapting the language in such a manner as to subsume certain indicators 
under the category sub-criteria, if that was considered appropriate. 
</p>
<p>9. At the session, the Working Group focused on a first reading of the criteria proposed 
by the task force, collecting views thereon and on refinements to the proposed criteria, as well 
as proposals for additional criteria. For that purpose, the Working Group had before it two 
conference room papers (A/HRC/WG.2/13/CRP.1 and 2) containing, respectively, 
submissions received from Governments, groups of Governments and regional groups, and 
submissions from other relevant stakeholders, including United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes and institutions, as well as other relevant multilateral institutions and forums. 
The papers were prepared by the secretariat pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
19/34. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of proceedings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Opening statements 
</b></p>
<p>10. Senegal, speaking on behalf of the African Group, pointed out that developing 
countries had used the framework of international negotiations to promote the right to </p>


<p>development and to place development at the centre of all efforts of the international 
community. Resistance to the implementation of the right to development could be due to a 
misconception of the application of that right at the international level, creating a North-
South divide. The responsibility for development fell on the international community. The 
effects of the multiple crises could have a unifying rather than dividing effect on both 
developed and developing countries. There was a need to cooperate to deliver the right to 
development to the entire human family. The right to development allowed the delivery of 
other rights, namely economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, and the reversal of 
unjust trends in history. In that regard, the mission of the Working Group was, more than 
ever, vital, and any attempt to politicize the issue, or complacency, would undermine its 
mandate and threaten the implementation of the right to development. The mandate was to 
review, redraft and approve the criteria and operational sub-criteria, bearing in mind the 
centrality of the Declaration on the Right to Development, which encompasses both 
collective and individual rights, as well as the need to find a proper balance between the 
national and international dimensions of the right to development, and to ensure the 
implementation of the right to development by international organizations with the ultimate 
goal of adopting a legally binding instrument on the right to development.  
</p>
<p>11. The European Union reiterated its commitment to achieving sustainable 
development and working towards freedom, accountability and good governance. This was 
reflected in the European Union policy on global challenges, which recognized that human 
rights and development were closely interlinked and key to achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals. One of the basic objectives of the European Union was to ensure that 
economic growth and development went hand in hand with good governance, 
environmental sustainability, and empowerment of women. Reference was made to the 
report of the High-level Panel on Global Sustainability, entitled &#8213;Resilient people, resilient 
planet: a future worth choosing&#8214; (A/66/700), which included elements that could guide the 
future work on the right to development, such as the Panel&#8217;s recognition that sustainable 
development was fundamentally a question of people&#8217;s opportunities to influence their 
</p>
<p>future, claim their rights and voice their concerns. Democratic governance and full respect 
for human rights were key prerequisites for empowering people to make sustainable 
choices. The right to development was based on the indivisibility and interdependence of 
all human rights, the multidimensional nature of development strategies and the individual 
as the central subject of development. The right to development required the full realization 
of all human rights and a mix of policies to create an enabling environment for individuals. 
The right-to-development criteria, sub-criteria and indicators should be formulated in a way 
that they can be applied to all countries, since the right to development should be enjoyed 
by all human beings, without discrimination. The European Union stated its belief that, 
given the nature of the right to development as a composite right, the elaboration of a new 
international legal standard of a binding nature was not the most appropriate means to 
operationalize the right to development.  
</p>
<p>12. Egypt, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, underlined that the international 
community was at a critical moment, with multiple crises and people taking to the streets 
demanding a reversal of social injustice. The calls were not limited to human rights, but 
extended to demands related to development. The right to development was at the 
intersection between human rights and development and could serve as a platform to push 
forward development goals. There were stereotypes; however, in reality the right to 
development did not reflect a North-South divide&#8212;it was about individuals and populations 
in both developed and developing countries. It was not only about aid but also about the 
creation of a national and international enabling environment for development. In this 
regard, it was stressed that States had the obligation and duty to cooperate with each other. 
It was important to capture the comprehensive nature of the right to development: the 
centrality of the right to development emanates from its nature as a bridge between human </p>


<p>rights and development. Recalling the mandate of the Working Group, the speaker noted 
that the drafters of the Declaration had realized the legal protection gap with regard to the 
right to development, which still existed today. That called for the establishment, within the 
United Nations system, of a mechanism to evaluate how the United Nations system 
incorporated the right to development in its work. As the Working Group continued to work 
on the refinement and final endorsement of the criteria and sub-criteria, those standards 
should evolve into a basis for the consideration of an international legal standard of a 
binding nature through a collaborative process of engagement. 
</p>
<p>13. Cuba emphasized that the right to development was a universal and inalienable right 
of individuals and peoples, and remained a priority for the country. There was a need for a 
favourable environment and international cooperation. Despite many efforts by developing 
countries, progress was hampered due to international barriers, including major 
protectionist barriers, unfair trade and failure to observe official assistance agreements. The 
economic, trade and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against 
Cuba constituted a massive and systematic violation of human rights and the right to 
development. There were many incongruences and inconsistencies in the right-to-
development criteria and operational sub-criteria as elaborated by the task force. Cuba 
opposed any attempt to reinterpret the right to development or to introduce progressivity; 
the purpose was to make the Declaration operational. Wars and the bellicosity of the United 
States and NATO-allied Governments constituted the most immediate and present threat to 
the right to development. Without peace there could be no development and without 
development there could be no peace. Disarmament was needed to free up resources for 
development. There was a need to fight underdevelopment, hunger and disease, and a need 
for armies of teachers and doctors, not armies sowing fear.   
</p>
<p>14. The United States underlined the need for more shared consensus on the definition 
and nature of the right to development. It stated its belief that the right-to-development 
criteria, sub-criteria and indicators provided potential common ground to advance work on 
the right to development. The United States supported the overall structure set forth by the 
task force, comprising goals and their component parts with benchmarks of progress, much 
the same way the Millennium Development Goals were structured around goals, targets and 
indicators, and ultimately all three components had to be considered as a package. It would 
be important to draw on expert guidance, as the process continued, to involve civil society 
and the private sector. Furthermore, there was a need to ensure that the criteria, sub-criteria 
and indicators complemented, rather than duplicated, the statistics of development and 
statistical agencies and the work done to monitor the Millennium Development Goals. The 
speaker underscored that the Working Group should focus on the human person as the right 
holder, as well as affirm the universality of human rights and that the State had the primary 
obligation to protect and promote human rights.  
</p>
<p>15. Morocco stressed that the Declaration on the Right to Development provided for a 
balanced sharing of national and international responsibilities in the area of development. 
States as well as the international community had a common moral obligation to make the 
right to development a priority in order to emancipate people from need and vulnerability 
and to address the growing gap between developed and developing countries. While States 
had the primary responsibility to create favourable conditions for the realization of the right 
to development, the international community had to fully assume its responsibility through, 
inter alia, cooperation and development assistance.  
</p>
<p>16. Pakistan pointed to recent developments at the international economic, financial and 
energy fronts, which called for increased and mutually beneficial cooperation. It supported 
all efforts aimed at transposing the right to development from the conceptual domain to 
operational reality. The elaboration of the right-to-development indicators was not within 
the mandate of the task force and lacked legal basis; however, Pakistan remained open to </p>


<p>all suggestions that could be helpful and instrumental in operationalizing the right to 
development. The right-to-development criteria and operational sub-criteria, once 
considered, revised and endorsed by the Working Group, should be used, as appropriate, in 
the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards for the implementation of 
the right to development. The Working Group should avoid entering into a debate on the 
scope, definition and dimensions of the right to development: it should work towards 
building an enabling environment at the international level for the sustainable development 
for all. 
</p>
<p>17. Algeria emphasized that the spirit of the Declaration on the Right to Development 
remained topical. Recent social movements, which were the consequences of the financial, 
food, energy and climate crises, attested to the need to defend the ideas in the Declaration. 
Although States had primary responsibility for the achievement of the right to development, 
the Declaration also required international solidarity and cooperation. The right to 
development was the right of peoples and individuals to the constant improvement of their 
well-being and to a national and global environment favourable to just, equitable, 
participatory and human-centred development, respectful of all human rights. The right-to-
development criteria and sub-criteria developed by the task force did not meet all the needs 
of developing countries, and failed to translate the whole spirit of the Declaration, which 
should provide the benchmark for operationalizing the right to development. Algeria 
expressed the view that the criteria, once adopted, should form the basis for the effective 
operationalization of the right to development and allow the adoption of a legally binding 
instrument, the ultimate purpose of which would be the effective realization of the right to 
development.  
</p>
<p>18. Switzerland welcomed efforts towards the effective implementation of the right to 
development, provided they were in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to 
Development, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and the two International Covenants on Human Rights. The right to 
development could bring human rights and development closer together and was yet 
another means to promote the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and 
interrelatedness of all human rights. Switzerland recalled the primary responsibility of 
States to realize the human rights of persons within their national jurisdictions and to create 
national and international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to 
development. The realization of the right to development should focus on promoting a 
human rights-based approach and policy consistency, coherence and coordination at all 
levels and strengthening the global partnership for development. Switzerland was not in 
favour of developing a binding instrument on the right to development. The criteria, 
corresponding operational sub-criteria and indicators could be used in the elaboration of a 
comprehensive set of standards which could lead to the adoption of a political commitment 
in the form of guidelines. More emphasis should be paid to the environmental dimension as 
key to sustainable development.  
</p>
<p>19. China stressed that the right to development was an inalienable human right and that 
its implementation was of great importance for all countries, but especially developing 
countries. Various factors, such as crises and instability, led to a worsening of the 
environment for achieving the right to development, and the task of achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals was more arduous than before. There was a need to 
strengthen international cooperation, to realize the Millennium Development Goals as well 
as the objectives of the Declaration on the Right to Development. Financial support, 
transfer of technology, debt relief and market access could help developing countries to 
achieve autonomous development. The democratization of international conditions as well 
as the formulation of sound national policies could help eliminate poverty and protect all 
human rights. There was a need to eliminate international disputes through dialogue and 
consultation, to refrain from using sanctions and pressure and to avoid politicizing </p>


<p>discussions of the right to development. China noted that the right-to-development criteria 
and sub-criteria needed further improvement and, in this regard, appreciated and supported 
the efforts undertaken by Egypt, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.   
</p>
<p>20. Nepal noted that the realization of the right to development, as an individual as well 
as a collective right, called for an enabling environment for development at the national and 
international levels. Full and unconditional recognition of the right to development on par 
with other internationally recognized human rights should guide the revision of the right-to-
development criteria and operational sub-criteria. As all human rights are indivisible, 
universal and inalienable, a balanced and coherent approach should be employed to ensure 
responsibility at all levels for the pursuit of all human rights in a holistic manner. 
Mainstreaming the right to development in overall development initiatives, policies and 
practices at all levels was paramount for its effective realization. Without the creation of a 
just and predictable enabling environment underpinned by a suitable international legal 
framework, the right to development risked remaining unfulfilled. There must be a focus on 
addressing the special needs of developing countries, in particular the least developed 
countries, who are suffering from structural problems and the effects of external events and 
crises. Hence, the realization of the internationally agreed development goals must remain 
an important component of efforts to realize the right to development.  
</p>
<p>21. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire emphasized that developing countries had been using the Declaration 
to promote development. There was a lack of understanding of what the right to 
development meant at the international level. Furthermore, the dichotomy between creditor 
and debtor nations undermined a balanced exchange. The responsibility for the realization 
of the right to development fell on the entire international community, and solidarity and 
international cooperation in line with the spirit of the Declaration were essential to fulfilling 
the right to development. There must be a balance in national and international 
responsibility and that should be reflected in a legally binding instrument on the right to 
development. 
</p>
<p>22. Bangladesh stressed that its engagement with human rights issues was based on the 
premise that all human rights are equal, indivisible, interdependent and mutually 
reinforcing. The right to development was about mainstreaming and implementing 
development-oriented policies at all levels, in order to improve the capacity of States to 
ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights. The recurring economic crises had re-
emphasized the relevance of the right to development and the need for its realization. 
Globalization had created an interdependent world, implying collective and shared 
responsibility and the need for a balance between the national and international dimensions. 
Efforts of developing countries had been restrained by impediments at the international 
level which were beyond their control. The global economic governance had to generate 
effective international cooperation for sustainable growth and development. Participation in 
the global decision-making process was also vital. It was also important to take into account 
the social, economic and cultural realities and differences among countries and the 
environmental vulnerabilities of countries. 
</p>
<p>23. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela emphasized that the guaranteeing of other 
human rights was not possible without the realization of the right to development. There 
was a need to make progress in the consolidation of the principles of solidarity, 
complementarity and mutual responsibility, with due respect for the sovereignty of peoples 
and genuine international cooperation free from conditionalities. The global crisis caused 
by neoliberal capitalism and policies enacted by global powers undermined peoples&#8217; 
enjoyment of the right to development. The failure to deliver on official development 
assistance commitments, to relieve countries from the debt burden and to transfer 
technology pointed to the need for a fair international order. Refining the right-to-
development criteria and operational sub-criteria should pave the way to design norms </p>


<p>which would lead to an international legally binding instrument that reflects the principles, 
the equilibrium and the elements contained in the Declaration on the Right to Development.  
</p>
<p>24. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland reiterated that the right 
to development could not be considered in isolation but was closely linked to the realization 
of all human rights. The criteria should strike a more equal balance between State action at 
the national and international levels; take full account of the indivisibility of all human 
rights, recognizing that progress has to be made in basic civil and political rights in order to 
create an environment in which the right to development can be implemented; and be 
formulated in a way that respects the universal character of the right to development. The 
United Kingdom proposed that there should be a detailed discussion involving experts of 
each criterion, incorporating their sub-criteria and indicators, so as to ensure that each is 
rigorously tested and that States have the opportunity to consider in detail the implications 
for national policies and practices. The United Kingdom further emphasized the need to 
consider all criteria, sub-criteria and indicators as a package. The next step should be 
translating policy discussion into concrete action. The United Kingdom did not support the 
development of a legally binding instrument but remained open to exploring other options, 
including guidelines or voluntary principles; training and education; exploring how human 
rights regimes incorporated the right to development into their work; and the provision of 
technical assistance or sharing of best practices.  
</p>
<p>25. Honduras reaffirmed its commitment to the realization of the right to development. 
In its view, the Millennium Development Goals constituted the consensus of the 
international community and prioritized actions to achieve the goals aimed at in the 
Declaration on the Right to Development. The realization of the right to development 
required collective action, in addition to national actions, for which strategies for 
international cooperation were essential. Honduras viewed the right to development as a 
process which was not essentially about economic growth but about the effective 
realization of all human rights. The right to development should not be seen exclusively in 
its individual dimension, but in its dual dimension as an individual right and the right of 
nations to achieve full development.  
</p>
<p>26. Brazil attached great importance to the process and to finding a way to move 
forward, with a view to achieving concrete results. The right to development was not about 
a North-South divide, but was a concern to all. The speaker underlined in that context the 
key notion of common and differentiated responsibilities, agreed in the 1992 Rio 
Declaration on Environment and Development, in recognition of different levels of 
development among countries. However, the lack of development could not be used as an 
excuse for human rights violations. The right to development was connected with all human 
rights but it was not only the duty of States; more emphasis had to be placed on 
international cooperation. Brazil suggested that the Working Group should identify and 
address the obstacles to the implementation of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>27. The Indian Council of South America, speaking on behalf of the Indigenous Peoples 
and Nations Coalition and the International Council for Human Rights, stressed that 
individual and collective rights were vitally important to the realization of the right of 
peoples to self-determination and were paramount attributes that had to be applied when 
working towards eliminating, for all peoples, injustices based on discrimination and in 
operationalizing the right to development. In its view, States often selectively reduced the 
scope and application of the right to development because they perceived that it applied 
only to their interests and not to the right of peoples. Indigenous peoples must be given an 
equal voice. The parameters of the nature of collective rights could not be designated only 
for States, but also for peoples who aspired to exercise their international right to self-
determination. The Indian Council emphasized that the right of peoples to self-
determination was a necessary component in the operationalization of the right to </p>


<p>development. It called upon the Working Group to allow for peoples to enjoy fair, open and 
equal participation in the debate and an equal voice in the process.  
</p>
<p>28. Centre Europe-Tiers Monde referred to three major obstacles to the realization of the 
right to development: the lack of realization of the right of peoples to self-determination; 
unbalanced macroeconomic policies; and the lack of coordination within the United 
Nations system. In its view, the criteria and operational sub-criteria contained very 
interesting elements, however, they overlooked the failure of the market economy, which 
was unable to eradicate hunger and poverty and exacerbated instability. Subjected to 
structural adjustment programmes, many people had no say as regards their future. At their 
best, the criteria and operational sub-criteria were dead letters unless there was genuine 
change in finance and the markets.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Review of progress in the implementation of the right to development: 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration, revision and refinement of the right-to-development 
</b></p>
<p><b>criteria and operational sub-criteria 
</b></p>
<p>29. At its second, third, fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth meetings, from 7 to 10 May, the 
Working Group considered and revised the right-to-development criteria.  
</p>
<p>30. Prior to the substantive review of the criteria, the Chairperson-Rapporteur reported 
on the outcome of the informal consultations that she had held with Governments, groups 
of Governments, regional groups and other relevant stakeholders, including United Nations 
agencies, funds and programmes and institutions, as well as civil society and non-
governmental organizations, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/34. The 
consultations focused on the way forward and the methodology to be adopted by the 
Working Group for its consideration, revision and refinement of the right-to-development 
criteria and operational sub-criteria. During the informal consultations with Member States, 
the two main divisive points concerned the methodology to be followed in the revision of 
the criteria and operational sub-criteria, and whether or not indicators should be addressed 
and to what extent. During the consultations with United Nations agencies, clarity and 
guidance was requested of Member States on the role expected of them. It was suggested 
that a mechanism be established for their structured and effective engagement. During 
consultations with non-governmental organizations, it was expressed that the criteria and 
sub-criteria lacked accurate human rights language and that they should reflect the 
multidimensional character of the right to development, and not be reduced to economic, 
social and cultural rights alone. It was also expressed that there was a lack of emphasis on 
international solidarity. The methodology for formulating criteria and sub-criteria and the 
need to use the Declaration on the Right to Development as a basis were also stressed. 
Emphasis was also placed on giving due prominence to the right of indigenous peoples to 
self-determination in any work involving the implementation of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>31. In the ensuing discussion, Egypt, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and 
along with Cuba, reaffirmed the view that the Declaration on the Right to Development 
should be the basis against which the criteria and operational sub-criteria should be 
considered, revised and refined, and that there was no legal foundation for the elaboration 
of indicators. The European Union, Switzerland, the United States and Japan underlined 
that the criteria, sub-criteria and indicators elaborated by the task force should form the 
basis for future discussions, which should also involve expert input from relevant United 
Nations bodies and other international organizations, non-governmental and civil society 
organizations, academic and research institutions, and other stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>32. Thereafter, the Chairperson-Rapporteur presented a short summary of the 
submissions received from Governments, groups of Governments, regional groups and </p>


<p>other relevant stakeholders, including United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and 
institutions, as well as other relevant multilateral institutions and forums. She pointed out 
that the submissions varied in their orientation, the extent of specificity and the level of 
detail. There were varied views on how national and international responsibilities were 
reflected in the criteria and operational sub-criteria. Some submissions pointed out that they 
were weighted towards national responsibilities, thereby ignoring the global challenges 
faced by developing countries, whereas others found that the criteria should strike a balance 
between State action at the national level and international cooperation, emphasizing that 
the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of all human rights, including 
the right to development, lay with the State. A few submissions pointed to the need to 
emphasize equality and non-discrimination, as well as to the lack of emphasis on vulnerable 
groups. One submission observed that the right to development could not be realized 
through the meeting of social and economic indicators alone; progress must also be made in 
basic civil and political rights in order to create an environment in which the right to 
development can be properly implemented. Views were also expressed that the attributes, 
criteria and sub-criteria were limited to Millennium Development Goal 8 and lacked 
appropriate human rights language. As to the nature of the expected outcome, the Non-
Aligned Movement aimed at the elaboration of an international instrument on the right to 
development of a legally binding nature. It noted, however that it was open to exploring 
other options to facilitate progress, which may include the development of guidelines. The 
European Union pointed out that the Working Group could develop appropriate 
instruments, such as templates, checklists or voluntary guidelines, as a means of 
implementing and assessing progress in the implementation of the right to development. 
Submissions from United Nations agencies focused primarily on aspects related to their 
particular fields of competence and mandate. In a joint statement, non-governmental 
organizations provided comprehensive remarks and suggestions in relation to the criteria 
and sub-criteria.  
</p>
<p>33. The criteria discussed by the Working Group were as follows: promote constant 
improvement in socioeconomic well-being; maintain stable national and global economic 
and financial systems; adopt national and international policy strategies supportive of the 
right to development; establish an economic regulatory and oversight system to manage 
risk and encourage competition; create an equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-
discriminatory international trading system; promote and ensure access to adequate 
financial resources; promote and ensure access to the benefits of science and technology; 
promote and ensure environmental sustainability and sustainable use of natural resources; 
contribute to an environment of peace and security; implement national development 
strategies and plans of action on the basis of a participatory and transparent process; 
establish a legal framework supportive of sustainable human-centred development; draw on 
relevant international human rights instruments in elaborating development strategies; 
ensure non-discrimination, access to information, participation and effective remedies; 
promote good governance at the international level and effective participation of all 
countries in international decision-making; promote good governance and respect for rule 
of law at the national level; provide for fair access to and sharing of the benefits of 
development; provide fair sharing of the burdens of development; and eradicate social 
injustices through economic and social reforms. Comments and drafting suggestions would 
be included in a conference room paper. 
</p>
<p>34. The representatives of the World Trade Organization and the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development as well as civil society and non-governmental 
organizations took active part in the review of the criteria by providing inputs, comments 
and contributions, which were appreciated by delegates.   </p>


<p><b> IV. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>35. After the adoption of the conclusions and recommendations (paras. 39 to 47 below), 
Egypt (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement) expressed its appreciation that work had 
started on the criteria, and for the positive spirit, despite some difficulties with regard to the 
conclusions and recommendations. It was stressed that extra meeting time was required to 
work on the criteria and operational sub-criteria and to fulfil the mandate provided by the 
Human Rights Council. The speaker recalled Human Rights Council resolution 19/34, in 
which the Council stressed that the criteria and corresponding operational sub-criteria, once 
endorsed, should be used, as appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and 
coherent set of standards for the implementation of the right to development.  
</p>
<p>36. Senegal (on behalf of the African Group) commented on lessons learned during the 
session, which were simple; the persistence of differences during the discussions illustrated, 
unfortunately, the divisive manner in which the right to development was addressed and 
implemented. But the African Group remained confident that with a constructive spirit, the 
differences could be overcome, noting the potential which emanated from the discussions. 
The speaker reiterated four points: the centrality of the Declaration on the Right to 
Development; the international and national dimensions of the implementation of that right; 
the fact that it contained collective and individual rights; and the comprehensive nature of 
such a right comprising civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. He stressed the 
need to bear in mind the billions of people in countries of both the South and the North, 
among the 7 billion comprising humanity, who were awaiting the right to development to 
improve their daily lives. The speaker concluded by stating that it was regrettable that no 
agreement could be reached on the non-substantive proposal to allocate an extra week to 
the Working Group, from its next session, to deal with the currently insufficient time for 
addressing the work on criteria and operational sub-criteria. 
</p>
<p>37. Bangladesh pointed out that while the Non-Aligned Movement had demonstrated 
full sincerity, this was not the same for other countries. There was a need to move the 
process forward and hope that in the future the Working Group would be able to fulfil its 
mandate in a positive spirit. Cuba expressed regret over the conclusions and 
recommendations, which in its view were weak. It called on partners to engage 
constructively in future sessions and noted that Cuba was open to consultations and to 
engage constructively during the next session. China shared the same views as the Non-
Aligned Movement and the African Group, and added that more time was required to fulfil 
the mandate. Pakistan also noted the positive spirit at the Working Group, but also added 
that more time was required to move forward with the work, including during the inter-
sessional period, but unfortunately there was no consensus on that point. Thailand similarly 
added that the Working Group had to be realistic about the time available for the 
consideration of the criteria and that there was a need for genuine dialogue. 
</p>
<p>38. The European Union stated that it would continue to engage actively and 
constructively as it did in the current session in support of progress in the work of the 
Working Group.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations
