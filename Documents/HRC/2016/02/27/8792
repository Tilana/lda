<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a country-by-
country basis, summaries of reliable and credible allegations of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that were brought to the attention of the 
Special Rapporteur, and were transmitted to the Governments concerned. It also contains 
replies from Governments. This addendum does not illustrate the state of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment throughout the world, but rather 
reflects the state of information brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall that in transmitting these allegations to 
Governments, he does not make any judgement concerning the merits of the cases, nor does 
he support the opinion and activities of the persons on behalf of whom he intervenes. The 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is a 
non derogable right, and every human being is legally and morally entitled to protection. 
When the Special Rapporteur receives reliable and credible information that gives grounds 
to fear that a person may be at risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment, he may 
transmit an urgent appeal to the Government concerned. The communications sent by the 
Special Rapporteur have a humanitarian and preventive purpose, and do not require the 
exhaustion of domestic remedies. Governments are requested to clarify the substance of the 
allegations, take steps to protect the person&#8217;s rights, and are urged to investigate the 
allegations and prosecute and impose appropriate sanctions on any persons guilty of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>3. During the period 15 December 2008 to 18 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur 
sent 70 letters of allegations of torture to 38 Governments and 175 urgent appeals to 59 
Governments on behalf of persons who might be at risk of torture or other forms of ill-
treatment. Government responses received up to 31 December 2009 have been included. 
The responses received after that date will be duly reflected in a future communications 
report. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the timely responses received from 
Governments to the letters and urgent appeals transmitted. He regrets that many 
Governments fail to respond, or do so selectively, and that responses to older cases remain 
outstanding in large part. 
</p>
<p>5. Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has been 
obliged to reduce considerably details of communications sent and received, with attention 
given to information relating specifically to allegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment. As a result, requests from Governments to publish 
their replies in their totality could not be acceded to. Moreover, attention is given to 
information in Government replies specifically relating to the allegations, particularly 
information on the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) What steps were taken to ascertain the veracity of the facts alleged? 
</p>
<p>(b) Has a complaint been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victim? 
</p>
<p>(c) The details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the case. 
</p>
<p>(d) Full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken (e.g. penal, 
disciplinary or administrative sanctions imposed on the alleged perpetrator(s)). 
</p>
<p>(e) What compensation and rehabilitation have been provided to the victim or the 
family of the victim?  </p>

<p><b>Alleged detention and deportation of a large 
number of nationals to the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (DRC). 
</b></p>
<p>Since January 2009, collective deportations and 
expulsion of nationals of the DRC have taken 
place, reaching a peak in August 2009. Overall, 
approximately 18,800 DRC nationals have been 
allegedly expelled from Angola; approximately 
16,000 of those since late August 2009.

irregular migrant workers were subjected to ill-
treatment, including gender-based violence, and 
deprived of their belongings. These violations 
were mostly perpetrated by the security force 
and intended to force them to return to the DRC. 
</p>
<p>Whereas most of the DRC nationals were 
expelled from the provinces of Lunda Norte and 
Lunda Sul, expulsions have also reportedly 
occurred in the territories of Soyo and Cabinda 
since early October 2009. Citizens of the DRC 
were detained and kept in very poor conditions 
prior to their expulsion. It appears that the 
administrative detention of asylum seekers is not 
subject to independent monitoring, takes place 
without prior authorization from a judicial body, 
and the detainees are most often denied access to 
legal counsel. In the context of the expulsions, 
many of them were subjected to sexual violence 
at the risk of HIV transmission, body searches 
without minimum hygienic standards and theft.  
</p>
<p>In this respect, we note the initiative to create a 
Commission in late November 2009 to discuss 
this concern with the DRC authorities and the 
issuance on 13 October 2009 of a joint 
communiqu&#233; announcing the concerted 
cessation of expulsions and the political will to 
find sustainable solutions to the issue. In spite of 
these commitments, reports were received that 
expulsions have continued to occur, albeit at a 
lesser scale.<b>

comenzaron a patear y golpearlos con los pu&#241;os 
y con las culatas de sus escopetas por todo el 
cuerpo. Les quitaron todas sus pertenencias de 
valor y sus documentos y los llevaron a

<p>Una vez en la comisar&#237;a de Quimilil, los 
pusieron de rodillas mientras les pisaban los pies 
y los golpeaban con mangueras. Tambi&#233;n los 
hicieron acostarse en el barro mientras llov&#237;a. A 
varios de ellos los sometieron a corrientes 
el&#233;ctricas en las piernas y en los &#243;rganos

de A&#241;atuya, donde tambi&#233;n fueron golpeados 
con una manguera, principalmente en las 
pantorrillas y en los hombros. En todo momento 
los oficiales les indicaron que permanecer&#237;an 
detenidos hasta que confesaran, pero nunca les 
indicaron el motivo de la detenci&#243;n. A los cuatro 
hombres los obligaron a firmar unos documentos 
que nunca pudieron leer.

(A/HRC/10/44/Add.4, para. 6). 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 17/12/08, the Government 
indicated that the incident took place at 11.00 
on 1 January 2008, when a prison transport 
vehicle travelling between Broome Regional 
Prison and Roebourne Regional Prison in 
Western Australia (WA) lost all power and 
broke down approximately 50 kilometers 
south of Bidgydanga. Prisoner transport 
vehicles in WA are owned by the WA 
Department of Corrective Services (WA 
DCS), however, they are operated under 
contract by offiers emplyed by Global 
Solutions Limited (GSL) Court Security and 
Custodial Services. WA DCS records indicate 
that there were in fact 17 prisoners in custody 
on board the prisoner transport vehicle and 
not eight. The maximum capacity for the 
prisoner transport vehicle in question in 19 
prisoners. Both sections of the vehicle (the 
driver&#8217;s cabin and the prisoner transport 
section) are fully air-conditioned, and it was 
only due to the full power loss and 
subsequent breakdown of the vehicle that the 
air-conditioning system ceased to operate. 
Portable toilet facilities are also available in 
this type of vehicle. Upon determining that 
the prisoner transport vehicle could not be

hatches opened to allow for maximum 
possible ventilation to the prisoners. 
</p>
<p>Due to the number of prisoners being 
transported and the fact that the prisoner 
transport vehicle had broken down in an 
insecure area, it presented an unacceptable 
security risk to allow them to exit the vehicle. 
However, the prisoners were continuously 
monitored by the officers and were regularly 
provided with water. Officers from the WA 
Police, stationed at Bidgydanga arrived on the 
scene at approximately 14.00, bringing with 
them additional water supplies for the 
prisoners. At approximately 15.30, a second 
prisoner transport vehicle arrived and the 17 
prisoners in custody were transferred to this 
vehicle and transported back to Broome 
Regional Prison without any incident. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Ward&#8217;s death is deemed a reportable 
death under the Coroner&#8217;s Act of 1996, and 
an inquest will be held by the WA State 
Coroner. The inquest will investigate all 
matters in relation to the quality of 
management, care and supervision of Mr. 
Ward, as well as the circumstances and cause 
of death. As part of the inquest, an 
investigation is conducted by the WA Police, 
which will include the results of the post 
mortem examination and toxicology analysis. 
If the WA State Coroner considers that an 
indictable offence has been committed, it 
shall be reported to the appropriate 
authorities. </p>

<p>5.  Austria 23/07/09 AL TOR <b>Alleged failure by the Austrian Department 
of Public Prosecution to act on the criminal 
complaint filed on 13 June 2008 against 
Chechnya's current president</b>, Ramzan A. 
Kadyrov. On 13 June 2008, a criminal complaint 
against President Ramzan Kadyrov of Chechnya 
was filed at the Office of the Public Prosecution 
in Salzburg (Staatsanwaltschaft Salzburg). The 
complaint was based on reports that President 
Kadyrov would be visiting Salzburg on 14 June 
2008 to watch the football match with Russian 
participation of the UEFA European Football 
Championship. In the criminal complaint, Mr. 
Kadyrov was accused of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment committed in 
contravention of &#167; 64 (1) 6 of the Austrian 
criminal code (Strafgesetzbuch &#8220;StGB&#8221;) and in 
contravention of Articles 1, 4, 5, and 6 of the 
UNCAT, as well as severe coercion according to 
&#167;&#167; 15, 105 and 106 Austrian StGB. The 
complaint contained and referenced numerous 
sources of evidence for the accusations made. 
The main evidence was contained in the 
testimony of Chechnyan citizen, Umar S. 
Israilov. Mr. Israilov, a former rebel fighter in 
Chechnya, who had become a bodyguard of 
President Kadyrov in 2003. He testified that, on 
15 April 2003, he had been kidnapped and then 
detained by persons under Kadyrov&#8217;s command, 
following which he was forced to work in 
President Kadyrov&#8217;s security service (SB). Mr. 
Israilov further testified that, during his 
detention, which lasted until June 2003, he was 
subjected to torture by Mr. Kadyrov personally 
and by persons under his command. He also 
witnessed other detainees being tortured and 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 22 October 2009, the 
Government responded that the Office of the 
Public Prosecution in Salzburg, upon receipt 
of the criminal complaint on 13/14 June 2008 
and according to &#167; 25(1) of the Austrian Code 
of Criminal Procedure (StPO), immediately 
forwarded the criminal complaint of the 
European Center for Constitutional and 
Human Rights against Ramzan Kadyrov to 
the Office of the Public Prosecution in 
Vienna (Staatsanwaltschaft Wien) which had 
local jurisdiction for the complaint as it 
relates to severe coercion (&#167;&#167;15, 105 (1) Z.1, 
106 (1) Z.1 StGB) against Mr. Israilov. 
</p>
<p>Contrary to the description in the allegation 
letter, criminal proceedings against Ramzan 
Kadyrov and others relating to Mr. Israilov 
had already been initiated on 11 June 2008 
(501 St 45/08d) based on a report of the 
Landesamt f&#252;r Verfassungsschutz und 
Terrorismusbek&#228;mpfung Wien of 11 June 
</p><p>2008. The criminal complaint that was 
forwarded by the Office of the Public 
Prosecution in Salzburg was immediately 
included in these proceedings. 
</p>
<p>Following these events, there were no 
indications whatsoever that Ramzan Kadyrov 
entered Austrian territory. Proceedings were 
indeed started against him for alleged 
instigation to severe coercion according to &#167;&#167; 
12, 15, 105 (1), 106 (1) and (3) StGB against 
Mr. Israilov and Muslim Dadaev. However, 
under Austrian law there was no link for 
prosecuting the acts of torture that he 
allegedly committed in Chechnya before </p>

killed by President Kadyrov and his assistants 
during the time of his detention and while being 
part of the security service.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Israilov testified that he had been beaten 
with gun butts and pistol grips and tortured with 
electric wires and a hot metal rod. In the autumn 
of 2004, Mr. Israilov fled Chechnya and entered 
Austria on 7 September 2005 where he was 
officially granted refugee status after the Federal 
Asylum Senate (Unabh&#228;ngiger Bundesasylsenat) 
found that Mr. Israilov&#8217;s testimony about his 
treatment during his captivity in Chechnya was 
credible.  An expert report dated 14 October 
2005 submitted to the Bundesasylamt by a 
medical doctor confirmed that Mr. Israilov&#8217;s 
scars and injuries fit the descriptions of 
mistreatment in his testimony.  
</p>
<p>After Mr. Israilov left Chechnya, his father, Mr. 
Sharpudi E. Israilov, was also kidnapped on 27 
November 2004 and, according to his testimony, 
detained and tortured by President Kadyrov&#8217;s 
security service for 10 months. This was 
apparently done to try to force his son, Mr. 
Israilov, then living in Vienna, to return to 
Chechnya. Mr. Israilov described in his 
testimony that, starting on 31 May 2008, he had 
been contacted repeatedly personally and by 
phone by a man called Artur Kurmakaev who 
later stated that he was sent by President 
Kadyrov to threaten Israilov&#8217;s family so as to 
force him to return to Chechnya, and to put 
pressure on Mr. Israilov to make him withdraw a 
complaint he had filed with the European Court 
of Human Rights. Mr. Israilov&#8217;s father Sharpudi 
Israilov&#8217;s testimony was also included in the 
complaint as further evidence that President 
Kadyrov had personally tortured detainees and 
was responsible for acts of torture committed by 
</p>
<p>Austrian courts as these were acts committed 
by a foreigner in a country other than Austria 
and because - as Kadyrov failed to enter 
Austria - there was also no connection to 
Austria. 
</p>
<p>As regards Mr. Israilov, his representative 
applied to the Landesamt f&#252;r 
Verfassungsschutz und 
Terrorismusbek&#228;mpfung Wien for his 
protection on 11 July 2008. At the time, and 
after consultation with the competent Public 
Prosecutor, no sufficient reasons to grant such 
protection were found. Currently, 
proceedings relating to the killing of Mr. 
Israilov on 13 January 2009 in Vienna are 
being conducted by the Office of the Public 
Prosecution in Vienna. 
</p>
<p>Ramzan Kadyrov is being prosecuted for 
alleged instigation to severe coercion 
according to &#167;&#167; 12, 15, 105 (1), 106 (1) and 
(3) StGB for criminal acts that he allegedly 
committed in Austria. As regards the acts of 
torture that he allegedly committed in 
Chechnya, due to the fact that Ramzan 
Kadyrov did not travel to Austria, no link for 
Austrian jurisdiction according to the relevant 
provisions of the Austrian penal code. 
</p>
<p>As regards Mr. Israilov, the Austrian Code of 
Police Practice (Sicherheitspolizeigesetz; 
SPG) does not provide a legal entitlement for 
police protection upon the request of an 
individual.  Decisive for the question whether 
police protection can be granted is the 
presumption that a dangerous attack is 
imminent. Mr. Israilov had been questioned 
in writing and, despite the questioning of 
additional witnesses and information received </p>

additional reliable sources from governmental 
and non-governmental sources were quoted 
describing President Kadyrov&#8217;s involvement in 
acts of torture in Chechnya .  
</p>
<p>After the complaint was filed on 13 June 2008, it 
was discovered that the Salzburg Office had 
declared itself incompetent in the matter, stating 
that, on 11 June 2008, the &#8220;Landesamt f&#252;r 
Verfassungschutz und Terrorismusbek&#228;mpfung&#8221; 
(LVT) had also filed a complaint against 
President Kadyrov and others for severe 
coercion (&#167;&#167; 15, 105 and 106 StGB) of Mr. 
Israilov with the Office of the Public Prosecutor 
in Vienna. The Office in Salzburg did not 
forward the new complaint to the appropriate 
office in Vienna as it was obliged to do under &#167; 
25 (6) of the Austrian Criminal Procedural Code 
(Strafprozessordnung, StPO).  
</p>
<p>When the attorney tried to file the complaint 
with the prosecution office in Vienna in person 
on 14 June 2008, a public prosecutor, Dr. 
Herrmann, informed her that the Office of the 
Public Prosecution could only accept complaints 
during office hours and not on weekends. She 
was advised to contact the police in an 
emergency case.  Once President Kadyrov had 
left Austria, the attorney was told informally by 
the prosecutor in charge that the issuance of an 
arrest warrant for President Kadyrov had been 
refused on the ground of lack of evidence. 
However, the case is still pending and under 
investigation. In July 2008, Mr. Israilov began to 
fear for his personal security as there were 
indications that he was being monitored. He 
feared that a politically motivated murder was 
planned against him. When an attorney applied 
for protection for him on 8 July 2008, the police 
</p>
<p>from a human rights organization, there were 
no indications that a dangerous attack against 
his life, health or freedom was imminent. 
Based on the knowledge and the risk 
assessment at that time, no protective 
measures were taken by the Landesamt f&#252;r 
Verfassungsschutz und 
Terrorismusbek&#228;mpfung Wien.  Likewise, the 
competent Public Prosecutor did not find any 
reason to commission further measures. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the measures that have been 
taken to ensure that the relevant Austrian 
authorities give effect to its obligations under 
the UNCAT, it is noteworthy that there was 
no Austrian jurisdiction according to &#167; 64 (1) 
Z. 6 StGB, as the UNCAT only provides for 
the obligation of a State Party to the 
Convention to exercise jurisdiction over acts 
of torture if: a) such acts were committed in 
its (extended) territory (territorial principle)  
</p>
<p>or if; b) the suspect (active personality 
principle) or the victim (passive personality 
principle) were citizens of the State Party 
(Art. 5 (1) UNCAT). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In addition, State Parties are obliged to 
exercise their jurisdiction in situations where 
they refuse to extradite a suspect to another 
State Party according to Art. 5 (2) UNCAT, 
which is based on the principle &#8220;aut dedere 
aut iudicare&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>In the present case, the criminal acts were 
committed in Chechnya, neither the suspect 
nor any of the alleged victims were citizens 
of Austria and the suspect, Ramzan Kadyrov, 
was not present in Austria. Therefore, the </p>

</p>
<p>By letter dated 09/01/09, the Government 
indicated that Mr. Alutus Newbold was 
sentenced to receive eight strokes of the rod, 
and not the cat-o-nine tails. He was found 
guilty of burglary for which he was sentenced 
to 16 years, attempted rape for which he was 
sentenced to six years, and causing harm, for 
which he was sentenced to two years. Mr. 
Newbold&#8217;s sentence is to run concurrently, 
therefore, he will serve 16 years. Further, 
under the laws of the Bahamas, the sentences 
of convicted persons may be reduced by one-
third, based on good behaviour. 
</p>
<p>In accordance with the laws of the 
Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Mr. 
Newbold appealed his conviction and 
sentence. However, he abandoned his appeal 
on 28 June 2007. Judgment in Mr. Newbold&#8217;s 
appeal against sentence was delivered on 29 
October 2008. The appeal was dismissed, 
with the Court of Appeal holding that the 
imposition of corporal punishment in the 
Commonwealth of the Bahamas was lawful 
and constitution. The execution of sentence in 
this case was stayed for 21 days to permit the 
filing of any contemplated appeals. No appeal 
or application for a further stay was filed. The 
first installment of the sentence ordered by 
the courts was administered at the expiration 
of the requisite period.

<p>The Government of the Bahamas plans to 
take steps to repeal corporal punishment in 
the next legislative term. </p>

Mahilara and Batazore areas to conduct a 
special operation, when he was informed that 
Mr. Shahin had been involved in a crime. The 
police went to his residence with some 
witnesses and called Mr. Shahin, but there 
was no response. After several minutes, Mr. 
Shahin was seen fleeing his house. He ran 
into a tree and fell unconscious. Two 
constables then applied force to secure his 
arrest. After hearing his shouting, the Sub-
Inspector and other officers, together with 
local people went to the spot of the arrest, 
helped Mr. Shahin escape from the constables 
and took him to Ashukathi (Gournadi)

rejected after a closed hearing on 31 October. 
Following his arrest, Mr Zeltser was kept at a

situation was poor, he was denied food and 
mattress and was deprived of his medication. He 
was also permanently handcuffed, which 
adversely affected blood circulation in his 
hands. In general, the facility was overcrowded 
(4.5 times above official capacity), and access to 
daylight and ventilation was extremely

the request of the US Government, an 
American doctor carried out a medical 
examination. He recommended additional 
painkillers and other medicines which he had 
been taking before his arrest. On 9 
September, he started receiving full supplies 
of all the necessary medicines.

doctors, together with the American doctor 
examined Mr. Zeltser. The doctors concluded 
that his condition was satisfactory and that all

Mr. Zeltser&#8217;s doctor stated that a cure would 
only be possible if he were hospitalized in an

police station behind an internal affairs 
officer who was supposed to assist medical 
workers in transporting a mentally disturbed 
individual. Near the building, he was 
approached by Ms. Polyakova, who stated 
that she had called for an ambulance, as her 
right arm was hurting. She had swelling and

her. Ms. Polyakova left the building and did 
not wait for the ambulance to arrive. As a 
result, she had to be tracked down on the

had already received qualified medical

inappropriately; she began swearing at the 
medical staff and screaming. She refused 
medical assistance and attempted to leave the

asked her to return, calm down and take a

escort her to the bench. In response, Ms.

<p><b>Raids in Beoung Tra Bek</b>, Phnom Penh. 
Recent police roundups took place in Beoung 
Tra Bek, a neighborhood of Phnom Penh, where 
many drug users live. Police beat the drug users 
while arresting them &#8211; sometimes resulting in 
them losing consciousness. In particular, police 
hit anyone trying to run away with their sticks. 
Drug users of Vietnamese origin caught up in 
the raids were reportedly treated worse than 
those of Khmer origin, and were hit or punched 
for being Vietnamese. 
</p>
<p>As a result of the raids, police arrested and 
detained at least 30 persons. With the exception 
of one man, no one has been charged. Drug 
users caught up in the raids were sent to Ogkas 
Kynom centre. 
</p>
<p>Similar raids had taken place in June 2008, 
following which approximately 40 out of 350 
detainees were sent to Koh Kor, situated on an 
island in Kandal Province in southern 
Cambodia. Many others were held in Ogkas 
Kynom, a drug treatment centre on the outskirts 
of Phnom Penh. Drug users detained in the past 
reported experiencing several human rights 
violations, including: Detainees who suffered 
from HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, tuberculosis and 
other illnesses, had no access to appropriate 
treatment; inadequate nutrition in the treatment 
center; detainees were kept in locked cells for 23 
hours and released only 40 minutes a day; 
detainees were beaten regularly with sticks and 
told that the reason for their beating was to 
&#8220;learn not to use drugs and that being an 
injection drug user is disgusting and bad&#8221;; and 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 29/04/09, the Government 
indicated that the competent authorities had 
conducted the drug control operations from 
12 to 17 December 2008, at the outskirts of 
Phnom Penh. These included the operation at 
Phat&#233; village, street 435, Tamnup Teuk 
commune, the operation at the slum area of 
Building on Sothearos Street, Tonl&#233; Bassac 
commune and the operation at Boeung Tra 
Bek, at street 97, Phsa Deum Thakov 
commune, all in Chamcar Mon District, 
Phnom Penh. 
</p>
<p>As a result of the operations, the competent 
authorities arrested 32 young people, most of 
them abandoned and street children who 
became victims of drug addictions. The 
victims were taken into custody and sent to 
the rehabilitation center in order to receive 
medical treatment and re-education without 
any type of abuse. 
</p>
<p>From June to December 2008, the 
Government received the support of two 
organizations that opened their doors to all 
drug addicts. Both centers received a large 
number of drug users and are designed to 
provide not only for the health-care services 
and treatments, but also the opportunity for 
the victims to take additional vocational 
training. For those who were in a serious 
mental and abnormal condition associated 
with their drug addiction, the centers gave 
them special care due to safety reasons. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Gao Zhisheng</b> was taken away from his 
home in Shaanxi Province by more than 10 
security agents on 4 February 2009. He had 
previously been taken into custody on or shortly 
after 19 January 2009 and held incommunicado 
at an unknown location. He is considered to be 
at high risk of torture and other ill-treatment in 
light of the harsh treatment he received while in 
detention in 2006 and 2007. His whereabouts are 
unknown. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Gao Zhisheng had been previously detained 
on 22 September 2007 and held incommunicado 
for six weeks. During this time, he was allegedly 
stripped and beaten by a group of police officers 
in civilian clothes. He was also beaten, given 
electric shocks to his genitals and had cigarettes 
held close to his eyes for several hours, leaving 
him partially blind for a number of days. During 
his detention in 2006, he was reportedly 
handcuffed and forced to sit in an iron chair or 
cross-legged for more than four days at a time, 
in addition to having bright lights shone in his 
eyes. In April 2007, Mr. Gao Zhisheng 
publicized the torture and ill-treatment he had 
suffered while in custody, which led to an 
escalation of harassment of his family.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>By letter dated 01/04/09, the Government 
indicated that on 15 August 2006, Gao 
Zhisheng was placed in criminal detention on 
suspicion of inciting subversion of State 
power, and was arrested by order of the 
procuratorial authorities on 21 September. On 
22 December, the Beijing First Intermediate 
People&#8217;s Court sentenced Mr. Gao to three 
years imprisonment with five years probation, 
and to one year&#8217;s deprivation of his political 
rights. At present he is still in Beijing serving 
his term of probation.  
</p>
<p>While Mr. Gao was in criminal detention in 
2006, the public security authorities never 
tortured him. Since 2007, he has never been 
subjected to any coercive measures or held in 
any covert form of imprisonment by the 
Chinese Government. The Chinese public 
security authorities have never received any 
complaint from Mr. Gao or from anyone else.

while in detention, and he has been unable to 
receive adequate and timely medical treatment. 
He, his family and his lawyer have applied for

arguing that Mr. Jin does not admit his guilt and 
that his illness was not serious enough to qualify

for medical parole according to a 1990 
regulation on medical parole and its attachment 
regarding the scope of qualifying illnesses. Item 
16 of the attachment permits medical parole if a 
prisoner suffers from a serious multi-symptom 
illness after surgery on the abdomen or digestive 
system, such as intestinal adhesion or 
reoccurring symptoms that are not easily 
curable.

his appendix was removed. Since then he has 
developed multiple complications, such as 
persistent, severe abdominal pain, and at least 
ten instances of diarrhea on a daily basis, 
regardless of his diet. After a checkup at the 
prison hospital, the doctor told Mr. Jin Haike 
there was no major problem, and that he was 
merely suffering from frequent bowel 
movement. The prison hospital&#8217;s medical

an &#8220;intestinal adhesion&#8221;. Mr. Jin Haike&#8217;s

enteritis.

hospitalized again in the Beijing Prison Center

diagnosed as suffering from enteritis, intestinal

hospital staff recommended that Jin Haike 
undergo surgery, but told his family that the 
surgery would have only a 30 percent chance of 
success. Mr. Jin&#8217;s father therefore did not agree 
to the procedure. Instead he asked permission 
from the prison to transfer his son to an outside 
hospital for the operation, which was declined.

<p>Ms. Liu claimed that she had previously had 
eye surgery and that she continued to suffer 
from rheumatoid arthritis, coronary heart 
disease, cholecystitis and rachiopathy. The re-
education facility conducted a physical 
examination, the results of which clearly 
indicated that apart from her eye condition, 
she continued to suffer from mild fatty liver 
disease and slight sinus arrhythmia. Given her 
relatively advanced age and poor health 
status, the facility conducted frequent 
physical examinations. When Ms. Liu 
claimed that her head hurt, the police 
immediately took her to the re-education 
facility clinic to have her blood pressure 
taken, whereupon it was discovered that her 
blood pressure appeared to have gone up. The 
labour re-education facility immediately 
treated her with medication, and her illness 
stabilized. On 17 July, the re-education 
facility police took her to the Harbin No. 2 
Hospital for an examination, where a 
physician diagnosed her as having 
&#8220;diminished vision in the right eye, requiring 
surgery&#8221;. On 17 September, at her request, 
Ms. Liu was taken to the First Affiliated 
Hospital of Harbin Medical University for 
further examinations. The doctor 
recommended that she have glasses fitted, but 
she refused and asked to have cataract 
surgery and a further keratectomy at the 
hospital. According to the doctor, she did not 
require any surgical correction at present.

indicated that Wang Guilan, female, born on 
20 May 1961, a native of Hubei Province, is a 
laid-off employee of the Wuyang Shopping

<p>In mid-March 2008, a group gathered 
illegally to create a disturbance. When police 
officers arrived to dissuade them, they 
clashed and violently attacked the officers 
with clubs, rocks and knives. At 
approximately 11.00 a.m. on 14 March, some 
monks at the Ramoche Temple threw stones 
at the police officers on duty. Subsequently, a 
group of rioters began to gather in Barkhor 
Street, shouting separatist slogans and 
wantonly beating, smashing and looting. The 
situation quickly spread. It resulted in the 
slashing or burning to death of 18 innocent 
persons; 382 persons were injured, 58 of 
them seriously. The rioters also set fire to 300 
sites, burning down seven schools, five 
hospitals, 120 homes and more than 1,300

During these incidents, law enforcement was 
carried out in a civilized manner by the local 
police, who consistently displayed a high 
degree of restraint. Scores of police officers 
were injured and no lethal or injurious 
weapons were used. The Chinese People&#8217;s 
Liberation Army did not take part in the 
response to these incidents. 
</p>
<p>On 16 March, rioters broke into the Aba 
Township police station and stabbed the 
police officers. When the rioters stole police 
firearms, the police fired warning shots, in 
accordance with the law, to no effect. They 
were thus compelled to open fire in self-
defence, striking and injuring four rioters, 
who managed to escape. The firing of 
weapons was fully consistent with the Basic 
Principles on the use of Force and Firearms 
by Law Enforcement Officials.

<p>China&#8217;s Criminal Procedure law stipulates 
that all citizens who are members of ethnic

indicated that Yang Chunlin (also known as 
Wei Houren), male, born on 29 July 1956, is 
a farmer from Jiamusi, Heilongjiang 
Province. From June 2006 to 2007 he posted 
dozens of articles on the Internet in which he 
claimed that incitement of subversion of State 
power could not be stopped. Such articles 
used rumours and libel, inter alia, to incite 
subversion of the political authority and 
fundamental political system of the State. On 
7 July 2007, the Jiamusi public security 
authorities placed Yang in criminal detention 
on suspicion of the crime of inciting 
subversion of State power. On 13 August he

</p>
<p>On 8 October 2007, Yang&#8217;s case was 
transferred to the Jiamusi People&#8217;s 
Procuratorate for review and prosecution. 
After accepting the case, the Jiamusi 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court sent Yang a copy 
of his indictment on 9 January 2008. On 19 
February 2008, the court conducted the trial 
in an open courtroom. During this period 
Yang was given ample time to prepare his 
defence. Throughout the trial the court fully 
respected Yang&#8217;s procedural rights; his two 
designated defence attorneys submitted a full 
defence on his behalf. Yang frankly 
confessed to the charges contained in the 
indictment and did not wear handcuffs or leg-
irons. During the trial, the court 
acknowledged that the prosecution authorities 
had charged Yang with colluding with others 
in forging farmers&#8217; signatures. However, 
while one of his Internet articles posed a 
definite harm to society, it was not in itself 
sufficient to convict him of a crime. The other 
45 articles posted by Yang on the Internet 
were sufficient to constitute the crime of 
inciting subversion of State power; the facts 
of the case were clear, the evidence was 
conclusive and punishment was mandated by 
law. On 24 March 2008, the Jiamusi 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court issued its verdict 
and publicly delivered its sentence, finding 
Yang guilty and sentenced him to five years&#8217; 
imprisonment and two years&#8217; deprivation of 
his political rights. Yang did not accept this 
verdict. The case is now being appealed 
before the Heilongjiang Province Supreme 
People&#8217;s Court. </p>

with electric batons while in the courtroom is 
something that could not have occurred. 
Inquiries have revealed that during the trial 
Yang did not seek to converse with family 
members and that the court did not take any

Yang was in detention, China&#8217;s law 
enforcement authorities safeguarded all of his

April 2008, she was taken to the public 
security bureau for questioning by Xining 
police officers, who first showed her their 
badges, in response to accusations that she 
was suspected of having committed a 
criminal offence. The public security 
authorities questioned Mrs. Jamyang further 
and conducted a search of her home, seizing 
certain items, including her computer. On 3 
April, the public security authorities placed 
her in criminal detention and held her in the 
Xining municipal detention facility. On 20 
April, the Xining police, taking into 
consideration the serious illness of her father 
and the young age of her child, modified the 
coercive measures taken in respect of her and 
released her on bail on humanitarian grounds.

indicated that Qi Chonghuai and He Yanjie, 
whose pen name is Yanhe, were arrested on 2 
August 2007. The People&#8217;s Procuratorate of 
Tengzhou, Shandong Province, brought 
proceedings against Qi and He on charges of 
having passed themselves off as writers and 
conducting interviews at a dozen or so 
administrative units in Tenghzhou and 
Zhucheng, county-level cities in Shandong 
Province. They then used articles which 
reported negatively about the aforementioned 
administrative units in order to make threats 
and extort large sums of money. Qi and He 
were also charged with fraud. Qi was 
sentenced to four years imprisonment and He 
was given a two-year sentence. Following the 
sentencing, Qi lodged an appeal. The case 
was tried in an open courtroom, and during 
the trial, appointed defence attorneys also 
made a full submission in their defence. 
During the trial Qi applied to communicate 
with his wife. The presiding judge did not 
permit this but informed Qi that following the 
trial, he could apply to see his relatives. After 
the trial, Qi made no such application. There 
were no instances of the court police beating 
the defendant during the trial. From the time 
they were placed under restraining measures 
by the procuratorial authorities, Qi and He 
were detained and looked after in the 
detention facility in accordance with the law. 
They were not beaten, threatened or subjected 
to any other form of ill-treatment by prison 
staff. Neither defendant raised any such 
issues in court.

she was sentenced by the Yangpu District 
People&#8217;s Court to a term of imprisonment of 
two years and six months for willful

admission to the prison indicated that she 
suffered from hypertension but that otherwise 
her health was normal. She was ordered to 
follow the medical treatment prescribed by 
the doctor and given an appointment for a 
subsequent exam. On 3 June she entered the 
infirmary with a stomach ache, diarrhea and 
an elevated white blood cell count. She was 
treated and a follow-up exam on 11 June 
revealed no symptoms of any kind, so the 
treatment was stopped.

Mr. Imangaliev and his family subsequently fled 
from Kazakhstan and founded a human rights 
organization in Prague, where demonstrations 
have repeatedly been organized to protest 
against the violations of freedom of religion or 
belief by Kazakh authorities, which may lead to 
reprisals by the latter, in case he is returned to 
Kazakhstan.  
</p>
<p>It appears that a large number of asylum seekers 
from Kazakhstan (222 persons, of who 54 
minors born in emigration) are currently at risk 
of involuntary return to Kazakhstan. All of them 
claim to have been persecuted by Kazakhstani 
authorities on the basis of their beliefs, which 
have been labeled as &#8220;extremism&#8221;.

<p><b>Mr. Shakhzod Maksudov</b>, aged 30, citizen of 
Uzbekistan, currently held at Vazebni Veznice 
in Prague. Mr. Maksudov was arrested on 21 
October 2008 without any explanation and taken 
to the main police criminal investigation 
department in Prague. There he was severely 
beaten and called &#8220;dirty and black foreigner&#8221;. In 
the process, he was stripped of his clothes. As a 
result of the beatings, he kneeled down and 
begged the police to tell him why he had been 
arrested, to inform his consular authorities and 
to allow him access to a lawyer, to no avail. 
Rather, the officers continued to beat him and 
forced him to sign some papers, which he did, 
despite the fact that everything was written in 
Czech, of which he has limited knowledge. As a 
result his head was bleeding and he felt the taste 
of blood in his mouth. The treatment continued 
on 22 October, when he received even stronger 
blows and his hands were handcuffed to a tube. 
The handcuffs were so tight he could not feel 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 1/10/09, the Government 
indicated that the first complaint against the 
police was received by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs from the Embassy of 
Uzbekistan in Austria, dated 27/03/09, 
pursuant to the demand of Mr. Shakhzod 
Maksudov&#8217;s parents asking for help against 
the arbitrary detention of their son. The Inner 
Control Section at the Regional Police 
Directorate in Prague investigated this 
complaint. The result was that no violation of 
the law or service instruction had occurred 
during the actions performed by the police. 
The report of the investigation was sent to the 
attention of the International Relations 
Section at the Ministry of Internal Affairs on 
27 May 2009. 
</p>
<p>A second complaint was received from Mr. 
Maksudov on 19 May 2009, regarding his 
dissent with the official action of four 
unnamed police officers who reportedly beat </p>

</p>
<p>It subsequently turned out that he and his brother 
were accused of having committed a murder. 
The brother was held in the neighbouring room, 
and Mr. Shakhzod Maksudov could hear him 
beg for help. When he reiterated his request for a 
lawyer and an interpreter, one of the police 
officers took out a rifle and put it to his head, 
threatening to kill him. The policemen also 
allegedly indicated that foreigners were 
considered &#8220;shit and litter&#8221;, so nobody would 
believe them, in case they decided to file any 
complaints.  
</p>
<p>Once he had made a confession, he was finally 
led to an office, where a defence lawyer was 
present. He said that he had nothing to do with 
the crime, but nobody listened to him. 
</p>
<p>and kicked him, served him no food or drink 
and refused his request to call a lawyer on 21 
and 22 October 2008. During the 
investigation of this complaint, two other 
complaints were received by the Regional 
Police Directorate of Prague on 30 July 2009. 
The first was addressed by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and the second by the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. The content was 
nearly the same as in the complaint from 19 
May. The result of the common investigation 
was that no police officer had treated the 
accused in a manner that was in violation of 
law or service instructions and that no 
reduction of the rights of the accused had 
occurred. Mr. Maksudov was not subjected to 
physical cruelty, verbal assaults, threats or 
other similar acts. In addition, he was 
regularly served meals and drinks. On 17 
December 2008, the Municipal Court in 
Prague did not find any violation of the law in 
the actions performed by the police. No other 
complaint has been submitted during the 
criminal proceedings. 
</p>
<p>There was a justified suspicion that Mr. 
Maksudov and others had participated in a 
murder. The state attorney of the 
Metropolitan prosecuting Attorney&#8217;s Office 
in Prague then approved their detention. On 
21 October, Mr. Maksudov was detained in 
the parking of the Imperial Hotel in Prague, 
where he had been employed. In the course of 
his detention, holds and grasps were used, in 
accordance with Police Act No. 283/1991. He 
was also handcuffed due to his active 
resistance. Three other persons were also 
arrested.

to the detention cell in the Regional Police

</p>
<p>On 22 October, the criminal prosecution 
began. The resolution to commence 
prosecution was handed over to Mr. 
Maksudov in the presence of his appointed 
counsel. His interrogation was then 
conducted in the presence of his defending 
counsels and an interpreter. 
</p>
<p>On 24 October, through the resolution of the 
District Court Judge, Mr. Maksudov was 
remanded in custody, and he was transferred 
to Remand Prison Pankrac, where he is 
currently detained.

believed that her arrest might have been carried 
out in connection with a trip to Europe in 
November 2008 during which she discussed the 
terms of her previous release from prison. 
Ethiopian government media reported that she 
had denied apologizing for the crimes she had 
allegedly committed and that she was given 
three days to revoke her statement. Shortly 
afterwards, the Pardons Board decided to recant 
her pardon and to re-impose her original life 
sentence passed in 2007.  
</p>
<p>Ms. Mideksa, together with thousands of 
individuals including opposition 
parliamentarians, opposition party leaders, 
journalists and human rights defenders, had been 
arrested in 2005 following demonstrations 
against the results of elections held in May 
</p><p>2005. In 2006, Ms. Mideksa was charged with 
treason, tried and sentenced to life 
imprisonment. The majority of those found 
guilty were released in 2007 following pardons 
after they had negotiated an agreement with the 
Government and signed letters of apology. 
However the exact terms and conditions of 
pardon remain unclear. Since her arrest Ms. 
Mideksa has reportedly been allowed one visit 
from her close family but has not been granted 
access to legal counsel or medical treatment. She 
has refused food to protest against her arrest and 
detention.

He sustained injuries to his leg as a result of the

<p>Government was carried out in accordance 
with the law in force on the subject. She was 
arrested and detained also in accordance with 
the law, with due regard to her rights under 
the Constitution and international human 
rights instruments. Her case was tried in fair 
proceedings before an independent and 
impartial court. She was convicted of crimes 
against the constitutional order and sentenced 
to life imprisonment. She was not subjected 
to special treatment, nor was she denied her 
right to be visited by her family. Federal 
Prison Administration reported that since her 
detention, she has maintained contact with 
her family, in particular with her mother, 
daughter and sister on Saturdays and 
Sundays. The Government is unaware of Ms. 
Mideksa&#8217;s refusal of food to protect against 
her detention. In contrast, her family is 
providing her with daily meals. Ms. Mideksa 
is also in contact with her lawyer. She is

the former Coalition for Unity and 
Democracy (CUD) party were granted 
conditional pardon by the President on 19 
July 2007, after submitting a signed written 
petition. Ms. Mideksa misrepresented the 
circumstances of the pardon on several 
occasions, by making an open statement to 
her supporters saying &#8220;she did not make any 
plea for pardon&#8221;, and rather that the pardon 
had been granted solely through the

Mideksa could have made an honest mistake, 
the Federal Police talked to Mr. Mideksa on 
more than one occasion about her statement. 
After she made it clear that she had made no 
request for pardon, the Federal Police asked 
her to officially rectify her statement within 
three days, failing which appropriate legal 
action would be taken to revoke her pardon. 
On the basis of the Pardon Proclamation, the 
Federal Police, having observed Ms. 
Mideksa&#8217;s final statements of refusal to 
rectify her misrepresentation, requested the 
Board of Pardon for revocation. Due to the 
conditional nature of the pardon, the penalty 
of life imprisonment imposed by the Federal

decision was taken to deport 67 Pakistani 
nationals. The decision was taken after 
extensive consultations during which no well-
founded evidence was discovered that could 
suggest any systematic persecution of these 
Pakistani nationals in Pakistan. Neither the 
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan nor 
any major internationally-recognized human 
rights organisations had drawn attention to 
any systematic persecution of Mehdi 
Foundation International of Pakistan. As per 
existing bilateral Protocol on Consular 
Access signed between India and Pakistan, 
consular access was provided to these 67 
Pakistani nationals during which the Pakistani 
High Commission in Delhi confirmed their 
nationalities and provided them with travel 
documents. 
</p>
<p>Even though the necessary arrangements had 
been made to release and repatriate these 
Pakistani nationals on 18 November 2008, 
they could not be repatriated due to a stay 
granted by the Honourable High Court of 
Delhi on their deportation. The matter is sub 
judice.

peaceful, violent clashes with security forces 
have ensued, resulting in the death of at least 
twelve people. Agents of the Revolutionary

were fired at opposition supporters who had

erupted after a group at the protest reportedly 
attempted to attack a military location in western 
Tehran.  Reports claim that Basij militiamen, 
linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard, may have 
been responsible for the shooting which resulted 
in the death of seven protesters.

filmed protesters attacking Basij neighbourhood

BBC&#8217;s Channel 4 News in the UK, apparently 
did not show the full contents of Mr. Bahari&#8217;s

</b></p>
<p>By letter dated 06/05/09, the Government 
indicated that Mr. Behrouz Safari and his 
wife Mrs. Leila Heydari traveled to Turkey as 
tourists and participated in training sessions. 
According to the confirmed information, the 
agenda of the courses included the overthrow 
of the system/government, through the abuse 
of civil and social rights. Mr. Behrouz Safari 
and his wife, together with seven other 
individuals took an oath to implement what 
they had learned in the course. Following 
their return to the country, Mr. Safari was 
arrested on 19 June 2007 and Mrs. Heydari 
on 27 August 2007. Following the relevant 
investigations, they were bailed out on 2 
March 2008 and their case, together with the 
bill of indictment, was sent to branch 15 of 
the Tehran Penal Court. The Court met on 8 
June 2008, in the presence of their defence 
lawyers, and convicted them to one year 
suspended imprisonment. Upon the complaint 
of the defence, the case was raised in branch 
36 of the Court of Appeal, and reinstated 
through verdict No. 1257 of 28 October 2008. 
</p>
<p>The two individuals were arrested in relation 
to their illegal activities and were treated in 
accordance with the law. They enjoyed all 
their legal rights before the court. Any 
allegation of maltreatment or lack of proper 
attention to his physical and psychological 
integrity, as well as any other allegation such 
as &#8220;torture to obtain confession&#8221; or arrested in 
relation with their peaceful activities in 
defence of human rights are baseless. 
</p>
<p>The Constitution provides for the punishment 
of those who commit acts of mistreatment 
and torture. Legal provisions have also been 
made for the legal protection of the victims. </p>

Article 38 of the Constitution states that &#8220;all 
forms of torture for the purpose of extracting 
a confession or acquiring information are 
forbidden&#8221;. Compulsion of individuals to 
testify, confess or to take an oath is not

<p>By letter dated 08/04/09, the Government 
indicated that it has prescribed the very heavy 
punishment of Hadde Rajm (stoning) for 
married and unmarried individuals in order to 
safeguard the security and morality of the 
society, particularly the fundamental 
institution of the family, and to secure the 
cleanliness and purity of the generation. Islam 
has defined highly difficult conditions, 
requirements and methods for proving 
perpetration of this group of offences. All 
those required accuracies and attention as 
well as the difficulties for proving the 
commission of these offences is meant to 
minimize the rate of oversight and error. 
Furthermore, this type of offences could be 
investigated or brought to trial. 
</p>
<p>Proving the commission of offences 
deserving stoning is extremely difficult. The 
introduction of a mechanism for the 
prevention and discontinuation of such 
offences is the main objective of Islamic 
laws. In practical terms, the rate of family 
disloyalty in Muslim societies is considerably 
lower than in western unreligious countries. 
In view of the Islamic jurisprudence, the 
punishment of stoning, in its nature and 
enforcement is substantially different from </p>

student, was arrested on the basis of an arrest 
warrant issued by the judicial authorities on 
15 December 2007, on charges of cooperating 
with a left-wing extremist terrorist 
organization. Despite his extremist tendencies 
and in view of the policy of the Government 
on clemency and patience with students, as 
well as the completion of the required 
investigation, he was released on bail on 10 
March 2008. According to existing 
information, he left the country and is 
believed to be in Turkey. Any allegation on

arrested on 21 February 2008, under the 
charge of extremist incitement to ethnic 
feelings and sentiments, organizing illegal 
gatherings, as well as ethnic propagation 
against other Iranian ethnic groups. 
Following the investigations, he was released 
on bail. On 14 May 2008, the penal court of

of the Islamic Penal Code, the remainder of 
his sentence was suspended.

<p>Mr. Daghestani was treated in accordance 
with the law, enjoying the highest level of 
affection as well as all of his legal rights 
before the court. The charges presented 
against him had no connection with any

was heard and settled in the shortest possible

<p>By letter dated 15/07/09, the Government 
indicated that Mr. Behnood Shojaie was put 
on trial on the charge of murder, pursuant to a 
complaint filed before a court by the victim&#8217;s 
guardians. Following the investigations and 
judicial proceeding, the trial took place in the 
presence of five defence lawyers. The court 
found him guilty of murder and sentenced 
him to qesas. Pursuant to an appeal by the 
defendant, the Supreme Court reviewed the 
case and upheld the lower court&#8217;s ruling. 
</p>
<p>The victim&#8217;s guardians have insisted on 
enforcing the court&#8217;s verdict, and the 
judiciary has been trying to bring the case to 
conciliation and refraining from enforcing the 
ruling. The utmost efforts are being made by 
the Judiciary to acquire the victim&#8217;s 
guardian&#8217;s consent to convert qesas to money. 
It is also resorting to whatever legitimate and 
legal instrument is available to settle the case 
and to prevent qesas for similar cases.

<p>On 28 and 29 July, hundreds of Iraqi army 
soldiers and police officers conducted an 
operation in Camp Ashraf with the goal of 
establishing a police station within the camp. 
Humvees and bulldozers were used to destroy 
fences and walls surrounding the camp. It is 
reported that the Iraqi armed forces also 
recklessly drove at high speeds through gathered 
crowds, running over some of the individuals. 
When the Iraqi security forces tried to enter the 
camp, they clashed with hundreds of unarmed 
residents who had formed a human chain. They 
subsequently clashed with camp residents within 
the camp. The Iraqi security forces made use of 
different means in order to disperse the crowd 
including water canons, batons, metal rods, 
cricket bats, chains, sickles, axes, teargas and 
sound grenades. It is reported that the Iraqi 
security forces also made use of firearms against 
the camp residents and that the shooting was 
targeted.

recommended that Mrs. I. and her daughters 
not be declared eligible for refugee status. It 
was determined that State protection against 
FGM is available in Nigeria and that it was 
open to Mrs. I. and her daughters to relocate 
internally.  
</p>
<p>Mrs. I. and her daughters appealed this 
finding and on 22 June 2005, the Refugee 
Appeals Tribunal affirmed the 
recommendation of ORAC. The applicants 
did not seek to have these decisions judicially 
reviewed, despite having full legal 
representation. Thus the decision that they do 
not have refugee status has never been 
questioned by Mrs. I. and her daughters.  
</p>
<p>On 13 Spetember 2005, the Department of 
Justice Equality and Law Reform wrote to 
Mrs. I. and her daughters, informing them 
that the Minister proposed making 
Deportation Orders for them and afforded 
Mrs. I. and her daughters several options, one 
of which was to make written representations 
within 15 days for temporary leave to remain

On 13 and 18 January 2006, applications 
were made to the High Court for an extension 
of time to institute proceedings and leave to 
bring Judicial Review Proceedings against the 
Deportation Orders. On 23 January 2006, the 
Minister issued an order not to deport Mrs. I. 
pending the determination of the judicial 
review proceedings challenging the 
deportation orders, and granted her 
conditional release from detention. 
</p>
<p>The High Court granted leave by way of 
judicial review on 12 December 2006 and 
made an order extending the time for bringing 
the proceedings challenging the Deportation 
Orders. On 30 January 2008, the High Court 
refused Mrs. I. and her daughters&#8217; application 
for judicial review. 
</p>
<p>An application for a certificate for leave to 
appeal this judgement was made on 6 March 
</p><p>2008. By judgment dated 13 March 2008, the 
High Court determined that there was no 
point of law of exceptional public importance 
and that it was not desirable in the public 
interest for Mrs. I. and her daughters to be 
allowed to appeal the case to the Supreme 
Court. 
</p>
<p>On 4 March 2008, Mrs. I. and her daughters 
applied to the Minister to exercise his 
discretion to allow them to apply for 
subsidiary protection under the Regulations. 
As persons in respect of whom deportation 
orders were signed before the coming into 
force of the Regulations on 10 October 2006, 
Mrs. I. and her daughters were not 
automatically entitled to apply for subsidiary 
protection. However, the Minister may

identified new facts or circumstances which 
demonstrate a change of position from that 
which pertained at the time the deportation 
order was made. On 19 March 2008, the 
Minister refused to exercise his discretion in 
this regard. Following this refusal, Mrs. I. and 
her daughters&#8217; solicitor sought an undertaking 
from the Department for a period of 14 days 
so that they would not be deported and to 
allow adequate time to seek their Counsel&#8217;s 
advice in light of the holiday period, which 
the Department refused. 
</p>
<p>On 20 March, the High Court granted Mrs. I. 
and her daughters leave to judicially review 
certain aspects of the refusal of the Minister. 
The Court also granted an injunction pending 
trial. The Minister subsequently sought an 
adjournment to add this case to a series of 
subsidiary protection test cases raising similar 
issues. Mrs. I. and her daughters objected as 
they wished the case to be heard separately. 
</p>
<p>On 14 October 2008, the High Court 
delivered its judgment in separate 
proceedings and upheld the judgment. On 18 
November, the High Court refused an 
application on behalf of Mrs. I. and her 
daughters for an order continuing the 
injunction restraining their deportation. They 
also lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court, 
which has not yet been listed for hearing.

On 11 February, the ECHR formally

requesting observations on admissibility and 
merits by 22 April 2009. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the measures and safeguards 
taken to ensure the protection of Mrs. I. and 
her daughters&#8217; rights should they be deported, 
it is worth noting that asylum has been 
granted in certain cases where FGM was one 
of the issues and lack of state protection, 
together with a lack of an internal flight 
alternative is confirmed by country of origin 
information. In this case, following an 
extensive consideration of country of origin 
information, as well as a consideration of the 
specific circumstances of Mrs. I. and her 
daughters, it was determined that state 
protection is available in Nigeria. Mrs. I. and 
her daughters did not seek to avail of state 
protection, and nothing prevents them from 
internally relocating in Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>Further, it is still open for Mrs. I. and her 
daughters to make an application pursuant to 
the Refugee Act to be re-admitted to the 
Asylum process or an application to have the 
Deportation Order revoked. This may be 
granted where there is a realistic prospect that  
favourable view could be taken of the new 
asylum claim or where new facts arise or 
there is a change of circumstances since the 
time that the deportation order was made 
which may give rise to a risk of refoulement.

that they do not have any knowledge about 
the reason behind the litigation acts of the

</p>
<p>In the Japanese criminal proceedings, the 
appeal to a higher court is broadly applicable 
to conviction and sentencing under a three-
tiered judicial system. The defence counsel, 
who is appointed in all death penalty cases, is 
also given the right to appeal. Moreover, 
appeals to a higher court have been filed in 
many cases where a death penalty sentence is 
issued. Therefore, the Government does not 
consider it necessary to establish a mandatory 
review system. 
</p>
<p>When an execution is issued, the 
circumstances are thoroughly examined in the 
request of retrial and appeal for pardon, 
paying due regard to the gravity of the 
penalty. However, it would be impossible to 
execute the death penalty if the inmate 
sentenced to death repeats retrial requests. No 
appropriate criminal proceedings would be 
achieved in such a scenario. Thus, the 
Government of Japan believes that it would 
be inappropriate not to issue an order to an 
inmate sentenced to death while the 
procedure of request of retrial or appeal is 
pending. 
</p>
<p>An inmate sentenced to death is notified of 
their execution on the day it is due to take

concern that they could become emotionally

his ears, feet, kidneys, and stomach. The 
beatings and attempted suffocation continued on 
the following days with the aim of obtaining a

from kidney problems, hypostasis and multiple

which took place in Nookat on 1 October 
2008.

<p>On 1 October 2008, the population of Nookat 
planned to hold an event dedicated to the Orozo 
Ait religious feast (Yid al Fitr) in the Central 
Park, which is an official holiday in Kyrgyzstan. 
On 27 September, the celebration was banned, 
but the akim of Nookat Rayon (head of 
administration) gave permission to celebrate the 
holiday at the local stadium. When people 
started to arrive at the stadium, they realized that 
the police had cordoned it off, and no 
explanation was given by the authorities. The 
people went to the headquarters of the Nookat 
Rayon administration, where the akim came out 
and urged those gathered to disperse, threatening 
to resort to legal measures if they did not leave

within 30 minutes. During this time, several 
people came out of the administration building 
covered with blood, allegedly as a result of 
having been beaten by the authorities. The 
people outside became increasingly upset and 
launched an open confrontation as the police 
started to disperse them with batons. The police 
then used tear gas (cheremukha) and light-and-
sound grenades (plamya). On 8 October, 32 
people were detained and taken to the Nookat 
Police Department for their involvement in the 
events. 
</p>
<p>During the initial detention period, the 
detainees&#8217; families were asked by law-
enforcement officials to pay for the release of 
their relatives. According to the allegations, the 
property of some of the detainees was 
expropriated for such purposes. However, the 
families of the detainees were not able to see 
them during the investigative phase, and only 
saw them at the trial.  
</p>
<p>The detainees were reportedly subjected to 
torture at the moment of detention, during their 
transfers, at the pre-trial facilities o the State 
Committee of National Security and at the pre-
trial facility No. 5 of the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Zaripa Karataevna Adbikarimova, who was 
pregnant at the time, was arrested at her home 
on 8 October. The police officers informed that 
she had to sign some papers and promised to 
take her back. She took her two-year-old son 
with her. Upon arrival at the Nookat Police 
Department, a police officer named Zhanysh 
pushed her and started to beat her in front of her 
child. He began to cry and was pushed out into 
the street. The police later called his 
grandmother so that she could pick him up. Ms. </p>

Abdikarimova was also beaten on her legs with 
clubs. On the same day, she was taken to the 
Office of the Prosecutor of Osh and to the 
Department of the State Committee of State 
Security of Osh and Osh oblast. She was later 
transferred to the pre-trial prison of the State 
Committee of State Security, where she 
remained for more than six weeks. There, she 
met her lawyer, whom she only saw on one 
further occasion during the investigation. 
</p>
<p>In the investigation room at the State Committee 
of State Security, Ms. Abdikarimova was forced 
to hold a coat rack in her hands. When her hands 
grew numb and she dropped it, she was heavily 
beaten. She was then forced to dance with Mr. 
Holmohammat Ergashev, one of the detainees, 
whose face was covered with blood. The 
authorities poured boiling water on his forehead, 
but he did not react, as he was almost 
unconscious. After she refused to dance with 
Mr. Ergashev, she was beaten. She was then 
asked to remove her clothes and have sex with 
him. In order to avoid this, she signed all the 
documents the authorities asked her to sign.  
</p>
<p>That same evening, an investigator named 
Talant called her to the investigation room. He 
asked her to kiss him, and when she refused, he 
started to harass her. During the trial, Ms. 
Abdikarimova stated to the court that she had 
been subjected to sexual violence, but her 
statements were ignored. The next day, the 
authorities put a gas mask on her head and let 
cigarette smoke into the hose. They then 
threatened to put her on an electric chair and 
beat her on her feet. The following day, her head 
was shaven and she was forced to stand for 
many hours. After that, she was placed in a cell 
with chlorinated water. Ms. Abdikarimova </p>

She received medical assistance, but after the 
doctor recommended that she stay in bed, she 
was taken to a cell where she was forced to stay 
naked ankle-deep in chlorinated water. She was 
also offered to drink urine and was forced to 
remove her head scarf and sing the Kyrgyz 
anthem. 
</p>
<p>Two minors, who had also been detained, were 
tortured for the purpose of obtaining 
confessions. They were beaten and kicked on the 
genitals. One of the minors was forced to sit 
naked in a metal tub with cold water, while one 
end of an electric wire was placed in the water 
and the other was put in his hand and turned on. 
They also poured boiling water on his neck and 
beat him with a rifle butt. When the minors 
shouted or cried, they were gagged by the 
investigators. In addition, they were kept in 
incommunicado detention for several days, 
without access to their families or to a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>Other detainees were also subjected to the 
following: beatings with batons on their feet and 
hands on their ears; suspension with their hands 
behind their back while they were beaten across 
their bodies; dousing with cold and boiling 
water; having plastic bags on their head; having 
their beards torn or burnt with a lighter; placed 
naked in a cold concrete room, where the floor 
was covered with chlorinated water for three 
days; prohibited from using the toilet; having 
their fingernails torn; having vodka poured 
down their throat; and having to war a gas mask 
before or after doing exercises, where cigarette 
smoke was sometimes filtered in. In addition, 
some of the detainees were forced to stand in the 
&#8220;Afghani position&#8221;, whereby they had to stand 
with half-bent legs on tiptoes, with their hands </p>

severely beaten. Other detainees were taken to 
the &#8220;special room&#8221; in the Osh Department of the 
State Committee of National Security, where 
they were placed facedown in a metallic trestle 
bed. They were then handcuffed and beaten 
across their bodies. Detainees would also be 
forced to sit in a metal chair, their hands tied to 
the armrest, a metallic wire on their heads, while 
they were threatened with its imminent 
application. 
</p>
<p>The trial was conducted by Nookat district court 
in Osh and not in Nookat City, which is 10 
hours away by car. The trial started on 21 
November. In addition, the process was 
postponed for several days and later resumed 
with very short notice. This limited the defense 
in terms of financial and logistical arrangements, 
as well as in trying to ensure the presence of 
witnesses and the collection of evidence. 
International organizations, human rights 
representatives and journalists were not allowed 
to sit in the court&#8217;s sessions. The verdict was 
issued on 27 November and they were all 
convicted. The appeal process began on 17 
January, and the verdict was only modified in 
the case of a minor. It is alleged that there was 
not a thorough consideration of the complaints 
and circumstances of the case during the 
process. 
</p>
<p>The case was appealed, and the Supreme Court 
issued its decision on the case on 29 May, 
whereby more than 10 sentences were reduced 
by a maximum of five years, two minors had 
their sentences reduced from 20 to five years, 
two women had their sentences reduced from 16 
to seven years, and two charges were dropped. </p>

However, there were certain irregularities in the 
process before the Supreme Court. The 
defendants were not allowed to participate in the 
hearing, which according to the information 
received, is the practice in Kyrgyzstan. In 
addition, the evidence and confessions allegedly 
obtained under torture and ill-treatment were 
used in Court. Finally, despite the fact that all of 
the evidence had been destroyed following the 
hearing at the second instance, the prosecution 
based its case on this evidence at the Supreme

approximately 3:30 p.m., Mr. M. G. 
Kuleshov held an unauthorized meeting on 
the southwestern side of the Kyrgyz 
Republic&#8217;s Government House. Ten minutes 
after, he was detained by officers from the

133). 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 08/09/08, the Government 
informed that on 21 January 2008, the Office 
of the Procurator-General of Kyrgyzstan 
received a request from the Office of the 
Procurator-General of Uzbekistan for the 
extradition of Mr. Erkin Tursinpulotovich 
Kholikov to face criminal charges for 
terrorism; attacks on the constitutional order 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan by or on behalf 
of an organized group; illegal departure from 
or entry into the Republic of Uzbekistan by 
prior conspiracy; organization of a criminal 
group; and formation, leadership of or 
participation in religious extremist, separatist, 
fundamentalist or other prohibited 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>On 5 February 2008, the Office of the 
Procurator-General of Kyrgyzstan rejected 
the Uzbek request for Mr. Kholikov&#8217;s 
extradition, as a criminal case had been 
brought against him in Jalal-Abad municipal 
court for crimes committed in the territory of 
Kyrgyzstan. 
</p>
<p>Having heard the criminal case, the Jalal-
Abad municipal court on 6 March 2008 
issued a verdict finding Mr. Kholikov guilty 
of concealment  of a particularly serious 
crime and illegal border crossing and 
sentencing him to four years&#8217; deprivation of 
liberty, to be served in an open prison. 
</p>
<p>We should also like to report that prior to the 
decision on Mr. Kholikov&#8217;s extradition to 
Uzebkistan, neither the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees nor

Committee) had sent the Office of the 
Procurator-General of Kyrgyzstan any 
petitions on his behalf. 
</p>
<p>On 26 March, the request from the Office of 
the Procurator-General of Uzbekistan for Mr. 
Kholikov&#8217;s extradition to stand trial for 
criminal offences was granted, in accordance 
with article 56, part 2, of the Convention on 
Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in 
Civil, Family and Criminal Matters of 22 
January 1993. On 14 May, he was transferred 
to the SIZO-3 remand centre in Bukhara. 
</p>
<p>At the same time, the Ministry received the 
reply concerning Mr. Kholikov&#8217;s application 
to the Committee. The letter states that on 30 
April 2008, Mr. E. T. Kholikov had applied 
for registration as an asylum-seeker to the 
Committee of the town of Osh, through a 
lawyer working for the International 
Protection Centre. In the application, he 
claimed that he was endangered by the Uzbek 
intelligence service. However, the application 
provided no specific details or reasons for this 
threat. In order to examine the case, the court 
file was requested, and consultations were 
held with the Office of the Procurator-
General. 
</p>
<p>It was thus established that on 6 March 2008, 
Mr. Kholikob received a four-year sentence 
from the Jalal-Abad municipal court for 
concealing crimes carried out in southern 
Kyrgyzstan in 2006 by a group of militants of 
the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, an 
international terrorist organization, and for 
illegally crossing the border. The extradition

Office of the Procurator-General of 
Uzbekistan. Pursuant to that request, the 
Office of the Procurator-General of 
Kyrgyzstan decided to extradite Mr. 
Kholikov on 26 May 2008. In addition, it was 
established that Mr. Kholikob arrived in 
Kyrgyzstan on 25 June 2007. Between 25 
June and 21 August 2007, he entered Uzbek 
territory several times but was neither 
arrested nor prosecuted. He did not apply for 
asylum before his arrest or during his trial.  
</p>
<p>It thus follows that Mr. Kholikov did not 
enter Kyrgyzstan in search of asylum, but 
only sought it after the decision regarding his 
extradition. In light of these circumstances, 
the Osh Committee did not register Mr. 
Kholikov as an asylum-seeker. According to 
information received from the head of the 
SIZO-5 remand centre in Osh, Mr. Kholikov 
was transferred to Uzbekistan on 15 May 
</p><p>2008. 
</p>
<p>On 6 May 2008, the International Protection 
Centre filed an application with the Osh 
provincial inter-district court, which on 22 
May partially satisfied the Centre&#8217;s request. 
The court declared that the action taken by

On 9 August 2007, both officers were 
sentenced to three years deprivation of

the Amnesty Act of 2 March 2007. The 
victim appealed the verdict, but it was upheld 
by the military court of the Kyrgyz Republic. 
</p>
<p>On 5 December 2006, a complaint was filed 
at the Osh garrison military prosecutor&#8217;s 
office concerning Mr. E. Kamalov, who had 
allegedly been beaten up by fellow 
servicemen. An initial investigation was 
carried out, and it showed that on 1 
November 2006, E. Kamalov left his post 
without permission and went into hiding. 
Other servicemen made clear that he had not 
been treated in any irregular fashion by the 
other officers. A local physician who 
examined Mr. Kamalov on 6 November 2006 
indicated that no physical injuries were found 
at the time. A trauma specialist who 
examined him on 9 November did not find 
traces of burns or stab injuries. Because the 
complaint lacked corroboration, no criminal 
proceedings were started.

comprising security agents and internal 
affairs officers of Jalalabad province entered 
Ms. R. Ibragimova&#8217;s home, in the context of a

the officers had used force against her. In 
addition, no oral or written complains were 
filed by her or her family. 
</p>
<p>On 27 September, she had a forensic 
psychiatric examination, during which her 
health deteriorated, so she was taken to the 
Tash-Kumyr city hospital. According to a 
certificate from the director of the hospital, 
Ms. Ibgragimova underwent an abortion 
because of a danger of miscarriage caused by 
psychological stress. However, no signs of 
violence were found. On 6 March 2008, her 
sentence was converted from three years 
imprisonment to three years probation. 
</p>
<p>On 17 September 2006, a corpse bearing 
signs of a violent death was discovered on the 
main road that leads from Bishkek to Osh. 
The investigation established that the crime 
had been committed by T. Adashev. During 
the investigation, Mr. Adashev made a full 
confession in the presence of a lawyer, 
admitting to the murder. Further proof was 
also found of Mr. Adashev&#8217;s involvement in 
the murder. On 19 November 2006, he was 
sentenced to 17 years deprivation of liberty. 
On 25 December, Mr. Adashev&#8217;s father 
complained that his son had been beaten up 
during the investigation. However, a forensic 
examination found no injuries on Mr.

instituted.

toutefois, de souligner que les autorit&#233;s

confirmer l&#8217;existence de toutes traces de 
violence, physique ou psychologique, en

qu&#8217;ils auraient subi. Par ailleurs, le syst&#232;me

<p>At around noon on 19 May 2008, Mr Al Tabakh 
was leaving his mother-in-law&#8217;s home, in the 
Abi al-Ashhor neighbourhood of Tripoli, when 
he heard gun shots. He ran to see what was 
happening and saw two policemen from the 
Tajouraa police force assaulting an 80 year old 
man on Abi Al Ashhor Boulevard. He tried to 
reason with them, which led them to drop the 
old man and turn their attention to Mr. Al 
Tabakh. They pulled Mr. Al Tabakh over to a 
police car where some 20 or so policemen were 
standing. Several of the police officers began 
hitting him with stones, batons, metal bars, their 
boots and their bare hands. He suddenly felt his 
leg snap and he fell to the ground. He was

policeman tried to stab him with a knife, badly 
cutting his left hand. The officer in the 
passenger&#8217;s seat violently beat him over the 
head with a stick, until it broke. He then 
strangled him whilst threatening to kill him. The 
policeman sitting to Mr. Al Tabakh&#8217;s left hit him 
over the head with the butt of his revolver and 
the one to his right hit him with a blunt object. 
Mr. Al Tabakh&#8217;s head began to swell and his 
right eye began to shut.  
</p>
<p>The car arrived at Tajouraa police station, and 
Mr. Al Tabakh was dragged from the car by the 
four policemen who continued to beat him until 
other police officers intervened. Mr. Al Tabakh 
was in such a critical state that the police were 
forced to get him urgent medical care. The 
officers first took him to a clinic, but upon 
seeing the state he was in, the doctor 
immediately requested that he be sent directly to

</p>
<p>Ms. Shukarno has been sentenced by the Pahang 
Syariah Court in Malaysia to six strokes of the 
rotan and fined RM 5000 for drinking beer in a 
hotel nightclub two years ago. The sentence is 
expected to be carried out today, 3 August 2009 
or 14 days from 20 July 2009. The punishment 
of caning is stipulated in Section 125 and 126 of 
the Phang Syariah Criminal Procedure 
Enactment of 2002, which has not been applied 
against a Malaysian woman before. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 1/09/09, the Government 
indicated that the punishment of six strokes of 
caning ( &#8220;whipping&#8221;) and a fine of RM 
5,000.00 decreed by the Pahang Syariah High 
Court was based on the provisions of the laws 
enforceable in Malaysia. Ms. Kartika had 
pleaded guilty to the offence of consuming 
beer.  
</p>
<p>The sentence given to Ms. Kartika does not 
constitute any form of discrimination against 
women. It is based on the laws enforceable in 
Malaysia and has also been executed in a 
number of cases involving men. It is enforced 
against all persons who profess the religion of 
Islam, regardless of gender. 
</p>
<p>When executing the punishment of whipping, 
the person shall use the rod with average 
force, without lifting his hand over his head 
so that the offender&#8217;s skin is not cut. After 
inflicting a stroke, he shall lift the rod upward 
and not pull it. Whipping may be inflicted on 
all parts of the body except the face, head, 
stomach, chest or private parts. The whipping 
rod shall be of the same type and make either 
from rattan or small branch of a tree without </p>

1.25 centimeters. Furthermore, the offender 
shall wear clothes when the whipping is 
inflicted and for women, the whipping shall 
be inflicted in a sitting position. 
</p>
<p>The main purpose of punishment under 
Syariah laws is to educate the offender. Ms. 
Kartika has not made any appeals in relation 
to the sentence imposed on her by the courts. 
She was advised by her lawyer to appeal 
against the case several times. However, she 
refused to file an appeal because as a Muslim, 
she felt repentance towards the wrongdoings 
that she had committed.  
</p>
<p>The Government is of the view that Mrs. 
Kartika has been provided access to effective 
remedies under the provisions of the relevant 
Malaysian laws. She was represented by her 
lawyer during the trial. She also has the right 
to appeal the sentence, although she made the 
decision to accept it without challenging it.

<p><b>Deceso de un migrante irregular y lesiones

<p>El 18 de Septiembre, fuerzas de seguridad 
mexicanas dispararon contra una camioneta  
pick-up que transportaba a siete migrantes 
irregulares de nacionalidades ecuatoriana y 
salvadore&#241;a cuando cruzaban la frontera cerca

transportaban los migrantes irregulares habr&#237;a 
aminorado la marcha al acercarse a un control de

presuntamente reportar&#237;an haber sido pateados y

los migrantes habr&#237;a sido golpeado directamente

<p>According to the information received, 40 from 
a sample of 230 women living with HIV 
participating in related research indicated that 
they were subjected to forced or coerced 
sterilization. Thirteen of the 40 cases are 
documented in detail and all suggest that 
informed consent to the procedure was 
compromised.In some cases, coercion was

sterilization procedure, while in other cases,

sterilization procedure was being conducted, and 
were only informed after completion of the

In at least six cases, consent was reportedly 
obtained by medical personnel in situation of 
duress. Women were asked to sign consent 
forms while in labour or on their way to the 
operating theatre, or were told or given the 
impression that they had to consent to 
sterilization in order to obtain another medical 
procedure such as an abortion or caesarean 
section. In other instances, it appears that 
women were asked to sign a consent form for 
sterilization without being informed of the 
form&#8217;s contents. In all of these cases, it is 
alleged that medical personnel failed to provide 
the women with a full description of the nature 
of the procedure, its benefits, risks and 
alternatives. Furthermore, it is reported that 
medical personnel did not inform the women of 
the procedure&#8217;s irreversibility and its potential 
side effects, or provided information on 
alternative forms of birth control and family 
planning.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received, six of the 
women subjected to coerced or forced 
sterilization have filed cases before the High 
Court alleging violations of their right to life, 
human dignity and equality, and the right to be 
free from cruel, inhuman, and degrading 
treatment. Court dates have been set for October 
and November 2009. It is also reported that 
when, on 15 July 2008, documentation of the 13 
cases was submitted to the Deputy Minister of 
Health and Social Services, she indicated that 
the Ministry would issue circulars to the health 
facilities stating that if forced and coerced

<p>One of the women concerned reported that

<p><b>Ms. E. H. A., aged 20, resident in Stavanger.  
</b></p>
<p>On 24 May 2005, E. H. A., at that time aged 16, 
was involuntarily admitted to the psychiatric 
ward of the Stavanger University Hospital. She 
had been taken there by a school consultant 
without her parents being informed or consulted 
although she had no previous history of violent 
or other disturbing behaviour. Since then, she 
has been kept at the hospital, most of the time in 
solitary confinement.  
</p>
<p>According to her mother, Ms. A. had gone 
through a difficult period, related to a possible 
sexual assault a few months earlier. This 
incident was reported to the police, but the case 
was dismissed by the authorities due to a lack of 
evidence. 
</p>
<p>Ms. A. has been forcibly administered different 
types of psychiatric drugs, despite her parents&#8217; 
repeated objections. The doctors&#8217; diagnoses 
have changed many times and do not appear to 
be consistent. Since her confinement, Ms. A.&#8217;s 
condition has deteriorated drastically: she 
allegedly has suffered from spasms, eyes rolled 
up in their sockets (dystonia), severe motoric 
restlessness (akathisia), memory problems, 
compulsive actions, incontinence, psychoses, 
dry mouth, teeth damage, inflammation of the 
gums and gross weight gain, among others. Ms. 
A. may even have sustained brain damage due to 
the extensive use of neuroleptics and other 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 23/12/2009, the Government 
indicated that the Norwegian Ministry of 
Health and Care Services has received 
information about the case from the hospital, 
and the facts described are completely 
different from those described by A. A. 
</p>
<p>Norwegian regulations of compulsory mental 
health care comply with international human 
rights norms and standards. According to the 
hospital, none of these regulations have been 
violated. The case is now under supervision 
by the Norwegian Board of Health. Due to 
confidentiality regulations, no more details 
can be provided concerning this case. </p>

<p>After her mother publicly criticized her 
treatment, her visit rights were restricted and 
eventually denied for more than one and a half 
years between 2006 and 2007, and again for one 
year in 2008. The father&#8217;s visitation rights have 
been severely restricted as well. Following a 
complaint, the Control Commission concluded 
on 26 September 2008 that the decision to deny 
the parents visits for one year was illegal, but 
that Ms. A. should remain under involuntary 
admission.  
</p>
<p>For their part, the Regional Supervisory 
Authorities (Helsetilsynet) concluded on 16 July 
2008 that the hospital violated Ms. A.&#8217;s legal 
rights related to free and informed consent to 
health care and the right to participation. 
However, on 4 December 2008, the Stavanger 
University Hospital filed a complaint asking for 
the father to be replaced as a legal guardian.  
</p>
<p>An application for free legal assistance filed on 
6 November 2008 on behalf of Ms. A. was 
rejected by the authorities (Fylkesmannen) on 11 
December 2008. Her father&#8217;s appeal against the 
decision was rejected on 30 January 2009. A 
further appeal is pending. The decision rejecting 
the application for legal aid states inter alia that, 
since the issue in question is not of such great 
significance for Ms. A.&#8217;s welfare and her 
parents, it would not be reasonable that the 
public treasury pay for free legal aid.

possibility to challenge the decision of the 
Control Commission of 26 September 2008

the Pakistani intelligence on suspicion of having 
been involved in a number of terrorist attacks, 
including the 11 September 2001 attacks against 
the United States and the 11 March 2004 
bombings in Madrid. He was detained in 
Pakistan for a certain period of time, accused of 
involvement in both incidents. He was then 
handed over to authorities of the USA under 
their exclusive control. While no official news 
of Mr. Nassar&#8217;s whereabouts has been received 
since his apprehension in October 2005, it is 
alleged that in November 2005, he was held for 
some time at a military base facility under 
United States of America authority in Diego 
Garcia, an overseas territory of the United 
Kingdom. It is now assumed that he is currently 
being held in secret detention in the Syrian Arab 
Republic.

by posting a notice for a reward for the same

Pakistan. Around the time of his reported 
capture, the US Government removed Mr. 
Nassar&#8217;s name from the &#8220;Rewards for Justice&#8221; 
list, and withdrew the proposed reward for 
information leading to his arrest. It also removed 
his name from the Federal Bureau of

Center reports that Mr. Nassar was captured in 
Pakistan in November 2005 
(www.nctc.gov/site/profiles/capture.html, last 
visited 23 September 2009). This may suggest 
that Mr. Nassar was captured and that the 
Government of the US was either involved in his 
capture or is cognizant of his whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>In June 2009, in response to a request made 
through Interpol by Spanish Judge Baltazar 
Garzon for information relating to Mr. Nassar&#8217;s 
whereabouts, the FBI informed that Mr. Nassar 
was not in the UUS at that time. The FBI did 
not, however, address whether Mr. Nassar may 
be held in US custody elsewhere or whether it 
knew where he was then held.

<p>Following queries by non-governmental 
organizations as to the whereabouts of Mr.

responded on 10 June 2009 stating that &#8220;the CIA 
can neither confirm nor deny the existence or 
nonexistence of records responsive to your

who later identified themselves as soldiers, 
approached them and began interrogating Mr.

the questioning, they punched and kicked him 
with their fists, feet and the butts of their rifles.

Aguak, one of the main towns of Maguindanao, 
to an electoral office to register Esmael 
Mangundadatu as a candidate in the elections for 
governor of Maguindanao province next year.

himself, was led by his wife and formed of local 
politicians, lawyers and journalists.  
</p>
<p>At around 9 a.m., in a rural area near the villages 
of Salman and Malating, the convoy was 
abducted by a group of more than 100 gunmen, 
suspected to be members of a militia at the 
services of the family of the Governor of 
Maguindanao province. Some reports indicate 
that among the abductors there were members of 
the police and of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines. The gunmen took the entire convoy 
to a location around ten kilometres from the 
main road, where they killed at least 57 persons, 
including 24 women (the reports received do not 
indicate clearly how many survivors there were). 
Some reports indicate that the abductors tortured 
the victims before executing them, including 
subjecting the female victims to sexual violence. 
The bodies were buried in mass graves on a 
hilltop in Sitio Masalay, Barangay Salman, in 
Ampatuan, Maguindanao province.

demonstrations held around the recent 
parliamentary elections or shortly afterwards.  
</p>
<p>Following the demonstrations of 6 to 8 April 
2009, in Chisinau, public security forces arrested 
129 persons. Many of those arrested, including 
minors, reported that they were subjected to 
beatings with clubs, plastic bottles filled with 
water, fists and kicking during their arrest and 
police custody in district police stations as well 
as in the General Police Commissariat. Many of 
the detained persons have physical marks that 
appear to corroborate their claims. Furthermore, 
reports were received of overcrowding and 
instances of denial of food. Twenty-five or more 
individuals were held in a cell measuring 
approximately eight square meters, they were 
denied food for two days, and only had limited 
access to water and basic sanitary facilities.

</p>
<p>By letter dated 23/09/09, the Government 
indicated that the events of 7-8 April 2009 
resulted in disturbances of the public order 
and violent acts by the demonstrators, in 
contravention of the Law on public 
gatherings. During the demonstrations, the 
police acted in accordance with national and 
international laws. Therefore, participants 
who infringed national legal acts were 
charged administratively, while others whose 
acts were tantamount to criminal acts were 
charged respectively.  
</p>
<p>Following the events, the Moldovan 
competent authorities initiated criminal 
investigations. Following these 
investigations, 120 persons were 
apprehended. Some of them were released on 
the basis of prosecutors&#8217; ordinances or 
judicial courts&#8217; decisions. Subsequently, this 
preventive measure was changed into non-

Council for the Prevention of Torture (National 
Preventive Mechanism under OPCAT) tried to 
visit several police stations and penitentiary 
institutions in Chisinau, where individuals were 
reportedly being detained and ill-treated. Despite 
the national legal provisions providing that the 
Consultative Council must be granted access to 
all places of detention without prior notice, the 
General Police Commissariat of Chisinau as 
well as the Central District Police Commissariat 
refused such access. The Consultative Council 
received information that two women who had 
allegedly been severely beaten, were still held in

<p>During the investigation process, the 
concerned persons were assisted by defenders 
and, depending on the particular case, by their 
legal representatives, thus the right to defence 
was fully assured. Other essential rights were 
granted, including the right to medical 
assistance, the right to formulate requests, the 
right to a translator, and the right to know the 
charges brought against them, among others. 
</p>
<p>Regarding the minors who took part in the 
demonstrations, the presence of their parents 
or relatives was ensured. In order to exclude 
acts of torture and ill-treatment, the 
conditions of detention of the concerned 
persons was checked daily by the prosecutors. 
In addition, the personal files of those 
detained on administrative charges were 
examined exclusively by the judicial courts, 
who issued decisions in this regard. 
</p>
<p>Between 10 and 30 April, 111 persons, 
including four minors, were transferred to the 
Penitentiary No. 13 in Chisinau. During their 
detention, no physical force, or constraints or 
inhuman treatment was exerted on them. 
Immediately after their transfer from the 
police station, they were examined by the 
medical personnel of the penitentiary. 
Medical assistance was granted and 27 
detainees had various physical injuries. Three 
persons were hospitalized for acute cranio-
cerebral trauma, hypertensive syndrome and 
pulmonary evolutive tuberculosis. Following 
the medical examinations, the Penitentiary 
informed the General Prosecution Office of 
the 27 persons with injuries, requesting due 
investigations. </p>

terrorist attacks against representatives of the 
state and law enforcement officers in the North 
Caucasus,&quot; including a June 2004 attack on a 
Ministry of the Interior building in Nazran, 
Ingushetia. Reportedly, Mr. Gasayev was named 
as a participant in the Nazran attack by a person 
convicted of involvement in the same attack 
while under interrogation. However, that person 
later retracted his testimony alleging that it was 
given under duress. In August 2004, before 
leaving the Russian Federation, Mr. Gasayev 
had reportedly been ill-treated for three days by 
officers of the central office of the Federal

him with plastic bottles filled with water and 
truncheons and subjected him to electric shocks. 
No medical examination was conducted 
following the ill-treatment, nor did Mr. 
Zubairaev have access to medical assistance. 
Consequently, he filed several complaints and 
was transferred to prison colony No. 9 in 
Volgograd. In February 2008, he was admitted 
to prison hospital LIU-15 in Volgograd, 
however the ill-treatment continued afterwards. 
As a result of the treatment, Mr. Zubairaev has 
lost weight and he suffers from back and 
stomach pain. In addition, the wounds on his 
body stemming from the ill-treatment are not

prison authorities do not provide him with 
adequate treatment, including medicine. In 
addition, they refuse to allow him access to the 
medication provided by his family.

<p>While serving his sentence, Mr. Zubairaev 
received various visits from relatives,

He refused to explain how the foreign body 
had appeared.

had been arrested earlier in relation to the 
murder of Mrs. Irina Zlatina, which occurred on 
10 April 2007 outside the Directorate of Internal

Valery Zhernakov led Mr. Bogushevsky to 
office n&#176; 505 and tied him to a chair with 
handcuffs. He then punched Mr. Bogushevsky in 
the chest with his fists. Since Mr. Bogushevsky 
has suffered from a heart condition since 1996,

was arrested on suspicion of having 
committed the crime. He claimed to be ill, so 
he was taken to the Ekaterinburg City 
Hospital No. 33, where he was diagnosed 
with cardiac insufficiency and given a 
certificate stating that he was fit to be 
temporarily detained. He was not found to be 
suffering from any bodily injuries. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Bogushevsky gave a detailed confession 
consistent with the evidence. His rights and

Bogushevsky, hit his throat and pressed him on 
his eyeballs with his thumbs. Several times Mr. 
Anatoly Smirnov, Chief of the unit, entered the 
office and asked how the &#8220;case was going&#8221;. 
Between 3 and 4 p.m., a third police officer 
entered office n&#176; 505, alarmed by Mr. 
Bogushevsky&#8217;s screaming. This officer told Mr. 
Zhernakov and Mr. Smirnov to call the 
ambulance. Around 4 p.m., a physician entered 
office n&#176; 505 and examined Mr. Bogushevsky. 
This physician confirmed an anomaly in Mr. 
Bogushevky&#8217;s heart and also explained to Mr. 
Zhernakov and Mr. Smirnov that Mr. 
Bogushevsky&#8217;s condition was life-threatening. 
Mr. Zhernakov and Mr. Smirnov then pressured 
Mr. Bogushevsky to testify, among other issues, 
to having been involved in the murder of Mrs. 
Zlatina. They told him that, if he was to sign an 
agreement on his involvement, he would not be 
ill-treated any longer. They pointed out that Mr. 
Bogushevsky would need a lawyer in order to 
make such a statement. The two police officers 
then called a lawyer who presented himself as 
Mr. Kurnosov. When it became apparent to Mr. 
Bogushevsky that Mr. Kurnosov and Mr. 
Smirnov had close ties, Mr. Bogushevsky 
insisted on having a lawyer of his choice who 
would defend him. Later, in the night of 30 to 31 
August 2007, Mr. Smirnov called Mr. Denis 
Kolganov, an acquaintance of Mr. Bogushevsky, 
who has a law degree. Mr. Bogushevsky then 
told Mr. Kolganov what had happened. Mr. 
Kolganov advised Mr. Bogushevsky that he 
should not testify against himself. He told this to 
Mr. Kurnosov, too. Mr. Kolganov and Mr. 
Bogushevsky were assured that no more 
interrogations would take place and that Mr. 
Bogushevsky would be moved to a temporary 
detention facility. Subsequently Mr. Kulgonov

Bogushevsky indicating that two police 
officers had subjected him to physical and 
psychological pressure during the 
investigation with the aim of obtaining a 
confession. An inquiry was conducted and, 
based on the results, the Unit decided not to 
initiate criminal proceedings. 
</p>
<p>On 7 April 2008, Mr. Bogushevsky was 
found guilty and sentenced to nine years 
deprivation of liberty in a strict-regime 
correctional institution. He lodged an appeal 
which was rejected by the regional court.

<p>On 16 June, the Sverdlovsk Region Police 
Headquarters received a petition concerning 
the legality of Mr. Bogushevsky&#8217;s detention, 
the investigation of the criminal case and the 
use of pressure against him to obtain a 
confession. On 17 June, the Internal Security 
Service conducted a judicial inquiry into the 
claims, but the facts alleged could not be 
objectively verified. The Office of the 
Attorney-General of the Russian Federation is 
currently conducting an inquiry into the 
legality of and the justification for the

they beat him in the chest and the stomach. Mr.

aid attendant was called immediately. Mr. 
Bogushevsky was taken to the hospital, where 
his condition was stabilized. Mr. Zhernakov and 
Mr. Smirnov accompanied Mr. Bogushevsky to

Mr. Bogushevsky consulted the lawyer about the

Mr. Bogushevsky was taken before the court of

then assaulted on the face, back and stomach, 
and dragged along the road to a police jeep, 
where he was forced to sit on the floor, his legs 
shackled.

get out of the jeep. Once inside, Mr. Shantha&#8217;s 
hands were tied with a rope, and a pole was put 
through his arms and legs, and lodged between 
two tables. This method of hanging is locally 
known as the Dharma Chakra, or wheel of

asked to return stolen goods, allegations which 
he denied.

Prevention of Terrorism Act. The physicians 
were last seen on the morning of 15 May 2009 at 
a holding area at Omanthai check point. An 
official of the Ministry of Health stated on 18 
May Government forces handed over the 
physicians to the police. 
</p>
<p>Dr. Shanmugarajah and Dr. Sathiyamoorthy are

<p>While working in the conflict zone, the doctors 
provided detailed eyewitness reports to the 
media and the international community from 
hospitals and makeshift medical centres. Their 
reports detailed the suffering of ordinary 
civilians, many of whom died from war-related 
injuries. Their reports also highlighted 
continuous shelling of areas with large 
concentrations of non-combatants.

Sathyamoorthy, Dr. V. Shanmugarajah and 
Dr. Thurairaja Varatharajah surrendered to 
the Army when they arrived at Omathai 
check point on 15 May 2009. Dr. 
Varatharajah, who was injured at the time of 
surrender was admitted to the General 
Hospital on Colombo. He was released on 6 
June.

<p>The three doctors were detained under section 
19 (1) of the Emergency Regulation on 
charged of their alleged links with the LTTE 
organization, disseminating false information 
to the international media and supplying 
medicine and medical equipment to the LTTE 
from Government hospitals. They are now 
being held in protective custody by the 
Criminal Investigation Department in 
Colombo, pending the completion of the 
investigations. They have been visited by the 
ICRC and their families on several occasions, 
and were given healthcare facilities. 
</p>
<p>At a media briefing on 8 July, all three 
doctors stated that they were forced by the 
LTTE to speak to foreign media and provide 
exaggerated information on civilian 
casualties. They also said that they were not

he should say that shelling by the 
Government troops continued and that scores 
of civilians and patients were dying as a 
result, which he did.

had made the day before to the emergency 
police service in Colombo. Mr. Perera had 
reported that when he went to lodge a complaint 
about a land dispute with his neighbour, officers 
at the Kamburupitiya station had chased him 
away. When both parties to the dispute arrived 
at the Police Station, the Officer in Charge 
examined the deed of ownership and started to 
verbally abuse Mr. Perera. He brought a pole 
from the next room and started to beat Mr. 
Perera on his head and body. Two other officers 
kicked him from behind. After the assault, Mr. 
Kaldera forced him to sign a piece of paper. He 
then told the officer to take him to the Aadapana 
Government Hospital in Kamburupitiya. The 
doctor told the officer that he should be warded, 
but after speaking to the Offier in Charge by 
phone, Mr. Perera was taken back to the police 
station.

<p>At around 3:30 p.m., Mr. Perera was charged 
with obstructing police duties. Two hours later, 
he was taken by jeep and produced before the 
magistrate of Matara. The lawyer who 
represented Mr. Perera informed the magistrate 
that he had been assaulted by the police and 
needed medical treatment. The magistrate 
ordered that Mr. Perera be given medical 
treatment and that a judicial medical report be 
obtained. However, he was taken instead to 
Matara Prison. After being admitted at the gate, 
Mr. Perera was beaten by the prison guards. 
That night, he was put in an overcrowded ward </p>

to dress and was taken to a cell. At

him. The next morning, he was taken to several

were any goods pawned under such identities.

<p>The following day, Mr. Wickramapathirana was

bent and his hands around his knees so that he 
could be hung upside down with a thick pole, a

<p>While we, in principle, welcome the draft 
Children Act which represents an important step 
forward in the protection of children&#8217;s rights, we 
are deeply concerned by the decision of the 
Council of Ministers not to proceed with the 
complete criminalization of the practice of 
female genital mutilation - cutting (FGM/C), 
and to make a distinction between several forms 
of FGM/C in line with an Islamic fatwa. In our 
view, this decision constitutes a setback 
following the recent efforts of the Government 
of Sudan to tackle this harmful practice through 
a series of measures, including the adoption of a 
national strategy to abandon the practice of 
FGM/C. This strategy, in line with the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child&#8217;s

recommendations of September 2002, involved 
raising public awareness of the dangers 
associated with the practice and encouraging 
communities and respected individuals to 
publicly commit to its abolition. A total of 110 
religious leaders in Sudan have openly declared 
that FGM/C had no association with the Islamic 
faith or practices and called for its eradication. 
In addition, the State of Southern Kordofan 
passed the first state law criminalizing FGM/C 
in November 2008.  
</p>
<p>We are concerned that instead of contributing to 
a gradual ending of these harmful practices, the 
legalization of &#8216;sunna&#8217; practice could open the 
door for maintaining other forms of FGM/C and 
also render more difficult legal efforts to 
eradicate FGM/C altogether. We received 
information that internally displaced persons 
from South Sudan in North Sudan have, for 
instance, started practicing genital mutilation, 
and that the custom has gradually spread to 
various ethnic groups in other parts of the 
country. 
</p>
<p>Women and girls can suffer long term heath 
consequences following FGM/C depending on 
the type and severity of the procedure 
performed. Recognized gynecologists and 
obstetricians indicated that the &#8216;sunna&#8217; practice 
constitutes amputation of parts of the child&#8217;s 
genital organs which would result in the same 
health hazards as other types of circumcision. 
Short-term difficulties include severe pain, 
shock, hemorrhage, urine retention, ulceration of 
the genital region, and injury to adjacent tissue. 
Hemorrhage and infection can cause death. 
Long-term consequences include: psychological 
trauma; a feeling of incompleteness, anxiety and 
depression; difficulties during childbirth; cysts </p>

<p>Ms. Gelsen Adelshina fled Uzbekistan in 2005 
because she perceived her life to be at risk due 
to threats she had received in connection with an 
apartment she owns in Karasu, Andijan Oblast. 
She inherited the apartment from an aunt, who 
was reportedly killed for refusing to sell it. Ms. 
Adelshina was asked by a police officer and 
other representative of the authorities to sell the 
flat. A representatives of the Housing and 
Communal Commission, the local authority 
dealing with housing issues, allegedly insisted 
that she, as a member of the Russian minority, 
should sell the flat and move from Uzbekistan.  
</p>
<p>Ms. Adelshina fled to Sweden, where she 
applied for asylum. Her request was rejected by 
the relevant authorities. Since April 2008, Ms. 
Adelshina was living in Sweden without a valid 
permit. On 25 March 2009, she was arrested by 
police in Stockholm following a random check 
and taken into immigration detention.

<p>During her stay in Sweden, Ms. Adelshina had 
participated in activities to support political 
prisoners and protest against human rights 
violations in Uzbekistan. She was allegedly 
preparing a second asylum application, which 
she had however not yet handed in to the 
Swedish Migrationsverket.

Convention as refugees. Under Swedish law, 
persons who are not convention refugees may 
also qualify for subsidiary protection in the

need of protection. A permit may also be 
granted if on an overall assessment of the 
alien&#8217;s situation there are found to be such 
exceptionally distressing circumstances that 
he or she should be allowed to stay in 
Sweden.  
</p>
<p>If an application for a residence permit is 
rejected, a refusal-of-entry or expulsion order 
shall be issued at the same time. A refusal of

torture or other inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment or if the alien risks 
being subjected to persecution in that country.

<p>If new circumstances come to light that mean 
that there is such an impediment to 
enforcement as described above, or there is

that Mr. Nassar was captured and that the

<p>  <b>Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi and Ms. Kawthar Taifour 
</b>(A/HRC/10/44/Add.4, para. 217).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>By letter dated 3/04/09, the Government 
indicated that Ms. Afandi and Ms. Tayfur 
were arrested for stirring up sectarian strife 
and unrest in the town of Ayn al-Arab in the 
Aleppo governorate. They were detained in 
women&#8217;s ward 4 at Aleppo Central Prison. 
They were not held in incommunicado 
detention and neither of them were subjected 
to ill-treatment. They appeared before the 
court on 20 August 2008, following an 
inquiry that was conducted in accordance 
with the due process norms laid down in the 
Constitution and Syrian law. The case was 
filed with the military prosecutor&#8217;s office. 
The case was filed with the chief judge of the 
lower military court in Aleppo, before whom 
they appeared for examination on 22 August 
</p><p>2008. Based on the judge&#8217;s decision, they 
were released that day. The case is still being 
reviewed by the judge.  
</p>
<p>The Syrian authorities verified the legality of 
the arrest procedures and found no evidence 
that the rights and freedoms of the two 
women had been infringed or that they had 
been placed in arbitrary detention or 
subjected to torture.  
</p>
<p>When Ms. Afandi arrived at the prison, the 
doctor at the prisoners&#8217; welfare association 
diagnosed her as suffering from an inflamed 
right ear, and treated her regularly throughout 
her time in detention. Ms. Tayfur was 
diagnosed as suffering from diabetes, 
rheumatoid arthritis pain and chest pains. She 
also had a condition known as &#8220;Aleppo boil&#8221; </p>

<p>By letter dated 17/11/09, the Government 
indicated that the Rohingyas who arrived on 
Thai shores entered Thailand illegally and are 
illegal immigrants under Thai law. The issue 
of Rohingyas is a complex one which 
involves problems of statelessness, people 
smuggling and human trafficking. The issue 
must therefore be addressed in a 
comprehensive manner and through regional 
cooperation, including bilateral cooperation 
with Myanmar and Bangladesh; cooperation 
with a contact group of affected countries 
(Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and 
Myanmar); cooperation with the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); and 
cooperation within the Bali Process on People 
Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and 
related Transnational Crime. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the group of 78 Rohingyas 
who have arrived on Thai shores in January 
2009, Thailand has taken care of them based 
on humanitarian considerations. The 
Government allowed relevant embassy 
representatives and staff from UNHCR to 
visit them.

<p>With regard to the death of Mr. Abdul Salam 
and Mr. Hammah Tulah in the Immigration 
Detention Centre in Ranong Province, the

</p>
<p>On 1 July 2009, Abdul Salam died at the age of 
18 at the Ranong IDC after suffering from heart 
failure. On 13 August 2009, Hammah Tulah, 15 
years of age, also died while in detention at the 
Ranong IDC. In both cases, the rapid 
deterioration of their health may be due to the 
inadequacy and inefficiency of healthcare being 
provided to them during the entire period of 
their detention and particularly during the hours 
preceding their deaths. A third person is 
reportedly in a critical medical condition. 
Following these deaths, all remaining 
individuals from the aforementioned Rohingya 
minority group have been transferred to the 
Suan Plu IDC in Bangkok.  
</p>
<p>It has also been reported that irregular 
immigrants in Thailand face potentially 
indefinite administrative immigration detention.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>of death were cardiac arrest. 
</p>
<p>On a humanitarian basis, the Immigration 
Bureau moved all the Rohingyas to the 
Immigration Detention Centre in Bangkok to 
give them more space for exercise and 
recreation, as well as for better access to 
medical care. The move also made it easier 
for UNHCR and other relevant NGOs to have 
access. 
</p>
<p>Thailand has no intention of detaining this 
group of persons indefinitely, and steps are 
being taken to verify their nationality and 
country of origin and to provide a long-term 
solution for them.

<p>On 25 December 2008, the Narathiwat 
Provincial Court ruled that Mr. Kaseng had 
died as a result of physical assault while in 
the custody of security personnel. According 
to the Criminal Procedure Code, after the 
Court has given an order, the examination file 
is forwarded to the Public Prosecutor to be 
sent to the inquiry official for further 
proceedings. Currently, the process against 
the alleged officials is underway. 
</p>
<p>On 19 March 2008, police and military forces 
conducted a security search at Ban Kor Tor 
village, Ruesog Sub-district, Rueso District, 
Narathiwat Province and took Mr. Sukri 
Salae, Mr. Yapa Kaseng and four other 
persons in custody, based on suspicion of the 
group&#8217;s involvement in activities detrimental 
to the public peace and security in the 
Southern Border Provinces. Such operation 
was carried out in accordance with the 
Martial Law Act. B.E. 2457 (1914), under 
which all suspects were sent to Narathiwat 
Task Force 39. 
</p>
<p>On 20 March, the police filed an application 
with the Narathiwat Povincial Court, 
requesting the detention of the suspects. After 
the Court granted permission for the 
detention, Mr. Sukri Salae and five other 
persons were sent to the Inkayuth Army 
Camp, on 21 March for further inquiry. After 
having been interrogated by officials, they 
were released on 9 April due to a lack of 
evidence. Regarding the allegation of torture, 
no petition or complaint was filed by or on 
behalf of Mr. Salae. </p>

The judge also barred the defence team from 
using social reports by a pedagogue and a child

the US Embassy in Pakistan reiterated this offer 
by posting a notice for a reward for the same

Prisoners are occasionally permitted out of their

sanitation facilities, prisoners are provided with 
buckets or plastic bags in which to urinate and 
defecate; the bags are not often collected for 
days and spill onto the floor, leaving the floors 
covered with urine and feces. There also 
indications that prison authorities provide little 
or no food or water, and malnutrition and 
starvation [are] continuous problems. Nor is 
medical treatment provided to prisoners, who

<p>In many U.S. prisons and jails pregnant women 
are restrained by their ankles or wrists when 
transported for prenatal medical appointments or 
when they go to the hospital for delivery.  
Pregnant women reportedly also remain 
shackled during labour, delivery and the post-
delivery recovery period &#8211;for hours or days-

level. This represents an important gap, since the 
majority of women in prison in the United States 
appear to be in state rather than federal prisons, 
and only 4 States (i.e. California, Illinois, 
Vermont, and New Mexico) have passed 
legislation restricting the use of shackles during 
labour and delivery.  Moreover, while the 
policies (both written and unwritten) of the 
Department of Corrections in some States also 
prohibit this practice, the lack of a statutory 
prohibition means that these policies can be 
relatively easily changed. Human rights reports, 
as well as a number of recent court cases attest 
to the fact that shackling women during birthing 
continues to be practiced both in States with and 
without statutory prohibitions, including on 
women detained because of their immigration 
status.   
</p>
<p>The practice of shackling pregnant inmates has 
been found to be traumatizing and to potentially 
represent avoidable health risks for the woman 
and her fetus. For example, shackles during the 
transportation to the hospital places the woman 
at increased risk of falling and of breaking her 
fall, it hampers her ability to alleviate the pain of 
contractions during birth and places further 
strain on her body and her baby, and it may also 
delay the doctor&#8217;s ability to perform 
interventions, especially on an emergency basis. 
The American Public Health Association has 
also explicitly warned that pregnant inmates 
should never be shackled during labour and 
delivery.   </p>

<b>Use of corporal punishment in public schools 
to discipline students with disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p>Corporal punishment is permitted in twenty 
states and hundreds of school districts allegedly 
make routine use of it to discipline pupils. It is 
alleged that the most common form of corporal 
punishment in these institutions is paddling, 
whereby students are repeatedly hit on the 
buttocks with a wooden board resembling a 
shaved-down baseball bat. Students have 
purportedly also been struck with other objects, 
such as rulers and toy hammers. Numerous 
reports of spanking, pinching, grabbing, 
bruising, beating and forceful restraint have also 
been received and must all equally be 
considered as corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p>Students with disabilities are allegedly subjected 
to corporal punishment at disproportionately 
high rates. Data received indicates that at least 
41,972 students with disabilities received 
corporal punishment at least once in the 2006-
2007 school year. The majority of these students 
are defined as disabled under the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act, while the 
remainder receive assistance under Section 504 
of the Rehabilitation Act. The total number of 
pupils, with and without disabilities, subjected to 
this form of discipline in US public schools 
during the 2006-2007 school year was 223,190. 
Hence, students with disabilities made up 18.8% 
of those who received corporal punishment, 
despite constituting just 13.7% of the national 
student population. The figures are allegedly 
much higher in certain states and only reflect 
reported incidents.

disabilities are frequently punished for

behaviour related to their disabilities. Such 
practices may indicate that educators lack 
sufficient training on the nature of their pupils&#8217; 
disabilities and/or the best means by which to 
respond to possibly inappropriate behaviour 
related to these disabilities. In addition to 
causing immediate physical discomfort, 
numerous incidents of corporal punishment have 
allegedly resulted in lasting injuries and barriers 
to education. Students have been known to 
become angry, depressed and deeply reluctant to 
return to school following physical discipline in 
the classroom. Data received indicates that the 
threat of severe educational barriers is 
particularly high for children with disabilities 
whose medical conditions may be worsened as a 
direct consequence of corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p>Finally, it is alleged that parents are frequently 
not informed of the full extent of violence used 
against their children. Reporting is not mandated 
for many types of corporal punishment and 
school districts do not always choose to report 
incidents to the parents of a child that was 
physically disciplined. In the case of children 
with disabilities, the potential lack of 
information is higher as many children are 
unable to verbalise their experiences. Reports 
received suggest that parents who have 
attempted to engage in discussion with educators 
in response to violent discipline of their disabled 
child at school have often seen their concerns 
and complaints ignored.

Nassar was apprehended in Pakistan by forces of 
the Pakistani intelligence on suspicion of having 
been involved in a number of terrorist attacks, 
including the 11 September 2001 attacks against 
the United States and the 11 March 2004 
bombings in Madrid. He was detained in 
Pakistan for a certain period of time, accused of 
involvement in both incidents. He was then 
handed over to authorities of the USA under 
their exclusive control. While no official news 
of Mr. Nassar&#8217;s whereabouts has been received 
since his apprehension in October 2005, it is 
alleged that in November 2005, he was held for 
some time at a military base facility under 
United States of America authority in Diego 
Garcia, an overseas territory of the United 
Kingdom. It is now assumed that he is currently 
being held in secret detention in the Syrian Arab 
Republic.  
</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Mr. Nassar fled the Syrian 
Arab Republic following his alleged 
involvement in a failed attempt by the Muslim 
Brotherhood to overthrow the government then 
in power. In 1985, he arrived in Spain where he 
married a Spanish citizen, thereafter obtaining 
Spanish citizenship.  
</p>
<p>Official US documents and web postings, as 
well as media reports, indicate that the US 
authorities had been interested in Mr. Nassar 
before his disappearance in 2005. The then 
United States of America administration pursued 
Mr. Nassar at least since November 2004, when 
it offered a five million US dollar reward for 
information relating to his capture as part of its 
&#8220;Rewards for Justice&#8221; program. In January 2005,

capture, the US Government removed Mr. 
Nassar&#8217;s name from the &#8220;Rewards for Justice&#8221;

information leading to his arrest. It also removed 
his name from the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation&#8217;s (FBI) &#8220;most wanted&#8221; list. The 
website of the US National Counterterrorism 
Center reports that Mr. Nassar was captured in 
Pakistan in November 2005 
(www.nctc.gov/site/profiles/capture.html, last 
visited 23 September 2009). This may suggest 
that Mr. Nassar was captured and that the 
Government of the US was either involved in his 
capture or is cognizant of his whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>In June 2009, in response to a request made 
through Interpol by Spanish Judge Baltazar 
Garzon for information relating to Mr. Nassar&#8217;s 
whereabouts, the FBI informed that Mr. Nassar 
was not in the UUS at that time. The FBI did 
not, however, address whether Mr. Nassar may 
be held in US custody elsewhere or whether it 
knew where he was then held. 
</p>
<p>Following queries by non-governmental 
organizations as to the whereabouts of Mr.

responded on 10 June 2009 stating that &#8220;the CIA 
can neither confirm nor deny the existence or

hematoma on his neck, and bruises on his back. 
Mr. Z.&#8217;s family was instructed by the prison 
authorities to bury him the next morning, 
without any opportunity for a medical 
examination of his body. The burial was 
observed by the police, who also monitored the 
family&#8217;s house in the days following the return 
of his body.  
</p>
<p>In 2000, the brother of Mr. Z., Mr. S. Z., was 
also arrested for religion-related charges. In 
spite of a serious medical condition, he was 
sentenced to 8 years&#8217; imprisonment in a strict 
regime prison in 2000, and is currently serving 
time in Prison Colony 46 in Navoi region. In 
January 2008, just prior to his release date, he 
was charged with violating prison rules, and was 
sentenced to a further 3 years and 6 months 
imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>There have been reports that Mr. S. Z. is being 
ill-treated in prison, including being placed in an 
isolation cell for up to six months as punishment 
for praying. </p>

<p>In early June 2009, when Hafiz Rasulzhon 
Rahmatov, an imam in the town of Shakhrikhan, 
was departing for Tashkent, a group of special 
forces officers with automatic rifles, masks and 
complete military equipage came to his home. 
The forces were looking for Mr. Rahmatov, 
whom they had previously interrogated after he 
had written a complaint letter to the city 
administration with regard to the disappearance 
of Sheikh Abdulavi Kori Mirzoev. However, 
once it became clear that Mr. Rahmatov was 
absent, they began to detain his followers and 
close friends. During the next two or three days 
60 of his disciples were arrested in Shakhrikhan. 
When Mr. Rahmatov learned that he was being 
sought, he fled to Moscow. One week later, he 
continued on to Turkey. It is alleged that he has 
subsequently been put on an international 
wanted list. As of 30 September 2009, more 
disciples of Mr. Rahmatov have been arrested in 
Shakhrikhan. They were held in custody in 
Shakhrikhan for several days before being 
remanded in custody at a pre-trial detention 
centre in Andijan.  
</p>
<p>By letter dated 16/11/09, the Government 
indicated that on 20 May 2009, the 
investigative department of the 
Shakhrikhansky district internal affairs office 
in Andizhanskaya province instituted 
criminal proceedings. The preliminary 
investigation established that from 2000 to 
2009, Mr. Rasulzhon Abdurakhimovich 
Rakhmatov, Mr. Isroil Pulatovich Usmonov, 
Mr. Utkirbek Nazarbekov and others were 
active members of an extremist religious 
group whose aim was to commit criminal acts 
in Uzbekistan with the aim of overthrowing 
the constitutional order. Mr. Rakhmatov and 
other associates were held in pre-trial 
detention. The investigation began on 24 May 
</p><p>2009. From the moment of their arrest, their 
constitutional rights were fully respected; 
they were provided with State legal aid and 
their relatives were informed of their arrest in 
a timely manner. 
</p>
<p>On 26 August 2009, a criminal indictment of 
Mr. I Usmonov and others was sent to the 
procurator&#8217;s office in Andizhanskaya 
province. On 3 September, the indictment 
was approved and the case was sent to court. 
Criminal proceedings were instituted against 
Mr. Pulatzhon Usmonov, but he was absolved 
of any criminal liability thanks to an amnesty 
declared by the Senate of the Majilisi Oli.

258 and 260).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>By letter dated 10/11/08, the Government 
indicated that on 11 July 2008, the Office of 
the Procurator in the Republic of 
Karakalpakstan opened a criminal 
investigation into Akzam Olimovich 
Turgunov and Khamza Nurullaevich Salaev. 
The investigation was prompted by a 
statement made by a witness and by evidence 
gathered during an initial inquiry. 
</p>
<p>In late May, Mr. Turgunov, who already had 
a criminal record, together with Khamza 
Salaev, the brother of his ex-wife, knew that 
the witness had earned money working in the 
Republic of South Korea. They invited him to 
the home of Mr. S. Eshzhanov where, 
threatening him with violence, they 
demanded that he acquire a house for Mr. 
Salaev&#8217;s younger sister or give her 20 million 
som. Should he not comply, they threatened 
to drown him, burn his house down and 
reduce his younger brothers to penury.  
</p>
<p>Based on the witness&#8217; statement, officers of 
the Karakalpakstan Ministry of the Interior 
and Office of the Procurator mounted a joint 
operation at about 8 p.m. on 11 July. Mr.

tea shop in Mangit, Amudarya district, as 
they extorted money from the witness and the 
maintenance logbook to a Neksiya car. Mr. 
Turgunov and Mr. Salaev were arrested and 
informed of their rights and obligations. Since 
their detention, Mr. Turgunov and Mr. 
Salaev&#8217;s constitutional rights have been fully 
respected, they have been provided with a 
State defence and their families were given 
timely notice of their arrest. 
</p>
<p>On 13 July, the case was referred for 
investigation from the Office of the 
Procurator-General to the Investigation 
Division of the Ministry of the Interior of 
Karakalpakstan. On 14 July, Mr. Turgunov 
and Mr. Salaev were named as suspects in the 
case and charged. The Nukus criminal court 
ordered them to be remanded in custody as a 
preventive measure.  
</p>
<p>The Investigation Division of the Republic of 
Karakalpakstan Ministry of the Interior 
conducted an official inquiry into the scalding 
that Turgunov suffered. This established that 
at around noon on 14 July 2008, while Mr. 
Turgunov was being interrogated as an 
accused person at the Nukus remand centre, a 
senior investigator gave the accused, at his 
own request, a cup of hot tea. To escape 
criminal liability by spreading rumours about 
being tortured, he deliberately poured the hot 
tea down his back, scalding himself. He was 
given first aid there. This was fully 
corroborated at the official inquiry by the 
testimony of the staff of the Nukus remand 
centre. Claims by defence counsel that Mr. 
Turgunov was tortured are ficticious, since 
the accused officer was not present during the 
interrogation. The senior investigator </p>

that in giving hot tea to Turgunov, the senior

suspects, accused persons and prisoners in 
custody by internal affairs bodies. The 
accused received a stern warning as a 
disciplinary action.

squad of the Republic&#8217;s Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, who were carrying out an operation 
to prevent and suppress illicit trafficking in 
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, 
known as Black Poppy 2008.  
</p>
<p>During the check, it was ascertained that the 
car in question was being driven by Mr. 
Abdurahmanov, who was unable to produce a 
driver&#8217;s licence. In addition, Mr. 
Abdurahmanov was not the owner of the car. 
With his permission, a canine patrol officer 
and a police dog inspected the vehicle. As a 
result, substances with a specific odor were 
discovered hidden in the boot of the car, 
wrapped in a paper and cellophane package. 
In the presence of witnesses, these substances 
were confiscated for forensic analysis and 
sealed, and the appropriate documentation 
was completed. The results of the chemical 
analysis performed on 7 June 2008 showed 
that the substances found included 114.18

sentenced to death on 17 February 2001. The 
appeals court upheld the death sentence. In 
September 2003, the Supreme Court confirmed 
the death sentence imposed on Abdullah 
Hussein al-Badi. After confirmation of the 
sentence by the President of Yemen, he was 
executed on 2 May 2005 (see 
A/HRC/4/33/Add.1, para. 335). 
</p>
<p>With regard to the case of Fatima Hussein al-
Badi, we have recently received information 
which was not available to us at the time of our 
letter of December 2005. These reports indicate 
that in September 2003 Section B of the 
Supreme Court found that Fatima Hussein al-
Bad<b>i</b> was not guilty of murder, but only of 
participating in hiding the victim&#8217;s body. It 
therefore quashed the death sentence and 
imposed a four years&#8217; prison term instead. 
Because of the death sentence imposed in the 
same Supreme Court judgment against Abdullah 
Hussein al-Badi, the case went to the President 
of Yemen for confirmation. The President 
ordered the Supreme Court to reconsider its 
findings and sentence regarding Fatima Hussein 
al-Badi. In August 2004, the Supreme Court 
sitting as General Assembly, reportedly 
overturned the judgment of Section B of the 
Supreme Court and reinstated the death penalty 
against Fatima Hussein al-Badi. She has been on 
death row since then. Her death sentence has 
reportedly not been carried out as a special 
appeal to the President by her defence lawyer 
remains pending.

reconsider its decision not to sentence Fatima
