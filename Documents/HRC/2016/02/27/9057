<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders conducted a country 
visit to Togo from 28 July to 4 August 2008 during which she met with senior government 
officials as well as a broad range of human rights defenders. The purpose of the visit was to 
assess the situation of human rights defenders in Togo in light of the principles set forth in the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p> Following an introductory section (I), in section II the Special Rapporteur presents the 
general context in which human rights defenders in Togo operate. Since 2005, Togo has been 
engaged in a process of political transition and, as a consequence, the prospects for the 
promotion and protection of human rights are improving. 
</p>
<p> In section III, the Special Rapporteur describes the legal and institutional framework for 
the promotion and protection of human rights in Togo. She welcomes the series of initiatives 
aimed at ensuring an environment conducive to the work of human rights defenders. She regrets, 
however, that insufficient funds are allocated to the institutions undertaking such initiatives. 
</p>
<p> In section IV, the Special Rapporteur details the current challenges faced by human rights 
defenders in Togo in their legitimate activities. She points out that defenders must first achieve 
unity and coordination within the defenders community. Other challenges include the 
stigmatization of defenders by authorities who see them as belonging to the political opposition, 
the plight of women defenders and the difficulties inherent to their work, unjustified delays in 
delivering registration certificates to NGOs, illegitimate restrictions on the exercise of the rights 
to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of opinion and expression, and impunity for past 
abuses against human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p> Finally, in section V the Special Rapporteur formulates her conclusions and 
recommendations for consideration by the Government. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251 and Human Rights Council 
resolution 7/8, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders conducted an 
official visit to Togo from 28 July to 4 August 2008, at the invitation of the Government of 
Togo. She was accompanied by Mrs Reine Alapini-Gansou, Special Rapporteur on human rights 
defenders of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. The joint visit between 
the United Nations (UN) and African Union Special Rapporteurs was the first of its kind by 
United Nations Special Procedures.<b>1</b>  
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation of human rights defenders in Togo in 
light of the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights 
and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter &#8220;the Declaration on human rights defenders&#8221; or &#8220;the 
Declaration&#8221;). An examination of the legal framework in the country, the institutional policies, 
and the mechanisms for promotion and protection of human rights were of particular importance 
to this assessment.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to renew her sympathy to the Government and people 
of Togo for the human casualties, the displacement of the population, the loss of property and the 
destruction of infrastructure caused by the major floods that affected the country shortly before 
the start of her visit. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Togo for the cooperation 
extended to her in preparation of, and during, her mission. During her visit, she was able to meet 
with the President; the Prime Minister; the Minister for Foreign Affairs; the Minister of Justice; 
the Minister for Security and Civil Protection; the Secretary-General and his staff of the Ministry 
of Human Rights and Consolidation of Democracy; the Prosecuting Attorney; the Director of the 
Prison Administration; the President and other members of the High Authority for Audiovisual 
and Communication; the Vice-President and other members of the National Human Rights 
Commission; the Chairperson and members of the Parliamentary Human Rights Commission; 
the Head of the Bar Association; a former Prime Minister; and the leaders of the three main 
political parties in Togo. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she was unable to meet the Minister 
of Territorial Administration and the President of the Constitutional Court, or their respective 
staff, despite repeated requests. 
</p>
<p>5. In addition to Lom&#233;, the Special Rapporteur visited Kpalim&#233; (Kloto prefecture) and 
Aneho (Lakes prefecture) where she met with the respective prefects and other local authorities. 
Because of the floods, the Special Rapporteur was unable to access Kara and other localities in 
the North as initially planned.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

</b>  The views expressed in the report are shared by the Special Rapporteur on human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders of the African Commission, but only bind presently the United Nations Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>6. Throughout her stay in Togo, the Special Rapporteur met a large segment of the civil 
society and human rights defenders engaged in the promotion and protection of a wide range of 
civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. These included members of 
non-governmental organizations, women human rights defenders, journalists, trade unionists, 
and lawyers.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur thanks all organizations and individuals who worked hard to 
coordinate her meetings with the defenders community. In particular, she thanks the 
Representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) in Togo, and staff, for the excellent support provided in organizing the visit as well as 
the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Heads of United Nations and regional agencies, and 
representatives of diplomatic missions with whom she hold meetings.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>II. GENERAL CONTEXT IN WHICH HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS 
OPERATE: A COUNTRY IN POLITICAL TRANSITION 
</b></p>
<p>8. Following the death of President Eyadema Gnassingb&#233; in February 2005, his son, 
Faure Gnassingb&#233;, was appointed President with the support of the military. Condemnation by 
the international community ensued, and Mr. Faure Gnassingb&#233; agreed to hold presidential 
elections in April 2005. He was elected President with 60 per cent of the vote, but the elections 
were marred by a large-scale outbreak of street violence and major violations of human rights, 
such as arbitrary killings, disappearances and torture. 
</p>
<p>9. In June 2005, the High Commissioner for Human Rights decided to establish a mission of 
enquiry to look into allegations of human rights violations in Togo committed from 5 February<b> 
</b>to 5 May 2005.<b> </b>The mission was headed by a Special Envoy appointed by the High 
Commissioner, who assessed the human rights issues arising from the conduct of the presidential 
elections of April 2005, verified reports of alleged violations, compiled information on the 
nature, causes and perpetrators of these violations, and prepared a report with recommendations 
aimed at combating impunity for human rights violations and on actions to prevent future 
violence in general. 
</p>
<p>10. In September 2005, OHCHR published the mission&#8217;s report, which emphasized the need to 
put an end to the culture of impunity that had prevailed during the 38 years of reign of the former 
President of Togo.<b> </b>According to the reports, between 400 and 500 people were reportedly killed 
and thousands wounded in Togo, and State authorities shoulder most of the blame. The mission, 
inter alia, recommended: that the principles of truth, justice and reconciliation must constitute the 
central foundation of all programmes addressing the crisis in Togo; the total reorganization of 
the judicial system; the sending of a high level (UN/Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS)) mission to emphasize the centrality of the human rights issue to the crisis in 
Togo; and in-depth reform of the army to make it republican and apolitical.<b>2</b> In November 2006,

l&#8217;&#233;lection pr&#233;sidentielle du 24 avril 2005&#8221;, 29 August 2005). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/12/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>OHCHR established a country office to assist the Government in designing policies to 
implement these recommendations, and more generally, to help build national capacities to 
protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>11. In August 2006, the Government of Togo and all opposition parties signed a Global 
Political Agreement,<b> </b>granting the opposition participation rights in the Government. In 
section 2.2, all signatories to the Agreement acknowledged that impunity for acts of political 
violence is a severe problem that Togo always experienced. They agreed that all major actors in 
Togo, in particular political parties and organizations of the civil society, contribute actively to 
its eradication. Finally, they agreed to establish two commissions: the first one will be tasked 
with shedding light on acts of political violence committed in the past, and examine ways and 
means to appease/sooth victims; the second one will propose measures to favour 
forgiveness/pardon and reconciliation.<b>3</b> On 28 July 2007, in relation to the establishment of the 
two aforementioned commissions, President Faure Gnassingb&#233; called for wide consultations 
among the civil society, religious authorities, traditional leaders and other major actors to seek 
their views on this matter. On 15 April 2008, President Faure Gnassingb&#233; launched the national 
consultations in the presence of members of the Government, all prefects, members of the 
Parliament, traditional leaders, representatives of the civil society and members of the 
international community.  
</p>
<p>12. In July 2008, a report on the findings of the national consultations was produced by 
OHCHR Togo.<b>4</b> It concludes that there is a real demand for truth, justice (including reparation), 
and reconciliation, and that Togo has a duty to meet this demand, because of the expectations of 
the population and Togo&#8217;s international human rights commitments. The report recommends 
that (a) the Government of Togo must take into consideration the qualitative findings of these 
consultations when establishing judicial and non-judicial mechanisms aimed at combating 
impunity in Togo; (b) because of the cost of the commissions, references to experiences in other 
countries and for the sake of efficiency, only one Truth and Reconciliation Commission with two 
subcommissions should be recommended, in accordance with the spirit of the Global Political 
Agreement; (c) in order not to exclude any victims of political violence, the period 1958-2005 
could be taken into consideration by the Commission; and (d) the Government must take all 
adequate measures to guarantee the security of witnesses, victims and alleged perpetrators, and 
must involve civil society in the search for solutions to questions pertaining to the fight against 
impunity. 
</p>
<p>13. Presently, the international community plays a significant role in assisting the Government 
of Togo in fulfilling its obligations under international human rights law. The European Union 
has been technically and financially assisting the country in the course of its reforms through 
the 22 commitments on democracy and human rights made by the Government of Togo

</p>
<p>in April 2004.<b>5</b> In 2007, ECOWAS put pressure on the Government to allow members of the 
civil society to monitor the parliamentary elections. Finally, the International Organization of the 
Francophonie (IOF), through its Observatory on Human Rights and Democracy, has been 
monitoring the human rights situation in the country.  
</p>
<p>14. Togo is, therefore, a country in political transition and, as a consequence, the prospects for 
the promotion and protection of human rights are improving. The next presidential elections, to 
be held in 2010, will be a decisive test for the Government&#8217;s will to uphold the basic principles 
of democracy and human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>III. LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE  
PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Domestic level 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Constitution 
</b>15. The Preamble, articles 50 and 140 of the Constitution of the Fourth Republic of Togo 
adopted in 1992 express the Togolese people&#8217;s attachment to human rights, and international 
legal instruments protecting human rights. According to article 50, &#8220;the rights and duties 
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and under other international human 
rights instruments ratified by Togo are deemed to be part of the Constitution&#8221;. Article 140 
specifies that all duly ratified or approved international instruments receive immediate national 
validity. In the event of a conflict between international treaties and national law, international 
treaties should take precedence.  
</p>
<p>16. The Togolese Constitution encompasses in its chapter II a set of human rights, including 
the right to equal treatment before the law (art. 11 (1) (2)), the right to be free from 
discriminatory treatment based upon any grounds whatsoever (art. 11 (3)), the right to life and to 
physical and mental integrity (article 13), the right to liberty and security of person (art. 15), the 
rights to freedom of movement (art. 22), freedom of thought, conscience, religion, cult, opinion 
and expression (art. 25), freedom of the press (art. 26), and freedom of association and peaceful 
demonstration (art. 30). Furthermore, the Constitution grants some economic, social and cultural 
rights, such as, inter alia, the right to health (art. 34), the right to education for children (art. 35), 
the right to work (art. 37), and the right to strike (art. 39). 
</p>
<p><b>(b) 1901 Act on Freedom of Association and Assembly 
</b>17. Law No. 40-484 of 1 July 1901, inherited from the French legal system and applicable in 
Togo since 1946, is the core domestic text governing the exercise of the right to freedom of 
association and assembly. This law establishes a regime of declaration in relation to the legal

</p>
<p>existence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs). NGOs may start activities on the ground 
once they have filed their statutes with the Ministry of Territorial Administration. Legal 
personality is granted to them upon delivery of a registration certificate (&#8220;r&#233;cipiss&#233;&#8221;) by the same 
Ministry. 
</p>
<p><b>(c) 2004 Press Code 
</b>18. In 2004, Togo adopted a new press code (Code de la Presse, Law No. 2004-015 
of 27 August 2004). This code is reportedly more favourable to the work of journalists as it 
decriminalizes the press offence related to defamation. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>19. Togo has ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in 1998, and its 
Protocol on the establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. Further, Togo 
is a party to the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and has signed the 
Protocol to the Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa.  
</p>
<p>20. Togo participated in the First Organization of African Unity Ministerial Conference on 
Human Rights in Africa, held from 12 to 16 April 1999 in Grand Bay, Mauritius. At the end of 
the conference, the Grand Bay Declaration and Plan of Action were adopted. Article 19 of the 
Declaration states that &#8220;[t]he Conference notes that the adoption of the UN Declaration on the 
Protection of Human Rights Defenders by the 54th Session of the [then] UN Commission on 
Human Rights marks a significant turning point, and calls on African governments to take 
appropriate steps to implement the Declaration in Africa&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>21. Togo further participated in the First African Union Ministerial Conference on Human 
Rights in Africa meeting on 8 May 2003 in Kigali, Rwanda, at the end of which the Kigali 
Declaration was adopted. Article 28 of the Declaration provides that &#8220;[t]he Conference &#8230; 
[r]ecognizes the important role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in general, and human 
rights defenders in particular, in the promotion and protection of human rights in Africa; calls 
upon Member States and regional institutions to protect them and encourage the participation of 
CSOs in decision-making processes with the aim of consolidating participatory democracy and 
sustainable development; and underscores the need for CSOs to be independent and transparent&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. The International Organization of the Francophonie (IOF), to which Togo is a member 
State, adopted the 2000 Bamako Declaration. Article 4 (D) (23) states that the IOF commits to 
&#8220;establish, generalize and strengthen national institutions of promotion of human rights, 
consultative or not, and to support the creation within national administrations structures 
dedicated to human rights, as well as the work of human rights defenders&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>23. In 2006, the IOF further adopted the Saint-Boniface Declaration. Article 31 of the 
Declaration states that Ministers and Heads of State French-speaking delegations &#8220;commit to 
promoting the work of human rights defenders and to ensuring their protection&#8221;. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>3.  International level 
</b></p>
<p>24. As at August 2008, Togo is a State party to the major United Nations human rights treaties, 
including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its First Optional Protocol </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>concerning the right of individual petition; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination; the 
Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women; the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Togo has 
signed but not yet ratified); and the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Optional Protocol 
on the involvement of children in armed conflict as well as Optional Protocol on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography.  
</p>
<p>25. Togo has signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, the Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p>26. Togo is also a party to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and to the Additional 
Protocols I and II. Togo is not a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Ministry for Human Rights and Consolidation of Democracy 
</b></p>
<p>27. In the Minister&#8217;s absence (away to head the Togolese delegation before the Committee on 
the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination), the Special Rapporteur met with the 
Secretary-General of the Ministry who apprised her on its work since its establishment in 1992.  
</p>
<p>28. The Ministry is mandated to: (a) promote and protect human rights, together with other 
ministries and institutions; (b) implement international human rights instruments ratified by 
Togo; and (c) ensure that citizens have access to information, training and sensitization on their 
rights, as well as popularize international instruments. The Ministry has reportedly organized 
a series of seminars, workshops, round tables, and sensitization tours in that respect. In 
December 2007, 14 lecturers toured high schools to present the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights to students. 
</p>
<p>29. In 2007, the Ministry elaborated, in collaboration with partners, a 4-year national plan of 
action and programmes of promotion and protection of human rights, with a series of short and 
long-term objectives. The five pillars of this plan are: (a) to improve the institutional and 
operational normative framework; (b) to educate citizens on human rights; (c) to establish a 
national documentation and information centre; (d) to reinforce national capacities; and (e) to 
reinforce collaborative mechanisms with partners. NGOs are reportedly the prime partners of the 
Ministry in advancing this plan. This plan was endorsed, with a large majority, by the Council of 
Ministers on 7 May 2007. A management unit and a piloting committee, composed of 
representatives of the Government, the legislative, the judiciary, the civil society, and the donor 
community, are in charge of monitoring the implementation of this plan. The Ministry is 
currently seeking funding for its plan. 
</p>
<p>30. In addition, a civil society unit has been established within the Ministry. This unit is 
mandated to design a consultation framework with representatives of civil society; provide legal 
assistance to human rights defenders; and seek, whenever possible, the involvement of human 
rights defenders in activities of promotion of human rights. To this end, the unit holds periodic 
meetings with NGOs to assess the partnership. The Special Rapporteur enquired whether the unit </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/12/Add.2 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>has raised awareness on the Declaration on human rights defenders. The Secretary-General 
responded that no popularization activity of the Declaration has yet been undertaken. However, 
within the context of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the tenth anniversary of the Declaration on human rights defenders, a series of activities aimed at 
promoting human rights and raising the profile of human rights defenders will take place, 
including a workshop on human rights defenders in October and a national tour in November 
presenting several international human rights instruments, including the Declaration on Human 
Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur was further informed that an inter-ministerial committee led by the 
Ministry, and of which the National Human Rights Commission is a member, is tasked with 
drafting reports for submission to United Nations treaty bodies and to the Human Rights Council 
on the Universal Periodic Review.<b>6</b> The committee acknowledges a reporting backlog, which is 
reportedly imputable to a lack of training of its members on how to draft these reports in a 
satisfactory manner. In July 2008, OHCHR-Togo delivered training on drafting skills to 
members of the committee, and co-developed with the committee a plan of action to deal with 
the backlog. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the work and series of initiatives undertaken by the 
Ministry, but regrets that it lacks resources. It is imperative that a more important budget be 
allocated to the Ministry so as to enable it to fulfil its mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Law enforcement authorities 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur met with the Minister of Security and Civilian Protection, and was 
briefed on the activities of the Ministry to which the police and the gendarmerie are attached. 
The Ministry is reportedly engaged in civil protection activities, notably linked to natural 
disaster. According to the Minister, the security situation in Togo is now satisfactory. If 
somebody complains to the Ministry for Human Rights and Consolidation of Democracy about a 
human rights violation, agents of the Ministry of Security will investigate the allegations. The 
Minister mentioned a general training on human rights for security forces posted in the country 
and to be deployed in United Nations peacekeeping missions. However, it appears that no 
training on the work of human rights defenders and on the Declaration on human rights 
defenders has been undertaken. The Special Rapporteur believes that sensitization to security 
forces on the work of human rights defenders is essential so as to make the environment of 
defenders more enabling. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur met with the Military Chief Commander and Heads of ground, 
navy and air forces. The two priorities of the military are to fight criminality and provide 
United Nations peacekeeping forces with soldiers. Currently, Togolese soldiers are serving 
in United Nations peacekeeping missions in Haiti, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and in Sudan&#8217;s Darfur region. In 
February 2007, the Parliament passed a law on the statutes of the Togolese armed forces. The 
law foresees that the army operates within the law, and that its role in the country is 
non-political. It does not address the accountability of security forces accused of human rights

<p>violations. The Special Rapporteur was further informed that since 1996, soldiers have been 
trained on international humanitarian law, most recently in 2007 and 2008. They have also 
received training on international human rights law, in cooperation with OHCHR-Togo, in 2007 
and 2008. However, specific training on human rights defenders is yet to be conducted. The 
Special Rapporteur reiterates her call on the military to organize such training in the near future, 
which it agreed to do so. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Parliamentary Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur met with the President of Parliament, the President of the 
Parliamentary Human Rights Commission (PHRC) and some of its members.  
</p>
<p>36. The PHRC is tasked with verifying that each draft bill pertinent to human rights conforms 
with international human rights instruments. The PHRC also sensitizes members of Parliament 
on human rights. 
</p>
<p>37. The PHRC has a steering committee composed of a member of the National Human Rights 
Commission, a member of the Togolese Coalition of Human Rights and a member of the Bar 
Association. It provides expertise on a range of human rights issues to members of the 
Commission, who are not human rights specialists. 
</p>
<p>38. In February 2008, the PHRC was briefed by OHCHR-Togo and the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union (ITU) on the &#8220;role of Parliaments in the implementation of international and regional 
human rights instruments&#8221;. The objective of the seminar was to familiarize members of 
Parliament with these instruments to enable them to guarantee the full application of basic 
human rights of Togolese citizens. A follow-up seminar was organized by OHCHR and ITU in 
the fall 2008. 
</p>
<p>39. The President of the PHRC stressed the good synergies with the Ministry for Human 
Rights and Consolidation of Democracy and the National Human Rights Commission. Each time 
an activity is organized by the Commission, the participation of the Ministry and the National 
Commission is actively sought.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the work of the PHRC, and takes note of the request 
made by the Commission to have its capacity strengthened. She calls on the Commission to 
continue its activities, and to propose an increase of the budget of the Ministry for Human Rights 
and Consolidation of Democracy. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Judicial system 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur was received by the Minister of Justice who introduced the judicial 
reform currently undertaken within the context of modernization of the justice system. In 2004, a 
diagnostic of the justice system was made, and the following problems were identified: lack of 
independence of the judiciary; limited access to justice by citizens; and insufficient capacity of 
magistrates. In August 2005, a five-year reform programme (2006-2011), financed by the 
United Nations Development Programme, the European Union and France, was adopted. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/12/Add.2 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>42. The six pillars of the judicial reform are: (1) strengthening the capacity of the judiciary to 
dispense justice, to ensure the fulfilment of the reform, and strengthening the capacity of prison 
administration; (2) modernizing judicial law, i.e. reforming the codes (civil, civil procedure and 
penal), and special legislations; (3) reinforcing the capacity of jurisdictions at first (25 courts) 
and superior levels (two appeal courts and one supreme court); (4) reforming the training of 
magistrates by establishing a training centre for magistrates, and making libraries available to 
them; (5) ensuring proper jurisdictional control of the activities of the State by establishing 
effective administrative jurisdictions and an audit court; and (6) ensuring a better access to 
justice for citizens by popularizing jurisdictional instruments and offering itinerant justice. 
</p><p>43. The implementation of the reform will be made possible by: (1) establishing a unit in 
charge of its supervision; (2) restructuring the Ministry of Justice; (3) rehabilitating the buildings 
hosting courts and justice services; and (4) establishing a national commission of modernization 
of the justice system which goal is to adopt the 18 core judicial texts. 
44. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this critical reform. Independence of the judiciary is 
vital for ensuring an environment conducive to the work of human rights defenders. However, 
she expresses concern at reports of ongoing internal and external pressure on magistrates at first 
level from magistrates from the superior level and high rank officials, instructing them to 
dispense justice in a certain manner on a number of cases. Reports of direct and indirect 
intimidation against magistrates in rural areas, and reports of nepotism in the nomination and 
promotion of magistrates were further brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur 
(magistrates from a certain ethnic group are favoured to others who may have better performed).  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur further regrets that, so far, there has reportedly been no training for 
magistrates and judicial officers on the Declaration on human rights defenders. Such training is 
of utmost importance to sensitize magistrates and judicial officers on the work of defenders.  
</p>
<p><b>5.  National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur met the Vice-President as well as several members of the National 
Human Rights Commission (<i>Commission Nationale des Droits de l&#8217;Homme</i> - CNDH). She was 
apprised of the work of the CNDH, and how it discharges its mandate. 
</p>
<p>47. The CNDH was officially inaugurated on 21 October 1987, but it ceased to exist four 
years later following the events that hampered democracy. In 1996, the CNDH was revived to 
bring it into line with article 152 of the Constitution. In 1999, the CNDH was accredited with 
A(r)-status, regarding its compliance with the Paris Principles, by the International Coordination 
Committee of National Institutions (ICC). In 2000, the reservation was removed, and in 2007, 
the A-status was confirmed by the ICC. 
</p>
<p>48. CNDH&#8217;s composition, organization and functions are provided under Organic Act 
No. 96-12 of 11 December 1996, as amended and completed by Organic Act No. 2005-004 
of 9 February 2005. According to article 3, the CNDH is composed of 17 members elected by an 
absolute majority by the National Assembly, including 2 persons proposed by the National 
Assembly; 1 magistrate; 1 lawyer; 1 law faculty professor; 1 doctor; 1 women rights activist; 
2 human rights activists; 1 child rights activist; 2 trade unionists; 1 traditional chief; 3 eminent </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>persons from a religious cult (catholic, protestant and Muslim); and 1 eminent person from the 
Togolese Red Cross and the Togolese Red Crescent. The duration of the mandate of the 
members of the CNDH is four years which can be renewed (art. 4). The current CNDH Bureau 
was elected on 23 February 2007, with Mr. Kount&#233; Koffi as President. 
</p>
<p>49. According to article 2, the main functions of the CNDH are: (a) to ensure the protection 
and defence of human rights in Togo; (b) to promote human rights by any means, in particular to 
examine and recommend to the public authorities all proposals related to human rights in order 
to have them adopted, to give opinions in the field of human rights, to organize seminars and 
conferences on human rights, to organize awareness-raising campaigns on human rights for the 
general public; and (c) to investigate cases of violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>50. Regarding the investigation function, any person who deems himself to have been a victim 
of a human rights violation may file a petition with the CNDH. The petition can also be filed by 
a third person or by an NGO. The CNDH also has the authority to initiate an investigation on its 
own initiative. The CNDH, at the request of its Chairperson or of one of its members, can act 
immediately on cases of human rights violations and may appoint a so-called &#8220;Special 
Rapporteur&#8221;. The &#8220;Special Rapporteur&#8221; can issue recommendations to the CNDH. If the human 
rights violation continues, the CNDH will meet at once to examine the report submitted by the 
&#8220;Special Rapporteur&#8221; and take all measures likely to end the situation.  
</p>
<p>51. In September 2007, the CNDH organized a workshop entitled &#8220;What collaboration for the 
protection of human rights of human rights defenders?&#8221;. It further held a round table for 
sensitizing State authorities and other actors, including NGOs, on the role of human rights 
defenders in monitoring elections. During these meetings, the CNDH noted that some members 
of the civil society requested the CNDH to design a consultative framework, undertake joint 
activities with NGOs with regard to campaigning, sensitizing and training on human rights, and 
exchange expertise on a range of human rights issues. These members would further like the 
CNDH to create a bank of information on human rights, and make it available to all human 
rights activists.  
</p>
<p>52. The CNDH has also acted in some instances as a mediator in conflicts between human 
rights defenders and law enforcement authorities as well as the High Authority for Audiovisual 
and Communication.<b>7</b> Finally, with regard to the violence surrounding the death of the former 
President, the CNDH constituted a working group in charge of investigating serious human 
rights violations. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur was informed that there are ongoing discussions within the CNDH 
to establish a human rights defenders focal point whose tasks would include: raising awareness 
on international and regional human rights instruments pertaining to the work of human rights 
defenders; ensuring that national legislation is in conformity with these instruments; offering 
legal assistance to human rights defenders; making recommendations to the Government, 
Parliament and other State institutions with regard to the situation of human rights defenders, 
</p>
<p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/12/Add.2

</p>
<p>and following up on these recommendations; and investigating human rights violations against 
defenders. The Special Rapporteur expresses her full support to this initiative which she believes 
will enhance the protection of human rights defenders, and their visibility within the State 
apparatus and the civil society.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur was also told that a draft bill calling on the inclusion of references 
to the Declaration on human rights defenders in national legislation is currently being prepared 
by the CNDH. The CNDH will then ask the Minister for Human Rights and Consolidation of 
Democracy to push for the draft bill to be adopted by the Parliament in the near future. The 
Special Rapporteur expresses her full support to this positive initiative. 
</p>
<p>55. However, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the CNDH suffers from a chronic lack 
of funding. The Government is reportedly the CNDH&#8217;s only donor, and not enough funds are 
reportedly allocated to the work of the CNDH. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government 
to increase the funds of the CNDH, and in the meantime encourages the CNDH to look for other 
sources of sponsorship. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also noted that the CNDH lacks visibility within the State 
apparatus and some parts of the civil society. Furthermore, from her discussions with various 
stakeholders, the Special Rapporteur observed a fairly widespread misconception of the CNDH&#8217;s 
role by State authorities and the civil society. A number of State officials see the CNDH as 
belonging to the civil society, and several members of the civil society see the CNDH as a direct 
emanation of the Government, lacking independence and impartiality.  
</p>
<p><b>6.  High Authority for Audiovisual and Communication 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur held a meeting with the President of the High Authority for 
Audiovisual and Communication (HAAC), and seven of its members. She was apprised of the 
statutes and work of the body. According to article 1 of the organic law of No. 2004-021 
of 15 December 2004, HAAC is an &#8220;independent institution vis-&#224;-vis administrative authorities, 
political power, political parties, associations and lobbying groups&#8221;. HAAC is composed of nine 
members: four are appointed by the President, and five are elected by the National Assembly, 
including two from a list proposed by organizations which are most representative of the 
profession of journalists and technicians of communication (art. 5 of Law 2004-021). Their 
mandate is five years renewable (art. 7). 
</p>
<p>58. According to article 21 of Law 2004-021, HAAC&#8217;s mission is to &#8220;guarantee and ensure 
freedom and protection of the press and other means of mass communication while respecting 
[inter alia, human dignity, public order and national unity, and ethics regarding information and 
communication]&#8221;. HAAC further ensures &#8220;respect for the pluralist expression of schools of 
thoughts in written communication and the audiovisual, particularly in relation with political 
information&#8221; (art. 22). HAAC is competent for &#8220;granting installation and broadcast licences to 
private television channels and radio stations&#8221; (art. 23). To fulfil its mission, HAAC may 
&#8220;request any information from administrations, persons and corporate entity so as to ensure that 
they respect their obligations; [HAAC may further] conduct enquiries and studies with these 
persons and corporate entity&#8221; (art. 36). </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>59. Article 53 details the range of sanctions at HAAC&#8217;s disposal. In case of non-respect of 
HAAC&#8217;s recommendations and formal demands, HAAC may impose a financial penalty, the 
provisional or definitive suspension of a programme or a part of the programme, the suspension 
of the authorization of broadcasting for a month maximum, the reduction of the length of the 
authorization within the limit of one year, and the removal of the authorization with or without 
the seizure of the antenna. In case of exceptional circumstances or breach of public order, the 
suspension of a programme, a part of the programme or of the authorization is pronounced by 
order of the President of the Tribunal and the President of HAAC. The suspension of a 
programme or a part of the programme may concern both official and private medias. Article 54 
states that the decisions of HAAC may be appealed before the administrative chamber of the 
Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>60. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the practice of regulatory bodies in relation to 
the media, she however raises concern about the lack of clarity regarding the guiding procedure 
of HAAC. She believes that in a number of instances, HAAC has arbitrarily sanctioned 
journalists in the exercise of their right to freedom of opinion and expression.<b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CURRENT CHALLENGES FACED BY HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Overview of the civil society in Togo 
</b></p>
<p>61. In the course of her visit, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to engage actively 
with members of civil society. Meetings were organized in the capital, in Kpalim&#233; and in Aneho, 
during which human rights defenders were able to voice their concerns. 
</p>
<p>62. Human rights defenders in Togo are active in the field of civil and political rights, and also 
with respect to economic, social and cultural rights (adequate housing, land, peasants, health, 
HIV/AIDS, education, development/reduction of poverty, water sanitation, etc.). Most of the 
defenders&#8217; activities are concentrated in the capital. Defenders in the countryside are less visible 
and aware of their rights and the opportunities offered to them.  
</p>
<p>63. On 18 July 2000, 11 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) decided to establish a 
network of organizations to facilitate their work in promoting and protecting human rights. The 
Togolese Coalition of Human Rights Defenders (<i>Coalition Togolaise des D&#233;fenseurs des 
Droits Humains</i>, CTDDH) was born in April 2002 in Lom&#233;. The CTDDH is now composed 
of 17 NGOs. Its mission is to ensure that all the necessary measures pertaining to the protection 
of human rights defenders are fully implemented, and to provide, in case of need, medical, 
psychological, social and judicial support to human rights defenders.  
64. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the creation of the CTDDH, she regrets that the 
civil society in Togo at large is fragmented and lacks coordination when advocating respect for 
human rights. The polarization of defenders&#8217; activities and the denial of legitimacy to a number 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  See paragraphs 86 and 87. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/12/Add.2 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>of NGOs perceived as backing governmental policies fuels suspicion and lack of trust among the 
NGO community. This is certainly detrimental to an environment conducive to the work of 
human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern about the ongoing stigmatization, by 
some authorities, tribal leaders and a part of the population, of defenders who are seen as 
belonging to the political opposition. She heard credible reports that some authorities refused to 
give legitimacy to the work of human rights defenders because they assimilated their work to 
political activism. This misperception, more acute outside the capital, generates a climate of 
mistrust between the State authorities and human rights defenders, and must be tackled seriously. 
Local authorities must be sensitized on the work of human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>66. As a consequence, some local authorities and tribal leaders have reportedly impeded the 
work of NGOs, notably with respect to their access to certain areas in the country by requiring 
reportedly unnecessary ministerial authorizations. Moreover, it was reported that during a 
meeting in December 2007, members of the Togolese section of Amnesty International were 
informed by the chief of the special delegation of Kara that they should not rely on local law 
enforcement authorities to provide them with protection in the course of their activities. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Plight of women human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>67. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with several women human rights defenders 
active in the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s rights in Togo. She held meetings with, 
among others, members of GF2D (Working Group on Women, Democracy and Development), 
WILDAF (Women in Law and Development in Africa), the German Service of Development, 
and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung. The Special Rapporteur was truly impressed by their courage 
and remarkable commitment in promoting and defending women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>68. Women human rights defenders in Togo have been active on sensitizing all local actors, 
including tribal leaders, on national, regional and international human rights instruments 
pertaining to the protection of women&#8217;s rights, and they have facilitated the access of women to 
these instruments. They have called on authorities to revise the reportedly discriminatory 
provisions of the code of personal and family law (<i>code des personnes et de la famille</i>) (notably 
the removal of article 391 governing the regime of inheritance for women), and to create an 
inter-ministerial committee to enable the perception of pensions for widows and orphans. They 
have highlighted the need of adopting specific penal legislation to fight violence against women, 
and have created medical and psychological clinics for women and children victims of sexual 
and gender-based violence.  
</p>
<p>69. Women human rights defenders have also worked on strengthening legal assistance to 
women. To this end, the Centre of Research, Information and Training for Women (<i>Centre de 
Recherche, d&#8217;Information et de Formation pour la Femme</i>, CRIFF) was established in 1994 in 
Lom&#233; and functions as: (a) a legal clinic opened to women (the first one in Togo) where they can 
obtain legal advice on their rights and how to redress violations of their rights; (b) a training 
centre for paralegal officers who act as intermediates between legal practitioners and the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>population: they are 580 in all Togolese prefectures and have popularized key provisions of the 
code of personal and family law; CRIFF has also trained civic education officers who have 
helped women to understand their rights better; and (c) a documentation and research centre on 
women&#8217;s issues. Other centres were established in Ts&#233;vi&#233;, Atakpam&#233;, Kara, Bafilo and Kpalim&#233;.  
</p>
<p>70. However, women defenders continue to face a series of challenges in their daily activities. 
First and foremost, women defenders are vulnerable to criticism and ostracism among their own 
families and communities. They are labelled as, inter alia, &#8220;bad mothers&#8221; and &#8220;family breakers&#8221;. 
Relatives of women defenders, such as spouses and children, are also the subjects of mockery. 
Women defenders further encounter discrimination within the organization or trade union they 
operate as their male colleagues often treat them with condescendence.  
</p>
<p>71. Hostility against female paralegal officers led to the closure of the CRIFF centre in Kara 
following threats received against these officers from tribal leaders and local authorities. Similar 
threats were reported in other rural parts of the country. The Special Rapporteur notes that it is 
becoming increasingly difficult for women defenders to operate safely in rural areas. Local 
authorities seem to do too little to investigate and prosecute the authors of the threats and other 
acts of intimidation. 
</p>
<p>72. Other difficulties reported to the Special Rapporteur include the scarcity of funding and 
resources for the centres run by women defenders (funding is provided by partners in 
development) as well as a lack of synergies between women&#8217;s organizations which fail to come 
up with a common strategy. Finally, a loss of momentum among women defenders was flagged 
as a growing number of women defenders are losing impetus because of a reported lack of 
improvement of the situation of women on the ground. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur expresses her full support to the commendable work of women 
defenders in Togo, and raises serious concern about the series of challenges they face in their 
legitimate activities. She highlights that women defenders need &#8220;specific and enhanced 
protection as well as targeted and deliberate efforts to make the environment in which they 
operate a safer, more enabling and accepting one&#8221;.<b>9</b>  
</p>
<p><b>C. Illegitimate restriction on the exercise of the right to 
freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p>74. Another hurdle largely reported to the Special Rapporteur is the systematic delay by the 
Ministry of Territorial Administration in delivering the registration certificate (&#8220;r&#233;c&#233;piss&#233;&#8221;) to 
NGOs.  Such delay is problematic in that NGOs are required by donors to produce this certificate 
in order to receive funding from them. Besides, without this certificate, NGOs cannot file a 
complaint before a court. Some NGOs are even prevented from operating outside the capital in 
the absence of this certificate. 
</p>

</b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders to the

<p>  A/HRC/10/12/Add.2 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>75. During the last meeting between the civil society unit of the Ministry for Human Rights 
and Consolidation of Democracy and representatives of the civil society, the issue of the 
registration certificate and other administrative hurdles was reportedly debated. The unit 
recommended to defenders, when faced with such problems, to inform it, and it committed to 
follow up with the Ministry of Territorial Administration on this issue. To this date, only one 
organization has contacted the Ministry for Human Rights in that respect, and a letter by this 
Ministry was addressed to the Ministry of Territorial Administration in order to convey a 
meeting so as to find a long-term solution. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this positive 
initiative, and encourages other organizations to use this leverage.  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she was not able in the course of her visit to draw the 
attention of the Minister of Territorial Administration or his staff to this serious issue because of 
the mobilization of the Ministry to respond effectively to the crisis caused by the floods. 
Nevertheless, she hopes that the Minister will take appropriate measures to address this serious 
issue. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Illegitimate restrictions to the exercise of the right to  
freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>77. During meetings with human rights defenders in the capital and prefectures, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that their exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly has 
proved to be problematic on several occasions. In accordance with the 1901 Act on Freedom of 
Association and Assembly, such exercise in Togo is governed by a regime of notification, i.e. the 
organizers must inform law enforcement authorities of their intent to hold a demonstration, 
which may refuse it if the demonstration is considered a threat to law and public order. 
</p>
<p>78. In September 2007, the Confederation of trade union workers of Togo (<i>Conf&#233;d&#233;ration 
Syndicales des Travailleurs du Togo</i>) intended to organize a peaceful march in Lom&#233; to protest 
against the high cost of living. During the last preparatory meeting with all the authorities 
concerned, a high level official reportedly arrived and strongly advised the organizers to cancel 
the march because the Government had received information that some individuals would try to 
infiltrate the march and vandalize public and private infrastructure, and that the police would 
be unable to ensure security of the public. To this date, the march has not taken place yet. 
The society of Togolese consumers tried to organize a similar march on 9 February and 
15 March 2008, and was faced with the same refusal. Other human rights defenders planned to 
organize a peaceful demonstration for criticizing the Government&#8217;s policy on HIV/AIDS issues, 
but they were too strongly dissuaded to undertake it.  
</p>
<p>79. In Kpalim&#233;, human rights defenders raised concern about the difficulty to organize 
demonstrations or public events. They reportedly need to seek the permission of the gendarmerie 
first, which is contrary to the principle of the aforementioned declaration. Then, the gendarmes 
reportedly sit in the first row as to intimidate the audience and the speakers. It seems even more 
difficult to organize public events involving youths, such as debates on human rights, because 
such events are reportedly seen by local authorities as constituting a potential threat to public 
order.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.2 
page 20

<p>80. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the reported limitations to the exercise of 
the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. She stresses that &#8220;the right to protest is an essential 
element of the right to participation in any democratic dispensation and restrictions imposed on 
this right must be closely scrutinized with respect to their necessity and reasonableness &#8230; [A] 
peaceful assembly that is threatened with violence should [not] itself be prohibited, [but] rather 
be assured of protection in accordance with State responsibility&#8221;.<b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b>E. Illegitimate restrictions to the exercise of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur held a meeting with professionals of the media who highlighted 
cases of assault and threats against journalists, and illegitimate restrictions to the exercise of their 
right to freedom of opinion and expression by HAAC, when advocating for human rights and 
good governance. 
</p>
<p>82. On 17 May 2007, Mr. Gautier Tekpor, a journalist at radio Kanal FM, was reportedly 
attacked by police officers wearing uniforms and driving a police car. This attack shocked the 
defenders community in Togo which got mobilized to obtain justice. However, despite several 
convocations of Mr. Tekpor by the Head of the Togolese armed forces, no arrest was undertaken 
and the perpetrators remain free.  
</p>
<p>83. During the counting of votes of the legislative elections of 14 October 2007, 
Mr. Sylvio Combey of Radio Nostalgie, who wanted to interview the president of the Local 
Independent Electoral Commission of Lom&#233; who reportedly left the poll station through the 
window with the results of the elections, was threatened by this authority to be arrested.  
</p>
<p>84. Mr. Carlos Ketohou, journalist and director of the <i>Ind&#233;pendant Express</i>, and his colleague 
Mr. Carmel Max, were convoked by HAAC in the presence of two army officers, following the 
publication in the edition dated 2 October 2007 of an article entitled &#8220;The soldier who &#8216;stole&#8217; the 
ballot box makes revelations and makes a call&#8221;. The article contained information on the soldier 
who was filmed while taking away a ballot box during the presidential elections in April 2005. 
The journalist was asked to produce the recording of the interview with the soldier, the picture of 
the interviewee, and all the evidence enabling HAAC and the military to authenticate the source, 
before 19 October 2007, otherwise the army would &#8220;act accordingly&#8221;. On 6 November 2007, 
Mr. Ketohu solicited the intervention of the CNDH to mediate in this case. On 
14 November 2007, Mr. Ketohu, the military, and the CNDH met at the HAAC premises in 
order to discuss the evidence in the case. No solution was found, and the case was brought before 
a judicial court. The case is reportedly still pending. 
85. In Aneho, human rights defenders expressed their distrust in local authorities when 
exercising their right to freedom of opinion and expression, and often censor themselves. For 
instance, they feared to criticize the increase of the price of cement.

</p>
<p>86. Human rights defenders further reported a curtailing of their freedom of opinion and 
expression by the HAAC in some instances. On 19 February 2008, HAAC suspended 
definitively the journalist activities of Mr. Daniel Lawson-Drackey, journalist at Nana FM, a 
private radio station in Lom&#233;, because the programmes of Mr. Lawson-Drackey were reportedly 
in breach of the principles of respect of human dignity and ethics with regard to information and 
communication. This decision was rejected by the Independent Journalist of Togo trade union 
which believed that the decision resulted from an erroneous interpretation of the Press Code. On 
21 February, Mr. Lawson-Drackey filed a petition before the CNDH, which considered HAAC&#8217;s 
decision to be abusive as it failed to produce any evidence of the substantive elements justifying 
the alleged violation, and recommended the HAAC to lift the definitive suspension of the 
journalistic activities of Mr. Lawson-Drackey.<b>11</b>  
87. In July 2008, HAAC suspended Radio Lumi&#232;re following the broadcast of a show on good 
governance during which listeners were calling to participate in the debate. The journalists were 
later convoked by HAAC. Upon arrival at HAAC&#8217;s premises, accompanied by members of the 
CNDH, they were informed that the meeting was cancelled. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the lack of professionalism of a number of Togolese 
journalists who often cover news in a sensationalist way. She advised journalists to enhance the 
credibility of the profession by conducting investigative journalism. Nevertheless, she wants to 
stress that, HAAC, when reviewing journalists&#8217; work, must balance carefully freedom of opinion 
and expression with ethics. To this end, the Special Rapporteur reminds HAAC of article 6 of the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, which states that &#8220;[e]veryone has the right, 
individually and in association with others: (<i>a</i>) To know, seek, obtain, receive and hold 
information about all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including having access to 
information as to how those rights and freedoms are given effect in domestic legislative, judicial 
or administrative systems; (<i>b</i>) As provided for in human rights and other applicable international 
instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge 
on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; (<i>c</i>) To study, discuss, form and hold opinions on 
the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, 
through these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters&#8221;.<b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b>F.  Obligation to address impunity for abuses against defenders 
</b></p>
<p>89. A major concern conveyed by human rights defenders to the Special Rapporteur is the 
question of impunity for violations committed against human rights defenders. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur stresses that justice is crucial for sustaining peace and encouraging 
and uplifting the work of human rights defenders. She expresses her support to the process of 
national consultations and to its outcome - the final report prepared by OHCHR Togo - and 
welcomes the will of the Government to implement the recommendations laid down in this

<p>report. In particular, she notes recommendation 6 (2) of the report which states that &#8220;[t]he 
Government &#8230; must involve the civil society in the search of solutions to questions pertaining to 
the fight against impunity&#8221;.<b>13</b>  
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur stresses that it is of utmost importance that the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission to be established addresses seriously and thoroughly all violations 
committed against human rights defenders: its credibility will be at stake. To this end, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the authorities that &#8220;[i]n the exercise of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms &#8230; everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to 
benefit from an effective remedy and to be protected in the event of the violation of those 
rights&#8221;.<b>14</b>  <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> Since 2005, Togo has been engaged in a process of political transition and, as a 
consequence, the prospects for the promotion and protection of human rights are 
improving. The legal and institutional framework for the promotion and protection of 
human rights enables human rights defenders to operate in a satisfactory way. In 
particular, the Minister for Human Rights and Consolidation of Democracy and the 
National Commission for Human Rights are the two most supportive institutions of the 
work of human rights defenders. However, both entities suffer from insufficient funding, 
which may impact on the situation of human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> Despite the above-mentioned framework, human rights defenders in Togo remain 
faced with a series of challenges that impede their legitimate activities. They must first 
achieve unity and coordination within the defenders community. Other challenges include 
the stigmatization of defenders by authorities who see them as belonging to the political 
opposition, the plight of women defenders and the difficulties inherent to their work, 
unjustified delays in delivering registration certificates to NGOs, illegitimate restrictions on 
the exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of opinion and 
expression, and impunity for past abuses against human rights defenders.  
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The 2010 presidential elections generate fear and anxiety among the human rights 
defenders community. The Government of Togo will have to fully allow human rights 
defenders to monitor these elections, which will echo its commitment to the principles of 
democracy and human rights.
