<p><i>Summary

<p>The present report contains information mostly covering the period from July 2011 to 
June 2012. Although the international community as a whole is moving towards abolition of 
the death penalty in law or in practice, some Member States have continued to use the death 
penalty during the reporting period. In some instances, international standards guaranteeing the 
protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty were not fully respected. In this 
regard, the report draws attention to a number of phenomena, including the ongoing difficulties 
in gaining access to reliable information regarding executions, the continued use of the death 
penalty in violation of international safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those 
facing the death penalty, in particular the use of the death penalty for crimes, such as drug 
offences, which could not be considered as &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, and its use against children 
under 18 at the time of the alleged offence and members of vulnerable groups, in particular 
individuals belonging to racial, religious, national, ethnic and sexual minorities. Attention is 
drawn to the forthcoming report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly on 
moratorium on the use of the death penalty, which will highlight, inter alia, national and 
international efforts made towards the universal abolition of the death penalty.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1.  In its decision 18/117 adopted on 28 September 2011, the Human Rights Council 
requested the Secretary-General to continue to submit to the Human Rights Council, in 
consultation with Governments, specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-
governmental organizations, a yearly supplement to his quinquennial  report on capital 
punishment and the implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights 
of those facing the death penalty, paying special attention to the imposition of the death 
penalty on persons younger  than 18 years of age at the time of the offence, on pregnant 
women and on persons with mental or intellectual disabilities. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report is submitted to update previous reports on the question of the 
death penalty, including the most recent quinquennial report of the Secretary-General 
(E/2010/10 and Corr.1 and 2) and previous reports submitted to the Council (A/HRC/4/78, 
A/HRC/8/11, A/HRC/12/45, A/HRC/15/19 and A/HRC/18/20). Attention is also drawn to 
the forthcoming report of the Secretary-General to the Assembly on moratorium on the use 
of the death penalty, which will outline national and international efforts made towards the 
universal abolition of the death penalty. The present report has been prepared on the basis 
of information received from States and other available sources, including United Nations 
agencies, international and regional bodies and non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Changes in law and practice 
</b></p>
<p>3.  Changes in law include new legislation abolishing or reinstating the death penalty, 
or restricting or expanding its scope, as well as ratifications of international and regional 
human rights treaties that provide for the abolition of the death penalty. Changes in practice 
cover mainly non-legislative measures reflecting a new approach regarding the use of the 
death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Countries that have abolished the death penalty for all crimes 
</b></p>
<p>4.  Approximately 150 of the 193 Member States of the United Nations have abolished 
the death penalty or introduced a moratorium, either in law or in practice. Reportedly, 175 
of the 193 Member States of the United Nations were execution-free in 2011.1  
</p>
<p>5. In December 2011, the Parliament of Latvia adopted amendments to several laws in 
order to abolish the death penalty in all circumstances. In the United States of America, in 
March 2012, the State of Connecticut adopted a law abolishing the death penalty, becoming 
the seventeenth state in the country to do so. On 6 November 2012, California will hold a 
referendum on whether to replace the death penalty with life imprisonment.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Countries that have restricted the scope of the death penalty or are 
</b></p>
<p><b>limiting its use 
</b></p>
<p>6. Even in countries where the application of the death penalty remains, some 
noticeable steps towards restricting its use were recorded during the reporting period. In 
particular, there were judicial, legislative and administrative developments in several 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Amnesty International, <i>Death Sentences and Executions in 2011</i> (London, 2012), p. 5. </p>


<p>countries with regard to the mandatory imposition of the death penalty and the procedural 
aspects of its implementation. 
</p>
<p>7. In some States, constitutional debates and reform processes addressed the question 
of the death penalty. The Republika Srpska introduced an amendment for the removal of 
provision for the death penalty in its Constitution.2 The Transitional Constitution of South 
Sudan, which came into force on 9 July 2011, provides for the inherent right to life, dignity 
and the integrity of his or her person which shall be protected by law. Furthermore, article 
21 of the Transitional Constitution places a restriction on the death penalty, providing that 
&#8220;no death penalty shall be imposed, save as punishment for extremely serious offences in 
accordance with the law&#8221;. It also precludes the imposition of the death sentence on a person 
</p>
<p>under 18 or a person who has attained the age of 70. It further states that &#8220;no death penalty 
shall be executed upon a pregnant and lactating woman save after two years of lactation&#8221;.3 
</p>
<p>8. In January 2012, the parliament of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Majlis) adopted the 
new Islamic Penal Code. According to article 90 of the new Islamic Penal Code, juveniles 
below 18 who commit offences under categories of <i>Hodoud</i> and <i>Qisas</i> (retribution in kind) 
will not be sentenced to death if the court decides, through forensic reports or any other 
appropriate means, that the offender did not have adequate mental maturity and ability to 
reason. Alternatively, the offender will be sentenced to one of the punishments under the 
category of Ta&#8217;zir, appropriate to her or his age. Although the amendment of the Islamic 
Penal Code does not end executions of juveniles in the country, it establishes new measures 
to limit sentencing to death. 
</p>
<p>9. In March 2012, China amended its Criminal Procedure Law to include enhanced 
procedures for suspects and defendants in capital cases, and provided some clarification 
regarding the role of lawyers in the final review process.4  
</p>
<p><b> C.   Countries that have ratified or committed to ratifying international and 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional instruments providing for the abolition of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>10. In March 2012, Mongolia became the seventy-fourth State party to the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the 
abolition of the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>11. In August 2011, the National Assembly of Benin approved a bill for the ratification 
of the Second Optional Protocol. On 28 February 2012, the President of Benin signed the 
documents ratifying the Protocol.   
</p>
<p>12. During the recent universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council Nigeria, 
Nauru, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Surinam, Samoa, Sao Tome &amp; Principe, Tajikistan, Togo, 
Tunisia and Zimbabwe expressed their intention to ratify the Second Optional Protocol.   
</p>
<p>13. In 2011, Honduras and Dominican Republic acceded to the Protocol to the American 
Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty; and Latvia ratified Protocol 
No. 6 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms concerning the abolition of the death penalty.

<p><b> D. Countries that have introduced a moratorium on executions 
</b></p>
<p>14. In September 2011, Sierra Leone established an official moratorium on the use of 
the death penalty. The Nigerian Attorney General and Minister of Justice reported in 
October 2011 that the country&#8217;s Government had introduced an official moratorium on 
executions.5 
</p>
<p>15. In January 2012, the President of Mongolia announced a moratorium on the use of 
the death penalty.6  
</p>
<p>16. In the United States of America, on 22 November 2011, Governor John Kitzhaber 
announced a moratorium on executions in the State of Oregon.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Countries that have reintroduced the use of the death penalty, extended 
</b></p>
<p><b>its scope or resumed executions 
</b></p>
<p>17. Some States have introduced the death penalty for crimes related to terrorism. In 
Nigeria, the National Assembly passed the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011, which states 
that &#8220;where death results from any terrorist act, the penalty shall be death sentence&#8221; (sect. 4, 
para. 2).7 In February 2012, the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act 2012 was adopted by 
Bangladesh&#8217;s national assembly (Jatiya Sangsad), which includes provision for death 
sentence as the maximum punishment.  
</p>
<p>18. Although, as noted in paragraph 8 above, the new Islamic Penal Code in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran establishes new measures to limit the sentencing to death of children, it 
has retained the death penalty in almost all instances that were punishable under the 
previous code and has expanded its scope in some cases.8 The new Penal Code still 
provides the death penalty for people charged with &#8220;action against national security&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i>Moharebeh</i> (enmity against God), <i>Mofsid-Fil-Arz</i> (corruption on earth), drug trafficking, 
rape, <i>Qisas</i> (retribution in kind) and certain other <i>hudud</i> crimes. In his report on the country 
(A/HRC/19/82, para. 8), the Secretary-General regretted that the new Islamic Penal Code 
failed to fully abolish the death penalty or restrict its imposition to only the &#8220;most serious 
crimes&#8221;, as stipulated in article 6, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>19. Article 111 of the Penal Code of Kuwait prohibits defamation of religion and 
currently provides for up to one year&#8217;s imprisonment and a fine. In April 2012, the National 
Parliament of Kuwait voted to amend the Penal Code to make blasphemy a crime 
punishable by death. This is despite an earlier call, in November 2011, from the Human 
Rights Committee to Kuwait to &#8220;revise its legislation on blasphemy and related laws &#8230; to 
ensure their strict compliance&#8221; with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
to which Kuwait is a State party (CCPR/C/KWT/CO/2, para. 24).  
</p>
<p>20. During the reporting period, the mandatory death penalty continued to be imposed in 
some States, including India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, 
Trinidad and Tobago and Zambia. However, some positive developments have been

<p>registered. In October 2011, the Attorney-General of Barbados announced that it would 
abolish the mandatory imposition of the death penalty in accordance with the decision of 
the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the <i>Boyce</i> v. <i>Barbados</i> case.9 In September 
2011, the Bombay High Court of India declared &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; section 31A of the 
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, which imposed a mandatory death 
sentence for drug trafficking.10 On 1 February 2012, also in India, the Supreme Court 
declared the mandatory imposition of the death penalty under the Arms Act 1959 
unconstitutional.11   
</p>
<p><b> III.  Enforcement of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>21.  Although the international community as a whole is moving towards abolition of the 
death penalty in law or in practice, some States continue to use the death penalty. 
Furthermore, as noted by the Secretary-General in previous reports,12 up-to-date and 
accurate global figures on the application of the death penalty are difficult to obtain. This 
difficulty arises from a lack of transparency on the part of many Governments in relation to 
the number and characteristics of individuals executed. Official figures on the use of the 
death penalty in 2011 were available only in a small number of countries. The data on the 
use of the death penalty continues to be classified as a State secret in some States. 
Furthermore, in some States, convicted inmates were not informed of their forthcoming 
execution, nor were their families and lawyers; and bodies of the executed inmates were not 
returned to the families.   
</p>
<p>22. According to non-governmental organizations, at least 18,750 people remained 
under death sentence at the end of 2011 and at least 680 people were executed worldwide 
during that year, excluding China. The exact number of executions carried out in a number 
of countries, including China, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Egypt, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and Viet Nam, was not available.13 In the first half of 2012, the use 
of the death penalty has continued or may have even increased in some countries. 
According to some reports, Iraq executed 65 people in first 40 days of 2012.14 In May 2012, 
the Iranian authorities confirmed that 35 executions had taken place.15 According to the 
Ministry of Justice of Japan, three prisoners were executed on 29 March 2012; these 
executions were the first to take place since July 2010.16

<p><b> IV. Application of the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the 
rights of those facing the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>23. The standards that seek to protect the rights of those facing the death penalty are set 
out in international human rights law, in particular in article 6 of the Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and article 37 (a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
Furthermore, in an annex to its resolution 1984/50, the Economic and Social Council set 
out the minimum international standards that provide safeguards for guaranteeing 
protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty. The Economic and Social 
Council, in its resolution 1996/15, called upon Member States in which the death penalty 
had not been abolished to effectively apply these safeguards guaranteeing protection of the 
rights of those facing the death penalty. The Commission on Human Rights, in its 
resolution 2005/59, reaffirmed the importance of the safeguards, as did the General 
Assembly in its resolutions 62/149, 63/168 and 65/206. 
</p>
<p><b> A.  </b>Restriction of use of the death penalty to &#8220;most serious c<b>rimes</b>&#8221;<b>  
</b></p>
<p>24. In accordance with article 6, paragraph 2, of the Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, in States that have not abolished the death penalty, it may only be imposed for the 
&#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; (A/63/293, para. 32; and for discussion on &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;), 
that is, intentional crimes with lethal or other extremely grave consequences. The 
application of this safeguard in recent years has focused on the use of the death penalty for 
crimes that are not intentional and that do not have lethal or other extremely grave 
consequences. In particular, imposing the death penalty for drug-related offences is in 
violation of article 6, paragraph 2, and the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights 
of those facing the death penalty.17  
</p>
<p>25. Harm Reduction International reported that there are currently 32 States or territories 
that prescribe the death penalty for drug-related offences.18 It further reported that hundreds 
of people are known to have been executed for drug-related offences in 2011 and early 
</p><p>2012. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, a new anti-narcotics law came into force in 2011, 
which expands the application of the death penalty to new drug-related offences, including 
through increasing the range of prohibited substances. In a press statement on 22 September 
2011, a number of special rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council condemned the 
continuing execution of persons charged with drug-related offences, stressing that these do 
not amount to the most serious crimes for which the death penalty may be applied under 
international law.19 The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has reported that there were 670 executions in Iran in 2011, of which 81 
per cent were of drug offenders, including people believed to be children under 18 at the 
time the offence was committed (A/HRC/19/66, paras. 20&#8211;21).20 A total of 51 alleged drug

<p>offenders were executed in the first six weeks of 2012.21 There are around 4,000 Afghan 
refugees on death row for drug-related offences in the Islamic Republic of Iran.22 In 
Indonesia, 50 of 87 individuals on death row have been convicted of drug-related offences, 
although no execution has been carried out since 2008.23 Singapore has reportedly executed 
326 drug offenders since 1991, including two that were executed in 2011.24 An unknown 
number of people have been put to death in China and the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea for drug-related offences and at least 27 people were sentenced to death in 2011 in 
Viet Nam for smuggling drugs.25 Nine death sentences for drugs-related offences were 
handed down in Thailand in 201126 and as of early 2012 there were at least 245 people on 
death row for drug offences there.27 In this regard, a reported amendment to the Narcotics 
Act of Viet Nam, which would shorten appeals times and expedite executions, is of 
significant concern because of the number of people on death row and the drug offenders 
among them. 
</p>
<p>26. Nearly every State in the world has become a party to treaties28 that include 
obligations to take steps to reduce supply of, and demand for, controlled drugs through the 
imposition of sanctions; confiscation of proceeds; provision of mutual legal assistance in 
investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings and other forms of cooperation and 
training. However, as 32 countries or territories prescribe the death penalty for drug-related 
offences, cooperative assistance &#8211; such as technical or financial aid, provision of materials, 
intelligence-sharing and mutual legal assistance &#8211; could facilitate the apprehension of 
alleged drug offenders, who may be subject to the death penalty in violation of international 
human rights law. There has been developing recognition of the need to systematize 
international law enforcement efforts to ensure that cross-border cooperation does not lead 
to penalties that would violate international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>27. Donor States and international organizations that provide support to drugs-control 
projects in retentionist States need to ensure that such assistance does not facilitate and 
legitimize the use of the death penalty in cases that would not be acceptable in accordance 
with international standards and safeguards. In this regard, in May 2012, the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crimes (UNODC) published a paper to articulate its position on the 
promotion and protection of human rights as part of its work. Taking note of applicable 
international standards, the paper noted that if &#8220;a country actively continues to apply the 
death penalty for drug offences, UNODC places itself in a very vulnerable position <i>vis-&#224;-
vis</i> its responsibility to respect human rights if it maintains support to law enforcement 
units, prosecutors or courts within the criminal justice system&#8221;. It further noted that &#8220;at the 
very least, continued support in such circumstances can be perceived as legitimizing 
government actions. If, following requests for guarantees and high-level political

but to employ a temporary freeze or withdrawal of support&#8221;.29 
</p>
<p>28. The use of the death penalty for non-violent acts such as financial crimes, religious 
practice or expression of conscience and sexual relations between consenting adults that 
may not constitute &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; under international human rights law is also a 
particular concern.30 For instance, in February 2012, a district court in Pakistan confirmed 
the death sentence of a Pakistani national, who is resident in the United States of America, 
for blasphemy crimes under its penal law. 
</p>
<p>29. In Saudi Arabia, the death penalty is applied in respect of a wide range of offences 
that cannot be considered &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, including apostasy and sorcery. 
Reportedly, in 2011, two individuals were executed for sorcery. In February 2012, a Saudi 
national was forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia from Malaysia, after he had left the country 
amid death threats for information posted on the social medium Twitter. He was accused of 
apostasy, punishable by the death penalty, for his statements on Twitter.31  
</p>
<p>30. According to some reports, the death sentence against an Iranian national residing in 
Canada for &#8220;insulting and desecrating Islam&#8221; was confirmed by the Supreme Court of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran on 17 January 2012.32 On 28 February 2012, the Amnesty and 
Clemency Commission of the Islamic Republic of Iran rejected a request for pardon for a 
death sentence against a Persian literature lecturer at the Payam-e Nour University for 
crimes of <i>Moharebeh</i> (fighter against God) for his alleged links with a banned opposition 
group.33  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Fair trial guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>31. The death penalty may be carried out only pursuant to a final judgment rendered by 
a competent court after a process which gives all possible fair trial safeguards, at least equal 
to those contained in article 14 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the 
right of anyone suspected of or charged with a crime for which capital punishment may be 
imposed to adequate legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings. 
</p>
<p>32. During the reporting period, human rights treaty bodies continued to address issues 
of fair trial standards relating to the death penalty in their dialogues with State parties 
during the consideration of their periodic reports. For instance, while acknowledging the de 
facto moratorium on the death penalty in Ethiopia, the Human Rights Committee stated that 
it remained concerned that death sentences were still imposed by Ethiopian courts for 
crimes which appear to have a political dimension, as well as following in absentia trials

<p>without adequate legal safeguards under articles 6 and 14 of the Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (CCPR/C/ETH/CO/1, para. 19). With regard to the situation in Belarus, the 
Committee against Torture stated its deep concern at reports that some death row prisoners 
were not provided with fundamental legal safeguards (CAT/C/BLR/CO/4, para. 27). In the 
light of the continued existence of the death penalty in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, 
the Human Rights Committee recommended that, in relation to all persons accused of 
capital offences, the State party should ensure that every article 6 requirement was strictly 
complied with and that the assistance of counsel, through legal aid as necessary, be 
provided immediately on arrest and throughout all subsequent proceedings to persons 
accused of serious crimes, in particular in cases concerning offences carrying the death 
penalty (CCPR/C/VCT/CO/2, para. 6). 
</p>
<p>33. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed concerns 
with regard to the lack of a fair trial in death penalty cases in a number of States. For 
instance, in January 2012, the High Commissioner expressed her concerns at reports that 34 
individuals, including two women, were executed in Iraq on 19 January following their 
conviction for various crimes. She expressed particular concern regarding &#8220;the lack of 
transparency in court proceedings, major concerns about due process and fairness of trials, 
and the very wide range of offences for which the death penalty can be imposed in Iraq&#8221;.34 
In April 2012, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) expressed serious concerns that the de facto authorities in Gaza in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory continued to issue death sentences and carry out executions, especially 
since many of the death sentences were handed down by military courts against civilians, 
and the use of military tribunals to try civilians in Gaza seriously undermined fair trial 
guarantees.35  
</p>
<p>34. In April 2012, United States officials announced that Khalid Sheik Mohammed and 
his four co-defendants would face the death penalty for their alleged role in planning the 
9/11 attacks. The American Civil Liberties Union commented that the United States Federal 
Government&#8217;s decision to seek the death penalty in military commissions at Guant&#225;namo 
Bay against numerous defendants accused of terrorism rather than in federal courts raised 
concerns under international law.36   
</p>
<p>35. In Bahrain, the Court of Cassation, in a decision adopted on 9 January 2012, 
overturned the death sentences of the people who were convicted for alleged killings during 
the protests in February and March 2011. Reportedly, these sentences had been imposed 
after grossly unfair trials before a military court &#8211; the National Safety Court &#8211; set up under 
emergency rule.37   
</p>
<p>36. The Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network reported that in many countries in Asia, 
specifically in death penalty cases, the right to a fair trial was impeded by laws which 
denied due process. Even in countries where due process safeguards existed in principle, 
including in specific laws, they often did not apply in practice.38 The International 
Commission against the Death Penalty also expressed its concerns regarding the imposition

Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan and the United States of America.39 
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to consular services for foreign nationals 
</b></p>
<p>37. Access to consular services for foreign nationals is also an important aspect of the 
protection of those facing the death penalty. All States should take every possible action to 
ensure reciprocal compliance with this safeguard, in line with the relevant provision on the 
right to seek consular service under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  
</p>
<p>38. In 2011, at least 79 people were reportedly executed in Saudi Arabia. Among them, 
many were migrant workers,40 deprived of protection under the Vienna Convention and 
sentenced to death without respect of fair trial standards. Several human rights and migrant 
organizations reported that the information of the beheading of an Indonesian migrants 
worker on 18 June 2011 had not been known by the Indonesian Consulate General and 
related institutions, and that she had been tried without a defence lawyer.41 In July 2011, the 
President of Indonesia formed a taskforce to defend Indonesian migrant workers that are 
facing the death penalty abroad.  
</p>
<p>39. Amnesty International reported that foreign nationals continued to be sentenced to 
death in China.42 A Pakistani man was executed by lethal injection on 21 September 2011 
after the Supreme People&#8217;s Court in Beijing had approved his death sentence for drug 
trafficking. Reportedly, he had not received adequate consular assistance during his trial 
and detention.  
</p>
<p>40. In July 2012, Humberto Garc&#237;a Leal, a Mexican citizen, was executed by the State of 
Texas in the United States, despite a ruling of the International Court of Justice in 2005 that 
the United States had violated article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in 
the case of 51 Mexican men, including Humberto Garc&#237;a Leal, who had been sentenced to 
death in that country. The International Court of Justice ordered the United States to 
provide judicial &#8220;review and reconsideration&#8221; of the convictions and sentences to determine 
if these individuals had been put to trial and sentenced without being granted access to 
consular services.43 The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also condemned the 
judicial execution by the United States of Humberto Leal Garc&#237;a in defiance of 
precautionary measures granted in his favour and without having complied with the 
recommendations issued by the Commission in the Merits Report on the Humberto case.44  
</p>
<p>41. On 2 November 2011, a petition was submitted to the Inter-American Commission 
on Human Rights, against the United States, on behalf of Ivan Teleguz, who was on death 
row in the State of Virginia. It was alleged that Mr. Teleguz did not receive an effective and 
adequate defence, that his due process rights were not respected and that he was arrested, 
tried and sentenced to death without having been informed of his right to contact Ukrainian 
consular officers, as provided for in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. On 22 
December 2011, the Inter-American Commission notified the United States that

<p>precautionary measures had been granted on behalf of the alleged victim, and requested a 
stay of execution until such time as it should pronounce on the merits of the petition.45 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Pardon or commutation  
</b></p>
<p>42. Amnesty International recorded pardons or commutations of death sentences in 33 
States.46 This practice could be seen as a sign that: a growing number of States accept that 
in some cases death sentences or executions are inappropriate for the crimes allegedly 
committed, or the legal process that led to the conviction is not consistent with international 
standards; and that by avoiding executions, they wish to undertake steps to protect the right 
to life in line with national law and their obligations under international law.  
</p>
<p>43. In April 2011, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of independence, the 
Government of Sierra Leone pardoned at least four death row prisoners, including one 
woman, and commuted all other death sentences to life imprisonment, except one.47 On 27 
April 2011, the President of Sierra Leone commuted all death sentences to life 
imprisonment and three death-row prisoners were granted pardon (A/HRC/18/10, para. 29). 
In Myanmar, on 2 January 2012, the death sentences of all 33 inmates on death row were 
commuted to life imprisonment by Presidential Order. In April 2012, King Mohammed of 
Morocco commuted five death sentences to terms of imprisonment.48 On 14 February 2012, 
a presidential amnesty was introduced in Tunisia, which led to commuting death sentences 
of 122 convicts to life imprisonment (A/HRC/WG.6/13/TUN/1, para. 63). 
</p>
<p>44. In some cases, death sentences against children who were under 18 at the time of the 
offences were commuted or pardoned by the judiciary or the executive authorities. For 
instance, on 2 April 2012, the Constitutional Court of Sudan issued a decision rejecting the 
death penalty imposed on a person under 18 in the Red Sea State. After continuous 
advocacy and psychosocial and legal aid provided by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF), OHCHR and other international organizations, the death sentence pronounced 
against three juveniles was commuted by the Appeal Court in Mauritania in December 
2011 to 12 years&#8217; imprisonment, the maximum penalty for minors under national law. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Methods of execution  
</b></p>
<p>45. In its resolution 1996/15, paragraph 7, the Economic and Social Council urged 
States to effectively apply the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners in 
order to keep to a minimum the suffering of prisoners under sentence of death and to avoid 
any exacerbation of such suffering.  
</p>
<p>46. During the reference period, executions were reportedly carried out publicly in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia and 
Somalia.49 Contrary to previous years, no execution by stoning was recorded during the 
reporting period. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the new Islamic Penal Code, passed by its 
parliament in January 2012, does not provide provision for punishment by stoning. The

<p>Secretary-General, in his report on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, welcomed the omission of punishment of stoning and details of this method of 
execution in the Code (A/HRC/19/82, para. 8). 
</p>
<p><b> V. Use of the death penalty on children, persons with mental or 
intellectual disabilities and other vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Children  
</b></p>
<p>47. Article 37 (a) of the Convention of the Rights of the Child, which is in force in 193 
States, reaffirms the internationally accepted standard50 that the death penalty cannot be 
imposed for a crime committed by a person who at that time was under 18 years of age, and 
stresses that &#8220;life imprisonment without possibility of release shall [not] be imposed&#8221; for 
such persons.   
</p>
<p>48. On 23 March 2012, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 19/37 on the 
rights of the child. The resolution includes safeguards with regard to the right of juvenile 
offenders not to be sentenced to death and to be removed from death row; a rebuttable 
presumption of age in favour of juvenile offenders; and access of children of parents 
incarcerated on death row to their parents and to information concerning their parents&#8217; 
status. 
</p>
<p>49. Despite the clear prohibition under international human rights law, some States 
continue to use the death penalty against persons below the age of 18 at the time of the 
alleged offence. The full overview of actual cases of executions of children, children on 
death row and children at high risk of receiving death penalty is not available due to the 
lack of available information and the lack of monitoring capacity of various actors. 
However, reportedly, executions of juveniles were carried out in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, Saudi Arabia and Yemen during the reporting period. A boy, 17 years old at the time 
of execution, was publicly hanged on 21 September 2011 in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
This was the third officially acknowledged execution of a juvenile offender, after two 
juvenile offenders had been executed in the southern port of Bandar Abbas in April 2011. 
In Saudi Arabia, Bandar bin Juza&#8217; bin Rumaithan al-Luhaibi was executed on 10 October 
</p><p>2011. He was identified in a Ministry of Interior statement as a &#8220;juvenile&#8221;, but there is no 
indication of his age at the time of the alleged offence or the execution. In January 2012, 
the Attorney General in Yemen rejected final appeals against the death sentences for Fuad 
Ahmed Ali Abdulla and Muhammed Taher Thabet Samoum, both of whom possibly were 
under 18 years old when they allegedly committed their crimes in 1999 and 2004, 
respectively. Fuad Ahmed Ali Abdulla was executed in January 2012.  
</p>
<p>50. Sentencing of juveniles to death also continued in some States. In Sudan, two 
juvenile prisoners under 18 at the time of the alleged crimes were sentenced to death under 
the 2005 Terrorism Act and the Sudanese Criminal Act, and the sentences were 
subsequently upheld by the Special Criminal Court in North Darfur on 29 November 2011. 
In November 2011, the Supreme Court of the Islamic Republic of Iran approved the death 
penalty for a boy, who was only 16 when he committed alleged crimes of murder and 
robbery.  
</p>
<p>51. In her work, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence 
against Children promotes the implementation of the recommendations of the United 
</p>
<p>  
 50 See for example article 6, paragraph 5, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </p>


<p>Nations study on violence against children, which called upon States to ensure that no 
person below 18 at the time of the alleged offence was subjected to the death penalty, to 
immediately suspend the execution of all persons sentenced to death for crimes committed 
before they were 18, and to ensure the abolition of the death penalty as a sentence as a 
matter of highest priority (A/61/299, para. 97). The Special Representative conducted a 
global progress survey to assess follow-up ensured to the recommendations of the study on 
violence against children, which contained queries on capital punishment imposed for 
offences committed by persons below the age of 18 years. The information received from 
States and other partners confirm that the large majority of countries have outlawed the 
death penalty, as well as life imprisonment and other forms of inhuman sentencing and 
punishment for children. 
</p>
<p>52. During the past year, the Special Representative also continued her support to the 
campaign to end all inhuman sentencing of children, including the death penalty, launched 
with the Child Rights Information Network. As a result of her efforts, special emphasis was 
placed on the adoption of national legislation in many States, banning all forms of violence 
against children, including capital punishment, and on the implementation of international 
human rights standards within the justice system, with priority attention given to the 
abolition of death penalty and the suspension of execution of death penalty sentences 
imposed for offences committed by persons under 18. In close collaboration with her 
partners, the Special Representative will continue to pursue advocacy efforts at the global, 
regional and national levels to achieve the universal abolition of death penalty, and to 
protect all persons below the age of 18 at the time of the alleged offence from the 
imposition of inhuman sentencing and of any other form of violence.  
</p>
<p>53. On 30 September 2011, the Committee on the Right of the Child devoted its day of 
general discussion to the topic of &#8220;Children of incarcerated parents&#8221; and sought to raise 
awareness about and explore child rights issues related to children of incarcerated parents. 
The main points of discussion addressed included the impact on children of a parent&#8217;s 
involvement with all stages of the criminal justice process, including coping with a parent 
in cases involving capital punishment. Several civil society and human rights provided 
submissions focusing on these issues.51 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Persons with mental or intellectual disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>54. In accordance to Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/64, paragraph 1 (d), 
States should eliminate the death penalty &#8220;for persons suffering from mental retardation or 
extremely limited mental competence, whether at the stage of sentence or execution&#8221;. This 
was reiterated by the Commission on Human Rights through resolution 2005/59. 
</p>
<p>55. Human rights organizations reported that, despite a significant national ruling 
providing that the execution of death row inmates with &#8220;mental retardation&#8221; violated the 
Eighth Amendment,52 the United States had continued to execute severely mentally ill 
persons. For instance, in February 2012, Edwin Turner was executed in Mississippi. He had 
been released from a mental hospital just weeks before the murder for which he was 
convicted. Despite the constitutional prohibition, the United States also continued to 
execute intellectually disabled individuals during the reporting period. In February 2012, 
Robert Moorman was executed in Arizona, despite the fact he had been diagnosed with 
mental retardation and attended special education classes as a child. He was first admitted 
to a mental health hospital at 13 years old. The United States Supreme Court recently

<p>granted review in two cases dealing with this issue.53 The Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights is currently considering two claims against the United States with respect to 
the imposition of the death penalty against persons with mental or intellectual disabilities.54  
</p>
<p><b> C. Discrimination in the imposition of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>56. Discrimination continues to have a distorting effect in various aspects of private and 
public life, including in criminal justice. In particular, instances have been recorded of 
individuals for whom membership of a minority constituted a significant factor in the 
decision that led to their sentence to death and execution. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
members of Ahwazi Arab, Baluoch and Kurdish and minorities were reportedly targeted 
and the death penalty imposed against them (A/HRC/19/66, paras. 62&#8211;66). In May 2011, 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions drew the attention 
of the authorities in Iran to two members of the Kurdish minority at risk of imminent 
execution. Both individuals were accused of <i>Moharebeh</i> (fighting against God), had their 
death sentences upheld by the Supreme Court for the second time in 2011 and their files 
were subsequently sent for implementation of the sentence. In December 2011, the 
commutation of the death sentence of another Kurdish activist to lifetime imprisonment 
was reported. The accused was sentenced to death on charges of <i>Moharebeh</i> for her alleged 
membership in an opposition group, defined as a terrorist group in Iran (A/HRC/19/82, 
para. 63). In March 2012, Amnesty International reported that five members of the Iranian 
Ahwazi Arab minority were at imminent risk of execution in public after their death 
sentences had been upheld by the Supreme Court.55  
</p>
<p>57. The Human Rights Committee expressed concern about discrimination against 
members of the Christian minority in the Islamic Republic of Iran, including arrests based 
on charges of proselytizing and a ban on conducting Christian services in Farsi. The 
Committee also noted with concern that individuals who have converted from Islam have 
been arrested and that article 225 of the Penal Code was aimed at making the death penalty 
mandatory for convicted male apostates (see CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3).  
</p>
<p>58. The High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that, in at least five countries, 
the death penalty may be applied to sexual minorities, in particular those found guilty of 
offences relating to consensual, adult homosexual conduct (A/HRC/19/41, para. 45). In 
November 2011, the Human Rights Committee expressed concern that members of the 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community in the Islamic Republic of Iran face 
harassment, persecution, cruel punishment and even the death penalty 
(CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3). The country&#8217;s new Islamic Penal Code, adopted in January 2012, 
provides for the death sentence for sodomy (art. 235) and for the non-Muslim party in 
same-sex relations not involving penetration (art. 233). In Liberia, in February 2012, a bill 
was reportedly tabled to amend section 2.3 of the Domestic Relations Law to prohibit 
same-sex relations and make such relations publishable by penalties ranging from one 
year&#8217;s imprisonment to death.

<p>59. In the United States, the North Carolina Racial Justice Act 2009 allows defendants 
in death penalty cases, for the first time, to use statistical evidence to show systemic bias in 
the imposition of the death penalty. If a defendant successfully proves that race was a 
significant factor in decisions to seek or impose the death penalty at the time of his or her 
trial, the court is required to convert that sentence to life in prison. In April 2012, a North 
Carolina judge found statistical evidence of racial bias in a death penalty case, commuting 
the death sentence of Marcus Robinson to life without parole. The Court concluded that 
&#8220;race was a materially, practically and statistically significant factor&#8221; in the decision to 
exercise peremptory challenges during jury selection&#8221; and &#8220;in the decision of prosecutors&#8221; 
at various stages of the trial of Mr. Robinson from 1990 to 2010.56

<p>60.<b> Developments in the practice of States with respect to the death penalty clearly 
indicate a growing trend towards abolition. Over the past few decades, the balance 
</b></p>
<p><b>has shifted between a substantial majority of States that maintained the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p><b>to these States becoming a minority. Furthermore, it may be noted that States that 
</b></p>
<p><b>have abolished the death penalty or are moving towards abolition represent different 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal systems, traditions, cultures and religious backgrounds.  
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> The development of international legal standards and jurisprudence in relation 
to the death penalty has also continued. International and regional human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>instruments strictly limit the application of the death penalty or aims to abolish it. 
</b></p>
<p><b>While article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights permits the 
</b></p>
<p><b>use of the death penalty in limited circums</b>tances, it also provides that &#8220;n<b>othing in this 
</b></p>
<p><b>article shall be invoked to delay or to prevent the abolition of capital punishment by 
</b></p>
<p>any State Party to the present Covenant&#8221; (para<b>. 6). The Second Optional Protocol to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Covenant aiming to abolish the death penalty was adopted in 1989. In the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international criminal law context, the statutes of international and hybrid criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>tribunals established or supported by the United Nations for the former Yugoslavia, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Cambodia and Lebanon all exclude the death penalty as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible sentence for relevant crimes. Similarly, in accordance with the Rome Statute 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the International Criminal Court the death penalty shall not be imposed by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Court, a fact that is often cited as evidence of a trend towards universal abolition of 
</b></p>
<p><b>capital punishment.   
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> Some States, however, still retain the death penalty in law. A smaller number 
thereof continue to impose it, and thousands of individuals are still executed each 
</b></p>
<p><b>year. In some cases, children under 18</b> <b>at the time of the alleged offence and 
individuals belonging to vulnerable groups, including racial, national, religious, ethnic 
</b></p>
<p><b>and sexual minorities, are executed in violation of international human rights law.   
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> For States that maintain the death penalty, the standards to safeguard the 
rights of those sentenced to death are of crucial importance in ensuring that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>punishment is carried out in a manner consistent with their international legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations.
