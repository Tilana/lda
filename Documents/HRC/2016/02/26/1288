<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> the Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted by the 
General Assembly through its resolution 41/128 on 4 December 1986, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/69 of 20 April 2005 in 
which the Commission established the mandate of Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises, and all previous Human Rights Council resolutions on the issues of human 
rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, including Council 
resolutions 8/7 of 18 June 2008 and 17/4 of 16 June 2011,  
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the approval of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4,

and the Human Rights Council on the question of the responsibilities of transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises1 with respect to human rights, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Stressing</i> that the obligations and primary responsibility to promote and protect 
human rights and fundamental freedoms lie with the State, and that States must protect 
against human rights abuse within their territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, 
including transnational corporations, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that transnational corporations and other business enterprises have a 
responsibility to respect human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that transnational corporations and other business enterprises have 
the capacity to foster economic well-being, development, technological improvement and 
wealth, as well as causing adverse impacts on human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the progressive development of this issue, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides</i> to establish an open-ended intergovernmental working group with 
the mandate to elaborate an international legally binding instrument on transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also</i> <i>decides </i>that the working group shall hold its first session for five 
working days in 2015, before the thirtieth session of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Recommends</i> that the first meeting of the working group will serve to collect 
inputs, including written inputs, from States and relevant stakeholders on possible 
principles and elements of such an international legally binding instrument; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Affirms</i> the importance of providing the working group with independent 
expertise and expert advice in order for it to fulfil its mandate; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
provide the working group with all the assistance necessary for the effective fulfilment of 
its mandate; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Requests </i>the working group to submit a report on progress made to the 
Human Rights Council for consideration at its thirty-first session; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of this question in conformity with its
