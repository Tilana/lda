<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Kiribati was held at the 2nd meeting on 19 
</p>
<p>January 2015. The delegation of Kiribati was headed by the Minister for Women, Youth 
</p>
<p>and Social Affairs, Tangariki Reete. At its 10th meeting, held on 23 January 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group adopted the report on Kiribati. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Kiribati: Ireland, Kenya and Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Kiribati: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/KIR/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/KIR/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/KIR/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Slovenia, Spain and the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Kiribati through the 
</p>
<p>troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation of Kiribati, Tangariki Reete, first expressed Kiribati&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>gratitude for the support provided by all the stakeholders involved in the preparation of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s second national report under the UPR, in particular, the OHCHR Regional Office 
</p>
<p>for the Pacific in Fiji, United Nations agencies in the Pacific region, the Secretariat of the 
</p>
<p>Pacific Community through the Regional Rights Resource Team, and the Commonwealth 
</p>
<p>Small States Office in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>6. In 2010, when Kiribati had presented its first UPR report, it was clear that a lot of 
</p>
<p>development would be required to meet its international obligations relating to human 
</p>
<p>rights. Four years later, Kiribati had fulfilled many of the international requirements 
</p>
<p>included in the recommendations. During its first review Kiribati had received 
</p>
<p>83 recommendations, out of which 42 had been accepted, 11 had not been supported and 30 
</p>
<p>were to be considered in due process. Kiribati informed the Working Group of the 
</p>
<p>significant progress achieved so far in meeting those commitments. 
</p>
<p>7. Work on the follow-up of the first review had involved relevant ministries, civil 
</p>
<p>society and faith-based organizations in the implementation of the recommendations, prior 
</p>
<p>to establishment of the Kiribati National Human Rights Taskforce in 2014. The task force 
</p>
<p>had led the national preparation for the country&#8217;s second UPR and had considered 
</p>
<p>submissions from all stakeholders, who had also participated in the consultation process. </p>


<p>8. The second UPR report included information on the progress and continued 
</p>
<p>commitment of the Government of Kiribati, and emphasized the achievements since the 
</p>
<p>review in 2010 in relation to mainstreaming human rights into the formal machinery of the 
</p>
<p>Government through the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) Commitment to human rights and related international conventions; 
</p>
<p>(b) Legislative and policy reforms; 
</p>
<p>(c) Creation of a human rights task force;  
</p>
<p>(d) Awareness programmes on human rights;  
</p>
<p>(e) National Development Plan (known as the Kiribati Development Plan);  
</p>
<p>(f) Child labour policy;  
</p>
<p>(g) Human rights special procedures; 
</p>
<p>(h) Gender and inequality policies;  
</p>
<p>(i) Health, education and environment programmes. 
</p>
<p>9. Kiribati had been addressing treaty obligations with a view to incorporating human 
</p>
<p>rights principles into its national legislation. The following legislation had been passed by 
</p>
<p>the Parliament of Kiribati since the country&#8217;s first review in 2010: 
</p>
<p>(a) Children, Young People and Family Welfare Act (2013);  
</p>
<p>(b) Education Act (2013); 
</p>
<p>(c) Amendment of the Constitution to establish the Ministry of Women, Youth 
</p>
<p>and Social Affairs;  
</p>
<p>(d) Te Rau N Te Mweenga (Family Peace Act) (2014). 
</p>
<p>10. Other developments that had been achieved in protecting and supporting human 
</p>
<p>rights included the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) Progress in the area of eliminating sexual and gender-based violence, 
</p>
<p>following the alarming results of the Kiribati Family Health and Support Study, which had 
</p>
<p>been completed in 2008. The study had highlighted the need for urgent action, resulting in a 
</p>
<p>very strong political call and national commitment to eliminate violence against women and 
</p>
<p>girls; 
</p>
<p>(b) A targeted programme had been set up to coordinate programmes on 
</p>
<p>eliminating sexual and gender-based violence. Technical and financial assistance from 
</p>
<p>various donors and development partners, including Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, Taiwan 
</p>
<p>Province of China, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
</p>
<p>Women, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the Pacific 
</p>
<p>Islands Forum Secretariat, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the World Bank, had 
</p>
<p>assisted in the implementation of those programmes; 
</p>
<p>(c) In 2010, the Government of Kiribati had endorsed the National Approach to 
</p>
<p>Eliminating Sexual and Gender Based Violence: Policy and Strategic Action Plan (2011&#8211;
</p>
<p>2021), which had led to a wide range of activities and changes, including the passing of Te 
</p>
<p>Rau N Te Mweenga (Family Peace Act 2014), male advocacy programmes, initiatives for 
</p>
<p>adolescent girls and collaborative work with key ministries and civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>in mainstreaming the elimination of sexual and gender-based violence into their 
</p>
<p>programmes and building their capacities; 
</p>
<p>(d) The Kiribati Shared Implementation Plan, an overarching plan that had been 
</p>
<p>endorsed in 2014 by the Cabinet, and the joint plan with the United Nations, which was </p>


<p>currently being finalized, were part of the implementation of the National Approach to 
</p>
<p>Eliminating Sexual and Gender Based Violence: Policy and Strategic Action Plan; 
</p>
<p>(e) SafeNet, a committee that comprised government ministries, non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations (NGOs) and faith-based organizations providing front-line 
</p>
<p>services to victims of domestic violence, had also been established in most islands of 
</p>
<p>Kiribati. Organizations referred cases to appropriate authorities and shared information and 
</p>
<p>data. In 2014, a gender project funded by the World Bank had been set up to manage, 
</p>
<p>coordinate and improve access to domestic violence services; 
</p>
<p>(f) Kiribati was a member of the Pacific Islands Forum Reference Group to 
</p>
<p>Address Sexual and Gender Based Violence. A socioeconomic impact costing of violence 
</p>
<p>against women had been conducted in 2014, and a report on the matter was currently being 
</p>
<p>finalized; 
</p>
<p>(g) The Children, Young People and Family Welfare Policy, aimed at protecting 
</p>
<p>children against abuse, violence, neglect and exploitation, ensured that the best interests of 
</p>
<p>children and families were fulfilled;  
</p>
<p>(h) An inclusive education policy had been developed with a view to supporting: 
</p>
<p>(i) Provisions of a flexible curriculum;  
</p>
<p>(ii) Training of teachers to deliver educational programmes and implement 
</p>
<p> strategies; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Compulsory education for all school-aged children (at the levels of primary 
</p>
<p>and junior secondary), including children with special needs; 
</p>
<p>(iv) Recognition of the role of parents/caregivers in all stages of their child&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>education. 
</p>
<p>11. Kiribati had also undergone a gender stocktaking exercise, conducted in September 
</p>
<p>2013 through the assistance of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. Recommended 
</p>
<p>strategic action emerging from the stocktaking included action to strengthen the capacity 
</p>
<p>for data collection and gender analysis of data, to improve accountability and to facilitate 
</p>
<p>the monitoring of the effectiveness of gender mainstreaming. The Gender Equality and 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s Development Policy had been reviewed: priorities were to create an enabling 
</p>
<p>environment for gender mainstreaming, improve political representation and leadership, 
</p>
<p>empower women economically, support stronger, informed families, and eliminate sexual 
</p>
<p>and gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government had ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities in 2013, and had drafted a national disability policy that would ultimately 
</p>
<p>provide a national framework to guide all stakeholders and communities in improving the 
</p>
<p>lives of persons with disabilities, dismantling the barriers in society and raising awareness. 
</p>
<p>Under the Building Act 2006, the Building Code had been formulated, by way of 
</p>
<p>regulations, to accommodate persons with disabilities and provide them with more access to 
</p>
<p>buildings and infrastructure. A workshop had been held with all mayors in Kiribati, while 
</p>
<p>Te Toa Matoa, an NGO serving as a disabled persons&#8217; organization, had carried out 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising programmes in islands in Kiribati. 
</p>
<p>13. The development of the Kiribati Health Strategic Plan (2012&#8211;2015) had set the 
</p>
<p>overall framework for action on health. The plan had been shaped by an assessment that 
</p>
<p>had examined the health needs of the I-Kiribati population and the ability of the health 
</p>
<p>system to respond to those needs.  
</p>
<p>14. The Kiribati Integrated Environment Policy had been approved in 2012 and publicly 
</p>
<p>launched in 2013. The Policy identified national environment priorities under five thematic </p>


<p>areas &#8212; climate change, biodiversity, waste management and pollution control, resource 
</p>
<p>management and environmental governance &#8212; and sought to keep the Government and 
</p>
<p>donors abreast of the environment priorities that needed to be addressed at the national 
</p>
<p>level. The policy was also aimed at protecting and managing the environment and promoted 
</p>
<p>the resilience of the peoples of Kiribati against the impacts of climate change. 
</p>
<p>15. The Kiribati Joint Implementation Plan for Climate Change and Disaster Risk 
</p>
<p>Management had been designed to complement the National Disaster Risk Management 
</p>
<p>Plan and the National Framework for Climate Change and Climate Change Adaptation. The 
</p>
<p>Kiribati Joint Implementation Plan respected and promoted human rights by ensuring that 
</p>
<p>all I-Kiribati had increased access to food security, safe water security and land security, 
</p>
<p>taking into account the current and future threats of climate change and disasters such as 
</p>
<p>sea-level rise and drought. 
</p>
<p>16. Efforts had been made to establish systems for mainstreaming human rights into the 
</p>
<p>work of all ministries and departments that administered and implemented national laws, 
</p>
<p>including the Constitution. For example, the Kiribati National Human Rights Taskforce had 
</p>
<p>been set up in July 2014, and a human rights unit had been included within the Ministry for 
</p>
<p>Women, Youth and Social Affairs, effective from 2015. 
</p>
<p>17. The delegation stated that the commitment of Kiribati to addressing and increasing 
</p>
<p>the promotion and protection of human rights was entrenched in the country&#8217;s own 
</p>
<p>traditional system. Kiribati was blessed with strong, age-old traditional and cultural 
</p>
<p>institutions that safeguarded the basic human rights of its people and communities. The 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Women, Youth and Social Affairs, through its Women&#8217;s Development Division 
</p>
<p>and Social Welfare Division, had conducted awareness-raising and consultations on human 
</p>
<p>rights conventions in collaboration with regional and international organizations. During 
</p>
<p>the period 2013&#8211;2014, human rights training on the Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women and eliminating sexual and gender-based violence 
</p>
<p>had been conducted on 20 of the 22 inhabited islands of Kiribati. A direct outcome of the 
</p>
<p>initiative had been the creation of a pool of human rights defenders and male advocates 
</p>
<p>throughout Kiribati. 
</p>
<p>18. Child protection legislation had been reformed through a common effort by the 
</p>
<p>Government and all stakeholders. A technical working group, established in 2010, 
</p>
<p>continued to work with representatives from NGOs and faith-based organizations. 
</p>
<p>Awareness-raising programmes on the Children, Young People and Family Welfare Act 
</p>
<p>and policy had been conducted in nine islands, including the capital, Tarawa, where over 50 
</p>
<p>per cent of the population &#8212; more than 50,000 people &#8212; resided. The other islands in the 
</p>
<p>country would be visited in 2015. Under section 18, subsections 1 and 2, of the Children, 
</p>
<p>Young People and Family Welfare Act 2013, any person was mandated to report concerns 
</p>
<p>to the police and welfare officers about the well-being of a child or young person, including 
</p>
<p>children undergoing and suffering from corporal punishment both in the community and in 
</p>
<p>schools. During the consultations on that legislation and the related policy, community 
</p>
<p>members had been trained to become child protection advocates. 
</p>
<p>19. The Youth Justice Bill was being drafted and the final version would be submitted to 
</p>
<p>the Cabinet by the end of March 2015.  
</p>
<p>20. The Kiribati National Human Rights Taskforce had been working on pending 
</p>
<p>reports for the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) 
</p>
<p>and the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC). It aimed at submitting the 
</p>
<p>consolidated initial and second and third periodic reports to CEDAW in April 2015. The 
</p>
<p>consolidated second to fourth periodic reports for CRC would be submitted in June 2015. 
</p>
<p>The task force would also compile and submit the initial report for the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the due date in 2015. The recent creation of the </p>


<p>Ministry of Women, Youth and Social Affairs and the establishment of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Taskforce and Human Rights Unit had placed Kiribati in a better position to advance its 
</p>
<p>work on human rights and, in particular, speed up the process of preparing and submitting 
</p>
<p>future periodic reports to relevant committees. 
</p>
<p>21. Kiribati would continue to work in cooperation with OHCHR and to seek support 
</p>
<p>from United Nations agencies, regional bodies and development partners in building 
</p>
<p>national capacity, training and exchanging human rights expertise and experiences with 
</p>
<p>other Pacific island countries. 
</p>
<p>22. Kiribati had also been making progress in achieving internationally set goals, such 
</p>
<p>as the Millennium Development Goals, despite various challenges, such as isolation, 
</p>
<p>overpopulation and lack of data and access to rights and services. 
</p>
<p>23. The smallness of the islands and their geographic dispersion across a large ocean 
</p>
<p>area made access to services, including the exorbitant cost of replicating those services, a 
</p>
<p>major challenge. Further support was required in building local capacity and strengthening 
</p>
<p>and resourcing existing structures and bodies that played a key role in human rights 
</p>
<p>implementation and reporting. 
</p>
<p>24. In its national report, Kiribati had highlighted that the major challenge it faced was 
</p>
<p>climate change. As a nation of low-lying islands, with an average elevation of only 2 metres 
</p>
<p>above sea level, climate change and the resultant sea-level rise had added new and major 
</p>
<p>challenges for Kiribati, including loss of territory, severe coastal erosion and involuntary 
</p>
<p>displacement of communities, affecting food and water security. More importantly, it had 
</p>
<p>become an issue of survival for the people of Kiribati. 
</p>
<p>25. Kiribati welcomed the upcoming full-day discussion on human rights and climate 
</p>
<p>change scheduled for 6 March 2015, during the twenty-eighth session of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council. It encouraged small States to take that opportunity to share their views on 
</p>
<p>challenges and best practices in addressing the adverse effects of climate change and human 
</p>
<p>rights. Kiribati called upon the international community to continue to support the increased 
</p>
<p>participation of small States, in particular those that did not have representation in Geneva, 
</p>
<p>in the discussions on those important issues taking place during the sessions of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>26. Kiribati strongly believed that it was absolutely essential to address the challenges 
</p>
<p>faced by low-lying nations due to climate change and the way in which climate change was 
</p>
<p>affecting the very basic human right of Kiribati people to survive as a distinct culture, and 
</p>
<p>to enjoy basic rights, such as access to clean drinking water and to food.  
</p>
<p>27. The Government of Kiribati had been doing its best to face the situation; it had been 
</p>
<p>buying land offshore, focusing on education and upskilling people to prepare them to be 
</p>
<p>able to &#8220;migrate with dignity&#8221; when the islands of Kiribati were no longer habitable. 
</p>
<p>Kiribati had also initiated a coalition of the nations most vulnerable to climate change: the 
</p>
<p>Coalition of Low-lying Atoll Nations on Climate Change. 
</p>
<p>28. Kiribati welcomed and appreciated assistance from development partners, but much 
</p>
<p>more needed to be done.  
</p>
<p>29. Climate change and sea-level rise were global problems. Kiribati was on the front 
</p>
<p>line, together with other low-lying countries, such as Maldives, the Marshall Islands and 
</p>
<p>Tuvalu, as well as areas such as Tokelau, but so were the scores of millions of people in the 
</p>
<p>Pacific region and around the world living in low-lying coastal cities, towns and village 
</p>
<p>communities. Kiribati called for urgent regional and global action to help island States 
</p>
<p>living in the same dangerous conditions as Kiribati. </p>


<p>30. The Government was strongly committed to upholding and ensuring human rights 
</p>
<p>for its people; the delegation took careful note of the comments made during the UPR 
</p>
<p>session, and Kiribati would continue to work hard in meeting its human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>However, the UPR process would amount to nothing if the major challenges posing serious 
</p>
<p>threats to the basic human right of Kiribati people to survive were not also addressed in 
</p>
<p>human rights bodies such as the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review. Climate 
</p>
<p>change was the number one challenge.  
</p>
<p>31. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review and the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council needed to focus and catalyse global action to address that major challenge to the 
</p>
<p>right to survive, not only for Kiribati but for the global community, as they had done so 
</p>
<p>well in respect of the rights of individuals, women&#8217;s rights, gender equality, the rights of 
</p>
<p>the child, the rights of the disabled, and freedom of speech, worship and association. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>32. During the interactive dialogue, 44 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>33. Estonia noted with appreciation that Kiribati had taken steps to implement the 
</p>
<p>previous recommendations. Estonia invited Kiribati to guarantee access to public 
</p>
<p>information and ensure that journalists and media workers could operate without fearing 
</p>
<p>reprisals. It encouraged Kiribati to continue efforts to become a party to all of the main 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments and to issue a standing invitation to special 
</p>
<p>procedures. Estonia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. France encouraged Kiribati to mobilize to promote the universal abolition of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty. It also encouraged Kiribati to accede to those international instruments to 
</p>
<p>which Kiribati was not a party. France welcomed the drawing up of the national action plan 
</p>
<p>on eliminating sexual and gender-based violence, and encouraged Kiribati to fully 
</p>
<p>implement the plan. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Germany commended the efforts of Kiribati to further strengthen human rights 
</p>
<p>protection and implement the recommendations of the first UPR cycle. It expressed 
</p>
<p>appreciation for the establishment of a dedicated task force on human rights and the 
</p>
<p>adoption and elaboration of legislation and policies to counter domestic violence and 
</p>
<p>protect the rights of children. Germany made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>36. Ghana noted the legislative measures taken by Kiribati to incorporate human rights 
</p>
<p>principles into its national legislation and applauded the acts and policy measures enacted 
</p>
<p>to improve education and the welfare of the family. It commended Kiribati for taking 
</p>
<p>measures to address sexual and gender-based violence, promote the participation of women 
</p>
<p>in politics and increase the number of women recruited into the Kiribati Police Service. 
</p>
<p>Ghana made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Indonesia noted with appreciation efforts taken by Kiribati to promote and protect 
</p>
<p>the human rights of its citizens. It also noted with appreciation the ratification of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2013, and that Kiribati was 
</p>
<p>considering ratifying or acceding to other human rights instruments. Indonesia further noted 
</p>
<p>efforts by Kiribati to reduce maternal and infant mortality. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Ireland commended the country&#8217;s legislative reform in the field of children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>It welcomed the work undertaken to implement the national action plan to eliminate sexual 
</p>
<p>and gender-based violence<i>. </i>However, it remained concerned at the high level of such 
</p>
<p>violence. Ireland recognized the extreme challenges faced owing to the effects of climate </p>


<p>change, and commended the establishment of national climate change institutions. Ireland 
</p>
<p>made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Israel commended Kiribati for incorporating human rights principles into national 
</p>
<p>legislation. It celebrated the initiative to formulate a national policy and a plan of action to 
</p>
<p>combat gender-based violence. It welcomed the willingness of Kiribati to consider a 
</p>
<p>constitutional amendment to expand the prohibited grounds of discrimination. Israel made 
</p>
<p>recommendations.  
</p>
<p>40. Italy welcomed the commitment of Kiribati in the field of human rights and 
</p>
<p>commended the actions taken so far. It also welcomed the measures taken to address 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence and promote women&#8217;s rights. It encouraged Kiribati to refrain from 
</p>
<p>any proposal or plan to reintroduce the death penalty. Italy made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Kenya commended the achievements of Kiribati in fulfilling its human rights 
</p>
