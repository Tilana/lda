<p>The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers conducted an 
</p>
<p>official visit to Tunisia from 27 November to 5 December 2014. The purpose of the visit 
</p>
<p>was to examine the situation of the justice system in the country since the revolution of 
</p>
<p>2011, before the temporary laws and bodies set up during the transition are replaced by 
</p>
<p>permanent legislation and institutions. 
</p>
<p>During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with a number of senior government 
</p>
<p>officials at the Ministries of Justice, Human Rights and Transitional Justice, the Interior 
</p>

</p>
<p>provisoire de la justice judiciare) and a large number of judges from all levels of 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, the Public Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation and a number of prosecutors, 
</p>
<p>and representatives of the Higher Committee of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 
</p>
<p>and the Truth and Dignity Commission. She also met with lawyers and representatives of 
</p>
<p>civil society, academia, United Nations agencies and other inter-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations. 
</p>
<p>The report opens with an overview of the justice system and its constitutional and 
</p>
<p>legal frameworks. In the second part of the report, the Special Rapporteur presents her 
</p>
<p>findings and concerns with regard to (a) the need to adopt a comprehensive legal 
</p>
<p>framework; (b) independence, impartiality, integrity and accountability; (c) the selection,

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, 
</p>
<p>visited Tunisia from 27 November to 5 December 2014 at the invitation of the Government. 
</p>
<p>She examined the situation of the justice system, and in particular how Tunisia endeavours 
</p>
<p>to ensure the independence, protection and accountability of the judiciary, prosecutors and 
</p>
<p>lawyers, and what obstacles may prevent them from discharging their functions effectively, 
</p>
<p>adequately and appropriately. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur visited Tunis, Grombalia and Nabeul. She met with the 
</p>
<p>Minister for Justice, Human Rights and Transitional Justice and with senior government 
</p>
<p>officials in the Ministries of the Interior and Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, 
</p>
<p>as well as with members of the National Constitutive Assembly. She also met with the 
</p>
<p>President of the Temporary Judicial Commission (Instance provisoire de la justice 
</p>
<p>judiciare), who is also the First President of the Court of Cassation, the First Presidents of 
</p>
<p>the Administrative Court and the Court of Audit, the First Presidents of the Courts of 
</p>
<p>Appeal of Tunis and Nabeul, the President of the Court of First Instance of Grombalia, the 
</p>
<p>Public Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, the Deputy Public Prosecutor of the Court of 
</p>
<p>Appeal of Tunis, the Public Prosecutor of the Court of Appeal of Nabeul and the Deputy 
</p>
<p>Public Prosecutor of the Court of First Instance of Grombalia, the Director of Military 
</p>
<p>Justice, the General Prosecutor before the Military Court of Appeal in Tunis, and other 
</p>
<p>members of the judiciary. Lastly, she met with members of the legal profession as well as 
</p>
<p>with representatives of the Higher Committee of Human Rights and Fundamental 
</p>
<p>Freedoms, the Truth and Dignity Commission, civil society, academia, and United Nations 
</p>
<p>agencies and other intergovernmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Tunisia for facilitating a rich and 
</p>
<p>interesting programme of meetings while respecting the independence of her mandate. She 
</p>
<p>also thanks the United Nations Resident Coordinator and the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) in Tunisia for their valuable cooperation 
</p>
<p>and assistance.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Justice system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A Recent political context 
</b></p>
<p>4. Following the popular uprising in Tunisia demanding basic human rights and social 
</p>
<p>justice, which began on 17 December 2010 and culminated in the ousting of President Ben 
</p>
<p>Ali on 14 January 2011, Tunisia entered a period of transition during which time there were 
</p>
<p>three interim Governments. Since the adoption of the new Constitution on 26 January 2014, 
</p>
<p>Tunisia has held parliamentary elections, in October 2014, and presidential elections, in 
</p>
<p>November and December 2014. The newly elected Parliament, which first convened on 2 
</p>
<p>December 2014, will be responsible for adopting the organic and other implementing laws 
</p>
<p>pertaining to the reform of the judicial system as stipulated in the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>5. The judiciary in Tunisia used to be heavily dependent on the executive power, given 
</p>
<p>that the former Supreme Judicial Council was presided by the President of the Republic and 
</p>
<p>the Minister for Justice was the Vice-President. A majority of Council members were 
</p>
<p>appointed by the executive, and, while its decisions were made by majority, the President or 
</p>
<p>the Vice-President had a casting vote in the event of a tie. The procedures for the selection, 
</p>
<p>appointment, transfer, removal, discipline and training of judges and prosecutors were 
</p>
<p>largely in the hands of the executive. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>6. In the aftermath of the revolution, the interim Constitution made provision to create 
</p>
<p>a temporary judicial authority to replace the former Supreme Judicial Council.1 The 
</p>
<p>Temporary Judicial Commission was established as a provisional independent body with 
</p>
<p>financial and administrative autonomy to supervise the careers of sitting judges and 
</p>
<p>prosecutors.2 This was deemed necessary to restore public trust in the judicial system after 
</p>
<p>decades of executive interference in the independence of the judiciary and the proper 
</p>
<p>administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>7. In May 2012, more than 80 judges and prosecutors were dismissed by a decree 
</p>
<p>signed by the Minister for Justice. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the dismissals 
</p>
<p>did not respect due process and fair trial guarantees and did not comply with the relevant 
</p>
<p>law on the statute for judges in force.3 By some accounts, this unilateral decision was a 
</p>
<p>reaction to public opinion, which demanded reform owing to the absence of vetting 
</p>
<p>processes for the judiciary. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the effect of this 
</p>
<p>decision had been to make judges deeply concerned about their own job security. She 
</p>
<p>expresses her concern at the chilling effect that such mass dismissals may have had on the 
</p>
<p>independence of the judiciary as a whole.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur was informed that some judges succeeded in challenging the 
</p>
<p>unilateral decision of their dismissal before the Administrative Tribunal. When the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur met with the Chief Justice, 32 additional cases were allegedly still pending 
</p>
<p>before the Tribunal. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the important efforts made during the transition 
</p>
<p>to reform and strengthen the independence of the justice system in compliance with 
</p>
<p>international standards, including by creating the Temporary Judicial Commission, which is 
</p>
<p>an improvement over its predecessor, the Supreme Judicial Council. She is encouraged by 
</p>
<p>reports from different sources that the Commission,4 which is composed of a majority of 
</p>
<p>elected members, has been a step in the right direction towards strengthening the 
</p>
<p>independence of judges through reportedly recent appointments it has made where 
</p>
<p>competence prevailed over political expediency.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Constitutional provisions 
</b></p>
<p>10. Chapter V of the Constitution establishes the judicial power as one of the three 
</p>
<p>branches of State. It includes important guarantees for the independence of judges, 
</p>
<p>prosecutors and lawyers as the main actors of the judicial system.  
</p>
<p>11. The Supreme Judicial Council, established by articles 112 to 114 of the Constitution, 
</p>
<p>is responsible for the effective administration of justice and the independence of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary. The Supreme Judicial Council comprises four organs: the Council of the Judicial 
</p>
<p>Judiciary, the Council of the Administrative Judiciary, the Council of the Financial 
</p>
<p>Judiciary, and a plenary assembly of the three councils. Each of the three councils is 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1  Constituent Law No. 2011-6 of 16 December 2011, art. 22. 
</p>
<p> 2  Organic Law No. 2013-13 of 2 May 2013. 
</p>
<p> 3  Law No. 67-29 of 14 July 1967 as modified by Law No. 69-5 of 24 January 1969. 
</p>
<p> 4  Organic Law No. 2013-13 of 2 May 2013, arts. 5-11. The 20-member body comprises 15 elected 
</p>
<p>members (10 judges elected by their peers, and five non-judges elected by the National Constituent 
</p>
<p>Assembly by an absolute majority from a list of candidates drawn up by the election commission) and 
</p>
<p>five appointed judges or prosecutors sitting in their official capacity (First President of the Court of 
</p>
<p>Cassation presiding, the Public Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, the General Director of Judicial 
</p>
<p>Affairs, the Inspector-General heading the General Inspection Service in the Ministry of Justice and 
</p>
<p>the President of the Real Estate Court. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>competent to decide on the professional career of judges and prosecutors and on 
</p>
<p>disciplinary measures. The mandate, structure, organization and procedures applicable to 
</p>
<p>each of the four entities that compose the Supreme Judicial Council will, however, be 
</p>
<p>determined by a separate law. Article 113 of the Constitution affirms that the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Judicial Council is self-managed, and ensures its administrative and financial independence 
</p>
<p>by preparing its draft budget and discussing it before the competent parliamentary 
</p>
<p>committee.  
</p>
<p>12. The Constitution also establishes the Constitutional Court as an independent judicial 
</p>
<p>body that oversees the constitutionality of laws, besides performing other tasks specified by 
</p>
<p>the Constitution. A separate law will govern the organization of the Constitutional Court, its 
</p>
<p>procedures and the guarantees enjoyed by its members. In addition, the Preamble to the 
</p>
<p>Constitution stipulates that the State is built on the principle of the separation of powers and 
</p>
<p>a balance between them. The Preamble also declares that the State must guarantee the 
</p>
<p>supremacy of the law, respect for freedoms and human rights, the independence of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary and equality of rights and duties between all male and female citizens. Article 20 
</p>
<p>of the Constitution also affirms that the State&#8217;s international obligations take precedence 
</p>
<p>over domestic law. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Court structure 
</b></p>
<p>13. The court system in Tunisia has separate judicial, administrative, financial and 
</p>
<p>constitutional branches. The judicial court system includes criminal, civil, real estate and 
</p>
<p>military courts comprising the Court of Cassation, courts of appeal, courts of first instance 
</p>
<p>and district courts.  
</p>
<p>14. The Court of Cassation in Tunis serves as the final court of appeal on points of law 
</p>
<p>in both civil and criminal matters. There are 10 courts of appeal, which are competent to 
</p>
<p>hear first instance appeals from courts of first instance. There are 27 courts of first instance, 
</p>
<p>in which a three-judge panel hears all commercial and civil cases irrespective of the 
</p>
<p>monetary value of the claim. At the base of the court structure there are 85 district courts, in 
</p>
<p>which a single judge hears cases.  
</p>
<p>15.  There are three permanent military courts of first instance, a military court of appeal 
</p>
<p>in Tunis, military indictment chambers and a military chamber at the Court of Cassation. 
</p>
<p>Judgements of the military courts of first instance may be appealed to the military court of 
</p>
<p>appeal and then reviewed on points of law by the military Chamber of the Court of 
</p>
<p>Cassation.  
</p>
<p>16. Tunisia has a separate administrative court system composed of the Administrative 
</p>
<p>Tribunal (Tribunal administratif) for litigation involving the administration, and the Court 
</p>
<p>of Accounts (Cour des comptes), which examines the accounts and management of the 
</p>
<p>finances of public authorities. Both are located in Tunis. In the event of conflict of 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction between the judicial and administrative systems, the Council of Conflicts 
</p>
<p>(Conseil des conflits de comp&#233;tence),5 composed of three judges from the Court of 
</p>
<p>Cassation and three from the Administrative Tribunal, is called upon to decide. There is 
</p>
<p>now a provisional body for the control of constitutionality of draft laws pending the 
</p>
<p>effective establishment of the Constitutional Court stipulated in the Constitution.6  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5  Organic Law No. 96-38 of 3 June 1996. 
</p>
<p> 6   Organic Law No. 2014-14 of 18 April 2014, and Constitution, art. 149, para. 7. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b> D. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>17. At the international level, Tunisia is party to eight core international human rights 
</p>
<p>treaties: the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
</p>
<p>or Punishment and the Optional Protocol thereto, the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
</p>
<p>Enforced Disappearance, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Optional Protocols thereto 
</p>
<p>on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child 
</p>
<p>prostitution and child pornography, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities Pursuant to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Tunisia 
</p>
<p>has undertaken to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to 
</p>
<p>its jurisdiction all rights related to, inter alia, the proper administration of justice, including 
</p>
<p>the principles of equality before the law, the right to an effective remedy, the right to liberty 
</p>
<p>and security, the presumption of innocence, the right to a fair and public hearing without 
</p>
<p>undue delay by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law, the 
</p>
<p>fundamental procedural guarantees of persons charged with a criminal offence, and the 
</p>
<p>principle of legality. 
</p>
<p>18. As a State party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Tunisia 
</p>
<p>is under an obligation to adopt legislative, judicial, administrative, educative and other 
</p>
<p>appropriate measures in order to ensure the establishment of an independent and impartial 
</p>
<p>judiciary and the proper administration of justice by making such changes to domestic laws 
</p>
<p>and practices as are necessary to ensure their conformity with international standards and 
</p>
<p>norms.7 
</p>
<p>19. The State judicial system is based on civil law. Law No. 67-29 of 14 July 1967 
</p>
<p>governs the judicial organization of courts and tribunals (civil and criminal), the 
</p>
<p>composition, mandate and powers of the Supreme Judicial Council (now replaced by the 
</p>
<p>Temporary Judicial Commission and the statute for judges and prosecutors. The afore-
</p>
<p>mentioned law provides that sitting judges and prosecutors are part of the same judicial 
</p>
<p>corps of magistrates (magistrats); they take the same entry examination, and graduate from 
</p>
<p>the same school, the Higher Institute for Magistrates (l&#8217;Ecole sup&#233;rieure de la 
</p>
<p>magistrature); the same or very similar provisions are applicable to both judges and 
</p>
<p>prosecutors in relation to selection and appointment, performance evaluation, promotion 
</p>
<p>and disciplinary proceedings. Law No. 2013-13 of 2 May 2013 replaced the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Judicial Council with the Temporary Judicial Commission; the provisions of Law No. 67-
</p>
<p>29 not in conflict with Law No. 2013-13 remain in force. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Challenges to the independence and impartiality of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>judiciary and the proper administration of justice  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Need to adopt a comprehensive legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>20. The achievements of the Constitution in the justice sector need to be translated into 
</p>
<p>reality. The Parliament has the task of adopting the necessary laws to operationalize the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Judicial Council by the end of April, and the Constitutional Court by the end of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 31 (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>October 2015. These laws need to be aligned with the Constitution and respect international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards and principles. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the important efforts made during the transition 
</p>
<p>to reform and strengthen the independence of the justice system in compliance with 
</p>
<p>international standards. Transitions, however, always come with challenges. This has been 
</p>
<p>the case in Tunisia, where transitional laws and provisional bodies have attempted to bridge 
</p>
<p>the gaps pending the adoption of new legislation and the establishment and implementation 
</p>
<p>of permanent institutions.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur believes that an overhaul of the legislation relating to the 
</p>
<p>legal system is necessary to implement the Constitution and to ensure an independent 
</p>
<p>judiciary and well-functioning justice system. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Independence, impartiality, integrity and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Constitution, in its article 102, consecrates the judiciary as an independent 
</p>
<p>power that guarantees justice, the supremacy of the Constitution, the sovereignty of the law 
</p>
<p>and the protection of rights and freedoms. Articles 102 and 103 also guarantee the principle 
</p>
<p>of the individual independence of judges, and the principles of impartiality, integrity, 
</p>
<p>competence and diligence. Article 109 prohibits all interference with the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur heard numerous complaints from both judges and lawyers 
</p>
<p>about the lack of individual independence of judges, and was told that the most important 
</p>
<p>priority was to combat judicial corruption. One positive step that the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>wishes to highlight is the establishment by article 130 of the Constitution of the Good 
</p>
<p>Governance and Anti-Corruption Commission as an independent body. The Commission 
</p>
<p>has investigative powers within the public and private sectors, and has a crucial role to play 
</p>
<p>in ensuring accountability, including of the judiciary, and in improving the credibility of 
</p>
<p>and confidence in the justice system. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur heard complaints about the selectivity and partiality shown 
</p>
<p>in the way some judges treat lawyers and their clients. She was informed that, during 
</p>
<p>hearings, judges sometimes ask lawyers or their clients personal or impertinent questions 
</p>
<p>that are not relevant to the facts of the case to destabilize them. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>strongly believes that such allegations are very serious and merit detailed investigation. 
</p>
<p>Such evidence should be brought before the newly created Supreme Judicial Council.  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur believes that it is important for Tunisia to ensure that 
</p>
<p>necessary safeguards are put in place to effectively guarantee the independence of judges. 
</p>
<p>For example, judges should have recourse to an independent authority, such as the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Judicial Council, when their independence is under threat, and the new statute for judges 
</p>
<p>should have specific sanctions for those seeking unduly to influence judges. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Supreme Judicial Council 
</b></p>
<p>27. The composition of the Supreme Judicial Council matters greatly to judicial 
</p>
<p>independence, as it is required to act in an objective, fair and independent manner when 
</p>
<p>selecting judges.  
</p>
<p>28. The Constitution provides that two thirds of each of the four bodies are magistrates 
</p>
<p>(sitting judges or prosecutors), and one third are non-magistrates who are independent 
</p>
<p>experts. For the members who are magistrates, the majority are elected, while the rest will 
</p>
<p>be appointed judges and prosecutors sitting in their official capacity. According to article 
</p>
<p>112, the overall majority of the members of each of the four bodies is to be elected for a 
</p>
<p>single six-year term. The new law will specify the number of members for each of the four </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>bodies of the Supreme Judicial Council, who is eligible for election or appointment, the 
</p>
<p>criteria, and who will elect or appoint the members. At the time of writing, a preliminary 
</p>
<p>draft of the law had been published. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>29. Article 130 of the Constitution states that judges are accountable for any 
</p>
<p>shortcomings in the performance of their duties. Judges enjoy immunity against criminal 
</p>
<p>prosecution and may not be prosecuted or arrested unless their immunity is lifted. They 
</p>
<p>may be arrested if caught in the act of committing a crime; one of the three judicial councils 
</p>
<p>on which they depend are to be informed to decide on the request for lifting immunity. 
</p>
<p>Article 114 provides that decisions on discipline are to be taken by the relevant judicial 
</p>
<p>council. 
</p>
<p>30. The preamble to the Bangalore Principles on Judicial Conduct explicitly states that 
</p>
<p>the Principles presuppose that judges are accountable for their conduct to appropriate 
</p>
<p>institutions established to maintain judicial standards, which are themselves independent 
</p>
<p>and impartial and are intended to supplement and not to derogate from existing rules of law 
</p>
<p>and conduct that bind judges.  
</p>
<p>31. According to Principles 17 and 20 of the Bangalore Principles, disciplinary 
</p>
<p>proceedings should be clearly established in law and respect fair trial and due process 
</p>
<p>guarantees, including the right to judicial review. The law must give detailed guidance on 
</p>
<p>infractions by judges triggering disciplinary measures, including the gravity of the 
</p>
<p>infraction that determines the kind of disciplinary measure to be applied in the case at hand 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/11/41, para. 57). 
</p>
<p>32. A code of conduct or ethics should be put in place that clearly sets out reprehensible 
</p>
<p>behaviour and respective sanctions for the judiciary. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
</p>
<p>fact that the judges and staff members of the Court of Accounts have a charter of 
</p>
<p>professional ethics dated July 2010. Such codes of conduct should be elaborated by judges 
</p>
<p>themselves and be sufficiently detailed and comprehensive, in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>Bangalore Principles and the principle of legality. Once the codes of conduct have been 
</p>
<p>adopted for other sections of the judiciary, adequate training should be organized to raise 
</p>
<p>awareness and to ensure their implementation.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the General Inspection Authority of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice, which together with the former Supreme Judicial Council used to 
</p>
<p>conduct disciplinary proceedings against judges before the revolution, continued to play a 
</p>
<p>role in disciplinary matters despite the replacement of the Supreme Judicial Council with 
</p>
<p>the Temporary Judicial Commission. Under the law creating the Temporary Judicial 
</p>
<p>Commission, the Minister for Justice may seize he Commission by transmitting a 
</p>
<p>disciplinary file against a judge, prepared on the basis of a report by the General Inspection 
</p>
<p>Authority.8 The Special Rapporteur believes that this competence should be transferred to 
</p>
<p>the Supreme Judicial Council. If the General Inspection Service were to continue to have a 
</p>
<p>role as an inspection body, it should be subordinated to the Supreme Judicial Council, not 
</p>
<p>to the Minister for Justice.  
</p>
<p>34. In the above connection, the Special Rapporteur recalls that, in general, the body 
</p>
<p>that adjudicates cases of judicial discipline should be separate from the persons or body 
</p>
<p>who initiate complaints or investigations that may lead to disciplinary measures, and must 
</p>
<p>not be influenced by or have as members persons who initiated such proceedings. In this 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8  Organic Law 2013-13 of 2 May 2013, art. 16. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that article 114 of the Constitution 
</p>
<p>provides that decisions on discipline are to be taken by the relevant judicial council. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Selection, appointment and conditions of tenure of judges  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Statute for judges 
</b></p>
<p>35. The new statute for judges should set out fair, transparent and objective criteria and 
</p>
<p>procedures for the selection, appointment, tenure, promotion, transfer, removal and 
</p>
<p>discipline of judges. This is an important safeguard for the independence of judges. 
</p>
<p>36. Institutional independence of the judiciary should be accompanied by financial and 
</p>
<p>administrative independence.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Qualifications and selection  
</b></p>
<p>37. Principle 10 of the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary states that 
</p>
<p>persons selected for judicial office should be individuals of integrity and ability with 
</p>
<p>appropriate training or qualifications in law. Furthermore, any method of judicial selection 
</p>
<p>should safeguard against judicial appointments for improper motives and against any type 
</p>
<p>or grounds of discrimination. A former mandate holder underscored that competitive 
</p>
<p>examinations conducted at least partly in a written and anonymous manner could serve as 
</p>
<p>an important tool in the selection process of judges (A/HRC/11/41, para. 30). The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur adds that written examination should be followed up by an oral and public one 
</p>
<p>to assess the competence, ability and integrity of future judges. Furthermore, a full 
</p>
<p>investigation into the conduct and prior record of candidates should be carried out prior to 
</p>
<p>their appointment to ensure that their behaviour or activities satisfy the appearance of 
</p>
<p>propriety, which, is a principle essential to the performance of all of the activities of a 
</p>
<p>judge.9 
</p>
<p>38. The Constitution provides that judges are to be nominated by presidential decree on 
</p>
<p>the basis of recommendations of the Supreme Judicial Council. The nomination of senior 
</p>
<p>judges is to be made by presidential decree, after consultation with the Prime Minister, on 
</p>
<p>the basis of a list of candidates provided by the Supreme Judicial Council. According to 
</p>
<p>article 106 of the Constitution, senior judicial positions will be decided by law.10 
</p>
<p>39. As already stated by the Special Rapporteur, if the law stipulates that an organ of the 
</p>
<p>executive branch is the one formally appointing judges following their selection by an 
</p>
<p>independent body, the recommendations of such a body should only be rejected in 
</p>
<p>exceptional cases and on the basis of well-established criteria that have been made public in 
</p>
<p>advance. Should the executive body not follow the recommendations, there should be a 
</p>
<p>specific procedure by which it is required to substantiate in writing, and made accessible to 
</p>
<p>the public, the reasons for which it has not followed the recommendation. This would 
</p>
<p>enhance transparency and the accountability of the selection and appointment process 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/11/41, para. 33). 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, Value 4. 
</p>
<p> 10 Law No. 67-29 of 14 July 1967, art. 7 bis lists the First President of the Court of Cassation, the Public 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, the Prosecutor-General Director of Judicial Services, the 
</p>
<p>Inspector-General of the Ministry of Justice, the President of the Real Estate Tribunal, the First 
</p>
<p>President of the Court of Appeal of Tunis and the Public Prosecutor of the Court of Appeal of Tunis. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Conditions of tenure and promotion 
</b></p>
<p>40. According to article 114 of the Constitution, each of the three judicial councils 
</p>
<p>(judiciary, administrative and financial) has the responsibility to decide on the professional 
</p>
<p>career of judges. The Constitution does not have any specific provisions on the security of 
</p>
<p>tenure of judges, stipulating only in article 107 that a judge may not be transferred without 
</p>
<p>his or her consent and that a judge cannot be suspended, dismissed or be subject to 
</p>
<p>disciplinary sanctions except in accordance with the instances stipulated in the law and 
</p>
<p>subject to such guarantees as those established by law and by virtue of a motivated decision 
</p>
<p>of the Supreme Judicial Council.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the new statute for judges should comply 
</p>
<p>with Principle 18 of the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary on the issue 
</p>
<p>of security of tenure by providing that judges may only be removed or suspended for 
</p>
<p>reasons of incapacity or behaviour that renders them unfit to discharge their duties. She 
</p>
<p>expresses her concern at reports that judges have been transferred without their prior 
</p>
<p>consent. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur also heard concerns that judges had been reappointed 
</p>
<p>beyond the indicative retirement age (reportedly set at 60 years of age) on an ad hoc basis 
</p>
<p>and without clear criteria. The new statute for judges should, in compliance with Principle 
</p>
<p>12. Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, guarantee security of tenure of 
</p>
<p>judges until a mandatory retirement age or the expiry of their term of office.  
</p>
<p>43. The promotion of judges is currently based on the principle of seniority.11 In 
</p>
<p>addition to experience, promotion should, in compliance with Principle 13 of the Basic 
</p>
<p>Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, be based on objective criteria, in particular 
</p>
<p>ability and integrity. 
</p>
<p>44. The performance evaluation of judges, including newly appointed judges on their 
</p>
<p>one-year period of probation, is currently carried out by the President of the Court of 
</p>
<p>Appeal after consultations with the Public Prosecutor, and on the basis of observations by 
</p>
<p>the President of the court at which the judge is serving.12 The Special Rapporteur strongly 
</p>
<p>believes that there is a need for an assessment procedure that does not only depend on court 
</p>
<p>presidents, given that such a procedure may lead to a system where judges unduly consult 
</p>
<p>the President in specific cases instead of making their own independent decisions. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the involvement of the Public Prosecutor is questionable, because this might 
</p>
<p>also interfere with the independent decision-making of judges or lead to prosecutorial bias, 
</p>
<p>in contradiction of the principle of equality of arms. The Special Rapporteur notes with 
</p>
<p>concern that the current law does not prescribe any principles according to which the 
</p>
<p>performance of judges should be assessed or any safeguards to ensure that the assessment is 
</p>
<p>conducted in a fair, objective and transparent manner.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Budget and conditions of work 
</b></p>
<p>45. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur heard from a range of interlocutors that 
</p>
<p>the poor conditions of work, including low salaries, inadequate or inexistent office 
</p>
<p>infrastructure, lack of basic facilities, and non-systematized methods of work, were a major 
</p>
<p>challenge to the independence of the judiciary. Providing judges with an adequate salary, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with Principle 11 of the Basic Principles on the Independence of the judiciary, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11  Law No. 67-29 of 14 July 1967, art. 33. 
</p>
<p> 12  Ibid., art. 34. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>would be an important measure to counter pressure against them and to promote 
</p>
<p>independent decision-making.  
</p>
<p>46. Another major challenge that the Special Rapporteur identified is the issue of 
</p>
<p>corruption of the judiciary. Lack of resources may render judges more vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>corruption, with the result that their independence is weakened. Furthermore, the allocation 
</p>
<p>and administration of those resources by the executive may render the judiciary more 
</p>
<p>vulnerable in accepting to be influenced over the outcome of sensitive cases, thereby 
</p>
<p>weakening its independence. 
</p>
<p>47. According to Principle 7 of the Basic Principles on the Independence of the 
</p>
<p>Judiciary, it is the duty of each Member State to provide adequate resources to enable the 
</p>
<p>judiciary to perform its functions properly. 
</p>
<p>48. A fixed percentage of the national budget (between 2 and 6 per cent) should be 
</p>
<p>allocated to the judiciary to enable the judiciary to properly perform its functions so that 
</p>
<p>their resources are not used to threaten or to bring pressure upon a particular judge or 
</p>
<p>judges (A/HRC/11/41, para. 37).13 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur found that there was no clarity as to whether there was a 
</p>
<p>fixed percentage of the national budget allocated to the judiciary and, if there was one, it 
</p>
<p>was reportedly as low as 0.7 per cent. The three judicial councils, in coordination with the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Judicial Council, should manage and prepare their own budget and administer the 
</p>
<p>funds directly. They should each also have appropriate human and material resources to 
</p>
<p>ensure improved conditions and methods of work that are conducive to the exercise of the 
</p>
<p>judges&#8217; fundamental functions.  
</p>
<p>50. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur considers that the Supreme Judicial Council 
</p>
<p>should give its consent if the budget allocated is to be reduced from one fiscal year to 
</p>
<p>another (A/HRC/11/41, para. 41). The Supreme Judicial Council should administer the 
</p>
<p>funds directly, and be subject to independent and external oversight (ibid. para. 43). 
</p>
<p><b> E. Case management, internal regulations and procedures, judicial delays 
</b></p>
<p><b>and access to justice  
</b></p>
<p>51. An important aspect of the fairness of a hearing is its expeditiousness. In its general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 32, the Human Rights Committee highlighted that, in both civil and criminal 
</p>
<p>cases, undue delays that cannot be justified by the complexity of the case or the behaviour 
</p>
<p>of the parties detract from the principle of a fair hearing and does not serve the interests of 
</p>
<p>justice (CCPR/C/GC/32, paras. 27 and 35).  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Case management  
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur learned about the apparent lack of transparency in the 
</p>
<p>assignment of cases to judges, the constitution of benches, decisions on hearing dates, lack 
</p>
<p>of information on when judgements are made, and the need to physically go to court to 
</p>
<p>personally file documents and follow up on cases. She was informed that there was no 
</p>
<p>information technology infrastructure for the automatic allocation or management of cases, 
</p>
<p>no databases recording the number, type and status of cases before the courts or any 
</p>
<p>meaningful statistics produced thereon or published.  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur heard complaints from other professionals involved in the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice, such as notaries, fiscal advisers and judicial experts about 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13  Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, Principle 11. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>outdated laws and practices governing their respective roles. The laws governing the status 
</p>
<p>of each of these professions, the conditions for entry into them, the training required, the 
</p>
<p>maintenance of lists with the updated contact details of such professionals, who appoints 
</p>
<p>them during a case, their remuneration, whether legal or other advice can be provided 
</p>
<p>directly to the lay client, and their rights of audience need to be revised and regulated in 
</p>
<p>consultation with the legal profession.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Judicial delays 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur was informed that there was a complete lack of efficiency in 
</p>
<p>the administration of justice. For example, judgements are first hand-written and then 
</p>
<p>typed, work processes are slow, there is no methodology for preparing cases for hearings, 
</p>
<p>too many people are working in the courts without clear responsibilities and allocation of 
</p>
<p>tasks, and nobody administers court work. The Special Rapporteur learned that, in one 
</p>
<p>court, there had been no ink for a printer for an entire year because courts were not 
</p>
<p>involved in the management of their budget and everything had to go through the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Justice. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur heard accounts of court files disappearing then reappearing 
</p>
<p>several months later owing to the lack of court clerks, and that lawyers had to pay to 
</p>
<p>physically locate their files in court. She was also informed that those employed as court 
</p>
<p>clerks were not adequately trained to provide an efficient service to all court users. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, judges were overwhelmed by their workload, given that they were required 
</p>
<p>to perform purely clerical tasks as well. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur learned from various sources that a very high number of 
</p>
<p>cases were appealed; up to 70 per cent of cases from the courts of first instance are 
</p>
<p>appealed to the Court of Appeal, and up to 70 per cent of cases from the Court of Appeal go 
</p>
<p>to the Court of Cassation. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the lack of relevant 
</p>
<p>statistical data on case management, the impact of the lack of methodology and efficiency 
</p>
<p>and the consequent delays on the quality of justice and the accessibility of the justice 
</p>
<p>system. Such delays in the administration of justice may result in miscarriages or the denial 
</p>
<p>of justice.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Pretrial detention  
</b></p>
<p>57. Article 27 of the Constitution provides that a defendant should be presumed 
</p>
<p>innocent until proven guilty, and be entitled to a fair hearing and to all the necessary 
</p>
<p>guarantees relating to the right to a defence throughout all phases of prosecution and trial. 
</p>
<p>According to article 29, persons placed under arrest are to be immediately informed of their 
</p>
<p>rights and the charges against them, and may appoint a lawyer to represent them. 
</p>
<p>58. According to article 13 bis of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a person is allowed to 
</p>
<p>consult with a lawyer only after having appeared before an investigative judge; during 
</p>
<p>police custody (garde &#224; vue), suspects are totally isolated, without access to counsel or 
</p>
<p>family for up to six days. The Special Rapporteur was informed that there were judges who 
</p>
<p>did not understand or believe in the right to a defence; apparently, in some criminal cases, 
</p>
<p>the defence lawyer is considered an &#8220;enemy&#8221; by the judge and the prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the above-mentioned factors run counter to 
</p>
<p>the right to a fair hearing, the right to defence and the right to have access to legal counsel, 
</p>
<p>and open a serious gap between the law and the guarantees enshrined in the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>The excessive length of police custody combined with the fact that a suspect does not have 
</p>
<p>access to a lawyer may create the circumstances for ill-treatment (A/HRC/19/61/Add.1, 
</p>
<p>paras. 17-20). Police custody comes under the oversight of the Prosecutor General, who has 
</p>
<p>the sole authority to extend, in exceptional cases, the initial period of police custody of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>three days by another three days. It is also mandatory for the judicial police to have a 
</p>
<p>detainee examined by a doctor upon the request of the detainee or the detainee&#8217;s relatives.14 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur heard numerous complaints according to which as many as 90 per 
</p>
<p>cent of police officers refuse to grant a medical check-up when requested and, even when it 
</p>
<p>is carried out, it is not recorded in the detention written record (proc&#232;s verbal). The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur also heard complaints that evidence obtained under torture was not expressly 
</p>
<p>excluded or systematically challenged in court, which is contrary to article 15 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the stated intention of the authorities to 
</p>
<p>amend the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur learned that a legal aid system is in place for civil, but not in 
</p>
<p>all criminal, matters;15 the system, however, is underfunded and has restrictive conditions 
</p>
<p>for eligibility, while the low retainer fee for court-appointed defence counsel undermines 
</p>
<p>the very effectiveness of legal aid. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the formal 
</p>
<p>appointment of counsel by the State is insufficient to satisfy the obligations of the State 
</p>
<p>under article 14 paragraph 3 (d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>The State is indeed required to take &#8220;positive action&#8221; to ensure that applicants effectively 
</p>
<p>enjoys their right to free legal assistance (A/HRC/23/43, para. 40). 
</p>
<p><b> F. Threats, attacks and lack of protection 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur was informed that lawyers active in the defence of human 
</p>
<p>rights were targeted and threatened, in particular those defending suspected terrorists. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the media reportedly associate the lawyers defending suspected terrorists with 
</p>
<p>their clients or their clients&#8217; causes. The Special Rapporteur also heard reports from 
</p>
<p>numerous sources on the increasing coverage by the media of trials where journalists make 
</p>
<p>legal qualifications about alleged crimes on television in violation of the right of suspects to 
</p>
<p>be presumed innocent until proven guilty, thus compromising their right to a defence.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur was informed that judges were often subjected to aggressive 
</p>
<p>media scrutiny, such as when they decide to release suspects and subsequently come under 
</p>
<p>media pressure to justify their decision. 
</p>
<p>63. The Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 32, pointed out that it 
</p>
<p>was a duty for all public authorities to refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial, for 
</p>
<p>example, by abstaining from making public statements affirming the guilt of the accused, 
</p>
<p>and that the media should avoid news coverage undermining the presumption of innocence 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 30). 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the position of Prosecutor of the Court of 
</p>
<p>First Instance in Tunis was one of the most dangerous in Tunisia, given that the Prosecutor 
</p>
<p>has the exclusive competence to initiate terrorist-related offences and to decide on whether 
</p>
<p>to prosecute.16 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the State has a positive obligation to take 
</p>
<p>effective measures to ensure the personal safety of judges, lawyers, prosecutors and their 
</p>
<p>families (see A/64/181, para. 68, A/HRC/11/41, para. 79, A/HRC/20/19, para. 78).

<p> 15  Law No. 2002-52 of 3 June 2002.

<p><b> G. Prosecutorial services  
</b></p>
<p>66. Article 115 of the Constitution provides that the public prosecution is part of the 
</p>
<p>judicial justice system, and is covered by the guarantees provided for in the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, public prosecutors exercise their functions within the framework of the penal 
</p>
<p>policy of the State as regulated by the relevant laws.  
</p>
<p>67. Guideline 13 of the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors provides that prosecutors 
</p>
<p>should, inter alia, carry out their functions impartially, protect the public interest, and act 
</p>
<p>with objectivity.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur has already highlighted in previous reports that it is essential 
</p>
<p>that prosecutors be able to play their role independently, impartially, objectively and in a 
</p>
<p>transparent manner in the discharge of their functions (for example, see A/65/274, para. 
</p>
<p>18). They also play a key role in protecting society from a culture of impunity and function 
</p>
<p>as gatekeepers to the judiciary (A/HRC/20/19, para. 93).  
</p>
<p>69. As stated above, sitting judges and prosecutors are part of the same judicial corps 
</p>
<p>and subject to the same rules with regard to selection, appointment, transfer, removal, 
</p>
<p>discipline and training, which are still partly in the hands of the executive power.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur was informed by sitting judges and prosecutors that they 
</p>
<p>could seamlessly move from one function to the other during their careers, which they 
</p>
<p>perceived as an enriching experience in understanding both roles. They did not regard this 
</p>
<p>as an issue undermining their independence. The Special Rapporteur did, however, hear 
</p>
<p>reports that the proximity between judges and prosecutors raised serious doubts regarding 
</p>
<p>the independence, impartiality and objectivity of judges, and created much confusion about 
</p>
<p>the respective roles of sitting judges and public prosecutors. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>emphasizes that the perception by the general public of sitting judges and prosecutors 
</p>
<p>performing different roles and functions is important, given that public confidence in the 
</p>
<p>proper functioning of the rule of law is best ensured when every State institution respects 
</p>
<p>the sphere of competence of other institutions (A/HRC/20/19, para. 40) and its actors have 
</p>
<p>a separate career.  
</p>
<p>71. According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, the State Prosecutor is the 
</p>
<p>hierarchical superior of the judicial police (art. 10), and has prosecutorial discretion to 
</p>
<p>decide whether to dismiss complaints received (art. 30). The public prosecution service 
</p>
<p>falls under the authority of the Minister for Justice.17 The Minister has a range of powers 
</p>
<p>vis-&#224;-vis the State Prosecutor, including to report known violations of criminal law, to 
</p>
<p>initiate or to have someone initiate prosecution, or to seize the competent jurisdiction with 
</p>
<p>the written submissions that the Minister considers desirable.18 This is in contradiction to 
</p>
<p>the principle of independence of the public prosecution service of the executive branch of 
</p>
<p>Government. 
</p>
<p>72. According to the Guidelines 14 and 15 on the Role of Prosecutors, prosecutors 
</p>
<p>should not initiate or continue prosecution, or should otherwise make every effort to stay 
</p>
<p>proceedings when an impartial investigation shows charges to be unfounded and they 
</p>
<p>should give due attention to the prosecution of crimes committed by public officials. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was informed that, reportedly, the outgoing Minister for Justice never 
</p>
<p>gave instructions to prosecutors. The Special Rapporteur was, however, also told that, even 
</p>
<p>if in practice public prosecutors do not accept written instructions from the Minister when 
</p>
<p>deciding on whether to prosecute a case and to assign it to an investigative judge, there 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17  Law No. 67-29, art. 15. 
</p>
<p> 18  Code of Criminal Procedure, art. 23. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>were no clear and written criteria, so they followed the prevailing public opinion or the 
</p>
<p>political trend set by the Government. For example, the Special Rapporteur was informed 
</p>
<p>that there had been a number of prosecutions against journalists, bloggers and artists who 
</p>
<p>had criticized the Government, and that the general public felt that the judicial system was 
</p>
<p>defending the interests of the Government in targeting these persons. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur emphasizes that this is not desirable; prosecutors should avoid confusion 
</p>
<p>between public and State interests, namely, the exercise of functions in the public interest, 
</p>
<p>such as criminal prosecution, should not be seen as having the role of protecting the 
</p>
<p>interests of the Government, a political party or any other State institution (A/HRC/20/19, 
</p>
<p>para. 50). 
</p>
<p>73. The selection and promotion of prosecutors should be based on objective criteria and 
</p>
<p>preclude appointments for improper motives. Furthermore, the law on the Supreme Judicial 
</p>
<p>Council and the statute for judges should specify objective criteria for appointment and 
</p>
<p>promotion, including the appropriate skills, knowledge and training. The powers of the 
</p>
<p>executive over the promotion and transfer of prosecutors should cease; in this regard, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that article 114 of the Constitution provides that 
</p>
<p>decisions on discipline are taken by the relevant judicial council. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Military courts 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Constitution provides that military courts are to be specialized in the domain of 
</p>
<p>military offences, stipulating in its article 110 that the relevant law19 is to regulate their 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, composition, applicable procedures and the statute for relevant judges. 
</p>
<p>75. In its general comment No. 32, the Human Rights Committee affirmed that it is 
</p>
<p>important to take all necessary measures to ensure that military trials take place under 
</p>
<p>conditions that genuinely afford the full guarantees stipulated in article 14 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 22).  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur reiterates her view that military courts should only have 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction over military personnel who commit military offences or breaches of military 
</p>
<p>discipline, and then only when those offences or breaches do not amount to serious human 
</p>
<p>rights violations. Exceptions are to be made only in exceptional circumstances and must be 
</p>
<p>limited to civilians abroad and assimilated to military personnel (A/68/285, para. 89).  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur expresses her great concern at the accounts heard that 
</p>
<p>civilians were still being tried by military courts. She welcomes the reforms aimed at 
</p>
<p>providing attributions of independence to the military justice system, including decree-law 
</p>
<p>No. 69 of 2011 (A/HRC/24/42/Add.1, para. 47), and the possibility for victims to be <i>partie 
</i></p>
<p><i>civile</i> in proceedings before military courts and to make claims for reparation for the harm 
</p>
<p>suffered (ibid., para. 49).  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the institutional dependence of military 
</p>
<p>judges on the Minister for Defence, who presides over the Military Judicial Council, which 
</p>
<p>is responsible for appointments, promotions and disciplinary measures (even though in 
</p>
<p>actual practice the Minister for Defence has reportedly never presided over the Military 
</p>
<p>Judicial Council). The Special Rapporteur notes that military judges are independent of the 
</p>
<p>military hierarchy when exercising their functions, are subject to the supremacy of the 
</p>
<p>law,20 and are protected against threats or attacks in the exercise of their duties.21 The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 19  Decree No. 9 of 10 January 1957 promulgated the Code of Military Justice, as amended by Law No. 
</p>
<p>2011-69 of 29 July 2011 and Law No. 2011-70 of 29 July 2011. 
</p>
<p> 20 Law No. 2011-70, art. 5.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is equally concerned about the hierarchical dependence of military 
</p>
<p>judges on their superiors, given that they are subject to general disciplinary rules.22  
</p>
<p><b> I. Lawyers  
</b></p>
<p>79. Article 105 of the Constitution recognizes the important role of lawyers as a free 
</p>
<p>independent profession that contributes to the establishment of justice and the defence of 
</p>
<p>rights and liberties. Lawyers are entitled to the legal guarantees that ensure their protection 
</p>
<p>and the fulfilment of their tasks. 
</p>
<p>80. Lawyers play an essential role in the right to justice, in access to justice, and in the 
</p>
<p>right to a defence. In order to fulfil their role, they need a legal and institutional framework 
</p>
<p>that allows them to exercise their profession freely and a judicial culture that allows them to 
</p>
<p>meet their clients in private and to communicate with the accused in conditions that respect 
</p>
<p>fully the confidentiality of their communications (A/HRC/8/4, para. 40). 
</p>
<p>81. The preamble to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers provides that adequate 
</p>
<p>protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms to which all persons are entitled 
</p>
<p>requires that all persons have effective access to legal services provided by an independent 
</p>
<p>legal profession. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur heard complaints that court-appointed defence counsel is 
</p>
<p>mandatory only in certain cases,23 and are paid a minimal retainer fee, considered derisory 
</p>
<p>by lawyers, currently fixed by the State at 180 dinars (approximately $90).24 Moreover, 
</p>
<p>such work is allocated to junior lawyers with little or no experience, or to interns, who work 
</p>
<p>unsupervised. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the lack of effective legal assistance at 
</p>
<p>all stages of the criminal justice process is contrary to article 14, paragraph 3 (d) of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (see A/HRC/23/43, para. 94 (c)). This 
</p>
<p>is a worrying practice that compromises the right of defence. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur heard complaints about the lack of necessary infrastructure 
</p>
<p>in prisons; for example, in a specific women&#8217;s prison, there is reportedly only one office 
</p>
<p>made available for lawyers to meet clients in private, with the result that some have to wait 
</p>
<p>for hours to consult with their clients, and in some instances return the following day. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was informed that, in one case, a lawyer had had to wait for nearly four 
</p>
<p>hours to meet a client in what appeared to be an empty prison. It was reported that, in 
</p>
<p>another prison that housed thousands of prisoners, only four offices were available for 
</p>
<p>confidential lawyer-client meetings. Reportedly, in some prisons, the lawyers could not 
</p>
<p>communicate with their clients in conditions that respect fully the confidentiality of 
</p>
<p>communications; moreover, in one prison, equipment had been installed to spy on lawyers 
</p>
<p>during such visits, and the information obtained was handed over to the prosecutor. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about such allegations, which would be in breach 
</p>
<p>of the right to a defence and the principle of professional privilege. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur is even more concerned about reports that lawyers are 
</p>
<p>sometimes considered &#8220;enemies&#8221; of sitting judges and prosecutors. She highlights the fact 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 21 Ibid., art. 6. 
</p>
<p> 22 Ibid., art. 19. 
</p>
<p> 23 Law No. 2002-52 of 3 June 2002, art. 1 provides that, in civil matters, legal aid may be granted to the 
</p>
<p>plaintiff or the defendant at any stage of the proceedings, whereas in criminal matters it may be 
</p>
<p>granted if the offence committed is punishable by imprisonment of at least three years and if the party 
</p>
<p>requesting legal aid is not a repeat offender. 
</p>
<p> 24 Decree law No. 2011-1178 of 23 August 2011, art. 1. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>that lawyers play an essential role in guaranteeing the right to defence and, in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, should not be confused with their clients 
</p>
<p>or their clients&#8217; causes.  
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that there is an independent bar 
</p>
<p>association in Tunisia that oversees the exercise of the legal profession. However, lawyers 
</p>
<p>have complained about the lack of sufficient means to oversee effectively the exercise of 
</p>
<p>the legal profession. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Education, training and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur found that the main challenge in the reform of the judiciary 
</p>
<p>in Tunisia is to change the mentality of judges, prosecutors, lawyers and administrative 
</p>
<p>staff in courts. She heard from various stakeholders about practical measures and 
</p>
<p>programmes to train all those involved in the administration of justice, and further 
</p>
<p>encourages such initiatives.  
</p>
<p>87. A number of interlocutors expressed their concern about the fact that legal 
</p>
<p>professional education for judges and prosecutors at the Higher Institute for Magistrates 
</p>
<p>was basic, and should cover in greater depth ethical issues of independence and 
</p>
<p>impartiality, and practical issues of working methods and case management. Initial and on-
</p>
<p>the-job training on ethical conduct and efficiency in the organization of work in the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice should be made compulsory for all judges, including for their 
</p>
<p>promotion. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that there is mandatory on-the-job 
</p>
<p>professional training for sitting judges and prosecutors with fewer than six years of 
</p>
<p>experience, but regrets that training is not compulsory thereafter. Reportedly, there is no 
</p>
<p>compulsory training to become eligible for promotion. The Special Rapporteur is concerned 
</p>
<p>about complaints that insufficient means are allocated to training, and that information 
</p>
<p>about training opportunities, those selected to attend and the criteria used is lacking or not 
</p>
<p>transparent. More needs to be done to set aside funds, and to create and propose training 
</p>
<p>courses in a long-term sustainable manner, to the benefit of all judicial actors. This would 
</p>
<p>further strengthen the integrity of the justice system and its independence. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> Tunisia finds itself at the critical stage of having to transition from a largely 
</b></p>
<p><b>fragmented justice system, which was revised to create interim structures and laws 
</b></p>
<p><b>owing to the political necessities and realities, to a system designed in a holistic way 
</b></p>
<p><b>and set out in the Constitution as one of the three powers of the State. 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> Although the general public has a poor perception of the justice system and 
</b></p>
<p><b>trust in it is low, justice not only needs to be done but must also be seen to be done. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The abuses of the previous regime, where corruption and regular executive 
</b></p>
<p><b>interference in the work of the judiciary to influence the outcome of specific cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>before the courts were common, must cease. The issue of the independence of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>judiciary is also related to institutional culture and mentality, which must eventually 
</b></p>
<p><b>give way to a culture based on human rights and an understanding of the principle of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers. 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Constitution generated high expectations and has left much work to 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislators, to revise existing laws and to draft new ones to operationalize the vision of </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>an independent judiciary and of a functioning, independent and impartial justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>system. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> Some progress has already been made, but much remains to be done. Against 
</b></p>
<p><b>this backdrop, the Special Rapporteur would like to highlight the importance of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>role to be played by the newly-elected authorities in building an independent justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>system in Tunisia. She encourages them to continue the broad and open-ended 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultations to adopt the legislation necessary for the establishment and functioning 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Supreme Judicial Council and the Constitutional Court in accordance with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitution of 2014 as a matter of urgency. Such legislation should comply with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights obligations of Tunisia to strengthen the rule of law, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>build trust in democratic institutions, and to develop a judicial system that will 
</b></p>
<p>guarantee people&#8217;s human rights<b>.  
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Parliament should draft, on the basis of broad and inclusive consultations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including with civil society organizations, and adopt the necessary legislation, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular that required to operationalize the Supreme Judicial Council and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitutional Court, and to elect their members as a matter of urgency. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Independence, impartiality, integrity and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The close ties that exist between the judiciary and the executive should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>severed so that that the judiciary may become independent in practice. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The principle of independence should be affirmed expressly in the law 
</b></p>
<p><b>governing the mandate, structure, organization and procedures applicable to each of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the four entities composing the Supreme Judicial Council. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Selection, appointment and conditions of tenure of judges 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The law governing the composition of the Supreme Judicial Council should 
</b></p>
<p><b>specify the exact number of members of the Council, and that at least a majority 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be judges elected by their peers. It should also specify that due consideration 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be given to gender balance among Council members, and establish clear and 
</b></p>
<p><b>objective procedures and criteria for both elected and appointed members, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>term of their mandates.  
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> The composition, mandate, structure, organization and procedures applicable 
</b></p>
<p><b>for each of the four entities composing the Supreme Judicial Council should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>established in the law, which should also guarantee its administrative and financial 
</b></p>
<p><b>independence. 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> The law governing the statute of judges should specify clearly that the selection, 
</b></p>
<p><b>appointment and promotion of judges should be based on fair, transparent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>objective criteria and procedures. Such procedures and criteria should be based on 
</b></p>
<p><b>merit, competence, ability, appropriate training and qualifications in law, integrity 
</b></p>
<p><b>and propriety, in accordance with the Basic Principles on the Independence of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Judiciary and the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> The law governing the statute of judges should provide that judges may only be 
</b></p>
<p><b>removed or suspended for reasons of incapacity or behaviour that renders then unfit 
</b></p>
<p><b>to discharge their duties, and guarantee security of tenure for judges until a 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandatory retirement age or the expiry of their term of office. 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> The Supreme Judicial Council should strengthen the vetting of future judges, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including a full investigation into the conduct of candidates, prior to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>appointment, to ensure their integrity and to fight corruption. 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> </b>The assessment of judges&#8217; work, and <b>the decisions on the promotion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transfer of judges should be based on the same objective criteria that govern their 
</b></p>
<p><b>selection and appointment, and should include procedural guarantees of fairness, such 
</b></p>
<p><b>as the right to be consulted and to </b>express one&#8217;s views on the assessment<b>, and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenge the assessment, if deemed necessary. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The law dealing with the statute of judges should stipulate clearly that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiation and conduct of disciplinary investigation (including general guidelines in 
</b></p>
<p><b>terms of sources of information and how to gather it), disciplinary proceedings and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the implementation of disciplinary sanctions are to be conducted by the Supreme 
</b></p>
<p><b>Judicial Council. It should stipulate expressly that all stages of disciplinary 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceedings should include guarantees of a fair trial and be subject to an independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>review by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal. 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> A code of conduct for judges, sufficiently detailed, comprehensive and in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, should be elaborated 
</b></p>
<p><b>by judges themselves. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Budget and conditions of work 
</b></p>
<p>104<b>. The Supreme Judicial Council and the courts should enjoy real administrative 
</b></p>
<p><b>and financial independence through its own separate budget allocation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>management. The three judicial councils, in coordination with the Supreme Judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council, should be vested with the role of receiving proposals from the courts, 
</b></p>
<p><b>preparing a consolidated draft for the judicial budget and presenting it to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate parliamentary committee, with the right to participate in subsequent 
</b></p>
<p><b>deliberations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Case management, internal regulations and procedures, judicial delays 
</b></p>
<p><b>and access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> The solutions offered by information and communications technology should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>explored through technical assistance and capacity-building to increase the efficiency 
</b></p>
<p><b>of case management and working processes, and to reduce undue delays in all courts. 
</b></p>
<p><b>All actors in the judicial system should be trained, in particular on information and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communications technology. 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> The Code of Criminal Procedure should be reformed to reduce the lawful 
</b></p>
<p><b>duration of police custody to a maximum of 48 hours and to ensure that access to a 
</b></p>
<p><b>lawyer during police custody is expressly provided for in the law; and to make the 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal grounds and records of arrest available to the families and to defence counsel. 
</b></p>
<p><b>All allegations of torture should be investigated ex officio by the investigative judge. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b> F. Threats, attacks and lack of protection 
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> Any act of harassment, threat, attack or physical assault against judges, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors or lawyers should be investigated promptly and carefully and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators sanctioned. Appropriate protection measures, should when necessary, be 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided to judges, prosecutors, lawyers and their families. 
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Prosecutorial services 
</b></p>
<p>108.<b> The public prosecution service should be independent of the Minister for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Justice and be headed by the Prosecutor-General of the Republic, who also should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent of the Minister for Justice. The service should be financially autonomous. 
</b></p>
<p>109.<b> The independence of prosecutors vis-&#224;-vis the judiciary should be established in 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant organic laws and other relevant legislation to ensure the distinct role that 
</b></p>
<p><b>each of them should have, in accordance with the Guidelines on the Role of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Prosecutors. 
</b></p>
<p>110.<b> The law governing the selection, appointment and promotion of prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p><b>should include fair, impartial and objective criteria and procedures. Such procedures 
</b></p>
<p><b>and criteria should take into account professional qualifications, ability, integrity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>experience, in accordance with the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors. 
</b></p>
<p>111.<b> The above-mentioned law should ensure that case-specific instructions to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors are eschewed; in extraordinary cases when such instructions are deemed 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary, such instructions should be given in writing, formally recorded and 
</b></p>
<p><b>carefully circumscribed to avoid undue interference or pressure. The law should also 
</b></p>
<p><b>afford prosecutors the right to challenge the instructions received, particularly when 
</b></p>
