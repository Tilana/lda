<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102, in 
which the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted 
by the Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies. The present 
update outlines progress achieved since the last report of the Secretary-General submitted to the 
Council (A/HRC/7/69). 
</p>
<p><b>II. OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER 
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS 
INSTITUTIONS 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
accords priority to the establishment and strengthening of national human rights institutions with 
due regard for the Principles Relating to the Status of National Institutions (the Paris Principles), 
adopted by the General Assembly (resolution 48/134, annex). OHCHR is also engaged in 
improving United Nations system-wide coordination on the work of national human rights 
institutions, and supports their increased participation in the United Nations human rights 
system. OHCHR encourages the sharing of good practices among national human rights 
institutions, supports the strengthening of their regional and international networks and facilitates 
their access to United Nations country teams and other relevant partners within and outside the 
United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>3. The national human rights institutions compliant with the Paris Principles are partners 
central to national human rights protection systems and are important counterparts for OHCHR. 
They can play a crucial role in promoting and monitoring the effective implementation of 
international human rights standards at the national level, a role that is increasingly recognized 
by the international community. 
</p>
<p>4. As pointed out by the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights in 
her opening statement at the ninth International Conference of National Human Rights 
Institutions on 22 October 2008, OHCHR continued in 2008 to support national human rights 
institutions to center their work on core protection issues, such as the prevention of torture and 
degrading treatment, summary executions, arbitrary detention and disappearances, or the 
protection of human rights defenders. The Deputy High Commissioner also mentioned that they 
can, and should, play a role in advancing all aspects of the rule of law, including with regard to 
the judiciary, law enforcement agencies and the correctional system. 
</p><p>5. During the reporting period, OHCHR sought, through a wide range of activities, to 
heighten its commitment to supporting the building of strong national human rights institutions 
and to increasing the effectiveness of their regional coordinating bodies. 
</p>
<p>6. Since 2003, OHCHR has maintained a website on national human rights institutions 
(www.nhri.net). The site, linked to websites of existing national human rights institutions and to 
the OHCHR main webpage, includes information on country and thematic issues of interest to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>those institutions. In 2008, after four years of a valuable and effective partnership with the 
Danish Institute for Human Rights, OHCHR signed a grant agreement with the Indian National 
Human Rights Commission for the management of the above-mentioned website, which will be 
strengthened with the development of an Intranet version that will be available to members of the 
International Coordinating Committee through a username and password. 
</p>
<p>7. In addition, in 2008 the National Institutions Unit of OHCHR introduced a fellowship 
programme and issued new calls for candidates for 2009. Through the programme, A-status staff 
members of national human rights institutions are selected to work in the Unit for six months in 
order to gain knowledge of and experience with the United Nations human rights system. The 
programme is beneficial for OHCHR, in terms of both substantive expertise and the 
consolidation of direct contacts with institution staff globally. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Advisory services provided by the Office 
</b></p>
<p>8. OHCHR has undertaken to strengthen the role of national human rights institutions at the 
country, regional and global levels, mainly through its National Institutions Unit, which works in 
consultation with the geographic and thematic units and field offices of OHCHR. Tailored 
advice is provided on appropriate constitutional or legislative frameworks regarding the 
establishment of institutions and on their nature, functions, powers and responsibilities. 
Comparative analyses, technical cooperation needs assessments, project formulation and 
evaluation missions are also undertaken to both establish and strengthen the institutions. 
</p>
<p>9. During the reporting period, advice and support was provided by OHCHR concerning 
national human rights institutions in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde, 
the Central African Republic, Chile, Denmark, Djibouti, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Guinea Bissau, 
India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Liberia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mauritius, 
Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, South Sudan, Tajikistan, 
Timor-Leste, Togo, Uganda and Uruguay. Advice was frequently provided in collaboration with

institution&#8217;s commissioners. The process is being developed with the Human Rights Office as its 
secretariat. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Support of the Office for regional initiatives 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  The Americas and the Caribbean 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Network of the Americas, supported by OHCHR, organized a seminar on the role of 
national human rights institutions in the implementation of the Convention for Persons with 
Disabilities in 2007. As a result of the workshop, OHCHR supported the publication of a 
handbook on national monitoring of the Convention, which was translated from Spanish into 
English and French and widely distributed in early 2008. 
</p>
<p>36. From 17 to 20 June 2008, OHCHR organized in Brazil a regional meeting for 
Latin America and the Caribbean, in preparation for the Durban Review Conference. It was the 
first of all regional meetings called for under decision PC.1/11, adopted by the Preparatory

their work in promoting and protecting human rights, in the year of the sixtieth anniversary of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Representative endorsed the International 
Coordinating Committee accreditation process for institutions, and stressed the importance of 
their continued engagement with the international human rights system through United Nations 
treaty bodies and the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Africa 
</b></p>
<p>39. OHCHR supported the establishment of the Network of African National Human Rights 
Institutions in 2007, the main purpose of which is to encourage the establishment of human 
rights institutions in Africa in conformity with the Paris Principles, to strengthen their 
effectiveness, and to encourage cooperation among them in Africa. The Network includes 
institutions accredited by the International Coordinating Committee and compliant with the Paris 
Principles. The Constitution of the Network provides that a permanent secretariat of the Network 
is established in Nairobi. With the financial support of OHCHR, an executive director was 
recruited, as was an assistant. In 2008, OHCHR continued to provide financial support for the 
permanent secretariat. OHCHR also encouraged various partners to contribute both financially 
and technically to building its capacity. 
</p>
<p>40. A strengthened network of African national human rights institutions can help to improve 
the human rights situation on the continent. The network highlighted its commitment to 
achieving greater coherence and better coordination with various stakeholders involved in the 
protection of human rights in Africa. In 2008, interaction between the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and human rights institutions in the region developed further. The 
election of the Chairperson of the network in 2008 as one of the five new members of the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights provided an opportunity to develop synergy 
between African institutions and regional human rights protection mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>41. The Network of African National Human Rights Institutions participated in the forty-third 
and forty-forth sessions of the African Commission for Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, held 
respectively in Swaziland from 7 to 22 May 2008, and in Abuja from 10 to 24 November 2008. 
Participation was in the context of the African Commission&#8217;s resolution 31 (XXIV) 98, adopted 
on 31 October 1998 during the twenty-fifth session held in Banjul, in which the Commission 
decided to grant special observer status to any national institution established in Africa and 
functioning according to internationally recognized norms and standards. 
</p>
<p>42. The Arab European Human Rights Dialogue, held in Rabat from 6 to 8 May 2008, was an 
opportunity for European and Arab human rights institutions to discuss legislative and practical 
challenges related to migrants&#8217; rights. It focused on the role of institutions in promoting and 
protecting the rights of migrants. 
</p>
<p>43. From 24 to 26 August 2008, OHCHR organized an intergovernmental regional preparatory 
meeting for Africa, hosted by the Government of Nigeria at the secretariat of the Economic 
Committee of West African States in Abuja. Invitation letters were widely distributed throughout 
the Network. OHCHR supported the participation of staff from the African secretariat and 
A-status national human rights institutions, from Malawi, the Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, the 
United Republic of Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zambia. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Asia and the Pacific 
</b></p>
<p><b>Thirteenth annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Forum of National Institutions 
</b></p>
<p>44. The thirteenth annual meeting of the Asian-Pacific Forum was held in Kuala Lumpur 
from 28 to 31 July 2008. The meeting, hosted by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia 
and co-sponsored by OHCHR, brought together almost 170 representatives from national human 
rights institutions, regional Governments, non-governmental organizations and the 
United Nations to discuss a number of key human rights concerns facing the region, including 
human rights and corporate social responsibility, the universal periodic review, human rights 
defenders and the rights of indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities. 
</p>
<p>45. In its presentation at the meeting, OHCHR mentioned its commitment to establish new 
national human rights institutions and strengthen existing ones in the region, in cooperation with 
United Nations and regional and national partners, such as Governments, existing institutions in 
the region and regional coordinating bodies. It also flagged the improvements made to the 
accreditation process in April 2008 and the importance for human rights institutions to engage 
with the international human rights system, in particular to ensure follow-up at the country level. 
OHCHR expressed its support for a subregional body of national human rights institutions, such 
as the human rights mechanism of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
</p>
<p>46. In the concluding statement (see annex I), the Forum reaffirmed the success of its 
partnership with OHCHR and looked forward to enhancing mutual cooperation and support, 
including through the holding of a Pacific workshop on national human rights institutions. It also 
expressed appreciation to the Chairperson of the International Coordinating Committee for her 
leadership in the review and development of Committee governance. 
</p>
<p><b>International conference on the promotion and protection of the rights of 
migrants in a multicultural society 
</b></p>
<p>47. From 10 to 12 November 2007, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea 
organized an international conference on the promotion and protection of the rights of migrants 
in a multicultural society. In a video message, the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
underscored the crucial role that national human rights institutions can play by contributing to a 
constructive and coherent worldwide strategy to ensure respect for migrants&#8217; rights, curb 
discrimination and build social cohesion.

A-status accredited institution would be a voting member of the incorporated Committee, subject 
to an annual subscription; and each B-status accredited institution would be accepted as a 
non-voting member of the incorporated Committee. The next institutional meeting of the 
Committee will be held the week of 23 March 2009, in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>59. The meeting agreed on the establishment of thematic working groups within the 
Committee: a working group on strategic participation of national human rights institutions in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Durban Review Process, and a working group on human rights and business. The meeting 
also discussed the participation of institutions in the Commission on the Status of Women and 
the Committee&#8217;s engagement in the indigenous rights mechanisms, and agreed to discuss further 
the issues at the next Committee meeting in March 2009. 
</p>
<p>60. Many national human rights institutions showed strong interest in and support for their 
participation in the Durban Review Conference, emphasizing their potential in building 
credibility for the Conference as well as implementing its outcome at the country level. The 
working group on the Durban Review Conference is composed of two institutions from each 
region (Costa Rica, Denmark, Germany, Indonesia, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Rwanda and 
South Africa) and led by co-chairs (the Republic of Korea and South Africa). The working group 
will make a contribution to the outcome paper of the Durban Review Conference. 
</p>
<p>61. The working group on human rights and business will be composed of institution 
representatives from all regions with expertise on the theme. The working group&#8217;s mandate will 
be to support institutions in strategic planning, capacity-building, pooling of resources and 
agenda-setting. A suggestion was made to the Committee Chairperson that human rights and 
business should be the theme of the tenth International Conference in 2010. 
</p>
<p>62. The Chairpersons of the four regional networks reported on their activities within the 
framework of the &#8220;UDHR 60&#8221; campaign, in which the High Commissioner for Human Rights

OHCHR for the financial and technical support provided in the context of the sixtieth 
anniversary of the Universal Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b>Ninth International Conference of National Human Rights Institutions 
</b></p>
<p>63. The ninth International Conference for National Human Rights Institutions was held in 
Nairobi from 21 to 24 October 2008. The Conference was hosted, organized and supported by 
OHCHR, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and the International Coordinating 
Committee. The event also benefited from the support of the Organisation internationale de la 
Francophonie, the Swedish International Development Corporation Agency and UNDP. 
Participants included over 120 representatives of national human rights institutions from all over 
the world, as well as regional coordinating bodies, non-governmental organizations, and 
international human rights experts. Several events were also organized in parallel to the 
Conference (see paragraphs 81-85 below). 
</p>
<p>64. The theme of the Conference was &#8220;National human rights institutions and the 
administration of justice&#8221;. Participants discussed good practices of institutions&#8217; work in 
strengthening the rule of law. Discussions developed around the following issues in different 
panels: (a) the relationship between institutions and the judiciary and the role that they play in 
the administration of justice; (b) institutions&#8217; support for critical components of national human 
rights protection systems; (c) institutions and the fight against impunity; (d) institutions and the 
right to restitution, compensation and rehabilitation for victims of gross human rights violations 
and fundamental freedoms in post-conflict situations; (e) institutions and capacity-building with 
regard to the administration of justice, in particular through reform of the judiciary, the security 
sector and the penal system, juvenile justice reform, or the fight against corruption. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>65. The Conference unanimously adopted the Nairobi Declaration (see annex III), which 
provides institutions with guidelines in performing their role in the administration of justice. The 
Declaration stipulates, inter alia, that institutions will strive to undertake initiatives towards the 
strengthening of the administration of justice within their mandate, and encourage cooperation in 
this area at the regional and international level, including through OHCHR and the wider 
United Nations system; engage in strategic partnerships with civil society organizations to 
implement their activities in the administration of justice; and develop and implement a strategy 
to strengthen the administration of justice. The Declaration also requests that OHCHR prepare a 
report, which would include best practices presented during the Conference. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Subcommittee on Accreditation 
</b></p>
<p>66. OHCHR provided secretarial support to the meetings of the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation, held in April and November 2008 (for a list of national human rights institutions 
with accreditation status as at December 2008, see A/HRC/10/55, annex I). A report of the 
Secretary-General (A/HRC/10/55) provides more information on the accreditation process and 
recent improvements. 
</p>
<p><b>III. COOPERATION BETWEEN UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS 
MECHANISMS AND NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>67. OHCHR has been supporting an enhanced role for national human rights institutions with 
regard to the Human Rights Council, in line with Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2005/74 and past practice of the Commission. Council resolution 5/1 opens many 
opportunities for institutions and their regional coordinating mechanisms to participate in 
Council sessions and to engage with its various mechanisms. Institutions accredited by the 
International Coordinating Committee for compliance with the Paris Principles, the Committee 
itself and regional coordinating bodies of institutions may participate and address the Council in 
an independent capacity and on all agenda items. They may also submit written statements, issue 
documentation (with a United Nations document symbol) and have separate seating 
arrangements. 
</p>
<p>68. With regard to Council mechanisms, institutions have been given a clear and significant 
role by resolution 5/1, for example with regard to the universal periodic review, where one of the 
three types of documents for review will consist of information provided by stakeholders, 
including national human rights institutions. Institutions may play a crucial role in all phases of 
the universal periodic review, from the submission of documentation to attendance of the review 
and follow-up to recommendations. They can also play an important role in the Advisory 
Committee as well as, more specifically, the complaint procedure. 
</p>
<p>69. A workshop for national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations on 
the universal periodic review was held on 19 and 20 November, in Nairobi, to share good 
practices on reporting, participating in the review and follow-up under the review. The meeting 
was organized by Rights and Democracy, OHCHR, the Francophonie and the Commonwealth 
Secretariat. Various human rights institutions that had participated in the review process shared 
their experience. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>70. As an ongoing activity, OHCHR has systematically engaged with treaty body members by 
providing expert analyses concerning national human rights institutions and their related 
activities. In 2008, several institutions made statements and provided reports to treaty bodies in 
relation to the consideration of reports submitted by their respective countries. 
</p>
<p>71. OHCHR prepares and regularly updates a compilation of all treaty body concluding 
observations and recommendations that relate to national human rights institutions 
(www.nhri.net) and systematically sends concluding observations to the institutions of the 
countries concerned, following their adoption. OHCHR also encourages institutions to 
participate in treaty body sessions and the strengthening procedures for their interaction, 
including by providing information on the list of issues, contributing to the sessions and in the 
follow-up to concluding observations. 
</p>
<p>72. In February 2008, OHCHR organized the East African subregional workshop on reporting 
practices to United Nations treaty bodies. National human rights institutions as well as 
government representatives from Burundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia, the 
Sudan, Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda participated. One session focused 
on the role of the said institutions in treaty body reporting. 
</p>
<p>73. On 19 May 2008, OHCHR, in collaboration with the Iberoamerican Federation of 
Ombudsmen and the University of Alcala, held a workshop on the role of national human rights 
institutions in the protection of economic, social and cultural rights during the session of the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Their role in the promotion of the 
justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights was discussed in this context, with 
institutions from Spanish-speaking countries participating. 
</p>
<p>74. A meeting of chairpersons of human rights treaty bodies was held from 23 
to 25 June 2008. The National Institutions Unit gave a written update of the developments 
regarding interaction between national human rights institutions and treaty bodies and shared a 
table of good practices in this area. 
</p>
<p>75. Since 2003, OHCHR has been involved in the European Union-funded project entitled 
&#8220;Strengthening the implementation of human rights treaty recommendations through the 
enhancement of national protection mechanisms&#8221;, which aims at improving the implementation 
of conclusions and recommendations of human rights treaty bodies at the national level by the 
strengthening of the capacity of national human rights institutions, non-governmental 
organizations and the media. Activities are designed to enhance their participation in the 
reporting process and to encourage the use of international human rights instruments and treaty 
body recommendations in their respective areas of work to further the promotion and protection 
of human rights. A regional workshop was held in Panama from 27 to 29 August 2008 with 
participants from Argentina, Columbia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico and Panama. National 
workshops were held in Morocco and Indonesia in December 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>76. Human rights institutions can be instrumental in the work of special procedures 
mandate-holders, specifically with regard to country visits (preparation, meetings during the 
visit, follow-up to recommendations); early warning; participation in and organization of 
thematic studies, conferences and seminars; and interaction in international forums, such as the 
Human Rights Council or the annual meeting of special procedures mandate-holders. 
Increasingly, mandate-holders look to the institutions for assistance in ensuring that their 
recommendations are followed up at the national level. 
</p>
<p>77. On 26 June 2008, an interactive dialogue was held among special procedures 
mandate-holders, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations. The 
representative of the International Coordinating Committee presented a statement on enhanced 
cooperation between the institutions and mandate-holders and follow-up to recommendations, as 
well as a paper on interaction between institutions and mandate-holders. 
</p>
<p>78. On 25 and 26 October 2008, OHCHR, in collaboration with the Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons and the Brookings-Bern 
Project on Internal Displacement, organized a seminar in Nairobi on the role of African national 
institutions in protecting the human rights of internally displaced persons. The workshop 
provided an overview of the legal and normative framework for protecting internally displaced 
persons; shared guidelines on developing national laws and policies on internally displaced 
persons; and discussed specific strategies for national institutions to protect and assist internally 
displaced persons. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. COOPERATION AMONG THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH  
COMMISSIONER, UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES AND  
PROGRAMMES, AND INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS ON NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS  
INSTITUTIONS 
</b></p>
<p>79. In 2008, OHCHR continued to strengthen its cooperation with United Nations country 
teams worldwide. OHCHR is cooperating with UNDP and the human rights institutions of 
Denmark, South Africa and Uganda to develop a country team toolkit for UNDP staff, which is 
due to be launched jointly by OHCHR and UNDP by June 2009. 
80. In March 2008, a HURITALK e-discussion was held on the theme &#8220;The role of 
United Nations agencies and country teams in supporting national human rights institutions&#8221;. 
Contributions were received from United Nations agencies, civil society organizations and 
experts from all regions, emphasizing the role that credible and independent human rights 
institutions can play as national partners to promote the rule of law, good governance and human 
rights or to contribute to other priority areas, such as poverty reduction. The e-discussion<b>1</b> 
focused on (a) the role of human rights institutions in promoting human rights and development 
objectives; (b) ensuring their credibility and independence, maintaining relationships with civil

</p>
<p>society, and the specific role of United Nations agencies therein; and (c) strategies for helping 
human rights institutions to carry out their functions effectively and the specific role of 
United Nations agencies. 
</p>
<p><b>V. COOPERATION WITH NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS  
AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Universal periodic review workshops 
</b></p>
<p>81. In April, July and October 2008, Rights and Democracy, OHCHR, the Francophonie and 
the Commonwealth Secretariat organized universal periodic review workshops in Geneva, 
Kuala Lumpur and Nairobi. Various national human rights institutions that participated in the 
review process shared their experience. 
</p>
<p><b>Non-governmental organization forum (Nairobi) 
</b>82. As part of the ninth International Conference of National Human Rights Institutions, a 
forum was held with over 100 participants from international, regional and national 
organizations. The main theme was improving access to justice for vulnerable groups through 
partnerships between non-governmental organizations and national human rights institutions. 
OHCHR briefed participates on current activities to strengthen the capacity of institutions to 
fulfil their core mandate, including through a more rigorous accreditation process. A plan of 
action for cooperation between institutions and non-governmental organizations was developed 
by some 50 organizations at the Forum. Some, including Amnesty International and the 
International Commission of Jurors, expressed their interest in helping OHCHR to enhance the 
protection potential of institutions at the national level to make them the first &#8220;port of call&#8221; for 
victims of human rights violations and vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p><b>Equitas 
</b></p>
<p>83. During the above-mentioned conference, Equitas launched a new handbook on economic, 
social and cultural rights for women, developed in partnership with UNDP for human rights 
institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>Harvard University Law School human rights programme 
</b></p>
<p>84. At the above-mentioned conference, the Director of the human rights programme of 
Harvard University Law School gave an overview of the programme and described the range of 
opportunities available to institutions, including fellowships, internship and dedicated support 
from a large number of Harvard Law school students. He also referred to a planned publication 
on institutions and the administration of justice by Harvard University and OHCHR. 
<b>Association for the Prevention of Torture 
</b></p>
<p>85. In 2008, OHCHR, in cooperation with the Association for the Prevention of Torture and 
the Asia-Pacific Forum for National Human Rights Institutions developed a publication entitled 
&#8220;Prevention of torture: an operational guide for national human rights institutions&#8221;, which builds </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>on the experience of the Actors for Change Project, conducted with OHCHR and the 
non-governmental organization Fahamu, and funded by the European Union. The guide is a 
practical tool for human rights institutions actively involved in torture prevention, stressing the 
importance of engaging in a global strategy. The Association presented the draft guide at the 
above-mentioned conference. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  ROUND TABLES ON THEMATIC ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conflict prevention and prevention of torture 
</b></p>
<p>86. The project &#8220;Actors for change: strengthening the capacity of national human rights 
institutions through distance and regional training&#8221; commenced in 2005 with the aim of 
strengthening the capacity of human rights institutions to prevent torture and engage in the 
prevention of conflict, including early warning. The project ended in 2007 and was reviewed 
in 2008. Funded by the European Union, it was implemented by OHCHR in partnership with the 
United Nations System Staff College, the Association for the Prevention of Torture and Fahamu. 
</p>
<p>87. After evaluation, it was concluded that the project had exceeded its targets and been an 
unqualified success. A key component of the project, the Actors for Change distance-learning 
programme, was overwhelmingly considered a success by participants. The materials were 
deemed relevant, useful, challenging and clear; links with human rights practitioners were 
established at an early stage, encouraging the development of processional connections; the 
workshops provided practical and real learning experience; and some very positive stories were 
reported of dissemination of learning among civil society, the prison service, police and even the 
military. In addition, there was strong support from both the executive direction and participants 
for further training using this approach on different themes and for similar courses for other 
colleagues in institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>88. The Secretary-General launched a year-long campaign to commemorate the sixtieth 
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, focused on &#8220;dignity and justice for 
all of us&#8221;. Within the campaign, OHCHR is paying special attention to the rights of people 
deprived of their liberty in prisons and other places of detention. OHCHR specifically designated 
6 to 12 October 2008 as the Dignity and Justice for Detainees Week, and invited human rights 
institutions and other partners to conduct focused activities in, and/or related to, places of 
detention during that week and throughout 2008. OHCHR plans to compile an official report on 
activities of institutions carried out during the year, with case studies and personal stories, which 
will serve as a guide for further efforts to protect the dignity of and justice for persons deprived 
of their liberty. 
</p>
<p>89. Several institutions have received OHCHR funding (totalling $143,000) in connection with 
planned activities, which were linked to the High Commissioner&#8217;s initiative on detention. 
Requests for funding were accepted from institutions in Ecuador, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, 
Mongolia, Panama, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Togo and Uganda. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Transitional justice 
</b>90. Following an international round table of national human rights institutions on transitional 
justice, hosted by OHCHR and the South African Human Rights Commission, in Cape Town, 
South Africa, from 22 to 25 November 2007, OHCHR elaborated a guidance note<b> </b>on institutions 
and transitional justice. The note is intended to assist institutions in their engagement with 
transitional justice to improve their institutional role of promoting and protecting human rights 
during the period of democratic transition.  
</p>
<p><b>VII.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>91. National human rights institutions compliant with the Paris Principles are key elements of 
a strong, effective national human rights protection system. In particular, they can support 
Governments in ensuring that international human rights norms are applied at the national level, 
including by facilitating follow-up actions to the recommendations resulting from the 
international human rights system. The Secretary-General encourages closer cooperation 
between non-governmental organizations and these institutions, especially in connection with 
core protection issues, including the protection of human rights defenders. They have also shown 
to be important partners in the international human rights system, especially through the Human 
Rights Council, the human rights treaty bodies and special procedures. 
</p>
<p>92. The Secretary-General welcomes the recent unanimous adoption by the General Assembly 
of its resolution 63/172 on national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights, 
in which the Assembly, inter alia, reaffirms the importance of the development of effective, 
independent and pluralistic institutions in line with the Paris Principles; recognizes the role of 
independent institutions working with Governments to ensure respect for human rights at the 
national level, including in the follow-up to recommendations from international human rights 
mechanisms; encourages Member States to establish or strengthen institutions, and welcomes the 
growing number of States doing so; recognizes the role played by human rights institutions in the 
Human Rights Council, including the universal periodic review and special procedures, as well 
as in treaty bodies, in accordance with Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 and Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 2005/74; acknowledges the role of institutions in the strengthening of 
the rule of law; commends the high priority given by OHCHR to work on institutions and 
encourages the High Commissioner to ensure that appropriate arrangements are made and 
budgetary resources provided to continue and further extend these activities and invites 
Governments to contribute additional voluntary funds to that end; and encourages institutions to 
seek accreditation status through the International Coordinating Committee and notes with 
satisfaction the strengthening of the accreditation procedure and the continued assistance of 
OHCHR in this regard, as well as the assistance of OHCHR to Committee conferences. 
</p>
<p>93. The Secretary-General also appreciates the adoption of the Nairobi Declaration at the ninth 
International Conference of National Human Rights Institutions. The text, agreed unanimously 
by over 150 representatives of 51 fully compliant institutions worldwide, is testimony of their 
growing role in the administration of justice and the rule of law. They are encouraged to give due 
attention to the practical recommendations of the Conference with respect to action and 
cooperation with the judiciary, the police and prison administration and to follow-up on them at 
the national level. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>94. The Secretary-General encourages closer cooperation of national human rights institutions 
with the United Nations system and encourages them to become its partners, especially in efforts 
to establish or strengthen the rule of law. The Secretary-General also welcomes the incorporation 
under Swiss law of the International Coordinating Committee and recent developments 
concerning the accreditation procedure of the Subcommittee on Accreditation. Upholding the 
Paris Principles through a more rigorous and transparent system of accreditation, with the 
support of OHCHR, ultimately strengthens the national human rights protection system and thus 
the promotion and protection of human rights. </p>

</p>
<p>General Guidelines 
</p>
<p>The State has the primary responsibility to protect, promote and respect human rights and ensure 
that the administration of justice is in full compliance with both international and domestic 
human rights obligations. The following are the main areas where NHRIs, through the exercise 
of their mandate, working closely with partners, including the NGOs, may become involved in 
order to strengthen the administration of justice: 
NHRIs and the Judiciary and Access to Justice 
</p>
<p>33. NHRIs should consider, in contributing to the promotion of the role of the judiciary in 
promoting and protecting human rights, the following actions: 
</p>
<p>(a) Role of NHRIs in Receiving Cases of Human Rights Violations and assisting 
victims: complaints-handling in a sequential nature; i.e. NHRIs may handle 
complaints submitted to them by a complainant and by settling the case through 
conciliation and mediation, thereby relieving the existing case-load of courts; 
Ensuring victims of human rights violations receive compensation, including 
encouragement of the establishment of the fund for this purpose; Promoting equal 
access to justice and assisting victims seeking redress with information on the law 
and the legal system particularly in relation to marginalized or vulnerable groups as 
well as migrants; 
</p>
<p>(b) Seeking informal legal redress mechanisms through conciliation or through binding 
decisions; 
</p>
<p>(c) Providing Recommendations to strengthen the legal system and judiciary: Proposing 
and contributing to legislative reforms to strengthen the judiciary (e.g. procedures 
related to the level and appointment of prosecutors and judges and qualifying 
lawyers; the independence of the judiciary and its capacity to adjudicate cases fairly 
and competently); Advocating for strengthening of laws to improve the judicial or 
criminal law system including enacting a law against torture where none exist; 
Strengthening the compliance of informal and traditional justice systems with 
international human rights standards by monitoring traditional justice mechanisms 
and addressing all  forms of discrimination both in the composition of traditional 
justice tribunals, their procedures and in terms of substantive outcomes of cases; 
</p>
<p>(d) Promoting adherence and compliance of the judiciary to international human rights 
norms including through amicus and legal education: Increasing awareness and 
knowledge by the judiciary of international human rights norms, standards and 
practices and related jurisprudence, including through training, seminars, study tours, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>or articles in professional legal publications. Engaging with judicial educational 
bodies and professional legal training bodies; Assisting in the education of judges, 
lawyers, prosecutors and other judicial authorities (e.g. ensuring curricula reflect 
international human rights law); Providing support for the development of legal 
education facilities (e.g. library); informing persons who filed petitions with NHRIs 
of their rights and remedies available intervening in courts as amicus curiae, 
nationally and, if existing, in regional human rights mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>(e) Taking action where officials in the judiciary are faced by intimidation, threats or 
violence; 
</p>
<p>(f) Through their research and monitoring functions examining the conditions of access 
to justice for all, with particular reference to indigent, vulnerable and marginalized 
groups; 
</p>
<p>NHRIs and Legal Aid Providers and Systems 
</p>
<p>34. Encouraging and supporting the establishment of legal aid centres that provide out-reach 
services and enhance access to justice, especially for people living in poverty, and other 
vulnerable groups; 
</p>
<p>35. Finding appropriate means of cooperating with such centres, in particular to ensure that 
human rights are thoroughly integrated into the provision of legal aid; 
</p>
<p>36. Encouraging the establishment of autonomously managed legal aid schemes in order to 
meet obligations in national and international law; 
</p>
<p>37. Working to ensure legal recognition and standardization of paralegalism; 
</p>
<p>NHRIs and Law Enforcement 
</p>
<p>38. NHRIs, together with relevant stakeholders, should strive to strengthen law enforcement 
systems, institutions and personnel, including through: 
</p>
<p>(a) Initiating the development, publication and implementation of education and training 
resources on human rights and international humanitarian law standards, 
investigation techniques for law enforcement and security forces and encourage them 
to incorporate human rights and international humanitarian law into all levels of their 
programs; 
</p>
<p>(b) Developing or revising standing orders that apply to police and security forces to 
meet international human rights and international humanitarian law standards, in 
particular related to places of detention, procedures of arrest, investigation and 
interrogation; 
</p>
<p>(c) Encouraging alternatives to pre-trial detention (such as bail, surveillance reporting 
and non-cash guarantees); </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(d) Encouraging non-custodial measures of punishment (such as community service, 
fines, restitution or compensation to the victim), especially for breast-feeding 
mothers in detention; 
</p>
<p>(e) Presenting concrete proposals aimed at ensuring that minor offences do not come 
under the ambit of the criminal law system; for instance, by strengthening mediation 
and direct victim compensation, and promoting local community structures for 
resolving petty crimes; 
</p>
<p>(f) Periodic site inspections (announced and unannounced) of police stations and 
prisons, in close partnership with other independent structures tasked with this role 
and law enforcement and other national authorities, encouraging them to take 
appropriate, prompt action; 
</p>
<p>(g) Legislative proposals on the setting up of accountability mechanisms, monitoring 
systems to ensure their application and internal investigation procedures and 
sanctions; 
</p>
<p>(h) Monitoring and reporting on alleged cases of corruption in the police and security 
forces; 
</p>

violators, as well as cases of corruption and abuse of authority); 
</p>
<p>(j) Public awareness-raising on complaints procedures against the police; 
(k) Encouraging fair remuneration and working conditions for law enforcement and 
</p>
<p>security personnel; 
</p>
<p>NHRIs and places of detention 
</p>
<p>39. NHRIs should encourage their Governments to ratify the Convention against Torture 
(CAT) and its Optional Protocol (OPCAT), and to consider their designation as national 
preventive mechanism in this context, only if the necessary powers and resources are made 
available to them; 
</p>
<p>40. NHRIs should ensure their Governments adopt appropriate measures to ensure that all 
detainees are able to enjoy their rights to, among other things, health, food, water and 
education; 
</p>
<p>41. NHRIs should work with their Governments to ensure that those in detention have the 
opportunity to complain about violations of their rights, including to the NHRI (for 
example through face-to-face complaints, complaint boxes or on-site human rights 
counselling services), and, where a violation is found, that detainees have access to a 
remedy and compensation; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>42. NHRIs should monitor their Governments&#8217; obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the 
rights of all people in detention, especially vulnerable or marginalised groups, and support 
their reintegration within society; 
</p>
<p>43. NHRIs should strive to strengthen the correctional system and its personnel, including

</p>
<p>(f) Assistance in vetting processes of staff of any place of detention; 
</p>
<p>(g) Legislative review and proposals (possibly based on individual complaints), 
including on minimum standards for correctional facilities; codes of conduct for 
correctional staffs; the intake, incarceration and transfer of inmates; 
</p>
