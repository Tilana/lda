IN THE COURT OF APPEAL FIJI ISLANDS
ON APPEAL FROM THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI

MISC. ACTION NO. 02 OF 2008S
(High Court Action No. HAM 8 /2008S)

BETWEEN:

SAKIUSA ROKONABETE
Appellant

AND:

THE STATE
Respondent

In Chambers: Randall Powell, Justice of Appeal

Hearing: Thursday, 10 and Friday 11 April 2008, Suva

Counsel: Appellant in Person
A Driu and H Tabete for the Respondent

Date of Judgment: Friday, 11 April 2008, Suva

JUDGMENT

[1]     
Sakiusa Rokonabete ("the applicant") seeks variation of a cash bail condition.

[2]     
On 6 September 2007 the applicant, having been charged with robbery, had a bail hearing before Winter J and on that day was granted bail "in your own recognisance of $1,500.00. There will be one surety of $1,500.00, $500.00 cash the balance will be non-cash"

[3]     
He had been in custody since July 2007.

[4]     
Other conditions were imposed including living under curfew between 9 pm and 8 am and reporting to the Nasinu Police Station on Sundays and Fridays.

[5]     
A co-accused, Akuile Dromudole, was given bail of "$1,500.00 non cash in respect of you and an additional $1,500.00 from a surety of which $500.00 will be cash and $1,000.00 non cash".

[6]     
It seems that the co-accused was successful in having bail varied to $100 surety cash bail. 

[7]     
On 1 February 2008 Justice Goundar ordered that this application be transferred to the Court of Appeal.

[8]     
Winter J was satisfied that bail was appropriate for the applicant. There is nothing before me to suggest that the applicant should be treated any differently from his co-accused at least one of whom has since had his bail condition reduced. 

[9]     
It would be unfair not to vary the cash bail conditions to $100.00 cash. 

[10]    
 I will refer the matter back to the High Court so that the surety can be tested and the $100 posted as security to the High Court Registry.
