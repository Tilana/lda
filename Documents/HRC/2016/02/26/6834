<p><b>Introduction 
</b> 
1. The present report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism contains summaries of 
communications transmitted to Governments between 1 January and 31 December 2006, as well 
as replies received up to 31 January 2007. In addition, the report covers press releases issued in 
2006. 
 
2. During the period under review the Special Rapporteur corresponded with Governments, 
either separately or jointly with other Special Rapporteurs, in 33 communications and he issued 7 
press releases that relate to a total of 24 countries or territories. In specific cases, the Special 
Rapporteur decided to address the concerns related to his mandate in a separate letter, instead of 
joining communications of other special procedures.  
 
3. In 2006, the Special Rapporteur received replies from 12 of the 24 Governments to which he 
had addressed communications. In addition, three Governments provided replies to 
communications sent in 2005. Most of the Governments offered detailed substantive information 
on the allegations received. The Special Rapporteur underlines that it is crucial that Governments 
share their views with him on the allegations received. The Special Rapporteur encourages 
cooperation from those Governments which have not yet provided replies to his 
communications. Replies received after 31 January 2007 and replies received during the 
reporting period, which were not able to be translated in time, will be reflected in the next 
communication report to the Human Rights Council.  
 
4. In most cases, the Special Rapporteur acted upon information received from reliable sources 
concerning individual cases of alleged breaches of fundamental freedoms and human rights in 
the context of countering terrorism. In addition, he also took action with respect to legislative 
developments and proposals undertaken by a number of Member States. The Special Rapporteur 
recognizes that problems concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms in the context of 
countering terrorism are not only confined to the countries and territories mentioned.  
 
5. In accordance with paragraph 14(e) of Commission on Human Rights Resolution 2005/80, as 
extended by Human Rights Council decision 1/102, the Special Rapporteur entered into a 
dialogue with several Member States on the preparation of legislation designed to combat 
terrorism. The Special Rapporteur, to the greatest possible extent, engaged with respective 
Governments during the drafting stage of the legislation. In the form of communications, press 
releases and informal consultations, the Special Rapporteur conveyed his main concerns to the 
Governments, some of which took the opportunity to reply, outlining their views and responding 
to specific questions posed by the Special Rapporteur. He regards this exchange of views as a 
positive and constructive dialogue resulting in a joint effort to draft and implement legislative 
frameworks that are equipped to successfully combating terrorism while at the same time 
effectively promoting and protecting human rights. With a view to his mandate, including the 
provision of advisory services or technical assistance found in paragraph (a) of Resolution 
2005/80, the Special Rapporteur encourages more Member States to enter into dialogue, ideally 
during the preparatory stage of the adoption of new counter terrorism legislation or legislation on 
terrorism related offences. </p>

</b>6. On 27 June 2006 the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Government of Afghanistan, in 
which he referred to the <b>draft law against terrorism</b>. The Special Rapporteur drew the 
Government&#8217;s attention to four substantive areas of concern. First, he pointed to the concern that 
terrorist acts as contained in Articles 5-12 of the draft law were defined as terrorist crimes 
without any requirement of specific terrorist intent or an underlying political or ideological 
cause. Second, Articles 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, and 15 of the draft law were not limited to serious acts of 
violence and were therefore overly broad. Furthermore, he referred to the concern that Article 21 
of the draft law did not comply with the principle of legality since this Article gives precedence 
to this law in respect of any other conflicting law. Finally, the Special Rapporteur raised the 
issue of sanctions attached to terrorist offences pointing to the death penalty as provided in 
Articles 5-12, 14 and 15 of the draft law.

8. Le 20 mars 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; une lettre au Gouvernement d&#8217;Alg&#233;rie 
concernant la <b>l&#233;gislation dans le domaine de la lutte contre le terrorisme, </b>en particulier le 
d&#233;cret l&#233;gislatif 92-03 relatif &#224; la lutte contre la subversion et le terrorisme (en partie incorpor&#233; &#224; 
l&#8217;article 87 bis du Code P&#233;nal) et certaines dispositions du Code de Proc&#233;dure P&#233;nale ainsi que 
certaines dispositions de la Charte pour la Paix et le R&#233;conciliation Nationale et l&#8217;ordonnance 
06-01 portant application de la Charte. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, l&#8217;article 87 bis du Code 
P&#233;nal comprend une d&#233;finition tr&#232;s large et g&#233;n&#233;rale de ce qui constitue un acte subversif et 
terroriste. De plus, le Code de Proc&#233;dure P&#233;nale permet une garde &#224; vue pouvant durer jusqu&#8217;&#224; 
12 jours dans les cas de crimes qualifi&#233;s d&#8217;actes terroristes ou subversifs (article 51) et la 
d&#233;tention provisoire peut &#234;tre prolong&#233;e cinq fois lorsqu&#8217;il s&#8217;agit de crimes terroristes (article 
125). Deuxi&#232;mement, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a soulev&#233; des question relatives &#224; la Charte pour la 
Paix et la R&#233;conciliation Nationale qui pr&#233;voit notamment (a) l&#8217;extinction des poursuites 
judiciaires &#224; l&#8217;encontre de tous les individus impliqu&#233;s dans des r&#233;seaux de soutien au terrorisme, 
qui d&#233;cident de d&#233;clarer leurs activit&#233;s aux autorit&#233;s alg&#233;riennes comp&#233;tentes (article II.4), (b) la 
gr&#226;ce pour les individus condamn&#233;s et d&#233;tenus pour des activit&#233;s de soutient au terrorisme 
(article II.6) ainsi que (c) la commutation et remise de peine pour ceux qui ne sont pas touch&#233;s 
par les mesures d&#8217;extinction des poursuites ou de gr&#226;ce, ce qui inclut les individus qui ont &#233;t&#233; 
impliqu&#233;s dans des attentats &#224; l&#8217;explosif dans des lieux publics. Finalement, l&#8217;ordonnance 06-01 
du 27 f&#233;vrier 2005, qui met en oeuvre les dispositions de la Charte pour la Paix et la </p>

R&#233;conciliation Nationale, pr&#233;voit dans son article 20 que les dispositions relatives &#224; la r&#233;cidive 
sont applicables aux individus qui ont b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233;, <i>inter alia</i>, de mesures d&#8217;extinction des 
poursuites pr&#233;vus par l&#8217;ordonnance en application de la Charte si &#224; l&#8217;avenir ils se rendent 
coupables de violations des articles du Code P&#233;nal relatifs aux actes terroristes et subversifs. De 
plus, l&#8217;article 26 de l&#8217;ordonnance en application de l&#8217;article III.3 de la Charte pr&#233;voit 
l&#8217;interdiction d&#8217;exercer une activit&#233; politique aux individus ayant &#171; particip&#233; &#224; des actions 
terroristes &#187;.  
 
9. Par lettre du 26 juin 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial 
charg&#233; d'examiner les questions se rapportant &#224; la torture, a attir&#233; l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement 
d&#8217;Alg&#233;rie sur la situation de &#8220;V&#8221; et &#8220;I&#8221;, citoyens alg&#233;riens (cf. paragraphe 64). Selon les 
information re&#231;ues, &#171; V &#187; et &#171; I &#187; ont &#233;t&#233; qualifi&#233;s de &#8220; terroristes internationaux soup&#231;onn&#233;s&#8221; 
par les autorit&#233;s britanniques, sur la base d&#8217;informations confidentielles produites par les services 
de renseignement. Ces informations n&#8217;ont &#233;t&#233; communiqu&#233;es ni aux individus en question, ni &#224; 
leurs avocats, qui ont donc &#233;t&#233; dans l&#8217;impossibilit&#233; de les contester. Les deux individus &#233;taient 
d&#233;tenus dans une prison de haute s&#233;curit&#233;. Ces individus ont &#233;t&#233; expuls&#233;s de Grande Bretagne par 
les autorit&#233;s britanniques vers l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie, les 16 et 17 juin respectivement, pour cause de &#171; danger 
&#224; la s&#233;curit&#233; nationale &#187; pos&#233; par ces individus au Royaume Uni. Les deux individus seraient 
d&#233;tenus dans un endroit gard&#233; secret depuis leur retour en Alg&#233;rie, et ils n&#8217;auraient pas pu entrer 
en contact avec leurs familles, en violation du droit alg&#233;rien, et ce malgr&#233; des assurances donn&#233;e 
par le consulat alg&#233;rien &#224; Londres qu&#8217;ils n&#8217;&#233;taient pas recherch&#233;s par la police en Alg&#233;rie et 
qu&#8217;ils seraient rel&#226;ch&#233;s apr&#232;s quelques heures pass&#233;s au commissariat de police de l&#8217;a&#233;roport 
pour remplir des formalit&#233;s. Ces deux individus seraient d&#233;tenus par une agence de 
renseignement militaire, le D&#233;partement du renseignement et de la s&#233;curit&#233; (DRS), sp&#233;cialis&#233; 
dans les interrogatoires d&#8217;individus poss&#233;dant des informations li&#233;s au terrorisme. Le Rapporteur 
a prie le Gouvernement de prendre toutes les mesures n&#233;cessaires pour assurer la protection des 
droits et des libert&#233;s des individus mentionn&#233;s, de diligenter des enqu&#234;tes sur les violations qui 
auraient &#233;t&#233; perp&#233;tr&#233;es et de traduire les responsables en justice. Le Gouvernement &#233;tait aussi 
demand&#233; d&#8217;adopter, le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant, toutes les mesures n&#233;cessaires pour pr&#233;venir la r&#233;p&#233;tition des

<p><i>Australia 
</i> 
(a)<b> </b><i>Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur<b></b></i><b> 
</b> 
12. On 18 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur addressed a communication to the Government of 
Australia, in which he drew the Government&#8217;s attention to the cases of <b>Amer Haddara, Shane 
Kent, Fadal Sayadi, Abdullah Merhi, Ahmed Raad, Ezzit Raad, Hany Taha, Aimen Joud, 
Abdul Nacer Benbrika, Bassam Raad, Majed Raad, Shoue Hammoud and Izzydeen Attik</b>. 
These individuals were awaiting trial for various offences relating mostly to membership and 
support of a terrorist organisation under the anti-terror provisions of the Criminal Code Act 1995 
at the maximum security Acacia Unit of Barwon Prison in Victoria. The Special Rapporteur 
referred to an Urgent Appeal, which was sent by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
or belief and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges on 15 August 2006, relating 
to the same individuals but different issues. The Special Rapporteur expressed his serious 
concerns with regard to the practice of segregation of individuals on remand for terrorist 
offences. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur asked that the Government provides 
information about the exact charges for which these individuals are awaiting trial and the 
justification for the necessity and proportionality of the measures taken vis-&#224;-vis them.  
<b> 
</b>(b)<b> </b><i>Communication from the Government 
 
</i>13. By letter of 30 November 2006, the Government replied to the communication of the Special 
Rapporteur of 18 August 2006 as well as to other letters sent by special procedures on the same 
individuals. First, the Government suggests that the special procedures produce coordinated 
letters and requests for information which relate to the same case. Second, the Government 
highlights that pursuant to section 120 of the Constitution of Australia, the responsibility to 
house federal offenders, including those of remand, lies with the States and Territories, which is 
in the case Victoria. As regards the charges, the Government indicates that each of the 
individuals was charged with being a member of a terrorist organisation under section 102.3 of 
the Criminal Code. Various additional charges have also been laid against some of the men, 
including charges of intentionally recruiting a person to join a terrorist organisation, intentionally 
making funds available to a terrorist organisation, and possessing a thing connected with the 
preparation of a terrorist act. The Government further informs that the alleged offenders are 
being held on remand in Barwon Prison in Victoria, which is a maximum security facility. The </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1

prison houses remand prisoners as the need arises. The alleged offenders are held within the 
Acacia High Security Unit. This Unit houses both remand and convicted prisoners; however, 
remand and convicted prisoners do not mix, which is consistent with Guideline 1.11 of the 
Standard Guidelines for Prisoners under the Revised Guidelines for Corrections in Australia 
2004, with Rule 8(b) of the Standards Minimum Rules on the Treatment of Prisoners and article 
10(2) (a) of the International Covenant Civil and Political Rights. Moreover, the Government 
informs that the alleged offenders have never been held in solitary confinement, but rather in 
individual cells. The Government also indicates that remand prisoners do not have limits on the 
number of visits from professionals, except by the conflicting demands of other prisoners to have 
access to the contact rooms available for professional visits, in accordance with article 14(3)(b) 
of the International Covenant Civil and Political Rights. Lawyers may visit their clients in the 
Acacia Unit between 8:45 am and 3.30 pm. Visits are video monitored for security reasons, but 
there is no audio sound or recording. Remand prisoners may make an unlimited number of legal 
professional calls.

<p><i>Bahrain 
</i> 
(a)<b> </b><i>Communications sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur<b></b></i><b> 
</b> 
14. By letter dated 29 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government of Bahrain 
with regard to the <b>draft law on counter-terrorism</b>, which was tabled before Parliament in 
March 2005. The Special Rapporteur drew the Government&#8217;s attention to two substantive areas 
of concern. First, Article 1 of the March 2005 draft law contained a broad definition of terrorism 
and Article 2 of the draft law set out a list of trigger offences which may lead to the existence of 
a terrorist crime. Article 6 of the draft law, in turn, criminalized establishing, organizing, 
managing or having a prominent role in an organization, notwithstanding its name, that uses 
terrorism as one of the means to carry out its objective. By way of example, the reference in 
Article 1 of the draft law to &#8220;any use of force or violence or the threat thereof&#8221; was very vague. 
In addition, Article 2 point (3) and the reference in Article 1 to &#8220;damage&#8221; to &#8220;public or private 
facilities, buildings and properties or their occupation, or obstructing their work&#8221; and to 
&#8220;obstructing the public authorities or religious buildings or educational faculties from doing their 
work&#8221; were likely to allow demonstrations by civil society, students or labour unions to be 
qualified as terrorist groups and sanctioned as such. Second, the March 2005 draft law stated that 
an order of detention may be issued for a maximum of 90 days by the Public Prosecutor (Article 
29) and that for individuals against whom there is enough evidence or where there is a case of 
flagrante delicto, the initial period of detention may last 14 days upon a decision by a judicial 
arrest officer and may be renewed once upon authorization by the public prosecutor (Article 30). 
Therefore, under this draft law, it was possible that an individual is detained up to 90 days 
without the involvement of any member of the judiciary. In addition, under the Article 31of the 
Draft Law, evidence which is used to extend the initial 14 day detention period was considered 
as strictly confidential to the public prosecution and it was forbidden to reveal either the 
information or reveal the names of those who have presented it.  
 
15. On 30 June 2006 the Special Rapporteur once again wrote to the Government of Bahrain 
with regard to the <b>draft law on counter terrorism</b> as he was advised that it was to be 
deliberated by Parliament in early July 2006, reportedly with a new title called &#8220;Protecting 
Society from Terrorists Acts&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur reiterated his concerns on some aspects of </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
 page 9 
 
the draft text and to highlight some additional concerns. First, he re-stated his concerns about the 
broadness of the definition of terrorism contained in the draft law, which he was advised had not 
been amended in the pending draft and had in fact already been adopted in another piece of 
legislation, namely the &#8220;Prohibition and Counter Money Laundering bill&#8221;. The Special 
Rapporteur highlighted that the Bahraini definition suffers from the absence of two of the 
cumulative conditions for classifying a crime as a terrorist crime: there was no requirement of a 
specific aim to further an underlying political or ideological cause and some acts were qualified 
as terrorist without the intention of causing death or serious bodily injury. Second, the 
restrictions brought to freedom of association and assembly contained in the draft law, in 
particular Articles 5, 6, 8 and 9, were of concern. The third matter of concern was that of 
incitement to terrorism, contained in Article 10 of the draft law criminalizing the use of religious 
and public places to propagate provocative appeals or extremist ideas, as well as placing posters, 
pictures and signs that might insult religions or harm the national unity, social peace or 
destabilize public order and Article 12 of the draft law criminalizing the promotion or approval 
&#8220;in any way of a crime committed for terrorist purposes&#8221;. Finally, the extensive powers of the 
Public Prosecutor regarding detention for up to 90 days without judicial review, which the 
Special Rapporteur also raised in his letter of 29 March, remained of concern. 
 
(b)<b> </b><i>Communication from the Government 
 
</i>16. By letter of 29 September 2006, the Government replied to the communication sent on 29 
March 2006. The Government informs the Special Rapporteur that the definition in the draft law 
does not go beyond the scope of the definition found in the regional conventions to which the 
Kingdom is a party or the laws currently in force, including the Arab Convention for the 
Suppression of Terrorism, which it ratified pursuant to Decree Law No. 15 of 1998, the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference Convention on Combating Terrorism, which it ratified 
pursuant to Decree Law No. 26 of 2002, and the Counter Terrorism Convention of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council, issued pursuant to Act No. 24 of 2005. The Government points out that the 
definition of terrorism in the draft law does not go beyond the scope of the definition contained 
in comparable laws, as explained above (Qatari law, Egyptian law, Emirates law, French law). 
The Government further advises that the proposed definition of terrorism consists of three main 
components which must be present to meet the condition of an aggravating circumstance with 
respect to offences committed for a terrorist aim. If any of these components is missing, the 
aggravating circumstance will not apply and the offence will not be subject to the penalties set 
out in the counter-terrorism law. Instead, it will be subject to the penalty prescribed in any other 
law, if there is one. The three components are referred to as means, terrorist aim and 
consequences of terrorism. As regards the first component, the condition is that the means used 
by the perpetrator to carry out an individual or collective offence must be the use or the threat of 
force such as assault, abduction or other acts in which force is used to achieve a criminal result. 
These acts are listed in all international conventions on the suppression of terrorism. With 
respect to the terrorist aim, the means used by the culprit, as explained above, must be employed 
in order to violate the Constitution or the laws or regulations, to disrupt public order, to 
jeopardize the safety and security of the Kingdom, or to damage national unity and the security 
of the international community. Third, in order for an act to be defined as an act of terrorism, the 
impact and purpose of using the means must be to harm, frighten and intimidate people, to 
endanger their lives or security, etc., as stated in the definition. The Government concludes from </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
page 10 
 
the above that the definition of terrorism is not broad and is consistent with the relevant 
international conventions.  
 
With respect to Article 2 of the draft law, the Government advises that the offences listed in this 
article are punished under other laws listing all the material components and the criminal intent 
on which such offences are designated as criminal acts. Article 2 of the draft law raises the 
penalty prescribed for such offences, when committed for the purposes of terrorism as defined in 
Article 1 of the draft law. If an offence is not committed to achieve a terrorist aim it will be 
punished in accordance with the Criminal Code and other laws.  
 
In relation to Article 6 of the draft law, the Government points out that this article does not apply 
to the right to demonstrate or to any right guaranteed by the Bahraini Constitution. The acts 
covered by Article 6 refer to any illegal group established for the purpose of impeding the 
application of the Constitution and the law or for the other reasons cited in this paragraph. 
Moreover, for the elements of this offence to be present, terrorism must be one of the means used 
to achieve the group&#8217;s aims. If any of these elements is missing, the offence listed in this article 
does not pertain. 
 
As regards the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s concerns related to Articles 30 and 31 of the draft law as 
compared with articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
Government indicates its agreement and informs that it has worked with the Chamber of 
Deputies to reformulate this article to ensure that detainees and arrested persons are brought 
before the judicial authorities to review the legality of their detention and thus to avoid any 
conflict with the above-mentioned Covenant. The Government&#8217;s letter also includes a summary 
of the reasoning behind the provisions of the draft law.  
 
(c)<b> </b><i>Press release<b></b></i><b> 
</b> 
17. The Special Rapporteur made the following statement on 25 July 2006: 
 
&quot;I urge the executive and legislative branches of government in Bahrain to reconsider the <b>new 
counter-terrorism bill </b>approved by the Appointees Chamber in a Special Session of Parliament 
on 22 July 2006 and to allow for further debate and additional amendments due to concerns that 
the implementation of this law could have a negative impact on human rights in the country.&quot; 
 
The bill, titled 'Protecting Society from Terrorists Acts', is awaiting ratification by the Head of 
State before becoming law. The Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government in March and June 
2006, when this bill was before Parliament, and identified some issues of concern regarding the 
proposed legislation.  
 
&quot;One of the main concerns is the overly broad definition of terrorism which is seen to be at 
variance with the principle of legality enshrined in several human rights instruments, including 
Article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which represents a 
universal standard also in respect of countries that have not yet ratified the Covenant.&quot; 
 
Due to the broad definition of terrorism and other vague terms, a number of human rights such as 
freedom of association and assembly and freedom of speech risk being subject to excessive </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
 page 11 
 
limitations such that the legislation might allow for severe or disproportionate restrictions on 
peaceful demonstrations by civil society. Also, the offence of incitement to terrorism fails to 
establish a clear and foreseeable threshold for criminalization. Further, the principle of due 
process may be denied due to the excessive powers of the Public Prosecutor regarding detention 
without judicial review. 
 
&quot;While fully conscious of the fact that States' obligation to protect and promote human rights 
requires them to take effective measures to combat terrorism, I encourage the executive and 
legislative branches of Government to make amendments to this bill to bring it in line with 
international human rights law. As a member of the newly constituted UN Human Rights 
Council, it is an opportune time for Bahrain to reflect international human rights standards in its 
national legislation.&quot;

su preocupaci&#243;n por la aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista a presos mapuches por hechos 
relacionados con la lucha social por la tierra y los leg&#237;timos reclamos ind&#237;genas. Seg&#250;n la

Patricia Troncoso, Patricio Marileo Saravia, Jaime Marileo Saravia y Juan Carlos Huenulao 
Lienmil habr&#237;an sido condenados a penas de diez anos y un d&#237;a de prisi&#243;n despu&#233;s de haber sido 
acusados del delito de &#8220;incendio terrorista&#8221;, bajo la Ley Antiterrorista 18.314, por un incendio 
causado en el predio conocido como Poluco y Pidenco. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, 
el juicio habr&#237;a presentado irregularidades y las declaraciones de los testigos habr&#237;an presentado 
contradicciones. Actualmente, las personas mencionadas se encontrar&#237;an en la ciudad del Angol 
y desde el 13 de marzo de 2006 mantendr&#237;an una huelga de hambre en protesta por las fuertes 
condenas recibidas y por la aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista (que se utiliza con frecuencia en 
relaci&#243;n con las reclamaciones agrarias y las reclamaciones para pedir un nivel de vida adecuado 
de los mapuches), habi&#233;ndose deteriorado gravemente su estado de salud tras m&#225;s de 55 d&#237;as de

manera discriminatoria; mientras que por los delitos contra la propiedad se aplican generalmente 
multas o penas de prisi&#243;n muy cortas, en el caso de los mapuches los jueces calificar&#237;an estos 
mismos delitos como actos de terrorismo y aplicar&#237;an penas de prisi&#243;n muy severas, de por lo 
menos 10 a&#241;os. Se expresan graves temores de que el uso de la ley Antiterrorista en el caso </p>

la situaci&#243;n de extrema fragilidad de las personas anteriormente mencionadas, se expresan graves 
temores porque la situaci&#243;n pueda acarrear da&#241;os irreversibles para su salud f&#237;sica y ps&#237;quica, y

(b)<b> </b><i>Comunicaci&#243;n recibida del Gobierno</i> 
 
19. Mediante comunicaci&#243;n del 23 de mayo del 2006, el Gobierno de Chile proporcion&#243; informaci&#243;n 
con respecto al llamamiento enviado el 11 de mayo. El gobierno informa de que el se&#241;or Huenulao, 
los se&#241;ores Marileo y la se&#241;ora Troncoso fueron condenados por un delito de incendio, que ya 
estaba previamente tipificado como delito en la ley penal y antiterrorista, con su pena 
correspondiente. El incendio de los fundos Poluco y Podenco, zona cuya propiedad pertenece a 
la empresa forestal MININCO, ocasion&#243; un da&#241;o cercano a los US $ 600.000. En cuanto a los 
antecedentes judiciales, los inculpados, de acuerdo con el art&#237;culo 19.3 de la Constituci&#243;n 
Pol&#237;tica de Chile, contaron con defensa jur&#237;dica desde el inicio de la causa, defensa que fue 
proporcionada por la Defensor&#237;a Penal P&#250;blica. A su vez, tambi&#233;n hicieron uso de recursos que 
proporciona la ley para impugnar las resoluciones judiciales. En consecuencia, no existe duda 
alguna de que se cumplieron los principios del debido proceso. Por lo que se refiere a la 
invocaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista, la Presidenta de la Rep&#250;blica, Sra. Michelle Bachelet, se ha 
comprometido a que el ejecutivo no invocar&#225; la aplicaci&#243;n de la Ley Antiterrorista, al hacer la 
denuncia o querella que corresponda, cuando en hechos futuros tipificados como delitos por la 
Ley Antiterrorista y que puedan ser juzgados por la ley Com&#250;n se vean involucrados ind&#237;genas. 
De todas maneras, cabe resaltar que en el caso concreto del delito de incendio, la pena que 
establece el C&#243;digo Penal es tan grave como la que establece la Ley Antiterrorista. Cabe destacar 
que los Senadores Alejandro Navarrro y Jaime Naranjo presentaron un proyecto de ley, sobre la 
libertad condicional, con el objeto de modificar el Decreto Ley N&#186; 321. Dicho proyecto establece 
la posibilidad de otorgar la libertad condicional a los condenados a penas privativas de libertad 
por delitos contemplados en la Ley 18.314 (Ley Antiterrorista), y a los condenados por delitos 
sancionados en otros cuerpos legales, en causas relacionadas con reivindicaciones violentas de 
derechos consagrados en la Ley 19.253 (Ley Ind&#237;gena), siempre que los hechos punibles hayan 
ocurrido entre el 1 de Enero de 1997 y el 1 de Enero de 2006, y los mismos condenados 
suscriban en forma previa una declaraci&#243;n inequ&#237;voca y favorable al no uso de la violencia en la 
reivindicaci&#243;n de derechos establecidos en la Ley 19.253 y en el derecho internacional de los 
pueblos ind&#237;genas. El 15 de mayo de 2006, el Ministro del Interior comunic&#243; que el Gobierno 
hab&#237;a puesto &#8220;suma urgencia&#8221; a la tramitaci&#243;n del Proyecto de Ley para modificar el Decreto 
Ley 321. Con motivo de la presentaci&#243;n del citado proyecto, el 14 de mayo de 2006 los cuatro 
afectados mencionados anteriormente depusieron temporalmente la huelga de hambre, a la 
espera de los resultados de la tramitaci&#243;n del proyecto de ley. El Gobierno desea especificar que 
esta situaci&#243;n no responde a una persecuci&#243;n pol&#237;tica hacia el movimiento ind&#237;gena o mapuche. 
A su vez, el Gobierno se&#241;ala algunos antecedentes que a continuaci&#243;n se citan. La aplicaci&#243;n de 
la Ley Antiterrorista fue invocada frente a situaciones de extrema gravedad. En la actualidad 
existen 9 personas de ascendencia ind&#237;gena condenadas por esta Ley. Asimismo, el Estado de 
Chile ha reconocido como leg&#237;tima la demanda de los pueblos ind&#237;genas, en especial la del 
mapuche. Desde 1993, la Ley Ind&#237;gena N&#186; 19.253 ha permitido traspasar unas 400.000 hect&#225;reas 
de tierra a m&#225;s de 500 comunidades a lo largo de todo el pa&#237;s.

(a)<b> </b><i>Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</i> 
20. On 13 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture, sent a letter to the Government of China drawing attention to the case of <b>Ismail Semed</b>, 
an ethnic Uighur from Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in northwest China, who 
was believed to be at imminent risk of execution. According to the allegations received, Ismail 
Semed was convicted by the Urumqi Intermediate People&#8217;s Court on 31 October 2005 for 
&#8220;attempting to split the motherland&#8221; and other charges related to possession of firearms and 
explosives. The possession of firearms charges against Ismail Semed appeared to have been 
based on old testimonies taken from other Uighurs, some of whom were reportedly executed in 
1999. According to reports, those testimonies might have been extracted through torture. The 
charge of &#8220;splittism&#8221; was based on second-hand testimony which stated that Ismail Semed was a 
member of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an organisation qualified as 
&#8220;terrorist&#8221; by the Chinese authorities, and attended one ETIM meeting in 1997 in Rawalpindi, 
Pakistan. However, his alleged membership of ETIM and attendance at that meeting have 
reportedly been disputed by people who were present at the meeting. Concern was expressed that 
he reportedly confessed to the terrorism-related charges under torture and subsequently denied 
them during his trial. Information has also been received indicating that his appeal might have 
already been heard in a closed session. The Special Rapporteur requested the Government in 
particular to indicate on the basis of what criteria organizations are qualified as terrorist 
organizations and whether they can appeal against such qualification.   
<b> 
</b>(b)<b> </b><i>Communication from the Government<b></b></i><b> 
</b> 
21. By letter of 12 July 2006, the Government replied to the joint communication sent on 13 
April 2006. The Government informs that, on 13 August 2004, the Urumchi city procuratorial 
authorities instituted criminal proceedings against Ismail Semed with the Urumchi city 
intermediate level people&#8217;s court for the offences of separatism, unlawful manufacture of 
ammunition and the causing of explosions. The Government indicates that the precise charges as 
set out in the bill of indictment are as follows. In January 1997, Ismail Semed, together with 
Hasan Mahsum (later shot dead in Pakistan) and Abdukadir Amat (now on the run), slipped out 
of the country through the city of Xiamen and made their way to Saudi Arabia to meet Kurban 
Aji and other persons, to propagate the notion of an independent Xinjiang, to carry out separatist 
activities and to drum up support. Soon after, Semed and the two other men travelled to 
Rawalpindi in Pakistan, to meet Uighur students and other young Uighurs engaged in business in 
that city, preaching to them and urging them to form an organization and to go to Afghanistan to 
receive training, for the purpose of waging a holy war. In March of that same year, Semed and 
the other men convened a preparatory meeting of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement and, 
following a division of tasks, Ismail Semed was appointed in charge of military operations. 
Thereafter, Ismail Semed and the other men continued to develop and expand the organization, 
establishing military bases, recruiting members, conducting fund-raising and other activities and 
forging links with Afghan Taliban bases and bases run by Bin Laden, striking an agreement with 
them on the provision of free training for their jihadists. From May 1997 to January 1998 Semed 
and his accomplices organized the transport of some 100 Uighur jihadists from Pakistan and the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1

Middle East to the above-mentioned military camps for training. After completing their training, 
Semed and the others appointed Usman Imat in charge and sent him to take 13 men to Xinjiang 
to set up workshops to manufacture explosives, to conduct training and to develop jihadist 
columns. After arriving in Xinjiang, Usman and the others purchased 1,053 boxes of erbium 
nitrate, for use in preparing chemicals and other reagents for the manufacture of explosives, and 
set up explosive manufacturing workshops in Turfan, Hotan and other cities. They trained some 
100 men in the use of chemicals and reagents for the manufacture of explosive devices, 
detonators and blasting fuses and in weapons technology. On 5 December 1997 Semed attended 
a conference of the formally constituted East Turkestan Islamic Movement, held in Rawalpindi 
in Pakistan, and was appointed military commander. The conference resolved that the goal of the 
organization would be to liberate East Turkestan through a holy war and to set in place an 
Islamic State, and mapped out a strategic plan for the period ahead. In mid-December 1998, 
Semed and others organized a meeting in Rawalpindi at which they decided to break away from 
the East Turkestan Islamic Movement and form a separate grouping. They deposed their former 
leader, Hasan Mahsum, assumed control of their members and funds in Afghanistan and started 
to look for ways of illegally entering Xinjiang, so as to prepare for the conduct of military 
jihadist activities in that region. On 16 September 2004 the Urumchi intermediate level people&#8217;s 
court commenced hearings on this matter. The Government informs that, given the complexity of 
this case, the proceedings are still under consideration.

24. On 18 December 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent a communication to the Government of Germany concerning the 
organization of <b>secret transfers of terrorist suspects</b> by the United States European Command 
(EUCOM) headquarters, Stuttgart-Vaihingen (see paragraph 69). It was alleged that EUCOM 
played a central role in the secret transfer of six suspected terrorists to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
EUCOM reportedly organized from Germany the abduction of six prisoners of Algerian origin, 
namely Bensayah BELKACEM, Hadj BOUDELLAA, Saber LAHMAR, Mustafa Ait IDIR, 
Boumediene LAKHDAR and Mohamed NECHLE, from Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina to 
Incirlik, Turkey in January 2002. From there they were flown to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where 
they continue to be detained without charges. Two German military officers, working at 
EUCOM, were assigned as liaison officers and tasked with obtaining and communicating 
information between the German and US authorities. Furthermore, information regarding this 
case was displayed on sources accessible to the public such as the website of EUCOM. The 
Special Rapporteur urged the German authorities to take all necessary measures to guarantee the 
accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations. Furthermore, it was requested that 
the German Government adopt effective measures to prevent the use of German territory or 
involvement of German authorities in practices of extraordinary rendition in breach of human 
rights treaties ratified by Germany.

</b> 
26. On 3 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions, drew the attention of the Government of Indonesia to 
information received regarding <b>Mr. Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Mr. Ali Ghufron alias 
Mukhlas, </b>and<b> Mr. Imam Samudera</b>, who were believed to be at imminent risk of execution. It 
was alleged that Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Imam Samudera had 
been found guilty of involvement in the 12 October 2002 bombings on the island of Bali, which 
killed 202 people and injured a further 209. They were sentenced to death by the Denpasar 
District Court between August and October 2003. The men and their families have declined to 
seek a pardon from the President. On 14 April 2006, the Attorney General&#8217;s office stated that the 
refusal to seek clemency would mean that they have exhausted all the legal remedies available to 
them and that, as a result, they would be executed immediately. On 25 April 2006, the Bali 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office announced that it had &quot;completed preparations&quot; for the execution and stated 
that it was waiting for the Attorney General&#8217;s order to proceed with the executions. The Special 
Rapporteurs referred to two &#8220;'Government Regulations in lieu of law&#8221; (Peraturan Pemerintah 
Pengganti Undang-Undang, or &#8220;Perpus&#8221;), Perpus 1/2002 and 2/2002, which were issued by 
President Megawati on 18 October 2002, six days after the Bali bombing. Perpu 1/2002 provides 
that an act of terrorism, or the planning of or assisting in an act of terrorism, is punishable by 
death. Section 46 allows for its retroactive application if this is authorised by another Perpu or 
law. Perpu 2/2002 authorised that retroactive application &#8220;in relation to the [Bali] bombing 
incident&#8221;. Perpus 1/2002 and 2/2002 were subsequently approved by Parliament in March 2003 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1

and converted into the Law on Combating Criminal Acts of Terrorism 15/2003. Furthermore, 
information was received that on 23 July 2004, the Constitutional Court had ruled that the 
retroactive application of Perpu 1/2002 (i.e. Law 15/2003) violated Article 28I (1) of the 
Constitution and was therefore unconstitutional. The Special Rapporteur requested the 
Government to explain on which grounds it intends to proceed with the execution of the three 
individuals notwithstanding Article 28I(1) of the Constitution of Indonesia, the ruling of the 
Constitutional Court and the Indonesia&#8217;s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights.

(a)<b> </b><i>Communications sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur<b></b></i><b> 
</b> 
28. On 3 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Government of Israel with 
regard to the <b>draft &#8220;Criminal Procedure</b> <b>(Enforcement Powers &#8211; Special Provisions for 
Investigating Security Offences of Non-Residents) (Temporary Provision)</b> <b>Law, 5765 &#8211; 
2005&#8221;</b>. The draft law, according to the information received, was to be examined at a special 
session of the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, which was scheduled for 16 March 
2006, with a view to obtaining its adoption by the Parliament at a special plenary session before 
the elections to be held on 28 March 2006. The Special Rapporteur drew the Government&#8217;s 
attention to two substantive areas of concern. First, the proposed law would be applicable solely 
to non-residents of the State of Israel, who are defined by the draft law as either persons who are 
not registered in the population registry, or persons who are not legally present in Israel for a 
period exceeding three consecutive years. The Special Rapporteur, having studied the 
explanatory notes accompanying the governmental bill, failed to see that objective and 
reasonable justification would have been presented for the proposed distinction between 
residents and non-residents. He reminded the Government that the prohibition of discrimination 
is a cornerstone of international human rights law. It is set out, in particular, in Articles 2, 14.1 
and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and in Articles 1 and 
2 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
(CERD), to which the State of Israel is a party. Second, the Special Rapporteur expressed 
concern that the draft law proposes to extend the initial period of detention by security forces 
from a maximum of 48 hours to 96 hours before the individual detained is brought before a 
judge. This can be followed by an additional period of detention bringing the detention to 20 
days, renewable once, for a total of 40 days. The envisaged law would also extend the period 
during which a detainee under interrogation may be denied access to a lawyer from 21 days to 50 
days. Furthermore, the new law would deny detainees the right to be present at court hearings 
held to consider an extension of their detention, except for the first hearing (up to 96 hours after 
the beginning of the detention), the hearing upon the expiry of the first 20 days of detention, and 
any extension thereof. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the explanatory note accompanying the 
governmental bill fails to advance adequate justification to the proposed extension of various 
time limits and the right to appear before a judge. He referred to article 9 and other provisions </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
 page 17 
 
and to the Concluding Observations on Israel of 21 August 2003 by the Human Rights 
Committee, concluding that the use of prolonged detention without any access to a lawyer or 
other persons of the outside world violated several articles of the Covenant. The Special 
Rapporteur asked the Government of Israel to bring to the attention of relevant governmental and 
parliamentary bodies that this draft legislation needs to be significantly amended before it is 
tabled before the Parliament for adoption.  
 
29. On 21 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of freedom of opinion and expression, sent a letter to the Government 
of Israel with regard to information received concerning <b>Mr. Aziz Dweik</b>, Speaker of the 
Palestinian Legislative Council. Mr. Dweik, an academic aged 57 and member of Hamas, was 
elected Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council after the most recent elections. On 5 
August 2006, Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) surrounded Mr. Dweik's house in Ramallah and took 
him into custody. From there he was taken to Ofer prison. On or around 10 August 2006, a court 
in Ofer decided to extend Mr. Dweik's detention, for further eight days. In these proceedings he 
had the assistance of a lawyer. He was then transferred to the Kfar Youna detention centre. The 
IDF has confirmed the detention of Mr. Dweik, stating that it was justified by Hamas being listed 
as a terrorist organization. Mr. Dweik remains in IDF detention. Israeli forces had already, on 29 
June 2006, arrested eight members of the Palestinian Authority's government and 20 or more 
members of the Palestinian Legislative Council. Reminding the Government of article 25 of the 
ICCPR and its pivotal role in a democratic society, the Special Rapporteurs urged the 
Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the 
aforementioned person are respected. Furthermore, the Government was requested to indicate the 
legal basis for qualifying an individual or an entity as &#8220;terrorist&#8221; under Israeli law.

</b> 
31. The Special Rapporteur issued a statement on 5 July 2006, following the adoption of Law 
5765 &#8211; 2006 &quot;Criminal Procedure (Enforcement Powers &#8211; Detention) (Detainees Suspected of 
Security Offences) (Temporary Provision)&quot; on 27 June 2006 by the Israeli Knesset,  
 
&quot;I am pleased to note that many of the criticisms voiced by different stakeholders including civil 
society have been addressed in the draft that was finally adopted. In March 2006, I raised some 
issues in a communication to the State of Israel in relation to the previous draft law. In particular, 
the provisions relating to the discriminatory scope of application solely to non-residents of the 
State of Israel, and those relating to the period of practical incommunicado detention &#8211; originally 
proposed as 40 days &#8211; and access to a lawyer have been amended. I view this as a positive 
example of responsiveness to international concern.  
 
&quot;However, some of the concerns remain: the law still does not provide all the necessary 
procedural safeguards for individuals detained for security reasons. In particular, the law 
provides that an individual may be held in detention for up to 96 hours before being brought 
before a judge and may not be present in court when a decision on the extension of the detention </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
page 18 
 
is made during the period when he is barred from contact with a legal counsel. In addition, while 
the provisions on access to legal counsel have not been worsened by this new law, the 21 days of 
detention without access to legal counsel authorised by the detention law currently in force 
remain incompatible with international human rights law.  
 
&quot;Fully conscious of the fact that States' obligation to protect and promote human rights requires 
them to take effective measures to combat terrorism, I wish to recall that States have the duty to 
ensure that any such measure comply with their obligations under international law, in particular 
international human rights law. The right to the liberty of the person as enshrined in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires access to legal counsel immediately 
after arrest. I call upon the Israeli Government to ensure that this provision is fully respected in 
law and practice.&quot; 
 
32. The Special Rapporteur issued the following statement on 7 December 2006 from Jerusalem: 
 
&quot;I welcome the Israeli Government's positive response to my request to conduct a country visit to 
Israel. This was indicated to me during my meeting today with senior officials from the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. I want to thank the Government for its willingness to meet and discuss issues 
pertaining to my mandate. It is my hope to visit Israel in the first half of 2007. 
 
&quot;The State of Israel has legitimate national security concerns and is often confronted with violent 
attacks, including against civilians. Hence, I fully understand that it must be able to respond to 
terrorist acts. However, the Government's response, including the enactment and implementation 
of legislation, and actual practices, must be in conformity with international law, in particular 
humanitarian and human rights law. If Israel resorts to the use of force, it must respect the 
distinction between military and civilian objectives, the principle of proportionality and the duty 
to prevent and minimize civilian loss of life, injury and damage to infrastructure.  
 
&quot;On 29 September 2006 the Special Rapporteur formally requested a visit to Israel to examine in 
situ questions relating to the mandate, and to formulate pertinent conclusions and 
recommendations with the objective of helping to ensure respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism. 
 
&quot;The Special Rapporteur seeks to examine the impact of counter-terrorism operations on civil 
and political rights, such as right to life, liberty and security of the person, the prohibition against 
torture and other inhuman treatment, and the freedom of movement (Articles 6, 7, 9 and 12 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)). Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned about counter-terrorism measures that negatively impact on other rights, 
such as the right to housing, health and education (Articles 11, 12 and 13 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), as many families have had their houses 
destroyed by Israeli authorities, causing displacement and lack of access to other services. Israel 
is a party to both Covenants, and there is no justification to deviate from these international 
obligations. In particular, many of the specific rights under the ICCPR are non-derogable even 
during times of public emergency.  
 
&quot;On 4 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur issued a press release following the adoption of law 
5765 on 27 June by the Israeli Knesset which addressed enforcement powers and detention of </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
 page 19 
 
detainees suspected of security offences. The Special Rapporteur noted some positive changes in 
the final text but stated that the law does not appear to provide all necessary procedural 
safeguards for those detained for security reasons. For example, individuals can be detained up 
to 96 hours before being brought before a judge, they are not necessarily present in court when 
detention may be extended, and there are restrictions on access to counsel during detention. 
These aspects of the law are, in my view, incompatible with international human rights law.  
 
&quot;I am mindful that States have a duty to protect their population and to take effective measures to 
combat terrorism. However, sustainable results can only be achieved by promoting and 
protecting human rights while countering terrorism. Otherwise there is no real security for the 
civilian population&quot;.  
 
The Special Rapporteur was in Israel to attend the Minerva Biennial Conference on Human 
Rights where he gave the keynote address on Terrorism and Human Rights. 
 
</p>
<p><i>Jordan 
</i> 
(a)<b> </b><i>Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</i> 
33. On 10 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government of Jordan with regard to 
the <b>legislation applicable to crimes of terrorism</b>, in particular that resulting from the Jordanian 
Penal Code No. 16 of 1960, as amended pursuant to the Provisional Act No. 54 which entered 
into force on 8 October 2001, and the <b>Draft Terror Prevention Law</b>. The Special Rapporteur 
drew the Government&#8217;s attention to several substantive areas of concern. First, the Special 
Rapporteur pointed to the overly broad and vague definition of terrorism as contained in Article 
147 paragraph 1 of the Jordanian Penal Code. In particular, its sweeping nature is revealed by the 
fact that an act may be qualified as terrorist regardless of the motives or purposes for carrying 
out the act as well as the references to damage, even partial, carried out against public or private 
property and facilities and the obstruction of the application of the constitution and laws. The 
Jordanian definition suffers from the absence of two of these cumulative conditions for 
classifying a crime as a terrorist crime: there is no requirement of a specific aim to further an 
underlying political or ideological cause and some acts are qualified as terrorist without the 
intention of causing death or serious bodily injury. Second, Article 5 of the draft terror 
prevention law provides that security services have the right to arrest and hold any suspect for a 
period of two weeks, which can be extended by the public prosecutor for a similar period, for 
justifiable reasons. Lastly, under Article 4 of the draft terror prevention law, the public 
prosecutor may take several freedom-limiting measures against individuals who are suspected of 
being involved in terrorist activities. In particular, the Public Prosecutor of the State Security 
Court may order surveillance of the home, the movements and communications of the suspected 
individual; ban from travel; and search the residence and impound any item relevant to terrorist 
activities and appropriate any money. These orders are valid for 3 months and may be renewed 
for another 3 months by the State Security Court. While the individual against whom these 
decisions are taken has the right to obtain the review of the measure, this can only be done before 
the Attorney General of the State Security Court, whose decisions are final. Due to the wide 
ranging consequences of the measures that may be taken vis-&#224;-vis suspected terrorists in respect 
of several human right, these measures should in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view be subject to 
review by a court of law. The Special Rapporteur also urged the Government of Jordan to review </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
page 20 
 
the definition of terrorism contained in the draft law, significantly amend the draft terror 
prevention law before it is adopted by Parliament and qualify what constitutes &#8220;justifiable 
reasons&#8221; for keeping an individual in detention.  
 
(b)<b> </b><i>Communications from the Government 
</i> 
34. By letter of 18 January 2006, the Government of Jordan replied to the communication sent 
on 17 November 2005 (see paras. 5-8, E/CN.4/2006/98/Add.1). The Government informed that 
the allegations submitted concerning Mr. Salah Nasser Salim &#8216;Ali and Mr. Muhammad Faraj 
Ahmed Bashmilah were false, as there was no record showing that the two had been arrested for 
violations of penal, disciplinary or administrative codes. Furthermore, the Government indicated 
that there had been no files on the two Yemeni citizens indicating that they pose a security 
concern, eliminating the possibility of their arrest for what may be described as &#8220;terrorism&#8221;. 
 
35. By letter of 22 September 2006, the Government of Jordan replied to the communication sent 
on 10 July 2006. In its reply, the Government states that the definition contained in Article 147 
paragraph 1 of the Jordanian Penal Code is consistent with the Arab Convention for the 
Suppression of Terrorism, which defines terrorism as any act or threat of violence, whatever its 
motive or purpose, which is carried out for the purpose of advancing an individual or collective 
criminal agenda, alarming and frightening people by doing them harm and endangering their 
lives, liberty or security, damaging the environment, damaging, occupying or seizing public or 
private installations, or endangering national resources. The definition contained in Article 147, 
paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code refers to the aims of the act as the basis for defining it as a 
terrorist offence. As stated in that article, the aim must be &#8220;to disrupt public order or endanger 
the safety and security of society&#8221;. These aims are linked to a specific outcome, namely alarming 
and frightening people, endangering their lives and security, damaging the environment, 
damaging, occupying or seizing public or private installations or property, State installations or 
diplomatic missions, endangering national resources or impeding the application of the 
Constitution and the law. The presence of intent (criminal intent), the Government informs, is a 
key component of terrorist offences. These offences are subject to the general provisions of the 
Criminal Code. According to article 63 of the Criminal Code, intent is the desire to commit an 
offence as defined by law. It follows that criminal intent to commit a terrorist offence necessarily 
entails the desire to commit a criminal act and to achieve a criminal result. 
 
With respect to Article 5 of the Draft Terror Prevention Law, the Government informs that it was 
designed to take account of the gravity of such offences. The purpose of the article is to give the 
security services enough time to gather evidence and conduct investigations into these kinds of 
offences. The article places a number of restrictions on this measure ensuring its correct 
implementation when and only when specific conditions are met. Thus, recourse to the period of 
time mentioned in the article can only be had in accordance with the prevention of terrorism law. 
The defendant must have committed a legally designated offence under that law. The time period 
cannot be extended unless by order of the public prosecutor and it can only be extended once, for 
the same period of time. Extension orders must be justified (i.e. they must be based on grounds 
that justify the extension). Two weeks is the maximum period of detention. If this period of time 
is not required for the purposes of the investigation and collection of evidence, the individual 
will be brought before the court as soon as these procedures are completed. 
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
 page 21 
 
Referring to Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
Government informs that according to article 159 of the Code of Criminal Proceedings, any 
confession made by a defendant, a suspect or an accused person without a public prosecutor 
being present shall be ruled inadmissible, unless the prosecution presents clear evidence of the 
circumstances in which the confession was made and the court is convinced that the confession 
was given voluntarily and of the person&#8217;s own free will. If the court concludes that the 
defendant&#8217;s confession was obtained as the result of any form of physical or mental coercion, it 
shall rule the confession to be null and void. Furthermore, Article 208 of the Criminal Code 
punishes anyone who uses violence or force to extract a confession. Accordingly, anyone who 
breaches this article must be brought before the competent court.  
 
With respect to incommunicado detention, the Government reports that according to Article 66 
of the Code of Criminal Proceedings, the public prosecutor is entitled to prevent a defendant in 
detention from communicating with the outside world for a period of up to 20 days, which may 
be extended. This does not apply to the defendant&#8217;s counsel, who can see his client at any time 
and without a guard being present. Anyone deprived of his or her liberty by means of detention 
is entitled to apply to the competent judicial authorities for release and to appeal to the 
competent court against any rejection of his application.  
 
As regards Article 4 of the Draft Terror Prevention Law, the Government letter informs that the 
Cabinet recently introduced a number of amendments to this draft law, of which the most 
important concern the defendant&#8217;s right to appeal to the court (the State Security Court) against a 
decision handed down by the public prosecutor, and an increase in the number of safeguards 
provided. The Court must hear the appeal within one week of being seized of the matter. If the 
appeal is rejected, it can be sent before the Court of Cassation (the highest court in the land), 
which must issue a ruling within one week of being seized of the matter.  
 
The Government further informs that there are three types of courts in Jordan, namely civil 
courts, religious courts and special courts. The types, levels, divisions and administration of the 
courts are determined by a special law. Special courts conduct proceedings in accordance with 
the relevant laws and the Constitution. The State Security Court was established by the State 
Security Act No. 17 of 1959 (as amended). It is an independent and impartial public court 
established by law. It applies the procedures and rules laid down in the Act and the Code of 
Criminal Proceedings, which are further explained in the Government&#8217;s letter.

as the implementation of this law as it currently stands could negatively impact on a number of 
human rights. 
 
&quot;I regret that Parliament passed this law, on 29 August, during a period of intense deliberation by 
a number of independent Members of Parliament, opposition party leaders and human rights 
activists who claim it infringes on certain public freedoms and peaceful political activities.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1

&quot;The Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government in July 2006 when the draft law was before 
Parliament and identified a number of areas of concern.  
 
&quot;One of the primary concerns is the overly broad definition of terrorism since it is vague 
regarding the elements of intent and aim and can be seen to be at variance with the principle of 
legality. There are also a number of procedural safeguards that appear to have been compromised 
which can negatively impact on the right to a fair trial and due process. For example, the law 
currently allows suspects to be detained for up to 30 days without access to a lawyer and without 
judicial review. Further, the law gives considerable powers to law enforcement, security forces 
and the Public Prosecutor with regard to detention, search and arrest that effectively negate the 
right to privacy, freedom and movement and the presumption of innocence. Finally, the law 
designates military courts as having sole jurisdiction of terrorism cases which may lack judicial 
independence and deny a number of procedural guarantees.  
 
&quot;This law awaits ratification; and while I am fully conscious of the fact that States' obligation to 
protect and promote human rights requires them to take effective measures to combat terrorism, I 
wish to recall that States have a duty to ensure that any such measures comply with their 
obligations under international law, in particular Articles 7, 9, 10, 14 and 15 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Jordan is a party&quot;.

(a)<b> </b><i>Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
<b></b></i><b> 
</b>37. On 21 June 2006 the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Government of Kenya with 
regard to the <b>draft Anti-terrorism Bill 2006</b>, which was under consideration by the Parliament. 
The Special Rapporteur brought several substantive areas of concern to the attention of the 
Government. First, the Special Rapporteur pointed to the overly broad definition of terrorism as 
contained Article 3 of the draft bill. Furthermore, he highlighted the vague reference to &#8220;any 
specified person&#8221; in Article 21 (1b) and (2c). Second, the Special Rapporteur underlined that 
Articles 6 and 7 of the draft bill are vaguely phrased and do not require any proof of intent on the 
person of the alleged perpetrator to support/commit a terrorist offence. Given the very broad and 
vague definition of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; and the lack of any intent requirement, articles 8 and 9 on 
incitement and aiding and abetting also carry the danger of being misused. Third, Part III of the 
draft bill confers large powers on the Minister to declare that an organization is &#8220;terrorist&#8221;, if he 
&#8220;believes that it is engaged in terrorism&#8221; (art. 11 (4)), based on an assessment of vaguely 
formulated criteria, such as &#8220;promotes and encourages terrorism or is otherwise involved in 
terrorism&#8221; (art. 11 (5 c and d)). Consequently, the Special Rapporteur underlined the need for 
revising the definition of terrorism contained in the draft bill by introducing clear and precisely 
formulated provisions, limiting its scope to acts that are genuinely terrorist in nature, and the 
need for clear and precise provisions with regard to the proscription of allegedly terrorist 
organizations and appropriate judicial oversight. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur requested 
the Government to provide more detailed information on the creation of a victim&#8217;s fund and its 
operation.

</b> 
39. On 1 September 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
and belief, drew the Government of Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s attention to the case of Mr. Mohammadrafiq 
Kamoluddin, imam of a mosque in the city of Kara-Suu, Mr. Ayubkhodja Shahobidinov and Mr. 
Fathullo Rahimo (see paragraph 73). According to the information received, on 6 August 2006, 
the above-mentioned individuals were killed in the city of Osh as the result of an alleged counter 
terrorism operation, led by the National Security Service of Kyrgyzstan, in cooperation with the 
security forces of Uzbekistan. It has been reported that these individuals were suspected 
members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and were planning to carry out a terrorist 
attack on the territory of the State of Uzbekistan. Other reports highlight that it was not alleged 
that Mr. Mohammadrafiq Kamoluddin was a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan or 
that he was involved in the commission of terrorist acts. The Special Rapporteur requested the 
Government on what basis it was decided to kill, rather than capture, these three individuals and 
to indicate legal basis for qualifying an individual or an entity as &#8220;terrorist&#8221; under the law of 
Kyrgyzstan.

<p><i>Malaysia 
<b></b></i><b> 
</b>(a)<b> </b><i>Communication from the Government<b></b></i><b> 
 
</b>41. By letter of 15 January 2007, the Government replied to the letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on 3 October 2005 (see paras. 9-10, E/CN.4/2006/98/Add.1). The Government 
informs that the Internal Security Act 1960 (ISA) came into force on 1 august 1960 in West 
Malaysia and on 16 September 1963 in East Malaysia. The Government further indicates that the 
aim of the ISA is to counter the subversive elements and threats prejudicial to national security. 
The provisions vesting powers of preventive detention in the Police and the Minister of Internal 
Security are sections 8 and 73 of the ISA. These sections empower the preventive detention of 
persons suspected of acting in any manner prejudicial to national security, the maintenance of 
essential services, and economic life of Malaysia. The Government explains that section 73 of 
the ISA allows arrest without warrant and detention by the Police not exceeding 60 days unless 
with a written order by the Minister pursuant to section 8. Section 8 of the ISA provides for the 
Minister&#8217;s power to issue an order for detention of any person without trial for up to two years, 
on the ground that the Minister is satisfied that the detention is necessary to prevent the person 
from acting in any manner prejudicial to national security. Such detention order may be renewed 
for a further period of not more than two years at a time. The Government further indicates that 
that a person detained under the ISA is not left without a legal recourse. A person detained can </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1

petition to the High court for a writ of habeas corpus to be issued. On various occasions, the 
High Court had granted habeas corpus to detainees wrongfully detained. The Government then 
highlights that the right to judicial review cannot be granted for any act done or decision made 
by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) or the Minister in the exercise of their discretionary power 
except if it is proved that there was a breach of any procedural requirement regarding such act or 
decision (section 8B of the ISA). Section 8B of the ISA has been judicially considered and has 
been held to be in conformity with the Federal Constitution in the Federal Court cases of 
Kerajaan Malaysia &amp; Ors v. Nasaharuddin Nasir (2004) CLJ 81 and Lee Kew Sang v. Timbalan 
Menteri Dalam Negeri, Malaysia &amp; Ors (2005) CLJ 914. Section 11 of the ISA provides that any 
person against whom an order by the Minister under section 8 has been made shall be entitled to 
make representations against that order to an Advisory Board. The Board shall, within three 
months of the date on which the representations are received, or within such longer period as the 
Yang di-Pertuan Agong may allow, consider the representations and make recommendations 
thereon to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, who shall in turn give such directions He thinks fit 
regarding the order made by the Minister. Furthermore, section 13 of the ISA provides that any 
order made by the Minister under section 8 of the ISA shall, so long as it remains in force, be 
reviewed not less than once every six months by an Advisory Board. The Advisory Board is 
established pursuant to Article 15 of the Federal Constitution which provides that it shall consist 
of a Chairman, who shall be appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and who shall be or have 
been, or be qualified to be, a judge of the Federal Court, the Court of Appeal or a High Court, 
and two other members who shall be appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The Government 
concludes that the ISA is still needed in order to maintain peace and stability in the country. 
Finally, the Government informs that it has recently received a report form the Royal 
Commission to enhance the Operation and Management of the Royal Malaysian Police. Among 
others, the Royal Commission recommended for a reduction of the period of detention from 60 
to 30 days under section 8 of the ISA. Other recommendations include detainees having 
visitations rights for counsel and family members. The Government indicates that it is presently 
studying these proposals.

<p><i>Maldives 
<b></b></i><b> 
</b>(a)<b> </b><i>Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</i> 
42. On 26 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government of the Maldives with 
regard to the <b>Law on Prevention of Terrorism</b> adopted in 1990 and its application to the case 
of Mr. Mohamed Nasheed. According to the information received, Mr. Mohamed Nasheed was 
arrested by the police on 12 August 2005 when he and four other individuals were reportedly 
sitting peacefully to mark the first anniversary of &#8220;Black Friday&#8221;. He had allegedly been charged 
inter alia with the offense of terrorism and his trial was scheduled to be resumed on 28 May 
2006. The Special Rapporteur was concerned that the definition contained in Article 2 (g) of the 
Law on Prevention of Terrorism was overly broad and vague and covered an array of actions 
which would include peaceful demonstrations by civil society, students or labour groups, as well 
as other acts such as written threats to damage any property. In addition, the requirement of 
intent appeared to be absent from this definition. The Special Rapporteur requested the 
Government to refrain from prosecuting Mr. Mohamed Nasheed as well as any other individual 
on the basis of this law before it is significantly amended and brought in line with international </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.1

human rights standards. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur asked the Government to review 
the definition of &#8220;acts of terrorism&#8221; contained in the above-mentioned law.  
<b> 
</b>(b)<b> </b><i>Communication from the Government<b></b></i><b> 
</b> 
43. By letter of 17 July 2006, the Government extended an invitation for a country visit to the 
Special Rapporteur. Furthermore, the Government made reference to the meeting held between 
the Foreign Minister of the Maldives and the Special Rapporteur on 20 June 2006, during which 
the case of Mr. Nasheed was also discussed. In its letter, the Government also informed that a 
new Penal Code was being considered. The new Code will redefine the crime of terrorism.<b>

<p><i>Mauritius 
<b></b></i><b> 
</b>(a)<b> </b><i>Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</i> 
44. On 20 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Government of Mauritius with 
regard to the <b>legislation applicable to crimes of terrorism</b>, in particular the <b>Prevention of 
Terrorism Act</b>, adopted in 2002. The Special Rapporteur drew the Government&#8217;s attention to 
three substantive areas of concern relating to this legislation. First, Special Rapporteur pointed to 
the broad definition of terrorist acts as contained in the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Second, the 
Prevention of Terrorism Act and a correlative Constitution Amendment Bill (No. 3 of 2002) 
extended the initial period of detention for individuals arrested under suspicion of having 
committed a terrorist act up to 36 hours before the individual is brought before a judge. During 
this time, the detainee would not have access to counsel, to relatives or to a doctor of his choice 
but only, upon his request, to a government medical officer. In addition, the right to bail has been 
limited for those individuals who are arrested or detained for an offence related to terrorism. 
Third, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Minister in charge of national security may 
declare any person to be a &#8220;suspected international terrorist&#8221; based, inter alia, on his 
&#8220;reasonable&#8221; suspicion that the person &#8220;(i) is or has been concerned in the commission, 
preparation or instigation of acts of international terrorism; (ii) is a member of, or belongs to, an 
international terrorist group; (iii) has links with an international terrorist group and he reasonably 
believes that the person is a risk to national security&#8221;. This qualification has wide-ranging 
consequences given the nature of the charge, and may have immediate implications, including 
financial, such as the freezing of funds; civil, such as stripping Mauritanian citizenship in the 
case of dual citizenship; or administrative, such as prohibiting entry into the territory of 
Mauritius or prohibiting immigration for foreigners. The Special Rapporteur asked the 
Government to indicate the procedural and judicial guarantees granted to individuals who have 
been declared &#8220;suspected international terrorists&#8221; to challenge such a qualification and the 
criteria used in the determination that individuals are &#8220;suspected international terrorists&#8221;. 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur asked the Government to indicate how this issue will affect 
the right of individuals to apply for asylum.

</b> 
46. Le 5 avril 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; une lettre au Gouvernement du Maroc 
concernant la <b>loi relative &#224; la lutte contre le terrorisme du 29 mai 2003</b>, qui a modifi&#233; 
certaines dispositions du Code p&#233;nal ainsi que certaines dispositions du Code de proc&#233;dure 
p&#233;nale. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, la loi du 29 mai 2003, qui a ajout&#233; au Code p&#233;nal les 
articles 218-1 &#224; 218-9, contient une d&#233;finition tr&#232;s large et g&#233;n&#233;rale de ce qui constitue des actes 
de terrorisme. En outre, l&#8217;article 218-2 incrimine l&#8217;apologie d&#8217;actes constituant des infractions de 
terrorisme. Deuxi&#232;mement, selon le Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale, la dur&#233;e de la garde &#224; vue dans 
les cas de crimes qualifi&#233;s d&#8217;actes terroristes est de 96 heures, renouvelables deux fois sur

En outre, le droit de consulter un avocat n&#8217;existe qu&#8217;a partir de la premi&#232;re prolongation de la

(b)<b> </b><i>Communication from the Government 
</i> 
47. By letter of 29 January 2007, the Government of Morocco replied to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s correspondence of 5 April 2006. The Government informs that the Counter-
Terrorism Act issued on 28 May 2003 is in fact an extension of the Criminal Code, insofar as 
some particular provisions on terrorist crimes are concerned. These provisions define terrorist 
crimes, refer to penalties for aggravating factors and list appropriate procedures for dealing with 
such offences. The definition of a terrorist crime is taken from the Arab Convention for the 
Suppression of Terrorism and from some comparable laws of democratic States. Furthermore, 
the Government indicates that the Moroccan legislature has listed a series of ordinary offences 
that are covered by the Criminal Code and are particularly heinous, abhorrent or grave in terms 
of the impact that they have on the security of the population and public order in Morocco. These 
offences are deemed to be terrorist crimes, if they are committed in pursuit of an individual or 
collective agenda that relies on intimidation, terrorism or violence to place public order in grave 
jeopardy. The Moroccan legislature furthermore makes it an offence to promote and finance 
terrorism and to encourage and incite others to commit terrorist crimes. 
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
 page 27 
 
In addition, the Government highlights that the legislature set the period of custody for terrorist 
crimes at up to 12 days, given the amount of time required to investigate and understand all 
aspects of these kinds of offences and given the nature and gravity of these offences, as well as 
the importance of investigating them thoroughly. If the exigencies of the investigation are such 
that an extension of custody is required, the police must apply to the prosecution service for 
written authorization. In fact, the period of custody for terrorist crimes is only 96 hours (four 
days); it cannot be extended automatically but only by order of a prosecuting judge, who must 
verify the grounds for the extension. Moreover, the Code of Criminal Procedure requires the 
police to notify the prosecution service and the family of an arrested person as soon as the person 
is placed in custody. The police must register, in their records, which are scrutinized by the 
prosecution service, the time and date on which custody begins and the date on which the person 
is presented to the prosecution service. The police must also draw up a list of all persons being 
held in custody. Visits to police stations are carried out at least once a week.  
 
As regards the concern expressed by the Special Rapporteur that access to counsel is only 
possible after the first extension of the period of custody, i.e. six days, the Government informs 
that the legislature approved this measure because of the confidentiality of police investigations 
in terrorism cases and the need to protect the police and the investigation proceedings. With 
respect to medical attention, the Government underlines that the Code of Criminal Procedure 
requires every royal prosecutor-general, royal prosecutor and investigating judge to order a 
medical examination of any person brought before him, if the person or his counsel requests one 
or if the officer at law can see signs, or suspects, that violence or torture has occurred. 
 
The Government further advises that the Moroccan legislature criminalizes acts of violence and 
torture and, while it does not define these terms precisely, it nevertheless makes it an offence to 
commit any act that adversely affects the liberty and physical and personal integrity of 
individuals. The legislature has adopted a set of provisions, laws and measures to prevent such 
acts. For example, the Criminal Code prohibits any judge, public official, government agent or 
law enforcement officer from doing any act that harms a citizen&#8217;s personal liberty and civil 
rights. Section 225 of the Criminal Code prescribes a penalty of deprivation of civil rights for 
such an act, while the perpetrator will also be subject to the penalty laid down in paragraph 3 of 
section 436 of the Code, i.e. a term of between 20 and 30 years, if he is entrusted with public 
authority or is in one of the categories listed in section 225 and if the arbitrary act or violation of 
personal liberty was committed or ordered for personal reasons or to pander to personal desires. 
The Government further states that Morocco is determined to strengthen and promote rights and 
freedoms, to amend its domestic laws in accordance with the international instruments which it 
has ratified, and to consolidate institutional mechanisms which ensure respect for human rights, 
has ratified all the relevant international human rights instruments, notably the International 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 
which it ratified on 21 November 1996. In an effort to ensure consistency between domestic 
legislation and the Convention, the Anti-Torture Act No. 43.04 was brought into law. The Act 
defines torture, recognizes victims of torture, and prescribes penalties for torture. It also lists 
certain aggravating circumstances, such as where the offence is committed against a judge, a law 
enforcement officer or a public official, in or during the course of his duties, or against a witness, 
a victim or a plaintiff, either because that person has given a statement or filed a complaint with 
a view to bringing proceedings, or in order to prevent that person from doing so.

</b>(a)<b> </b><i>Communications sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
<b></b></i><b> 
</b>48. On 7 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent a letter to the Government of Pakistan (see 
paragraph 67) regarding three incidents of <b>air strikes by United States unmanned aircraft 
against targets in Pakistan</b>, each of them resulting in the death of several civilians. According 
to the information received, on 5 November 2005, an unmanned aircraft operated by the US 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) fired a missile at a house in North Waziristan, Pakistan. The 
CIA had received information that al-Qaeda operative Hamza Rabia, a citizen of Egypt alleged 
to have been involved in an attempt on the life of President Pervez Musharraf in December 2003, 
was staying there with his wife and children. While an overall of eight persons, including his 
wife and children, were reportedly killed in the attack, Hamza Rabia managed to escape with an 
injured leg. Furthermore, it was reported that on 1 December 2005, an unmanned drone operated 
by the CIA fired a missile at a house in the village Haisori, near the town of Mir Ali, North 
Waziristan, about 30 kms from the Afghani border, killing five persons. It appeared that the dead 
were Hamza Rabia, two other foreign men, and the 17-year-old son and an eight-year-old 
nephew of the owner of the house. While officials of the Government of Pakistan stated that the 
blast resulting in the deaths was caused by explosives handled or stored in the house, reports 
indicate that residents of the area saw an unmanned aircraft fire a missile at the house and 
recovered fragments of the missile. Information received also indicated that in the early morning 
hours of 13 January 2006 a remote-piloted Predator aircraft of the United States security services 
launched a strike with &#8220;Hellfire&#8221; missiles on the village of Damadola in the Bajaur Agency, 
North Western Pakistan, close to the border with Afghanistan. The attack was reported to have 
killed 18 persons, including women and children. The target of the strike reportedly was Ayman 
al-Zawahri, who is commonly referred to as the &#8220;number two&#8221; of al-Qaeda. He was reportedly 
expected at a dinner in Damadola on the evening of 12 January 2006. The Government of 
Pakistan was reported to have stated that 5 senior al-Qaeda figures were among those killed, 
including a chemical and explosives expert, Midhat Mursi al-Sayed alias Abu Abu Khabab, Abu 
Obaidah al-Misri, allegedly al-Qaeda chief of operations for Afghanistan&#8217;s eastern Kunar 
province, and Ayman al-Zawahiri&#8217;s son-in-law Abdur Rehman al-Maghribi. However, the 
reports received indicated that the bodies of the five &#8220;Arab fighters&#8221; killed in the strike were 
pulled out of the rubble and taken away from the scene soon after the strike, so that only the 
bodies of 13 Pakistani victims could be identified. It was the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s understanding 
that the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was authorized to operate such Predator 
operations under presidential authority signed after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 
With regard to the incident in Haisori of 1 December 2005, the Government&#8217;s position reportedly 
was that the deaths were caused by the explosion of explosives stored in the house. With regard 
to the incident in Damadola on 13 January 2006, however, media reports suggested that the 
Government attributed the deaths to a missile fired by a US aircraft. The Government&#8217;s Prime 
Minister, Mr. Shaukat Aziz, was reported to have publicly stated that such attacks were not 
acceptable to Pakistan. In connection with these conflicting reports, the Special Rapporteurs also 
expressed concern at information received regarding Mr. Hayatullah Khan, a reporter for the 
Urdu-language daily &quot;Ausaf&quot; and photographer for the European Press Photo Agency, who 
reportedly found and reported evidence that the deaths in Haisori village on 1 December 2005 
had been caused by a US air strike, thus contradicting your Government&#8217;s official version of the </p>

events. According to information received, he was abducted by armed men on 5 December 2005, 
in Mir Ali, North Waziristan, and has since then remained unaccounted for. The Special 
Rapporteurs urged the Government to clarify the whereabouts of Mr. Khan and to ensure that his 
rights to life, physical integrity, personal freedom and freedom of expression are respected. In 
addition, the Government was requested whether it accepted that there were three air strikes by 
unmanned CIA drones on targets in Pakistan on 5 November 2005, 1 December 2005, and 13 
January 2006. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs asked the Government of Pakistan whether 
it agreed to the killing of Hamza Rabia and Ayman al-Zawahri as well as whether it agreed to the 
United States carrying out air strikes against targets in Pakistan in order to kill terrorism 
suspects. 
 
49. On 18 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, drew the attention of the Government of Pakistan to the case of Mr. <b>Khalid 
Mehmood Rashid</b>, a Pakistani citizen (see paragraph 51). According to information received, 
Mr. Khalid Mehmood Rashid was handed over by South African authorities to Pakistani officials 
at an air base in South Africa in late 2005. Thereafter, he left the country with Pakistani officials 
on an unscheduled flight. It was alleged that he had not been seen or heard from since. 
According to the Pakistani High Commission in South Africa, on 14 June 2006, Mr Rashid was 
&quot;wanted in Pakistan for his suspected links with terrorism and other anti-state elements ... 
Presently he is in the custody of the Government of Pakistan&quot;. On 29 June 2006, the Lahore 
High Court directed the state to disclose his whereabouts within three weeks. The Special 
Rapporteur requested the Government to indicate on what basis the individual was had been 
wanted in Pakistan for his suspected links with terrorism and other anti-state elements and for 
what offences he has had charged. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur asked to be provided 
with details as to whether the individual had been brought before a court for the determination of 
the lawfulness of his detention and of the criminal charges of against him.

</b> 
51. On 18 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, drew the attention of the Government of South Africa to the case of Mr. 
<b>Khalid Mehmood Rashid</b>, a Pakistani citizen (see paragraph 49). According to information 
received, Mr. Khalid Mehmood Rashid was handed over by South African authorities to 
Pakistani officials at an air base in South Africa in late 2005. Thereafter, he left the country with 
Pakistani officials on an unscheduled flight. It was alleged that he had not been seen or heard 
from since. According to the Pakistani High Commission in South Africa, on 14 June 2006, Mr 
Rashid was &quot;wanted in Pakistan for his suspected links with terrorism and other anti-state 
elements ... Presently he is in the custody of the Government of Pakistan&quot;. On 29 June 2006, the 
Lahore High Court directed the state to disclose his whereabouts within three weeks. The Special 
Rapporteur requested the Government to provide in particular information on the measures taken 
by South African authorities to ensure compliance with international norms, specifically the non-</p>

refoulement obligation, as well as whether Mr. Khalid Mehmood Rashid had an opportunity to 
appeal the decision taken before being handed over. 
 
(b)<b> </b><i>Communication from the Government<b></b></i><b> 
</b> 
52. By letter dated 23 November 2006, the Government replied to the communication of the 
Special Rapporteur. The Government informed that Mr. Rashid was detained on 31 December 
2005 under the provisions of section 34, 42 and 8 of the Immigration Act, No 13 of 2002. On 6 
November 2005, Mr Rashid was deported to Pakistan by having been handed over by South 
African authorities to Pakistani officials at Waterkloof Air Force Basis, South Africa. At that 
stage, the South African authorities were not aware of the fact that Mr Rashid was &#8220;wanted in 
Pakistan for his suspected links with terrorism and other anti-state elements&#8221;. The first time, the 
South African authorities became aware thereof, was when the Pakistani High Commission to 
South Africa issued a statement to this effect on 14 June 2006.The Government further informed 
that, on 2 November 2005, Mr Rashid waived his entitlement to the review procedure provided 
for in section 8 of the Immigration Act as well as his entitlement to call for the confirmation of 
his detention by way of a warrant arrest issued by a South African court. The Government 
underlined that it cannot adopt the approach that all deportations to countries such as Pakistan 
will lead to the torture of such returnees. In the event of the South African officials, however, 
being aware of the possibility that specific returnees may well be exposed to torture, the South 
African Government will request written undertakings by the returnee&#8217;s government that the 
relevant international covenants regulating torture will be respected.

(a)<b> </b><i>Communication from the Government 
</i> 
53. By letter dated 24 November 2005, the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
communication of 20 October 2005 (see paras. 13-14, E/CN.4/2006/98/Add.1). The Government 
informed that Muhamadruzi Iskandarov&#8217;s complicity in the commission of a number of other 
serious and especially serious offences was proved by the preliminary investigation. As a result 
of the investigation, in June 2005 he was charged with the commission of offences under several 
articles of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Tajikistan. On 4 July 2005 the investigation of 
the criminal case against M. Iskandarov was completed and on approval of the indictment the 
case was sent to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Tajikistan for consideration of the merits. 
By a judgement of the criminal division of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Tajikistan 
rendered on 6 October 2005, M. Iskandarov was found guilty of the illegal storage of large 
quantities of firearms, ammunition, explosive substances and explosive devices, terrorism, 
banditry, multiple instances of the embezzlement of public property entrusted to him, the illegal 
engagement of private protection, and other serious and especially serious offences under 
common criminal law, and sentenced to 23 years&#8217; deprivation of liberty. It must be noted that 
during the preliminary investigation M. Iskandarov fully admitted his guilt in the killing of a 
militia officer and members of his family in 1993. However, in compliance with the inter-Tajik 
peace agreement, the part of the criminal case regarding those facts concerning M. Iskandarov 
was terminated pursuant to the Amnesty Act for participants in the political and armed resistance 
of 1992-1997 in Tajikistan. In the course of the proceedings, evidence collected both during the 
court hearings and in the judicial examination was examined fully, with the involvement of the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
 page 31 
 
defendant, M. Iskandarov, his defence counsel and other participants in the proceedings. The 
evidence was also subjected to the appropriate legal scrutiny. Allegations that illegal methods 
had been used during the pretrial investigation were examined during the hearing and a legal 
ruling was passed on their substance. In particular, during the trial it was established that at the 
pretrial investigation the defendants M. Iskandarov, D. Sakovarov and E. Ibrogimov had been 
assigned defence counsel, and the investigative actions had been performed with their 
involvement. During the investigation they made statements admitting their complicity in acts of 
terrorism and illegal storage of weapons and ammunition. During the pretrial investigation the 
defendants had lodged no complaints or objections concerning the manner in which the 
investigation was conducted or alleging the use of prohibited methods of investigation, although 
they had had every opportunity to do so. Witnesses, namely B. Muhibov, head of the police task 
force, B. Homidov, head of the investigation team, C. Uzokov, detective, I. Bazirov, procurator 
of Tajikabad district, T. Nazirov, task force member, explained at the court hearing that, from the 
moment they were taken into custody, M. Iskandarov, D. Sakovarov and E.A. Ibrogimov had 
quite spontaneously, freely, and without any coercion made statements admitting their 
complicity. During the investigation no pressure of any kind of mental or physical force had 
been applied at any time. In accordance with due process, all the defendants had been provided 
with lawyers - two defence lawyers in the case of M. Iskandarov - and the lawyers had been 
present when they made their statements admitting their complicity in the offences. The fact that 
M. Iskandarov and D. Sakorov had made their statements without coercion or pressure of any 
kind during the investigation is confirmed by video recordings of their testimony during the 
pretrial investigation, in which they testify freely in the presence of their lawyers with regard to 
the offences committed, and also give replies to the lawyers&#8217; questions in which they admit their 
complicity. Taken together, all these facts disprove allegations that prohibited methods were 
used against these defendants during the pretrial investigation, and that they were prevented from 
communicating freely.  
 
The Special Rapporteur was further informed that the assertion that M. Iskandarov was charged 
with terrorism for religious or political reasons is inconsistent with the facts of the matter, as he 
was found guilty and sentenced for offences which do not relate in any way to his political, let 
along his religious, activities. In addition, as the records have established, M. Iskandarov 
organized and committed the crime of terrorism after criminal proceedings had been initiated on 
counts of embezzlement on a particularly large scale committed while he had still been 
employed by Tajikgas. He committed this offence after he had become aware of the evidence in 
the case against him and realized that he would be prosecuted. It was then that he conceived the 
idea of committing a terrorist crime as a way of evading criminal prosecution. It was specifically 
with this aim that he took advantage of the opportunity presented by the discontent of certain 
members of his gang, who resented the fact that a manhunt had been launched against them for 
certain especially serious offences, including murder. Accordingly, when they met, he suggested 
that they carry out their terrorist operation. The motive of this crime specified in M. Iskandarov&#8217;s 
statements admitting his complicity was to attract public attention and give him leverage in 
forcing the Government to drop the criminal case against him. Finally, the Special Rapporteur 
was provided with relevant excerpts of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Tajikistan, namely 
Article 179 (Terrorism) and Article 186 (Banditry).

<p><i>Thailand 
</i> 
(a)<b> </b><i>Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur<b></b></i><b> 
</b> 
54. On 11 January 2006 the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Government of Thailand, in 
which he referred to the use of what was described to him as <b>blacklists of suspected militants</b>. 
According to information received, district offices, local police and military task forces prepared 
lists which identify typically Muslim villagers from southern regions in Thailand said to be 
members or supporters of militant groups, or having shown an inclination towards separatist 
ideology. Those identified in these lists were said to have been asked to surrender themselves to 
prove their innocence, pledge not to participate in insurgent activities, and undertake re-
education programmes. Failing this, a warrant for the individual&#8217;s arrest was issued under an 
Emergency Decree adopted in July 2005. It was alleged that those arrested subject to the 
Emergency Decree were not entitled to exercise their right to silence, nor have access to legal 
counsel, nor bring an application for habeas corpus. Safeguards under the Criminal Procedure 
Code were also said to be not applicable. The Special Rapporteur requested the Government to 
provide him with a copy of the Emergency Decree of July 2005 and to advise him of the grounds 
upon which this state of emergency was declared. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur asked the 
Government to advise him of the basis upon which individuals were listed in the blacklists 
mentioned and whether this is linked in any way with the criminalisation of membership in any 
organization(s). Moreover, the Special Rapporteur requested the Government to inform him of 
the basis upon which individuals were denied the right to exercise their right to silence, access to 
legal counsel, and their inability to bring an application for habeas corpus. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur asked the Government to provide him with comprehensive information on 
specific provisions of the Thai Penal Code and Anti-Money Laundering Act and related anti-
terrorism laws and measures. Referring to an emergency anti-terrorist decree, establishing 
criminal offences in the Penal Code and providing for various investigative tools to fight 
terrorism, issued in August 2003, the Special Rapporteur requested the Government to advise 
him whether this decree was still in force and, if so, the basis upon which it was issued and 
continued to exist.  
 
(b)<b> </b><i>Communication from the Government<b></b></i><b> 
</b> 
55. By letter dated 30 June 2006, the Government replied to the communication of the Special 
Rapporteur. The Government informed that, with a view to the unrest in the south of the country, 
the Thai authorities were compelled to keep a preliminary checklists of those suspected of 
having links with armed militants. With regard to the concern raised as to the so called &#8220;black 
list&#8221;, the Government clarified that no such lists are being compiled by the law enforcement 
officials in Thailand. The only existing list are &#8220;watch lists&#8221; similar to what other countries also 
keep for similar national security concerns. According to Section 11 (1)-(2) of the Emergency 
Decree, law enforcement officials can request the court to issue arrest warrants and/or summons 
in order that the suspects can be appropriately interrogated by the authorities. This process of 
questioning can last from 3 days up to 30 days maximum in accordance with Section 12 of the 
Emergency Decree. After the 30 days limit, a person can only be further detained if he is charged 
with an offence. In this case, the suspect has the right to remain silent and access to a legal 
counsel. Furthermore, a person arrested according to the Emergency Decree is not considered a 
suspect under criminal law. The information obtained from the suspect during the 30 days </p>

interrogation period cannot be used against that suspect in court. This is in accordance with 
Article 134/4 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

and Mr. Mursel Kayar were arrested and detained in the Directorate of Security in Batman, as 
they were trying to observe riots that were taking place in Batman village. While in custody Mr. 
Resit Yaray and Mr. Mursel Kayar were said to be beaten by police officers after their arrest. On 
2 April 2006 Mr. Resit Yaray and Mr. Mursel Kayar were charged with &#8220;assisting and 
supporting illegal organizations&#8221; and transferred to Batman prison, where they remain. The first 
hearing of the trial of Mr. Resit Yaray and Mr. Mursel Kayar was scheduled to take place on 30

transferred to Diyarbakir Prison where they remain in detention. Mr. Edip Yasar&#8217;s trial was 
scheduled to begin on 13 July 2006. Grave concern was expressed that the above events were 
connected with the activities of the above named people in defence of human rights, in particular 
because of their efforts to observe and report on human rights violations allegedly committed by 
the security forces during the disturbances in Turkey in March and April 2006. The Government 
was specifically requested to explain the legal bases and the domestic law applicable to the arrest 
of Mr. Resit Yaray, Mr. Mursel Kayar, Mr. Ali Oncu, Mr. Edip Yasar, Mr. Mecail Ozel, Mr.

57. By letter dated 15 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur drew the attention of the Government 
of Turkey to information concerning Mr. <b>Osman Baydemir</b>, mayor of Diyarbakir Metropolitan 
Municipality. The Special Rapporteur mentioned that he had had the opportunity to visit 
Diyarbakir during his country visit of February 2006. According to the information received, 
following his intervention during incidents in March 2006 in Diyarbakir, Mr. Baydemir has been 
charged under article 314/2 of the Turkish Penal Code &#8211; membership in an armed organisation &#8211; 
with reference also to articles 314/3 and 220/7 &#8211;, and article 53/1 of the Turkish Penal Code, as 
well as to article 5 of the Anti-Terror Law. The case was to be tried in the Diyarbakir Aggravated 
Felony Court No.6. The Government was requested to inform the Special Rapporteur of the 
factual allegations concerning the charge against Mr. Baydemir and the justification for 
considering the conduct of Mr. Baydemir as &#8220;terrorism&#8221;. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur 
asked the Government to indicate whether any limitations allowed in Turkish law have been 
placed upon Mr. Baydemir as regards the legal safeguards pertaining to the investigation of the 
case. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur asked to be advised on the penalty called for by the 
prosecution in this case. Finally, the Government was asked whether the trial of Mr. Baydemir 
had been open to the public, allowing for the independent monitoring of the trial. 
<b> 
</b>(b)<b> </b><i>Communication from the Government<b></b></i><b> 
</b> 
58. By letter of 4 September 2006, the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
communication sent le 22 June 2006. The Government informed that Mr. Resit Yaray and Mr. 
Mursel Kayar were apprehended by law enforcement officials while they were breaking 
windows of the Turkish Telecom and of Akbank and entering both buildings respectively. They 
were then transferred to the Public Prosecutor. On 2 April 2006, they were arrested upon the 
decision of the Penal Court of first Instance of Batman pursuant to Article 100/3-a-9 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure. The court trial against Mr. Resit Yaray and Mr. Mursel Kayar was 
initiated on the charges of willfully assisting illegal organizations. On 30 June 206, the Court 
ruled on the continuation of their arrests. At the time of writing of the Government&#8217;s reply, the 
case was still underway. As regards Mr. Edip Yasar and Mr. Necdet Atalay, the Government 
advised that they were among the persons who actively participated in the incidents which took 
place from 28 to 31 March 2006 in Diyarbakir. They had been detained upon their interrogation 
on 4 April 2006 by the instruction of the Public Prosecutor. On 5 April 2006, they were arrested 
by the decision of the Heavy Penal Court of Diyarbakir pursuant to Article 100/3-a-9 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure. A court trial was initiated against both individuals on the charges of 
willfully assisting illegal organizations. On 20 July 2006, Mr. Edip Yasar and Mr. Necdet Atalay 
were released by decision of the Court. At the time of writing of the Government&#8217;s reply, the 
case was still underway. With respect to Mr. Mecail Ozel, the Government indicated that he was 
detained by law enforcement authorities when trying to invade several private residences. His 
family was officially informed of his detention the same day. He was also allowed to access his 
lawyer. Mr. Mecail Ozel was arrested by order of the Heavy Penal Court on 3 April 2006, where 
a court trial was initiated against him. On 17 April 2006, the Court decided on the continuation 
of his arrest pursuant to Article 100/3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A hearing was held by 
the Court on 8 August 2006 and at the time of writing of the Government reply, the case was still 
underway. On 6 April 2006, Mr. Mecail Ozel lodged a complaint with the Office of the Chief 
Public Prosecutor of Diyarbakir alleging that he was subject to torture during his detention. An 
investigation was initiated by the Chief Public Prosecutor on this complaint, which was still </p>

underway at the time of writing of the Government reply. The Government also informed that an 
investigation was initiated against Mr. Erdal Kuzu and Mr. H&#252;seyin Cangir by the Office of the 
Chief Public Prosecution of Diyarbakir for their involvement in the incidents during the funerals 
on 29 March to 1 April 2006 in Diyarbakir. The Government maintained that they were not 
arrested or detained in connection with the investigation. Finally, the Government informed that 
Mr. Ali Oncu was detained on 4 April 2006 in connection with his involvement in the incidents

59. On 11 October 2006, the Government replied to the allegation letter sent on 15 August 2006. 
The Government informed that a case was initiated against Mr. Osman Baydemir in the 6th 
Heavy Penal of Diyarbakir on the charge of &#8220;willfully assisting an armed organization&#8221; under 
Articles 314/3 and 220/7 of the Turkish Penal Code. The first hearing was scheduled to be held 
on 20 October 2006. According to the indictment, the charge against Mr. Osman Baydemir was 
based on his public statement, displaying support for the members of the terrorist organization 
PKK/KADEK who lost their lives during a counter-terrorist operation in Bingol as well as 
encouraging and supporting the persons who were involved in the incidents of violence which 
took place in Diyarbakir on 29 March to 1 April 2006. The Government further informed that the 
link to terrorism had been established in terms of the terrorist nature and activities of the 
PKK/KADEK, constituting an armed organization according to Article 314 of the Turkish Penal 
Code and the established jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Appeals. According to the 
indictment, the public statements of Mr. Osman Baydemir support the terrorist organization 
PKK/KADEK in furthering its activities. Finally, the Government informed that according to 
Article 141 of the Constitution, court trials are open to the public. Trials can only be held closed 
to the public by the decision of a court, in cases where public morals or public security 
absolutely so dictates.

</b> 
61. On 6 January 2006 the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Government of Uganda 
referring to information received concerning a charge of terrorism against opposition leader and 
Presidential candidate Dr. <b>Kizza Bisegye</b>. According to information received, Dr. Kizza 
Bisegye, 49, was leader of the main opposition party in Uganda, the Forum for Democratic 
Change, and a candidate in the approaching Presidential elections. He was arrested on 14 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
page 36 
 
November 2005, accused of treason, concealment of treason and rape, shortly after returning to 
Uganda after some years abroad. He was taken to the High Court for a bail hearing in Kampala 
on 16 November 2005, which was abandoned after the Court was surrounded by armed members 
of a special counter-terrorism security force, prompting the presiding judge to withdraw from the 
proceedings. Soldiers took up positions around the High Court, apparently prepared to re-arrest 
anyone who was released on bail. Their presence resulted in 14 of those charged with Dr. 
Bisegye, who were granted bail, to refuse to leave the prison. Dr. Bisegye was later charged with 
separate military offences of terrorism and unlawful possession of firearms and, instead of 
appearing at the reconvened bail hearing, he was instead taken to be heard on these fresh charges 
before a military tribunal. These charges carry the death penalty upon conviction. Dr. Bisegye 
has in the past been accused of leading the People&#8217;s Redemption Army and having links with the 
Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army. On arraignment before the Army Court-Martial, the Head of the Court-
Martial General Tumwine entered a plea of not guilty on behalf of Dr. Bisegye, who had refused 
to recognise the jurisdiction of the Court. Eighteen of a suspected 22 accomplices to Dr. Bisegye 
appeared before General Tumwine on the same charges. In protesting the jurisdiction of the 
Court-Martial and the conduct of that hearing at the same time that Dr. Bisegye was scheduled to 
appear for his bail hearing before the civilian High Court, legal representatives of Dr. Bisegye, 
Mr. Elias Lukwago and Mr. Caleb Alaka, were arrested for contempt of Court. Proceedings 
before the Court-Martial are said to have been closed. A Government ban had been imposed 
against the reporting, discussion or debate of all proceedings against Dr. Bisegye and his alleged 
accomplices. The Government had also banned any demonstrations linked to these charges and 
proceedings.  Dr. Bisegye was released on bail by the High Court in early January 2006. The 
status of charges against him before the Military Court-Martial was to be considered by 
Uganda&#8217;s Constitutional Court. The Government was inter alia requested to inform the Special 
Rapporteur of the factual allegations concerning the charge(s) of terrorism against Dr. Bisegye, 
providing him also with relevant excerpts of the legislation under which Dr. Bisegye was 
charged. The Special Rapporteur also asked the Government to advise him why Dr Bisegye and 
his alleged conspirators are, as civilians, being tried before a military tribunal. Furthermore, the 
Special Rapporteur asked to be advised of the legal and factual grounds upon which legal 
counsel Mr. Elias Lukwago and Mr. Caleb Alaka were arrested for contempt of court, and the 
result and current status of any resulting charges against them. Finally, the Special Rapporteur 
requested to be informed of the status of proceedings before the Constitutional Court. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur requested comprehensive information on Uganda&#8217;s Anti-
Terrorism Act 2002 and related anti-terrorism laws and measures, with particular regard to what 
was said to be an overly broad definition of &#8216;terrorism&#8217;, the applicability of the death penalty 
under the act to minors, the breadth of provisions allowing the prohibition of organizations, and 
powers of interception of communications and other forms of surveillance.

63. On 21 June 2006, following the adoption of the <b>United Kingdom&#8217;s Terrorism Act 2006</b>, 
the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland to thank them for the cooperation extended to him in the process towards the 
adoption of the law, notably for the meetings in November 2005 and the responses to his written 
questions, but also to express the two areas of concerns. First, the Special Rapporteur referred to 
certain overly broad and vague terms and concepts such as &#8220;indirectly encouraging&#8221; acts of 
terrorism and &#8220;glorification&#8221;, interpreted as including &#8220;any form of praise or celebration&#8221;. In 
relation to intent, the Special Rapporteur commended its explicit inclusion in some parts of the 
Act, regretting at the same time that is not always a necessary element of the offences and that, 
in particular, there is a possibility of committing the offence of encouragement of terrorism and 
dissemination of terrorist publications through &#8220;recklessness&#8221;. Second the Special Rapporteur 
addressed the issue of the extension of the length of detention without charge for up to 28 days 
for terrorist suspects. While appreciating the Government&#8217;s opinion that one&#8217;s right to habeas 
corpus was not affected by the previous 14-day period of detention and that the extension of 
detention without charges, possible under strict conditions, was subject to judicial oversight, the 
Special Rapporteur he remained of the opinion that the possibility of 28 days of detention 
without charge is too long unless there is a regular judicial review of all aspects of the detention, 
including the reasons for it and any arguments the detainee may wish to present to contest them.   
 
64. On 26 June 2006 the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, brought to the Government of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland's attention information received concerning two Algerian men, known as &#8220;V&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8221; 
(see paragraph 9). According to the allegations received, &#8220;V&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8221; were labelled as &#8220;suspected 
international terrorists&#8221; by the authorities on the basis of secret intelligence to which they had no 
access and which they were therefore unable to challenge, and detained in high-security prisons. 
They were deported to Algeria on 16 and 17 June 2006 respectively, on the grounds that they 
presented a &#8220;threat to the national security&#8221;. The two men had been held at an undisclosed 
location since their arrival in Algeria, and had been allowed no contact with their families, in 
violation of Algerian law and in spite of earlier assurances by the Algerian consulate in London 
that they were not wanted for any crimes in Algeria and that they would be released after they 
had spent a few hours in police custody at the airport to satisfy formalities. The men were held 
by a military intelligence agency, the Department for Information and Security (D&#233;partement du 
renseignement et de la s&#233;curit&#233;, DRS), which specializes in interrogating people thought to 
possess information about terrorist activities. The Special Rapporteur requested the Government 
to indicate in particular on which basis the two men were labelled &#8220;suspected international 
terrorists&#8221; and whether they had an opportunity to appeal this decision. Furthermore, he asked to 
be advised what measures the Government had taken to ensure compliance with international 
norms, notably the non-refoulement obligation if there is a risk of torture.  
<b> 
</b>(b)<b> </b><i>Communication from the Government<b></b></i><b> 
</b> 
65. As at 31 January 2007, there had been no reply to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication 
of 21 June 2006. 
 
66. By letter of 4 August 2006, the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter sent on 
26 June 2006. The Government informed that, in April 2002, the then Home Secretary issued a 
certificate under Section 21 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 in respect of &#8220;I&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
page 38 
 
The grounds for this certification under that Section (which was repealed in March 2005) were 
that the Home Secretary reasonably suspected that the person was a terrorist. Such certification 
only applied to persons suspected of international terrorism. This decision was taken on the basis 
of an assessment by the British Security Service. &#8220;I&#8221; was then detained. He appealed against this 
certificate to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, which is a superior court of record. 
The appeal was dismissed. &#8220;I&#8221; was released when Section 21 of the 2001 Act was repealed in 
March 2005. As regards &#8220;V&#8221;, the Government advised that he was not certified and not detained 
under the provisions of the 2001 Act. He was detained and remanded in custody while being 
tried on criminal charges. He was found not guilty, and released in April 2005. In August 2005, 
&#8220;I&#8221; was notified that the Home Secretary intended to deport him from the UK on the grounds that 
he was a threat to national security. &#8220;V&#8221; was notified in September 2005. Both men were 
detained pending their deportation. Both initially appealed against the decision to deport them, 
but both men subsequently withdrew their appeals. &#8220;V&#8221; was deported on 16 June and &#8220;I&#8221; on 17 
June 2006. The Government underlined that, notwithstanding the withdrawal of the men&#8217;s appeal 
against deportation, it held extensive discussions with the Algerian authorities about the 
circumstances in which they would be returned. The UK was informed by the Algerian 
authorities that &#8220;V&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8221; were held in police custody because they had been deported from the 
UK, that they were being asked to explain the circumstances of their detention in the UK and of 
their deportation, and that this is standard Algerian practice in accordance with the Algerian 
Penal Code. Both men were released on 22 June. The Government also informed that it was not 
aware of any allegations of mistreatment of the two men while they were in detention following 
their return to Algeria. Finally, the Government informed that in case of removals from the UK, 
which include deportations, an assessment is made whether or not the removal is consistent with 
the UK&#8217;s international obligations. According to the Government&#8217;s information, these 
assessments are conducted on an individual basis, taking into account of the facts of the 
particular case, and publicly available information. Such assessments must necessarily be 
conducted before the removal takes place. In the cases of &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;V&#8221;, the assessment reached 
was that neither man would be in danger of being subjected to torture or to cruel or degrading 
treatment if returned.

</i>(a)<b> </b><i>Communications sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</i> 
67. On 7 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent a letter to the Government of the United 
States of Amercia (see paragraph 48) regarding three incidents of <b>air strikes by United States 
unmanned aircraft against targets in Pakistan</b>, each of them resulting in the death of several 
civilians. According to the information received, on 5 November 2005, an unmanned aircraft 
operated by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) fired a missile at a house in North 
Waziristan, Pakistan. The CIA had received information that al-Qaeda operative Hamza Rabia, a 
citizen of Egypt alleged to have been involved in an attempt on the life of President Pervez 
Musharraf in December 2003, was staying there with his wife and children. While an overall 
eight persons, including his wife and children, were reportedly killed in the attack, Hamza Rabia 
managed to escape with an injured leg. Furthermore, it was reported that on 1 December 2005, 
an unmanned drone operated by the CIA fired a missile at a house in the village Haisori, near the 
town of Mir Ali, North Waziristan, about 30 kms from the Afghani border, killing five persons. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
 page 39 
 
It appeared that the dead were Hamza Rabia, two other foreign men, and the 17-year-old son and 
an eight-year-old nephew of the owner of the house. While officials of the Government of 
Pakistan stated that the blast resulting in the deaths was caused by explosives handled or stored 
in the house, reports indicated that residents of the area saw an unmanned aircraft fire a missile 
at the house and recovered fragments of the missile. Information received also indicated that in 
the early morning hours of 13 January 2006 a remote-piloted Predator aircraft of the United 
States security services launched a strike with &#8220;Hellfire&#8221; missiles on the village of Damadola in 
the Bajaur Agency, North Western Pakistan, close to the border with Afghanistan. Reports 
indicated that US Predator drones were circling the area of Damadola village during the three 
days preceding the missile strike. The attack was reported to have killed 18 persons, including 
women and children. The target of the strike reportedly was Ayman al-Zawahri, who is 
commonly referred to as the &#8220;number two&#8221; of al-Qaeda. He was reportedly expected at a dinner 
in Damadola on the evening of 12 January 2006. The Government of Pakistan was reported to 
have stated that 5 senior al-Qaeda figures were among those killed, including a chemical and 
explosives expert, Midhat Mursi al-Sayed alias Abu Abu Khabab, Abu Obaidah al-Misri, 
allegedly al-Qaeda chief of operations for Afghanistan&#8217;s eastern Kunar province, and Ayman al-
Zawahiri&#8217;s son-in-law Abdur Rehman al-Maghribi. However, the reports received indicated that 
the bodies of the five &#8220;Arab fighters&#8221; killed in the strike were pulled out of the rubble and taken 
away from the scene soon after the strike, so that only the bodies of 13 Pakistani victims could 
be identified. It was the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s understanding that the US Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) was authorized to operate such Predator operations under presidential authority 
signed after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The Government of Pakistan was reported 
to have lodged a diplomatic protest over the incident on 14 January 2006. Pakistan&#8217;s Prime 
Minister, Mr. Shaukat Aziz, reportedly stated publicly that such attacks are not acceptable to 
Pakistan. The Government of the United States of America was requested to inform the Special 
Rapporteur whether the reports according to which the target of the missile strike against 
Damadola was Ayman al-Zawahri were accurate. Furthermore, the Sprecial Rapporteur asked 
particularly on what basis it was decided to kill, rather than capture, Ayman al-Zawahri and 
Hamza Rabia. 
 
68. On 15 September 2006 the Special Rapporteur addressed a letter to the Government of the 
United States of America drawing attention to information received regarding <b>Ravil Gumarov</b> 
and <b>Timur Ishmuratov</b>, two former detainees at Guant&#225;namo Bay, Cuba. According to 
information received, in February 2004, Ravil Gumarov and Timur Ishmuratov, along with five 
other Russian citizens, were returned from Guant&#225;namo Bay to Russia. After their return, in 
April 2005, they were arrested in connection with the explosion of a pipeline in Tatarstan in 
January 2005. While in detention, they were allegedly severely mistreated in an effort to force 
them to confess. Both men confessed to the crime during the investigation, but subsequently 
withdrew their confessions in court. In September 2005, a jury unanimously acquitted them and 
a third defendant, Fanis Shaikhutdinov, of the charges against them. However, the Russian 
Supreme Court subsequently annulled the verdict &#8211; thereby allowing the three men to be tried 
again for the same crime &#8211; and on 5 May 2006, the defendants were convicted of terrorism and 
illegal possession of weapons or explosives, and were ordered to pay for the property damage. 
Ravil Gumarov was sentenced to a term of 13 years, and Timur Ishmuratov to 11 years and one 
month. The third man, Fanis Shaikhutdinov, received 15 years and six months. All three 
appealed their convictions to the Russian Supreme Court. The Government was requested to 
inform the Special Rapporteur whether the facts related to the return from Guantanamo Bay to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1 
page 40 
 
Russia of the two individuals were accurate. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur asked the 
Government what measures had been taken to ensure compliance with international norms, 
notably the non-refoulement obligation if there is a risk of torture or other inhuman, degrading or 
cruel treatment. In this context, the Special Rapporteur requested to be advised on whether the 
Government had carried out an individual assessment of the risks if these individuals were 
returned to Russia. Finally, the Special Rapporteur asked the Government to inform him about 
its intention to provide compensation to these two individuals if there were findings that the 
allegations above were true. 
 
69. On 18 December 2006 the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent a communication to the Government of the United States of America 
concerning the organization of <b>secret transfers of terrorist suspects</b> by the United States 
European Command (EUCOM) headquarters, Stuttgart-Vaihingen (see paragraph 24). It was 
alleged that EUCOM played a central role in the secret transfer of six suspected terrorists to 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. EUCOM reportedly organized from Germany the abduction of six 
prisoners of Algerian origin, namely Bensayah BELKACEM, Hadj BOUDELLAA, Saber 
LAHMAR, Mustafa Ait IDIR, Boumediene LAKHDAR and Mohamed NECHLE, from Tuzla, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina to Incirlik, Turkey in January 2002. From there they were flown to 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they continue to be detained without charges. The Special 
Rapporteur pointed out that, on 17 January 2002, the investigative judge of the Supreme Court of 
the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina had issued a decision terminating the applicants&#8217; pre-
trial detention on the grounds that there were no further reasons or circumstances upon which 
pre-trial detention could be ordered. Furthermore, the Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, in its decision of 11 October 2002, had concluded that the hand-over of the six 
individuals to the US authorities was in violation of a number of provisions of the European 
Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), including article 5 (para. 1) 
and article 6 (para.2) and also article 1 of Protocol No. 6 to the ECHR. The Special Rapporteur 
requested the Government to adopt effective measures to prevent the occurrence of practices of 
extraordinary rendition in breach of international human rights law. The Government was also 
asked to indicate on which basis these six men had been labelled &#8220;terrorist suspects&#8221; and whether 
they had an opportunity to appeal this decision. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur requested 
the Government to inform him on what grounds the six individuals were detained at Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba. Finally, the Special Rapporteur asked to be advised about the details on the 
procedural guarantees being employed providing for judicial review of the continued detention 
of the six individuals.

and 15 September 2006. A response to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s correspondence of 18 December 
was requested by 17 February 2007.

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.1

71. The Special Rapporteur issued the following statement on 27 October 2006: 
 
&quot;On 17 October 2006 the <b>Military Commissions Act</b> (MCA) was signed into law, less than four 
months after the Supreme Court's decision on 29 June 2006 in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld which 
upheld the applicability of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to all detainees during 
times of armed conflict, affirmed minimum standards of due process protection and struck down 
the special military commissions initially established by the President of the United States of 
America in 2001. Debate regarding this legislation was relatively brief considering its potential 
impact, and while there were some positive amendments made by Congress, the MCA contains a 
number of provisions that are incompatible with the international obligations of the United States 
under human rights law and humanitarian law.  
 
Several national and international non-governmental organizations have been critical of many 
aspects of the MCA, which was enacted to provide a legal basis for the military commissions. I 
believe it is important in my capacity to publicly express my concerns on this law as the United 
States has taken a lead role on countering terrorism since the 11 September 2001 terrorist 
attacks. Therefore there is an added concern that some Governments may view certain aspects of 
this legislation as an example that could be followed in respect of their national counter-
terrorism legislation.  
 
A number of provisions of the MCA appear to contradict the universal and fundamental 
principles of fair trial standards and due process enshrined in Common Article 3 of the Geneva 
Conventions. One of the most serious aspects of this legislation is the power of the President to 
declare anyone, including US citizens, without charge as an &quot;unlawful enemy combatant&quot; &#8211; a 
term unknown in international humanitarian law &#8211; resulting in these detainees being subject to 
the jurisdiction of a military commission composed of commissioned military officers. At the 
same time, the material scope of crimes to be tried by military commissions is much broader than 
war crimes in the meaning of the Geneva Conventions. Further, in manifest contradiction with 
article 9, paragraph 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights the MCA denies 
non US citizens (including legal permanent residents) in US custody the right to challenge the 
legality of their detention by filing a writ of habeas corpus, with retroactive effect. Another 
concern is the denial of the right to see exculpatory evidence if it is deemed classified 
information which severely impedes the right to a fair trial.  
 
On 1 September 2005, less than a month after assuming the mandate, the Special Rapporteur 
wrote to the Government advising he would welcome the opportunity to cooperate with the 
Government by providing written comments, attending parliamentary hearings or undertaking a 
country visit in order to assess the conformity of existing or envisaged counter-terrorism 
measures with international human rights standards. Further, in July of this year, the Special 
Rapporteur formally requested a country visit to the United States in order to assess its counter 
terrorism laws and practices against international standards. 
 
In addition to the Special Rapporteur's numerous concerns with respect to the Military 
Commissions Act he also has concerns regarding a number of other issues relating to the 
protection of human rights in the context of countering terrorism such as the Patriot Act, 
immigration laws and policies, CIA secret detention centers, rendition flights, breaches of non-
refoulement and the Government's denial of extra-territorial human rights obligations. During a </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.1

country visit, the Special Rapporteur would like to discuss these and other issues with relevant 
authorities, and he hopes that the Government will extend him an invitation in the very near 
future&quot;.

<p><i>Uzbekistan 
<b></b></i><b> 
</b>(a)<b> </b><i>Communications sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
<b></b></i><b> 
</b>72. On 10 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on freedom 
of religion or belief, drew the attention of the Government of Uzbekistan to information received 
concerning <b>legal amendments restricting the right to promote the bible outside prayer 
houses</b>. According to the information received, following a meeting of the heads of the main 
confessions organised by the Religious Affairs Department held on 28 July 2006, a number of 
changes to the criminal and administrative Codes were announced. In particular these changes 
provide that persons who promote the bible outside prayer houses should be fined, and, in case 
of repeated attempts, imprisoned. Also the &quot;pastor&quot; of the church to which the person belongs 
can be fined respectively punished. These punishments also apply if a person carries more than 
one bible since it is assumed that only one is needed for private use.  
 
73. On 1 September 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
and belief, drew the Government of Uzbekistan&#8217;s attention to the case of Mr. <b>Mohammadrafiq 
Kamoluddin</b>, imam of a mosque in the city of Kara-Suu, Mr. Ayubkhodja Shahobidinov and 
Mr. Fathullo Rahimo (see paragraph 39). According to the information received, on 6 August 
2006, the above-mentioned individuals were killed in the city of Osh as the result of an alleged 
counter terrorism operation, led by the National Security Service of Kyrgyzstan, in cooperation 
with the security forces of Uzbekistan. Reports indicated that these individuals were suspected 
members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and were planning to carry out a terrorist 
attack on the territory of the State of Uzbekistan. Other reports highlighted that it was not alleged 
that Mr. Mohammadrafiq Kamoluddin was a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan or 
that he was involved in the commission of terrorist acts. The Special Rapporteur requested the 
Government particularly on what basis it was decided to kill, rather than capture, these three 
individuals and to indicate legal basis for qualifying an individual or an entity as &#8220;terrorist&#8221; 
under the law of Uzbekistan.  
<b>

</b> 
75. By letter of 20 December 2005, the Government of Yemen replied to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s letter sent on 17 November 2005 (see paras. 28-30, E/CN.4/2006/98/Add.1). The 
Government informed that Mr. Salah Nasser Salim &#8216;Ali and Mr. Muhammad Faraj Ahmed </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.1

Bashmilah stated, when questioned, that they had not been tortured by the Indonesian, Jordanian 
or United States of America authorities. Furthermore, the Government advised that the two men 
had not been arrested but rather handed over to the Yemeni authorities by the United States 
authorities after having been accused of being members of the organisation know as Al-Quaida. 
The Yemeni authorities detained the two individuals under the Code of Criminal Procedures No. 
13 of 1994, with a view to questioning them and verifying the allegations made by the United 
States authorities. The Government indicated that steps were being taken to verify that the 
Department of Public Prosecutions had followed the proper legal procedures. Moreover, the 
Yemeni authorities received the files on the two individuals from the United States authorities on 
10 November 2005. The Government stated that the legal procedures were being completed 
pending the arraignment against the two men before the courts. Finally, the Government 
indicated that, under the Prisons Act, detainees awaiting trial are legally entitled to access to 
medical treatment and rehabilitation programmes, whether at a detention centre or, if they have 
been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, at a prison. Internal rules regulating and 
establishing the parameters for such treatments are being applied, the implementation of which is 
overseen by the Department of Public Prosecutions.
