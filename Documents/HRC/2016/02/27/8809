<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102, 
in which the Council requests the High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue with 
the fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the 
Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies. The report 
outlines progress achieved since the previous report on the accreditation of national human 
rights institutions (NHRIs) (A/HRC/10/55) and should be read together with the report of 
the Secretary-General on national institutions for the promotion and protection of human 
rights (A/HRC/13/44), which includes, inter alia, information on activities of the Office of 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to establish and strengthen NHRIs; 
measures taken by Governments and the said institutions in this regard; and NHRI 
cooperation with international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Subcommittee on Accreditation 
</b>2. The Subcommittee on Accreditation of the International Coordinating Committee of 
National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights has the mandate to 
review and analyse applications for accreditation and to make recommendations to the 
Committee Bureau members on the applicant&#8217;s compliance with the Principles Relating to 
the Status of National Institutions (Paris Principles). The Subcommittee on Accreditation 
comprises one A-status accredited institution from each of the four regional groupings: 
Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, and Europe. Subcommittee members are 
appointed by the regional groupings for a renewable term of three years. The Subcommittee 
designates by consensus, for a renewable term of one year, one of its members to act as the 
Chairperson. Currently, the members are representatives of the NHRIs of Canada 
(Americas), Togo (Africa), the Republic of Korea (Asia and the Pacific) and Germany 
(Europe). OHCHR is a permanent observer of the Subcommittee on Accreditation and 
serves as the secretariat of the International Coordinating Committee. The Subcommittee 
has acknowledged the high degree of support and professionalism of the staff of the 
International Coordinating Committee secretariat (OHCHR National Institutions and 
Regional Mechanisms Section). 
3. In 2009, the Subcommittee on Accreditation reviewed the accreditation status (re-
accreditation reviews) of institutions from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chad and the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory. It considered new applications from the NHRIs of Mauritania, the 
Republic of Moldova, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Switzerland,1 Tunisia and Ukraine, as well as from 
the Scottish Human Rights Commission, and conducted special reviews of the NHRIs of 
Algeria, Ecuador, Greece, Luxembourg, Malaysia and Nepal.  
</p>
<p>4. To date, there are 65 NHRIs accredited with A status by the International 
Coordinating Committee, i.e. in full compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>5. The table reflecting the accreditation status of NHRIs as at January 2010 is attached 
in annex I. Annexes II and III include the Subcommittee on Accreditation reports of March 
and November 2009. The general observations developed by the International Coordinating 
Committee as of 2009 are attached in annex IV.

</p>
<p><b> III. Improvement of the International Coordinating Committee 
Accreditation Process 
</b></p>
<p>6. At its seventeenth session held on 12 April 2006, the International Coordinating 
Committee established a working group to examine the accreditation process of NHRIs and 
to develop a discussion paper for the Committee on the matter. The working group, 
comprising the then members of the Subcommittee on Accreditation, developed a 
discussion paper examining three areas: (a) the composition of the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation and its role and responsibilities; (b) the accreditation process; and (c) the 
substance of criteria or minimum standards set for accreditation. The paper was presented 
at the eighteenth and nineteenth sessions of the International Coordinating Committee. In 
addition, members were asked to provide further comments in writing with a view to 
developing a final paper, which was presented and adopted by the Committee at its 
twentieth session in April 2008.  
</p>
<p>7. The paper, as adopted by the International Coordinating Committee, includes a 
number of measures to improve the accreditation procedure, including: 
</p>
<p> (a) An appeal process to ensure greater transparency and due process for NHRIs 
that are deemed not to comply with the Paris Principles;  
</p>
<p> (b) A more rigorous review of each application for accreditation, including of the 
full documentation and statement of compliance submitted in advance of the session by 
NHRIs, with a detailed summary prepared by the secretariat; 
</p>
<p> (c) More focused recommendations provided to each national institution 
(whether A or B status) to ensure full compliance with the Paris Principles, even before the 
prescribed five-year time frame for review of accreditations;  
</p>
<p> (d) Wider distribution and greater knowledge of the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation recommendations by NHRIs and other stakeholders, so that they can play a 
proactive role in the context of follow-up action by the United Nations or NHRI regional 
coordinating bodies in the country concerned. The Subcommittee on Accreditation&#8217;s reports 
are also posted on the Internet (www.nhri.net). 
</p><p>8. In 2008, the International Coordinating Committee developed a new Statute for its 
incorporation as an association under Swiss law. The statute, which is based on the 
Committee&#8217;s existing rules of procedure, was adopted during the ninth International 
Conference of National Human Rights Institutions held in Nairobi from 21 to 24 October 
2008, and further amended at the General Meeting of the International Coordinating 
Committee held in Geneva from 23 to 27 March 2009. The accreditation procedure, as 
defined in the statute, stipulates in article 12 that, where the Subcommittee on Accreditation 
comes to an accreditation decision, that decision shall be considered an accreditation status 
recommendation, with the final decision being taken by the Committee Bureau after the 
following process has been completed:  
</p>
<p> (a) The recommendation of the Subcommittee shall first be forwarded to the 
applicant;  
</p>
<p> (b) An applicant can challenge a recommendation by submitting a written 
challenge to the Committee Chairperson, through the Committee secretariat, within 28 days 
of receipt; 
</p>
<p> (c) Thereafter, the recommendation will be forwarded to the members of the 
Committee Bureau for a decision. If a challenge has been received from the applicant, the 
challenge, together with all relevant material received in connection with both the 
application and the challenge, will also be forwarded to the members of the Bureau;  </p>


<p>GE.10-10278 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p> (d) Any member of the Bureau who disagrees with the recommendation shall, 
within 20 days of its receipt, notify the Chairperson of the Subcommittee and the 
International Coordinating Committee secretariat. The secretariat will promptly notify all 
Bureau members of the objection raised and will provide all necessary information to 
clarify that objection. If within 20 days of receipt of this information a majority of members 
of the Bureau notify the secretariat that they hold a similar objection, the recommendation 
shall be referred to the next Bureau meeting for decision;  
</p>
<p> (e) If a majority of members do not raise objection to the recommendation within 
20 days of its receipt, the recommendation shall be deemed to be approved by the Bureau;  
</p>
<p> (f) The decision of the Bureau on accreditation is final. 
</p><p>9. In accordance with its rules of procedure, the classifications for accreditation used 
by the Subcommittee on Accreditation are:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A: Compliance with the Paris Principles 
</p>
<p>&#8226; B: Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information 
 provided to make a determination 
</p>
<p>&#8226; C: Not in compliance with the Paris Principles  
</p>
<p>10. The Subcommittee on Accreditation rules of procedure remain in force and are 
incorporated as an annex of the statute of the International Coordinating Committee (art. 
59). 
</p><p>11. The Subcommittee on Accreditation continued to develop new procedures during 
the reporting period. For the two sessions in March and November 2009, the Subcommittee 
received information from civil society and shared it with the relevant NHRIs, requesting 
them to provide comments, if any, for the Subcommittee&#8217;s consideration. Summaries of all 
documentations are prepared by the secretariat and shared with the relevant NHRIs prior to 
the review of the NHRI applications by the Subcommittee. National institutions have one 
week to provide comments on these summaries. Subsequently, the summaries and 
comments are sent to the members of the Subcommittee, and are posted online 
(www.nhri.net) following the adoption of the recommendations of the Subcommittee by the 
International Coordinating Committee Bureau.  
</p>
<p>12. In 2009, the Subcommittee on Accreditation increased its efforts to engage regional 
coordinating committees in the accreditation process. The committees of all four regions 
have a standing invitation to participate, as observers, in the sessions of the Subcommittee. 
The Subcommittee welcomed the attendance at its March session of representatives of the 
secretariat of the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions, the secretariat of 
the Network of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights of 
the Americas and the Asia-Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions, as well as 
the attendance at its November 2009 session of the representative of the Asia-Pacific 
Forum.  
</p>
<p>13. At the 14th annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Forum held in Amman, from 3 to 6 
August 2009, hosted by the National Centre for Human Rights of Jordan with OHCHR 
assistance, NHRIs from the Asia-Pacific region decided to suspend the existing Forum 
accreditation process and use the International Coordinating Committee accreditation for 
the purpose of Forum membership. In the long term, such an approach will bring greater 
consistency and strength to the International Coordinating Committee accreditation process.  
</p>
<p>14. In 2009, the Subcommittee on Accreditation started to develop informal cooperation 
with the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment on matters of common interest, including cases where </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10278 
</p>
<p>NHRIs are designated as national preventive mechanisms under the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Prevention of Torture.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. General observations 
</b>15. Following the practice initiated at its meeting in October 2006, the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation continued to develop general observations concerning accreditation. The 
general observations have been formulated on common or important interpretative issues 
regarding the Paris Principles and are intended to constitute guidance for members on the 
process for accreditation and on the implementation of the Paris Principles. As highlighted 
in the decision paper adopted by the International Coordinating Committee at its twentieth 
session, the general observations, as interpretive tools of the Paris Principles, may be used 
to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Instruct institutions when they are developing their own processes and 
mechanisms, to ensure compliance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p> (b) Persuade domestic governments to address or remedy issues relating to an 
institution&#8217;s compliance with the standards articulated in the general observations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Guide the Subcommittee on Accreditation in its determination of new 
accreditation applications, re-accreditation applications or special reviews. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>16. <b>The Secretary-General acknowledges that the accreditation process carried out 
by the Subcommittee on Accreditation of the International Coordinating Committee, 
with the support of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, is a 
dynamic process, and expresses appreciation for its increasing rigorousness, fairness 
and transparency. The Secretary-General also stresses the importance of this process 
in strengthening the independence and effectiveness of national human rights 
institutions which, ultimately, will result in strengthening the national human rights 
protection system. 
</b></p>
<p>17. <b>The Secretary-General notes that following the suspension of the Asia-Pacific 
Forum&#8217;s separate accreditation process, the accreditation rules of the International 
Coordinating Committee for membership currently apply universally to all NHRIs. 
The Secretary-General appreciates that this brings greater consistency in the 
accreditation process and ensures uniformity in the accreditation system. 
</b></p>
<p>18. <b>The Secretary-General notes with satisfaction that the number of NHRIs 
accredited continues to rise and that all A-status institutions have now been reviewed, 
and notes that a new cycle will commence in 2010. The Secretary-General also 
welcomes the policy of periodically revising all B-status institutions as well, to 
encourage and assist them in enhancing their compliance with the international 
standards. The Secretary-General appreciates that the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation&#8217;s rigorous process is intended to give NHRIs support for petitioning 
their respective Governments for any needed statutory changes; while special review 
is meant to give an NHRI the chance to improve its performance in line with the Paris 
Principles.  
</b></p>
<p>19. <b>The Secretary-General acknowledges the increased participation of informed 
stakeholders in the process, such as the regional coordinating bodies of NHRIs as 
observers, as well as the growing interest of civil society organizations. This can </b></p>


<p>GE.10-10278 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute to greater effectiveness of NHRIs in their daily work, as well as to a more 
comprehensive approach to human rights protection at the national level.</b> 
</p>
<p>20. <b>The Secretary-General also appreciates the tailored and time-bound 
recommendations issued as the result of reviews of NHRI applications for 
accreditation. The Secretary-General calls upon States and other stakeholders, 
including United Nations agencies, to join efforts and follow up on the Subcommittee 
on Accreditation&#8217;s recommendations so that NHRIs fully comply with the Paris 
Principles, both in law and in practice. </b> 
</p>
<p>21. <b>The Secretary-General welcomes the development of general observations by 
the International Coordinating Committee, serving as an additional and progressive 
interpretative tool of the Paris Principles. The Secretary-General particularly 
welcomes the general observation on the interaction between NHRIs and the 
international human rights system and encourages this interaction to be strengthened 
in order to ensure greater harmonization between the international and national 
human rights systems. 
</b></p>
<p>22. <b>The Secretary-General welcomes the active participation of NHRIs in the 
regional consultations organized by OHCHR together with the African Union, the 
Organization of American States and the Council of Europe on enhancing cooperation 
between regional and international human rights mechanisms in 2009, and calls on 
NHRIs to redouble their efforts in enhancing cooperation and dialogue with regional 
human rights mechanisms and in follow-up to the latter&#8217;s recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>The Secretary-General welcomes the continuing work of the regional networks 
of NHRIs in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, and Europe and encourages 
greater cooperation between the regional networks and OHCHR. The Secretary-
General particularly welcomes the plan to develop a multi-year cooperation 
framework between OHCHR and the Asia-Pacific Forum, in support to NHRIs in the 
region. 
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>The Secretary-General notes that NHRIs accredited by the International 
Coordinating Committee garner greater recognition from, and access to, a growing 
list of international human rights mechanisms, including special procedures, treaty 
bodies and the Human Rights Council.</b> </p>

<p><b>  International Coordinating Committee of National 
Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report and recommendations of the session of the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation 
</b></p>
<p>  Geneva, 26&#8211;30 March 2009 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Background 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.1.</b> In accordance with the Statute of the International Coordinating Committee of 
National Institutions for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights (ICC), the Sub-
Committee on Accreditation (the Sub-Committee) has the mandate to consider and review 
applications for accreditation, re-accreditation and special or other reviews received by the 
National Institutions Unit of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) in its capacity as the ICC Secretariat, and to make 
recommendations to the ICC Bureau members with regard to the compliance of applicant 
institutions with the Paris Principles. The Sub-Committee assesses compliance with the 
Paris Principles in law and in practice.  
</p>
<p><b>1.2.</b> In accordance with the Sub-Committee Rules of Procedure, the Sub-Committee is 
composed of representatives of each region: the National Human Rights Institutions 
(NHRIs) of Germany for Europe (chair), Rwanda for Africa (represented by Morocco when 
absent), the Republic of Korea for Asia-Pacific and Canada for the Americas. The Sub-
Committee convened from 26 to 30 March 2009. OHCHR participated as a permanent 
observer and in its capacity as ICC Secretariat. In accordance with new procedures, 
regional coordinating bodies of NHRIs were invited to attend as observers. The Sub-
Committee welcomed the participation, as observers, of a representative of the Secretariat 
of the Network of African NHRIs, as well as the Chairperson of that Network, and 
representatives of the Secretariat of the Network of NHRIs of the Americas and the Asia 
Pacific Forum of NHRIs. 
</p>
<p><b>1.3.</b> The Sub-Committee notes the procedures for its work as set out in the ICC Statute 
adopted on 30 July 2008, as amended on 21 October 2008, and further amended on 24 
March 2009 (attached as Annex 1). The Sub-Committee applied these new procedures to its 
work in the current session, as set out below. 
</p>
<p><b>1.4.</b> Pursuant to article 10 of the Statute, the Sub-Committee considered applications for 
accreditation from NHRIs of Qatar, Sri Lanka, Switzerland (<i>Commission F&#233;d&#233;rale pour les 
Qu&#233;stions F&#233;minines</i>) and Ukraine. 
<b>1.5.</b> Pursuant to article 15 of the Statute, the Sub-Committee also considered an 
application for re-accreditation from the institution of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
</p>
<p><b>1.6.</b> Pursuant to article 17 of the Statute, the Sub-Committee reviewed certain issues 
regarding the NHRIs of Algeria, Ecuador, Luxembourg and Malaysia. 
</p>
<p><b>1.7.</b> In accordance with the Paris Principles and the ICC Sub-Committee Rules of 
Procedure, the different classifications for accreditation used by the Sub-Committee are: 
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: Compliance with the Paris Principles; </p>


<p>GE.10-10278 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>B</b>: Observer status &#8211; Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or 
insufficient information provided to make a determination; 
</p>
<p><b>C</b>: Non-compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p><b>1.8.</b> The General Observations (attached as Annex 2), as interpretative tools of the Paris 
Principles, may be used to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Instruct institutions when they are developing their own processes and 
mechanisms, to ensure Paris Principles compliance; 
</p>
<p> (b) Persuade domestic governments to address or remedy issues relating to an 
institution&#8217;s compliance with the standards articulated in the General Observations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Guide the Sub-Committee on Accreditation in its determination of new 
accreditation applications, re-accreditation applications or other review: 
</p>
<p> (i) If an institution falls substantially short of the standards articulated in the 
General Observations, it will be open for the Sub-Committee to find that it was not 
Paris Principle compliant; 
</p>
<p> (ii) If the Sub-Committee has noted concern about an institution&#8217;s compliance 
with any of the General Observations, it may consider what steps, if any, have been 
taken by an institution to address those concerns in future applications. If the Sub-
Committee is not provided with proof of efforts to address the General Observations 
previously made, or offered a reasonable explanation why no efforts had been made, 
it would be open to the Sub-Committee to interpret such lack of progress as non-
compliance with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>1.9.</b> The Sub-Committee formulated a new General Observation (attached as Annex 3).  
<b>1.10.</b> The Sub-Committee notes that when specific issues are raised in its report in relation 
to accreditation, re-accreditation and other review, NHRIs are required to address these 
issues in any subsequent application or other review.  
</p>
<p><b>1.11.</b> The Sub-Committee encourages all accredited NHRIs to inform the ICC Bureau at 
the first available opportunity about circumstances that would negatively affect their ability 
to meet the standards and obligations of the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>1.12.</b> When the Sub-Committee declares its intention to consider particular issues within a 
specified time-frame, the outcome of the review may lead to a recommendation that may 
affect the accreditation status. In the event additional issues arise during the course of the 
review, the Sub-Committee will so notify the NHRI.  
</p>
<p><b>1.13.</b> Pursuant to Article 12 of the Statute, where the Sub-Committee on Accreditation 
comes to an accreditation recommendation, it shall forward that recommendation to the 
ICC Bureau whose final decision is subject to the following process: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The recommendation of the Sub-Committee shall first be forwarded to the applicant. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An applicant can challenge a recommendation by submitting a written challenge to 
the ICC Chairperson, through the ICC Secretariat, within twenty eight (28) days of 
receipt. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Thereafter the recommendation will be forwarded to the members of the ICC Bureau 
for decision. If a challenge has been received from the applicant, the challenge 
together with all relevant material received in connection with both the application 
and the challenge will also be forwarded to the members of the ICC Bureau. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Any member of the ICC Bureau who disagrees with the recommendation shall, 
within twenty (20) days of its receipt, notify the Chair of the Sub-Committee and the </p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.10-10278 
</p>
<p>ICC Secretariat. The ICC Secretariat will promptly notify all ICC Bureau members 
of the objection raised and will provide all necessary information to clarify that 
objection. If within twenty (20) days of receipt of this information at least four 
members of the ICC Bureau coming from not less than two regional groups notify 
the ICC Secretariat that they hold a similar objection, the recommendation shall be 
referred to the next ICC Bureau meeting for decision. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; If at least four members coming from two or more regional groups do not raise 
objection to the recommendation within twenty (20) days of its receipt, the 
recommendation shall be deemed to be approved by the ICC Bureau. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The decision of the ICC Bureau on accreditation is final. 
</p>
<p><b>1.14.</b> As provided for in the Statute, in cases where the Sub-Committee considers a 
recommendation that would serve to remove accredited status from an applicant institution, 
the applicant institution is informed of this intention and given the opportunity to provide in 
writing, within one year of such notice, the documentary evidence deemed necessary to 
establish its continued conformity with the Paris Principles. The concerned institution 
retains its &#8220;A&#8221; status during this period.  
</p>
<p><b>1.15.</b> The Sub-Committee continued to consult with concerned NHRIs, where necessary, 
during its session. Prior to the session, all concerned NHRIs were requested to provide a 
name and phone number in case the Sub-Committee needed to contact the Institution. In 
addition, OHCHR desk officers and, as appropriate, OHCHR field officers were available 
to provide further information, as needed. 
</p>
<p><b>1.16.</b> The Sub-Committee acknowledges the high degree of support and professionalism 
of the staff of the ICC Secretariat (OHCHR National Institutions Unit).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Implementation of new procedures 
</b></p>
<p><b>2.1.</b> The Sub-Committee continued to develop its procedures in the ongoing effort to 
advance the principles of rigour, transparency, and fairness in the accreditation process. 
</p>
<p><b>2.2.</b> As initiated at the November 2008 session of the Sub-Committee, the March 2009 
session was open to NHRI regional coordinating committees to attend as observers. All 
four committees were invited to participate. A representative of, the Secretariat of the 
Network of African NHRIs, the Secretariat of the Network of NHRIs of the Americas and 
the Asia Pacific Forum of NHRIs attended the session. The Sub-Committee encourages the 
participation of all regional coordinating committees in future sessions.  
</p>
<p><b>2.3.</b> The Sub-Committee shared the summaries prepared by the Secretariat with the 
concerned NHRIs before the consideration of their applications and they were given one 
week to comment on them. All comments received, together with the summaries, were then 
sent to the members of the Sub-Committee. Once the recommendations of the Sub-
Committee are adopted by the ICC Bureau, according to the procedures, the summaries and 
the comments and the statement of compliance will be posted on the NHRI Forum 
(www.nhri.net). The summaries are currently only prepared in English, due to current 
financial constraints. 
</p>
<p><b>2.4.</b> The Sub-Committee considered information received from civil society. The Sub-
Committee shared that information with the concerned NHRIs and considered their 
responses.  
</p>
<p><b>2.5.</b> The Sub-Committee amended paragraph 3.6 (new), 4.2 and 6.1 of its Rules of 
Procedure as well as its General Observations 6.3 and 6.6, in keeping with the ICC Statute </p>


<p>GE.10-10278 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>and its current procedures. The Sub-Committee<b> recommends </b>that the ICC Bureau approve 
the amendments to the Rules of Procedure and General Observations. 
</p>
<p><b>2.6.</b> The Sub-Committee considered the issue of re-accreditation of status B NHRIs and 
<b>recommends </b>that all NHRIs that hold B status be subject to re-accreditation on a 5 year 
cyclical basis. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Specific recommendations &#8211; accreditation applications 
</b></p>
<p><b>3.1.</b> <b>Qatar: National Human Rights Committee (NHRC)</b> 
<b>Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the NHRC be accredited with 
<b>status A</b>. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee expresses appreciation for the work done by the NHRC, as well 
as the inclusion of non-citizens under its mandate, especially given the national 
circumstances and societal composition.  
</p>
<p> It expresses appreciation for the legislative changes that have increased the number 
of civil society representatives on the NHRC, their majority status on the NHRC and the 
removal of voting rights for Government representatives.  
</p>
<p> It also expresses appreciation for the regular increase in funding for the NHRC and 
that the NHRC has management and control over the use of those funds. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee (&#8220;SCA&#8221;) notes the following: 
&#8226; While the NHRC considers and proposes new members, the existing legislative 
</p>
<p>process refers to the selection of new members by the Emir. The existing legislation 
should establish a clear, transparent and pluralistic nomination process. The SCA 
refers to General Observation 2.1 &#8220;Ensuring pluralism&#8221; and General Observation 2.2 
&#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing body&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There is no legislative provision guaranteeing the immunity of NHRC members for 
actions undertaken in their official capacity. The SCA refers to General Observation 
2.5 &#8220;Immunity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Financial security and autonomy through the creation of an individual entry in the 
budget which is solely attributed to the NHRC is not ensured. The SCA refers to 
General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate Funding&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There is no legislative provision for the dismissal of NHRC members. The SCA 
refers to General Observation 2.9 &#8220;Guarantee of tenure for members of governing 
bodies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The SCA encourages the NHRC to monitor developments in the international 
human rights system and to use such developments to inform and develop their 
domestic activities where applicable. Furthermore, and where relevant, the SCA 
encourages the NHRC to interact directly with the international human rights system 
(UN Human Rights Treaty Bodies, Special Procedures Mandate Holders and Human 
Rights Council, including the UPR), providing information independently of the 
Government and ensuring follow up action to recommendations resulting from that 
system. It refers to General Observation 1.4 &#8220;Interaction with the International 
Human Rights System&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> <b>The Sub-Committee will consider these issues at its first session of 2010. </b>The 
Sub-Committee encourages the NHRC to seek advice and assistance from OHCHR and the 
regional network of NHRIs. </p>


<p><b>20</b> GE.10-10278 
</p>
<p><b>3.2.</b> <b>Sri Lanka: Human Rights Commission (SLHRC)</b> 
<b>Recommendation</b>: After reviewing the information provided by the SLHRC, the Sub-
Committee recommends that its <b>B Status</b> be maintained. It encourages the SLHRC to 
submit a complete accreditation application for a future session. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee (&#8220;SCA&#8221;) notes the following: 
&#8226; It observes that new SLHRC members are due to be appointed in April 2009. While 
</p>
<p>recognising that the Constitutional Council may not be constituted at this time to 
make recommendations on appointments as provided for in the SLHRC&#8217;s 
legislation, the SCA nevertheless stresses the need for a transparent and consultative 
selection process in practice. The SCA strongly encourages the SLHRC to engage 
with the government to ensure the adoption of such a process. The SCA refers to 
General Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and Appointment of the Governing Body&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It expresses its concern that the SLHRC does not appear to have released regular and 
detailed reports or statements in relation to killings, abductions and disappearances 
stemming from the human rights crisis in Sri Lanka. While the SCA acknowledges 
the work of the SLHRC&#8217;s regional offices in extremely difficult circumstances, it 
reemphasises the need for the SLHRC to carry out its core protection mandate to 
demonstrate its vigilance and independence during the ongoing state of emergency. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It commends the SLHRC on its concrete efforts to implement a regular consultation 
mechanism with civil society organisations in line with the ICC recommendation on 
the same. However, the SCA notes that consultation so far has been described as 
selective. The SCA emphasises that engagement with civil society must be broad 
based, to ensure the pluralistic representation of social forces as required by the 
Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It welcomes the publication of the 2006&#8211;07 Annual Report in line with the ICC 
recommendation on the same, but notes that the report provides insufficient 
information to assess the ongoing work of the SLHRC and appears to be only 
available in English. The SCA refers to General Observation 6.7 &#8220;NHRI Annual 
Report&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It further notes that the Tamil and Sinhala sections of the SLHRC website are not 
functioning. The SCA highlights the importance of ensuring that the SLHRC is 
accessible to all groups in society.  
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee encourages the SLHRC to seek advice and assistance from 
OHCHR and the regional network of NHRIs. 
</p>
<p><b>3.3. Switzerland: Commission f&#233;d&#233;rale pour les questions f&#233;minines (CFQF) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the CFQF be accredited with 
<b>status C</b>.  
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee (&#8220;SCA&#8221;) notes: 
&#8226; The mandate of the CFQF largely focuses on research and investigation of the status 
</p>
<p>of women&#8217;s rights in Switzerland. It refers to General Observation 1.2 &#8220;Human 
Rights mandate&#8221; and stresses the importance that NHRIs be endowed with a broad 
human rights mandate. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Appointment of members is largely done based on nominations from Government 
authorities and social organizations. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.2 
&#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing body&#8221; and emphasizes the importance 
that the selection and appointment process involves; a transparent process; broad 
consultation through the selection and appointment process; advertising vacancies </p>

</b></p>
<p>broadly; maximizing the number of potential candidates from a wide range of 
societal groups; and selecting members to serve in their own individual capacity 
rather than on behalf of the organization they represent. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Nine of the 20 members of the CFQF are appointees from the Swiss Government. 
The SCA refers to General Observation 2.3 &#8220;Government representatives on 
National Institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Members of the CFQF do not enjoy immunity for actions undertaken in their official 
capacity. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.5 &#8220;Immunity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The CFCQ receives an annual credit from the Government to support its activities. 
The SCA refers to General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate Funding&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There is no provision in the legislation nor in the institution&#8217;s internal regulations 
stipulating salaries or any form of remuneration for CFQF&#8217;s members. The SCA 
refers to General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate Funding&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; None of the members of the CFQF functions on a full-time basis. The SCA refers to 
General Observation 2.8 &#8220;Full-Time Members&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There are no written procedures governing dismissal of members of the Institution, 
nor are there any written procedures to govern resignation of members. The SCA 
refers to General Observation 2.9 &#8220;Guarantee of Tenure for Members of Governing 
Bodies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The CFQF must seek prior approval of the Swiss Federal Department of the Interior 
prior to publishing its communications, reports, recommendations, and propositions. 
The SCA recalls that the Paris Principles proscribe that NHRIs should be able to 
exercise its mandate in an independent manner. 
</p>
<p><b>3.4. Ukraine: Office of the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights 
(UPCHR) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the UPCHR be accredited with 
<b>status A</b>. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee (&#8220;SCA&#8221;) notes the following: 
&#8226; The mandate of the UPCHR refers to the parliamentary control over constitutional 
</p>
<p>human and citizens&#8217; rights and freedoms and to the protection of every individual&#8217;s 
rights within the jurisdiction of Ukraine. The SCA refers to General Observation 1.2 
&#8220;Human Rights mandate&#8221; and stresses that NHRIs should be mandated with specific 
functions to both protect and promote human rights, such as those listed in the Paris 
Principles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Civil society and other groups are not involved in the appointments process. The 
SCA refers to General Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing 
body&#8221; and stresses that this process should include a transparent process, broad 
consultation throughout the selection and appointment process, advertising 
vacancies broadly, and maximizing the number of potential candidates from a wide 
range of societal groups. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The importance of financial independence, both in terms of budget submissions, as 
well as sufficient funding. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate

control which might affect its independence. </p>

<p><b> 4. Specific recommendations &#8211; re-accreditation application 
</b></p>
<p><b>4.1. Palestine: Palestine Independent Commission for Human Rights (PICHR) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the PICHR be accredited with 
<b>status A</b>. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee expresses appreciation for the work of the PICHR, noting that it 
operates effectively and efficiently in a context of extreme insecurity and a difficult 
humanitarian situation. PICHR has conducted itself with a heightened level of vigilance and 
independence in the exercise of its mandate.  
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee (&#8220;SCA&#8221;) notes the following: 
&#8226; While acknowledging the specific circumstances regarding the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Authority, the Sub-Committee encourages the PICHR to continue to engage with the 
Palestinian Authority to formalize its status through the adoption of an enabling law. 
The SCA refers to General Observation 1.1 &#8220;Establishment of national institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Neither the Presidential Decree nor the by-laws contain a definition of human rights. 
The SCA refers to General Observation 1.2 &#8220;Human Rights mandate&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The by-laws do not provide guarantees of tenure for members of the governing 
body, nor do they contain provisions setting out a dismissal procedure for Board 
members. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.9 &#8220;Guarantee of tenure for 
members of governing bodies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The budget of the PICHR is nearly totally funded through international donor 
funding. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate Funding&#8221;, in 
particular that funding from external sources should not compose the core funding of 
the NHRIs. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee notes that Palestine has received a standing invitation to 
participate as an observer in the sessions and the work of the UN General Assembly and 
maintains a permanent observer mission at the UN Headquarters.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Specific recommendations &#8211; reviews under article 17 
</b></p>
<p><b>5.1. Algeria: Commission Nationale Consultative de Promotion et de Protection des 
Droits de l&#8217;Homme (CNCPPDH) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the CNCPPDH be accredited 
with status B. It takes note of a letter dated 25 March 2009 from the CNCPPDH President 
to the ICC Chair informing that the Prime Minister has instructed the Minister of Justice to 
elaborate a legislative text on the status of the CNCPPDH. This text is to be submitted to 
Parliament at its spring session 2009.  
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee (&#8220;SCA&#8221;) notes the following: 
&#8226; It expresses appreciation that the CNCPPDH provided the Secretariat with the 
</p>
<p>Annual Human Rights Report 2007, following the April 2008 Sub-Committee&#8217;s 
recommendation on the same. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It reiterates its concern that the CNCPPDH is established by a Presidential decree, 
which is an act of the executive, rather than a constitutional or legislative text as 
called for in the Paris Principles and General Observation 1.1 &#8220;Establishment of 
national institutions&#8221;. </p>


<p>GE.10-10278 <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; No additional information was provided by the CNCPPDH on follow up action on 
the remaining April 2008 recommendations, despite having been reminded to do so 
by the Secretariat through a communication dated 12 January 2009. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Chair and the members of the CNCPPDH are appointed and dismissed without 
a clear and transparent process. The SCA has not been informed of plans to establish 
these processes, following its April 2008 recommendation on the same. The SCA 
refers to General Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing 
body&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It reiterates the need for the CNCPPDH to interact effectively and independently 
with the United Nations Human Rights System. The SCA refers to General 
Observation 1.4 &#8220;Interaction with the International Human Rights System&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee urges the CNCPPDH to apply for accreditation once the 
legislation has been enacted and the issues above appropriately addressed. The Sub-
Committee encourages the CNCPPDH to seek advice and assistance from OHCHR and the 
regional network of NHRIs. 
</p>
<p><b>5.2. Ecuador: Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo de Ecuador (DPE) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends that the <b>status A</b> be maintained. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee is satisfied that the revisions to the Constitution of Ecuador did 
not negatively affect the independence and effectiveness of the DPE. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee (&#8220;SCA&#8221;) notes the following: 
&#8226; It recommends that amendments to the organic law resolve discrepancies (e.g. term 
</p>
<p>of office) between the revised Constitution and the current organic law and be in line 
with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The <i>Consejo de Participaci&#243;n Ciudadana y Control Social</i> is in charge of the 
appointment of the <i>Defensor</i>. The SCA calls on the <i>Defensor </i>to ensure the <i>Consejo</i> 
is aware of and encourages the incorporation of relevant Paris Principles 
requirements in future selection processes. The SCA refers to General Observation 
2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing body&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It reiterates the need for the <i>Defensor&#237;a</i> to interact effectively with the United

</p>
<p><b>5.3. Luxembourg: Commission Consultative des Droits de l&#8217;Homme of Luxembourg

<b>deferred</b> to its next session. It gives the CCDH the opportunity to provide, in writing, 
within the one year period expiring November 2009, the documentary evidence deemed 
necessary to establish its continued conformity with the Paris Principles. The CCDH 
<b>retains its &#8220;A status&#8221;</b> during this period. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee welcomes the additional information provided by the CCDH 
following its November 2008 review and acknowledges that efforts are being made to 
address most of the concerns expressed by it.  
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee welcomes the Government&#8217;s expressed intention to establish a 
Special Nominations Committee composed of representatives of civil society and/or human 
rights institutions that would advise on the designation of the members of the CCDH. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee (&#8220;SCA&#8221;) notes the following: </p>


<p><b>24</b> GE.10-10278 
</p>
<p>&#8226; While the CCDH is composed of members coming from different political, 
ideological and religious backgrounds, neither the 2000 Regulations nor the Draft 
Law provides any legal requirements to ensure the pluralism of the institution&#8217;s 
membership and staff composition. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.1 
&#8220;Ensuring pluralism&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The CCDH is developing an internal regulatory document dealing with appointment 
and dismissal of members. The SCA recommends that selection, appointment and 
grounds for dismissal be in accordance with the Paris Principles. The SCA refers to 
General Observations 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing body&#8221; and 
2.9 &#8220;Guarantees of tenure for members of governing bodies&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; None of the CCDH&#8217;s members occupies a permanent full-time position. The SCA 
refers to General Observation 2.8 &#8220;Full-time Members&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There is indication that the CCDH exercises only limited budgetary autonomy and 
that the budget may not be sufficient for the CCDH to carry out a protection function 
in conformity with the Paris Principles. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.6 
&#8220;Adequate funding&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Draft Law does not provide CCDH members with functional immunity. The 
SCA refers to General Observation 2.5 &#8220;Immunity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It recommends that the CCDH further develop relationships with civil society. The 
SCA refers to General Observation 1.5 &#8220;Cooperation with other human rights 
institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>5.4. Malaysia: National Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) 
Recommendation</b>: The Sub-Committee recommends, pursuant to Article 16.3 of the ICC 
Statute, that consideration of SUHAKAM be <b>deferred</b> to its next session. SUHAKAM 
<b>retains its &#8220;A status&#8221;</b> during this period. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee welcomes the entry of the Bill to Parliament (i.e. amendment to 
the 1999 Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act), which was passed by the House of 
Representatives on 25 March 2009 and is currently before the Senate. It notes that some of 
the concerns it raised at its April 2008 session have been addressed (e.g. the expansion of 
the term of office to 3 years renewable). 
 However, the Sub-Committee (&#8220;SCA&#8221;) notes that the legislation is not yet finalised 
and that not all the issues it raised at its April 2008 Session have been addressed in the 
amended legislation, namely the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Although the appointment process has been strengthened by the recent legislative 
amendments, the SCA expresses its disappointment that the amendments do not 
make the process more transparent through a requirement for broad based 
participation in the nomination, review, and selection of Commissioners. The SCA 
notes that this process may be further strengthened through inclusion and 
participation of civil society. The SCA refers to its General Observations 2.1 
&#8220;Ensuring pluralism&#8221; and 2.2 &#8220;Selection and Appointment of the Governing Body&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The SCA expresses its concern with regard to the inclusion of performance 
indicators, as established by the Prime Minister, used in relation to re-appointment 
or dismissal decisions. While acknowledging the value of such indicators in making 
clear the expectations of Commissioners, it stresses that such requirements must be 
clearly established; appropriately circumscribed, so as not to interfere in the 
independence of members; and made public. The SCA refers to its General 
Observation 2.9 &#8220;Guarantee of tenure for members of governing bodies&#8221;. </p>


<p>GE.10-10278 <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; While acknowledging SUHAKAM&#8217;s interaction with the International Human 
Rights System, in accordance with its General Observation 1.4 &#8220;Interaction with the 
International Human Rights System&#8221;, the SCA stresses the need for SUHAKAM to 
continue to promote ratification and implementation of international human rights 
instruments. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee will consider whether these issues have been dealt with through 
further amendments to the pending legislation or through regulatory or administrative 
mechanisms, which are clear, transparent and participatory.  </p>

<p><b>  International Coordinating Committee of National 
Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report and recommendations of the session of the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation  
</b></p>
<p>  Geneva, 16&#8211;18 November 2009 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Background 
</b></p>
<p><b>6.1.</b> In accordance with the Statute (attached as Annex I) of the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Protection and Promotion of 
Human Rights (ICC), the Subcommittee on Accreditation (SCA) has the mandate to 
consider and review applications for accreditation, re-accreditation and special or other 
reviews received by the National Institutions and Regional Mechanisms Section (NIRMS) 
of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in its 
capacity as the ICC Secretariat, and to make recommendations to the ICC Bureau members 
with regard to the compliance of applicant institutions with the Paris Principles (attached as 
Annex 2). The SCA assesses compliance with the Paris Principles in law and in practice.  
<b>6.2.</b> In accordance with the SCA Rules of Procedure, the SCA is composed of 
representatives of each region: the National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) of Canada 
(Chair) for the Americas, Germany for Europe, Togo for Africa, and the Republic of Korea 
for Asia-Pacific.  
</p>
<p><b>6.3.</b> The SCA convened from 16 to 18 November 2009. OHCHR participated as a 
permanent observer and in its capacity as ICC Secretariat. In accordance with established 
procedures, regional coordinating bodies of NHRIs were invited to attend as observers. The 
SCA welcomed the participation of a representative of the Secretariat of the Asia Pacific 
Forum of NHRIs, and the ICC representative in Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b>6.4.</b> The SCA also welcomed as observers the participation of members of the 
Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture (SPT) during the consideration of the NHRI of 
the Republic of Moldova, and their contribution on the work of the NHRI as a National 
Preventive Mechanism (NPM). 
<b>6.5.</b> At the next session, the SCA will develop a General Observation to outline the 
criteria to be considered when dealing with NHRIs serving as NPMs or the national 
monitoring mechanism under article 33 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (CRPD). The SCA welcomes input and suggestions from ICC members and 
others on possible content of the General Observation. </p>


<p>GE.10-10278 <b>27 
</b></p>
<p><b>6.6.</b> The SCA notes receipt of the draft compilation of the SCA rules and working 
procedures as prepared by the Secretariat;2 and has requested the Secretariat, together with 
the Canadian NHRI, to consolidate it for SCA consideration at the next session. 
</p>
<p><b>6.7.</b> At the November 2009 ICC Bureau meeting, Bureau members made suggestions to 
improve the accreditation process, including the development and use of General 
Observations. After consideration and discussion of these recommendations, the SCA 
decided to embark on a review of the ICC General Observations.  
</p>
<p><b>6.8.</b> Pursuant to article 10 of the Statute, the SCA considered applications for 
accreditation from institutions of Mauritania, the Republic of Moldova, Scotland (United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) and Tunisia. 
<b>6.9.</b> Pursuant to article 15 of the Statute, the SCA also considered applications for re-
accreditation from the NHRIs of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Chad.  
</p>
<p><b>6.10.</b> Pursuant to article 17 of the Statute, the SCA reviewed certain issues regarding the 
NHRIs of Greece, Luxembourg, Malaysia, and Nepal. 
</p>
<p><b>6.11.</b> In accordance with the Paris Principles and the ICC SCA Rules of Procedure, the 
classifications for accreditation used by the SCA are: 
</p>
<p><b>A</b>: Compliance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p><b>B</b>: Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information 
provided to make a determination; 
</p>
<p><b>C</b>:  Non-compliance with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>6.12.</b> The General Observations (attached as Annex 3), as interpretative tools of the Paris 
Principles, may be used to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Instruct institutions when they are developing their own processes and 
mechanisms, to ensure Paris Principles compliance; 
</p>
<p> (b) Persuade domestic governments to address or remedy issues relating to an 
institution&#8217;s compliance with the standards articulated in the General Observations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Guide the SCA in its determination of new accreditation applications, re-
accreditation applications or other review: 
</p>
<p> (i) If an institution falls substantially short of the standards articulated in the 
General Observations, it will be open for the SCA to find that it was not Paris 
Principle compliant. 
</p>
<p> (ii) If the SCA has noted concern about an institution&#8217;s compliance with any of 
the General Observations, it may consider what steps, if any, have been taken by an 
institution to address those concerns in future applications. If the SCA is not 
provided with proof of efforts to address the General Observations previously made, 
or offered a reasonable explanation why no efforts had been made, it would be open 
to the SCA to interpret such lack of progress as non-compliance with the Paris 
Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>6.13.</b> The SCA also considered issues of concern regarding certain NHRIs. The SCA will 
follow up with the relevant institutions.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>2
 Including ICC Statute provisions on the SCA; Rules of Procedures of the SCA; new procedures 
</p>
<p>adopted by the SCA from October 2007 &#8211; November 2008; implementation of new procedures from 
the SCA report of March 2009; and procedural issues in the ICC General Observations as per March 
2009 SCA report. </p>


<p><b>28</b> GE.10-10278 
</p>
<p><b>6.14.</b> The SCA notes that when specific issues are raised in its report in relation to 
accreditation, re-accreditation and other review, NHRIs are required to address these issues 
in any subsequent application or other review.  
</p>
<p><b>6.15.</b> The SCA encourages all accredited NHRIs to inform the ICC Bureau at the first 
available opportunity about circumstances that would negatively affect their ability to meet 
the standards and obligations of the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b>6.16.</b> When the SCA declares its intention to consider particular issues within a specified 
time-frame, the outcome of the review may lead to a recommendation that may affect the 
accreditation status. In the event additional issues arise during the course of the review, the 
SCA will so notify the NHRI.  
</p>
<p><b>6.17.</b> Pursuant to Article 12 of the Statute, where the SCA comes to an accreditation 
recommendation, it shall forward that recommendation to the ICC Bureau whose final 
decision is subject to the following process: 
 (i) The recommendation of the SCA shall first be forwarded to the applicant; 
 (ii) An applicant can challenge a recommendation by submitting a written 
</p>
<p>challenge to the ICC Chairperson, through the ICC Secretariat, within twenty eight 
(28) days of receipt; 
</p>
<p> (iii) Thereafter the recommendation will be forwarded to the members of the ICC 
Bureau for decision. If a challenge has been received from the applicant, the 
challenge together with all relevant material received in connection with both the 
application and the challenge will also be forwarded to the members of the ICC 
Bureau;  
</p>
<p> (iv) Any member of the ICC Bureau who disagrees with the recommendation 
shall, within twenty (20) days of its receipt, notify the Chair of the SCA and the ICC 
Secretariat. The ICC Secretariat will promptly notify all ICC Bureau members of the 
objection raised and will provide all necessary information to clarify that objection. 
If within twenty (20) days of receipt of this information at least four members of the 
ICC Bureau coming from not less than two regional groups notify the ICC 
Secretariat that they hold a similar objection, the recommendation shall be referred 
to the next ICC Bureau meeting for decision;  
</p>
<p> (v) If at least four members coming from two or more regional groups do not 
raise objection to the recommendation within twenty (20) days of its receipt, the 
recommendation shall be deemed to be approved by the ICC Bureau; 
</p>
<p> (vi) The decision of the ICC Bureau on accreditation is final. 
<b>6.18.</b> Pursuant to Article 18 of the Statute, in cases where the SCA considers a 
recommendation that would serve to remove accredited status from an applicant institution, 
the applicant institution is informed of this intention and given the opportunity to provide in 
writing, within one year of such notice, the documentary evidence deemed necessary to 
establish its continued conformity with the Paris Principles. The concerned institution 
retains its &#8220;A&#8221; status during this period.  
</p>
<p><b>6.19.</b> The SCA continued to consult with concerned NHRIs, where necessary, during its 
session. Prior to the session, all concerned NHRIs were requested to provide a name and 
phone number in case the SCA needed to contact the Institution. In addition, OHCHR desk 
officers and, as appropriate, OHCHR field officers were available to provide further 
information, as needed. 
</p>
<p><b>6.20.</b> The SCA acknowledges the high degree of support and professionalism of the staff 
of the ICC Secretariat (OHCHR National Institutions and Regional Mechanisms Section).  </p>


<p>GE.10-10278 <b>29 
</b></p>
<p><b>6.21.</b> The SCA shared the summaries prepared by the Secretariat with the concerned 
NHRIs before the consideration of their applications and they provided comments on them 
in one week. All comments received, together with the summaries, were then sent to the 
members of the SCA. As in previous cases, once the recommendations of the SCA are 
adopted by the ICC Bureau, the summaries and the comments and the statement of 
compliance will be posted on the NHRI Forum (www.nhri.net). The summaries are only 
prepared in English, due to financial constraints. 
</p>
<p><b>6.22.</b> The SCA considered information received from civil society. The SCA shared that 
information with the concerned NHRIs and considered their responses.

</b></p>
<p><b>7.1.</b> <b>Mauritania: Commission National des Droits de l&#8217;Homme (NHRC)</b> 
<b>Recommendation</b>: The SCA recommends that the NHRC be accredited with <b>B status</b>. 
</p>
<p> The SCA expresses its appreciation for the work done by the NHRC in the 
promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p> The SCA takes note that the enabling legislation of the NHRC is currently being 
reviewed. 
</p>
<p> The SCA notes the following: 
</p>
<p> 1. The NHRC is established by an Executive Order. The Paris Principles and 
the ICC General Observations indicate that an NHRI must be established in a 
constitutional or legal text, given that creation by an instrument of the Executive is 
not adequate to ensure permanency and independence. The SCA refers to General 
Observation 1.1 &#8220;Establishment of national institutions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 2. The NHRC is placed under the Office of the Prime Minister (article 1 of the 
Executive Order) and it reports annually to the Head of State (article 6 of the 
Executive Order). This does not guarantee the independence and autonomy of an 
NHRI. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.10 &#8220;Administrative regulation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 3. The selection and appointment process is not established in the Executive 
Order and is not transparent, consultative and pluralistic. The SCA refers to General 
Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing body&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 4. Article 27 of the Executive Order stipulates that the Government provides the 
NHRC with the necessary administrative staff. This impairs the ability of the NHRC 
to hire its own staff. The Secretary General is appointed by the President of the 
Republic. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.4 &#8220;Staffing by secondment&#8221; and 
2.7 &#8220;Staff of an NHRI&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 5. The budget of the NHRC is insufficient to allow it to effectively carry out its 
mandate. This includes the hiring of an adequate number of staff. The SCA refers to 
General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate Funding&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> The SCA will consider whether these issues have been effectively dealt with through 
amendments to the legislation. 
</p>
<p> The SCA also encourages the NHRC to continue to interact actively with the 
international human rights system (UN Human Rights Treaty Bodies, Special Procedures 
Mandate Holders and Human Rights Council, including the UPR), providing information 
independently of the Government and later ensuring follow up action to recommendations 
resulting from that system. </p>

<p><b>7.2.</b> <b>Republic of Moldova: Parliamentary Advocates &amp; Centre for Human Rights of 
Moldova (HRCM)</b> 
<b>Recommendation</b>: The SCA recommends that the HRCM be accredited with <b>B status</b>. 
</p>
<p> The SCA expresses its appreciation for the work done by the HRCM, carried out in 
difficult circumstances, especially due to the inadequacy of resources allocated to the 
institution that affects its capacity to effectively deliver its mandate.  
</p>
<p> The SCA notes the following:  
</p>
<p> 1. The selection and appointment process as enshrined in the law does not 
ensure all necessary guarantees of a transparent, consultative and pluralist process. 
Additionally, there is no provision to involve civil society in this process. The SCA 
refers to its General Observations 2.1 &#8220;Ensuring pluralism&#8221; and 2.2 &#8220;Selection and 
appointment of the governing body&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 2. The lack of adequate funding is a structural problem of the HRCM. Despite 
the significant efforts made by the institution, inadequate funding undermines the 
capacity of the HRCM to hire staff, make use of equipped premises and carry out 
activities. 
</p>
<p> 3. The HRCM should be equipped with adequate resources in order to ensure 
the gradual and progressive realization of the improvement of the organization&#8217;s 
operations and the fulfilment of its mandate. The HRCM budget should also have a 
separate budget line for the NPM function. The SCA refers the HRCM to the 
General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate Funding&#8221; in order to ensure its involvement in 
the budget process, and the sustainability of its financial, material and human 
resources. The attribution of additional powers and functions related to the work of 
NPM, which was not accompanied by any allocation of additional resources, can 
further affect the HRCM&#8217;s ability to function effectively. With regard to the 
HRCM&#8217;s role as the National Preventative Mechanism (NPM) under the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, the Subcommittee draws the attention 
of the HRCM to the SCA on the Prevention of Torture&#8217;s Preliminary Guidelines for 
the ongoing development of NPMs, and in particular sub-paragraph (g) which 
provides that &#8220;adequate resources should be provided for the specific work of 
national preventive mechanisms, in accordance with article 18.3 of the Optional 
Protocol; these should be ring-fenced, in terms of both budget and human 
resources&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 4. The enabling law provides the HRCM with both protection and promotion 
functions, and encourages the institution to interpret it in an extensive way which 
includes broad protection and promotion of all human rights, including through 
active cooperation with civil society.  
</p>
<p> 5. The HRCM is encouraged to continue its constructive engagement with the 
international human rights system and refers to General Observation 1.4 &#8220;Interaction 
with the International Human Rights System&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> The SCA requires further clarification on the role, functions, decision-making and 
budget allocations between the four Parliamentary Advocates and the Centre, and amongst 
the Parliamentary Advocates. 
</p>
<p> The SCA encourages the HRCM to seek the cooperation of the ICC, OHCHR and 
the regional coordinating group of NHRIs (European Group) in order to address the above 
mentioned matters.  </p>

<p><b>7.3. Scotland (United Kingdom): Scottish Human Rights Commission (SHRC) 
Recommendation</b>: The SCA recommends that consideration of the application for 
accreditation of the SHRC be <b>deferred</b> to its first session of 2010. 
</p>
<p> The SCA notes that the SHRC was established in December 2008 and has been 
operational for eleven months. The effectiveness of the SHRC and its compliance with the 
Paris Principles could not be determined in the present session. The SCA refers to General 
Observation 6.6 &#8220;More than one national human rights institution in a state&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>7.4. Tunisia: Comit&#233; Sup&#233;rieur des Droits de l&#8217;Homme et des Libert&#233;s 
Fondamentales (SCHRFF) 
Recommendation</b>: The SCA recommends that the SCHRFF be accredited with <b>B status</b>. 
</p>
<p> The SCA expresses its concern with the following:  
</p>
<p> 1. There are no provisions in the legislation setting out a transparent and 
pluralistic nomination process of members which include objective membership 
criteria. The ultimate appointment is done by the President of the Republic. The 
SCA refers to the Paris Principles regarding the appointment of the members of the 
national institution and to General Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of 
the governing body&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 2. There are no legislative provisions regarding the immunity of members for 
liability for actions undertaken in their official capacity, nor for the dismissal or 
removal process of a member. The SCA refers to General Observations 2.5 
&#8220;Immunity&#8221; and 2.9 &#8220;Guarantee of tenure for members of government bodies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 3. There are no provisions indicating whether members of the governing body 
are full or part time, however, Article 5 of the Rules of Organization states that the 
members are not remunerated but receive an allowance for each meeting they attend. 
The SCA refers to General Observation 2.8 &#8220;Full-time Members&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 4. The institution is required to submit all its reports to the President of the 
Republic. Pursuant to article 6 of the law the SCHRFF undertakes investigations 
upon request of the President of the Republic and reports the results of the 
investigations to the President. This provision is not consistent with the exercise of 
the protection function that an NHRI is to carry out in an independent and unfettered 
manner. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.10 &#8220;Administrative regulation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 5. The 2005 Annual Report on the human rights situation of Tunisia does not 
reflect the recent activities, conclusions and recommendations made by the 
SCHRFF. The SCA refers to General Observation 6.7 &#8220;NHRI annual report&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> The SCA encourages the SCHRFF to interact actively with the international human 
rights system (UN Human Rights Treaty Bodies, Special Procedures Mandate Holders and 
Human Rights Council, including the UPR), providing information independently of the 
government and later ensuring follow up action to recommendations resulting from that 
system. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Specific recommendations &#8211; re-accreditation applications 
</b></p>
<p><b>8.1. Bosnia and Herzegovina: Institution of Human Rights Ombudsmen for Bosnia 
and Herzegovina (IHROBH)</b> 
<b>Recommendation</b>: The SCA informs the IHROBH of <b>its intention to recommend the 
ICC Bureau that the IHROBH be accredited with status B</b>, and gives the Institution the 
opportunity to provide, in writing, within one year of such notice, the documentary </p>


<p><b>32</b> GE.10-10278 
</p>
<p>evidence deemed necessary to establish its continued conformity with the Paris Principles. 
The IHROBH retains its &#8220;A&#8221; status during this period.  
</p>
<p> The SCA expresses appreciation of the work of the IHROBH, noting that it operates 
in a situation where the merger of three distinct institutions is currently on-going, and the 
law has not yet been clarified.  
</p>
<p> The SCA notes the following: 
</p>
<p> 1. Civil society and other groups are not involved in the appointment process. 
The SCA refers to General Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the 
governing body&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 2. The importance of financial autonomy, both in terms of budget submissions 
and financial controls. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate 
funding&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 3. The Law on Salaries in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina has annulled the provision in 
the Law of the Human Rights Ombudsman that entitled members to a salary equal to 
that of a Constitutional Judge. This derogation may impact the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
independence.   
</p>
<p> 4. It commends the IHROBH on its concrete efforts to implement a regular 
consultation mechanism with civil society organisations. However, this cooperation 
should be formalised. The SCA also emphasises that engagement with civil society 
must be broad based, to ensure the pluralistic representation of social forces as 
required by the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p> 5. It recommends that the mandate of the IHROBH be strengthened to include 
human rights promotion and refers to General Observation 1.2 &#8220;Human rights 
mandate&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 6. In the absence of an Annual Report for 2008&#8211;2009, the SCA is not able to 
assess the activities implemented over the past year, and encourages the IHROBH to 
submit this in any future application for accreditation. The SCA refers to General 
Observation 6.7 on &#8220;NHRI Annual report&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 7. It reiterates the need for the IHROBH to interact effectively and 
independently with the International Human Rights System. The SCA refers to 
General Observation 1.4 &#8220;Interaction with the International Human Rights System&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> The SCA encourages the IHROBH to seek advice and assistance from OHCHR and 
the regional coordinating group of NHRIs (European Coordinating Committee). 
<b>8.2. Chad: Commission National des Droits de l&#8217;Homme (CNDH) 
Recommendation</b>: The SCA recommends that the CNDH be accredited with <b>B status</b>.  
</p>
<p> The SCA expresses its concerns with the following: 
</p>
<p> 1. The CNDH is dependent in law and practice on the Office of the Prime 
Minister. The SCA recalls that the Paris Principles prescribe that an NHRI should be 
able to exercise its mandate in an independent manner. 
</p>
<p> 2. The legal texts of the CNDH do not provide details on the selection and 
appointment process. All the members are appointed by the Prime Minister and the 
Government is heavily represented in the composition of the membership. The SCA 
refers to General Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the governing 
body&#8221;. </p>


<p>GE.10-10278 <b>33 
</b></p>
<p> 3. The representatives of the Government on the membership are granted voting 
rights. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.3 &#8220;Government representatives on 
National Institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 4. None of the members of the CNDH functions on a full-time basis. The SCA 
refers to General Observation 2.8 &#8220;Full time Members&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 5. The CNDH does not have capacity to recruit its own staff and depends on the 
will of the Office of the Prime Minister for this purpose. The SCA refers to General 
Observation 2.7 &#8220;Staff of an NHRI&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 6. The Office of the Prime Minister provides the CNDH with resources and 
necessary services for the performance of the CNDH functions. The SCA refers to 
General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate Funding&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Specific recommendations &#8211; reviews under article 17 of the ICC statute 
</b></p>
<p><b>9.1. Greece: Greece National Commission for Human Rights (GNCHR) 
Recommendation</b>: The SCA recommends that the <b>A status</b> be maintained.  
</p>
<p> The SCA expresses appreciation for the efforts undertaken by the GNCHR in 
advocating for ensuring adequate funding through provision of a separate budget line. 
While welcoming the developments achieved, the SCA stresses the importance of ensuring 
financial autonomy over the funds allocated to the GNCHR. The SCA refers to General 
Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate funding&#8221;, and requests the GNCHR to provide an update on 
developments on this matter at its first session of 2010.  
</p>
<p><b>9.2. Luxembourg: Commission Consultative des Droits de l&#8217;Homme of Luxembourg 
(CCDH) 
Recommendation</b>: The SCA recommends that the <b>A status</b> be maintained. 
</p>
<p> The SCA acknowledges the efforts undertaken by the CCDH to ensure that the 
concerns it had expressed were addressed. 
</p>
<p> The SCA notes the following:  
</p>
<p> 1. The dismissal process, as currently defined in the Law of 2008 conflicts with 
the Paris Principle of stable mandate of an institution and with General Observation 
2.9 &#8220;Guarantee of tenure for members of governing bodies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 2. The CCDH enabling law does not include provisions to ensure functional 
immunity of its members (i.e. protection from legal liability for actions undertaken 
in their official capacity of the NHRI). The SCA refers to General Observation 2.5 
&#8220;Immunity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 3. It is uncertain whether the budget allocations of the CCDH are such as to 
ensure, to a reasonable degree, the gradual and progressive realisation of the 
improvement of the organisation&#8217;s operations and the fulfilment of its mandate. The 
CCDH should be in a position to exercise autonomous/unfettered control over its 
budgetary allocation. The SCA refers to General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate 
funding&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> The SCA will review the above mentioned matters at its second session of 2010, and 
encourages the CCDH to seek advice and assistance from OHCHR and the regional 
coordinating group of NHRIs (European Coordinating Committee). </p>


<p><b>34</b> GE.10-10278 
</p>
<p><b>9.3. Malaysia: National Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) 
Recommendation</b>: The SCA recommends that the <b>A status</b> be maintained. 
</p>
<p> The SCA welcomes the passage of the two Human Rights Commission of Malaysia 
(Amendment) Acts of 2009, and expresses its appreciation for the constructive approach 
taken by SUHAKAM in pursuing both sets of amendments with the government.   
</p>
<p> The SCA notes, in particular, improvements to the legislation that, amongst other 
things: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Increases the term of office from two to three years 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Creates a selection committee that includes representation of members of civil 
society with knowledge of or experience in human rights 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Includes pluralism as an element in the selection of Commission members 
</p>
<p> The SCA notes, however, that these amendments may not, in practice, address all 
the concerns that were raised in previous sessions.   
</p>
<p> While the introduction of a selection committee has addressed in part the Paris 
Principles requirement for a clear, transparent and pluralist process for the selection of new 
members, the SCA notes that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The selection of civil society representatives on the committee is at the sole 
discretion of the Prime Minister; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Decisions of the selection committee are only recommendatory, since the Prime 
Minister is required to consult with, but is not bound to accept its decisions 
</p>
<p> The combination of these two factors leaves open the potential for political 
interference that may impact adversely on the transparency and participatory nature of the 
selection process. The SCA refers to Paris Principles B(1) and to its General Observations 
2.1 &#8220;Ensuring pluralism&#8221; and 2.2 &#8220;Selection and Appointment of the Governing Body&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> The SCA also notes the proposal to develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to 
be used in situations where a member is being considered for re-appointment, and in cases 
of dismissal. While acknowledging the value of such indicators in making clear the 
expectations placed on Commissioners, the SCA noted that the KPIs are yet to be adopted. 
It is therefore not in a position to assess whether the concerns expressed in the March 2009 
session &#8220;<i>that the KPI&#8217;s must be clearly established; appropriately circumscribed, so as not 
to interfere in the independence of members; and made public</i>&#8221; have been addressed. In this 
regard the SCA again refers to its General Observation 2.9 &#8220;Guarantee of tenure for 
members of governing bodies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> The SCA notes that both the new selection process and the KPI&#8217;s will be in effect 
for the selection of new or renewing members in April 2010. The SCA will therefore 
consider these issues at its second session in 2010.  
</p>
<p><b>9.4. Nepal: National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)  
Recommendation</b>: The SCA recommends that the consideration of the NHRC be deferred 
to its next session.  
</p>
<p> The SCA notes that there have been further delays in the drafting of the NHRC 
legislation, which has not been introduced into and adopted by the Parliament. The SCA is 
therefore not in a position to undertake a review at this time. 
</p>
<p> The SCA notes the ongoing drafting process and encourages the NHRC to engage 
with government to promote the development of legislation in full compliance with the 
Paris Principles. </p>


<p>GE.10-10278 <b>35 
</b></p>
<p> The SCA also reiterates comments raised in earlier reviews regarding the promotion 
of the NHRC mandate in practice, notably: 
</p>
<p> 1. It referred to General Observation 2.6 &#8220;Adequate funding&#8221;, in particular sub-
paragraphs b) and c) and that financial systems should be such that the NHRI has 
complete financial autonomy. 
</p>
<p> 2. It referred to General Observation 2.2 &#8220;Selection and appointment of the 
governing body&#8221;, in particular sub-paragraphs a), b) and d).  
</p>
<p> 3. It encouraged the NHRI to strengthen its interaction with civil society 
organisations. 
</p>
<p> 4. It referred to General Observation 1.4 &#8220;Interaction with the International 
Human Rights System&#8221;, in particular with regard to engagement with the United 
Nations Human Rights Treaty Bodies, the Human Rights Council and the ICC.  
</p>
<p> The SCA draws the NHRC&#8217;s attention to article 16.3 of the ICC Statute, which 
provides that &#8220;any review of the accreditation classification of a NHRI must be finalized 
within 18 months&#8221;.   
</p>
<p> The SCA will consider all of the above issues at its first session in 2010. </p>


<p><b>36</b> GE.10-10278 
</p>
<p><b>Annex IV 
</b></p>
<p><b>  International Coordinating Committee Subcommittee on 
Accreditation 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Competence and responsibilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.1.</b> <b>Establishment of national institutions</b>: An NHRI must be established in a 
constitutional or legal text. Creation by an instrument of the Executive is not adequate to 
ensure permanency and independence.  
</p>
<p><b>1.2.</b> <b>Human rights mandate</b>: All NHRIs should be mandated with specific functions to 
both<i> protect</i> and <i>promote</i> human rights, such as those listed in the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p><b>1.3.</b> <b>Encouraging ratification or accession to international human rights 
instruments</b>: The Sub-Committee interprets that the function of encouraging ratification or 
accession to international human rights instruments, set out in the Paris Principles, is a key 
function of a National Institution. The Sub-Committee therefore encourages the 
entrenchment of this function in the enabling legislation of the National Institution to 
ensure the best protection of human rights within that country. 
</p>
<p><b>1.4.</b> <b>Interaction with the International Human Rights System</b>: The Sub-Committee 
would like to highlight the importance for NHRIs to engage with the international human 
rights system, in particular the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms (Special 
Procedures Mandate Holders) and the United Nations Human Rights Treaty Bodies. This 
means generally NHRIs making an input to, participating in these human rights 
mechanisms and following up at the national level to the recommendations resulting from 
the international human rights system. In addition, NHRIs should also actively engage with 
the ICC and its Sub-Committee on Accreditation, Bureau as well as regional coordinating 
bodies of NHRIs. 
</p>
<p><b>1.5.</b> <b>Cooperation with other human rights institutions</b>: NHRIs should closely 
cooperate and share information with statutory institutions established also for the 
promotion and protection of human rights, for example at the state level or on thematic 
issues, as well as other organizations, such as NGOs, working in the field of human rights 
and should demonstrate that this occurs in their application to the ICC Sub-Committee. 
</p>
<p><b>1.6.</b> <b>Recommendations by NHRIs</b>: NHRI recommendations contained in annual, 
special or thematic human rights reports should normally be discussed within a reasonable 
amount of time, not to exceed six months, by the relevant government ministries as well as 
the competent parliamentary committees. These discussions should be held especially in 
order to determine the necessary follow up action, as appropriate in any given situation. 
NHRIs as part of their mandate to promote and protect human rights should ensure follow 
up action to recommendations contained in their reports. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Composition and guarantees of independence and pluralism 
</b></p>
<p><b>2.1.</b> <b>Ensuring pluralism</b>: The Sub-Committee notes there are diverse models of 
ensuring the requirement of pluralism set out in the Paris Principles. However, the Sub-
Committee emphasizes the importance of National Institutions to maintain consistent </p>


<p>GE.10-10278 <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>relationships with civil society and notes that this will be taken into consideration in the 
assessment of accreditation applications. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee observes that there are different ways in which pluralism may 
be achieved through the composition of the National Institution, for example:  
</p>
<p> (a) Members of the governing body represent different segments of society as 
referred to in the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p> (b) Pluralism through the appointment procedures of the governing body of the 
National Institution, for example, where diverse societal groups suggest or recommend 
candidates; 
</p>
<p> (c) Pluralism through procedures enabling effective cooperation with diverse 
societal groups, for example advisory committees, networks, consultations or public 
forums; or 
</p>
<p> (d) Pluralism through diverse staff representing the different societal groups 
within the society. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee further emphasizes that the principle of pluralism includes 
ensuring the meaningful participation of women in the National Institution. 
</p>
<p><b>2.2.</b> <b>Selection and appointment of the governing body</b>: The Sub-Committee notes the 
critical importance of the selection and appointment process of the governing body in 
ensuring the pluralism and independence of the National Institution. In particular, the Sub-
Committee emphasizes the following factors:  
</p>
<p> (a) A transparent process; 
 (b) Broad consultation throughout the selection and appointment process; 
 (c) Advertising vacancies broadly; 
 (d) Maximizing the number of potential candidates from a wide range of societal 
groups; 
</p>
<p> (e) Selecting members to serve in their own individual capacity rather than on 
behalf of the organization they represent. 
</p>
<p><b>2.3.</b> <b>Government representatives on National Institutions</b>: The Sub-Committee 
understands that the Paris Principles require that Government representatives on governing 
or advisory bodies of National Institutions do not have decision making or voting capacity. 
</p>
<p><b>2.4.</b> <b>Staffing by secondment</b>: 
</p>
<p> In order to guarantee the independence of the NHRI, the Sub-Committee notes, as a 
matter of good practice, the following:  
</p>
<p> (a) Senior level posts should not be filled with secondees; 
 (b) The number of seconded should not exceed 25% and never be more than 50% 
of the total workforce of the NHRI. 
</p>
<p><b>2.5.</b> <b>Immunity</b>: It is strongly recommended that provisions be included in national law 
to protect legal liability for actions undertaken in the official capacity of the NHRI. 
</p>
<p><b>2.6.</b> <b>Adequate funding</b>: Provision of adequate funding by the state should, as a 
minimum include: 
</p>
<p> (a) The allocation of funds for adequate accommodation, at least its head office;  
 (b) Salaries and benefits awarded to its staff comparable to public service salaries 
and conditions;  </p>


<p><b>38</b> GE.10-10278 
</p>
<p> (c) Remuneration of Commissioners (where appropriate); and 
 (d) The establishment of communications systems including telephone and 
Internet.  
</p>
<p> Adequate funding should, to a reasonable degree, ensure the gradual and progressive 
realisation of the improvement of the organization&#8217;s operations and the fulfilment of their 
mandate.  
</p>
<p> Funding from external sources, such as from development partners, should not 
compose the core funding of the NHRI as it is the responsibility of the state to ensure the 
NHRI&#8217;s minimum activity budget in order to allow it to operate towards fulfilling its 
mandate.  
</p>
<p> Financial systems should be such that the NHRI has complete financial autonomy. 
This should be a separate budget line over which it has absolute management and control.  
</p>
<p><b>2.7.</b> <b>Staff of an NHRI</b>: As a principle, NHRIs should be empowered to appoint their 
own staff. 
</p>
<p><b>2.8.</b> <b>Full-time Members</b>: Members of the NHRIs should include full-time remunerated 
members to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Ensure the independence of the NHRI free from actual or perceived conflict 
of interests; 
</p>
<p> (b) Ensure a stable mandate for the members; 
 (c) Ensure the ongoing and effective fulfilment of the mandate of the NHRI. 
<b>2.9.</b> <b>Guarantee of tenure for members of governing bodies</b>: Provisions for the 
dismissal of members of governing bodies in conformity with the Paris Principles should be 
included in the enabling laws for NHRIs:  
</p>
<p> (a) The dismissal or forced resignation of any member may result in a special 
review of the accreditation status of the NHRI; 
</p>
<p> (b) Dismissal should be made in strict conformity with all the substantive and 
procedural requirements as prescribed by law; 
</p>
<p> (c) Dismissal should not be allowed based on solely the discretion of appointing 
authorities.  
</p>
<p><b>2.10.</b> <b>Administrative regulation</b> 
</p>
<p> The classification of an NHRI as a public body has important implications for the 
regulation of its accountability, funding, and reporting arrangements.  
</p>
<p> In cases where the administration and expenditure of public funds by an NHRI is 
regulated by the Government, such regulation must not compromise the NHRI&#8217;s ability to 
perform its role independently and effectively. For this reason, it is important that the 
relationship between the Government and the NHRI be clearly defined. </p>

<p><b> 3. Methods of operation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Additional principles concerning the status of commissions with quasi-
jurisdictional competence 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Additional issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>5.1.</b> <b>NHRIs during the situation of a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat or a state of emergency</b>: As a 
principle, the Sub-Committee expects that, in the situation of a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat or a state of 
emergency, an NHRI will conduct itself with a heightened level of vigilance and 
independence in the exercise of their mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>5.2.</b> <b>Limitation of power of National Institutions due to national security</b>: The Sub-
Committee notes that the scope of the mandate of many National Institutions is restricted 
for national security reasons. While this tendency is not inherently contrary to the Paris 
Principles, it is noted that consideration must be given to ensuring that such restriction is 
not unreasonably or arbitrarily applied and is exercised under due process. 
</p>
<p><b>5.3.</b> <b>Functioning of an NHRI in a volatile context</b>: The Sub-Committee acknowledges 
that the context in which an NHRI operates may be so volatile that the NHRI cannot 
reasonably be expected to be in full conformity with all the provisions of the Paris 
Principles. When formulating its recommendation on the accreditation status in such cases, 
the Sub-Committee will give due consideration to factors such as: political instability; 
conflict or unrest; lack of state infrastructure, including excessive dependency on donor 
funding; and the NHRI&#8217;s execution of its mandate in practice. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Procedural issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>6.1.</b> <b>Application processes</b>: With the growing interest in establishing National 
Institutions, and the introduction of the five-yearly re-accreditation process, the volume of 
applications to be considered by the Sub-Committee has increased dramatically. In the 
interest of ensuring an efficient and effective accreditation process, the Sub-Committee 
emphasises the following requirements: 
</p>
<p> (a) Deadlines for applications will be strictly enforced; 
 (b) Where the deadline for a re-accreditation application is not met, the Sub-
Committee will recommend that the accreditation status of the National Institution be 
suspended until the application is considered at the next meeting; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Sub-Committee will make assessments on the basis of the documentation 
provided. Incomplete applications may affect the recommendation on the accreditation 
status of the National Institution;  
</p>
<p> (d) Applicants should provide documentation in its official or published form 
(for example, published laws and published annual reports) and not secondary analytical 
documents;  
</p>
<p> (e) Documents must be submitted in both hard copy and electronically;  
 (f) All application related documentation should be sent to the ICC Secretariat at 
OHCHR at the following address: National Institutions Unit, OHCHR, CH-1211 Geneva 
10, Switzerland and by email to: nationalinstitutions@ohchr.org; and 
</p>
<p> (g) It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensue that correspondence and 
application materials have been received by the ICC Secretariat. </p>


<p><b>40</b> GE.10-10278 
</p>
<p><b>6.2.</b> <b>Deferral of re-accreditation applications</b>: The Sub-Committee will apply the 
following policy on the deferral of re-accreditation applications:  
</p>
<p> (a) In the event that an institution seeks a deferral of consideration of its re-
accreditation application, a decision to grant the deferral can be taken only if written 
justifications for the deferral have been provided and these are, in the view of the ICC 
Chairperson, compelling and exceptional;  
</p>
<p> (b) Re-accreditation applications may be deferred for a maximum of one year, 
after this time the status of the NHRI will lapse; and  
</p>
<p> (c) For NHRIs whose re-accreditation applications are received after the due date 
or who have failed to submit their applications, their accreditation status will be suspended. 
This suspension can be in place for up to one year during which time the NHRI may submit 
its application for re-accreditation. If the application is not submitted during this time, the 
accreditation status will lapse.  
</p>
<p><b>6.3. NHRIs under review</b>: Pursuant to Article 16 of the ICC Statute,3 the ICC Chair or 
the Sub-Committee may initiate a review of a NHRI&#8217;s accreditation status if it appears that 
the circumstances of that NHRI may have changed in any way which affects its compliance 
with the Paris Principles. Such a review is triggered by an exceptional set of circumstances 
considered to be temporary in nature. As a consequence, the regular re-accreditation 
process will be deferred until the review is completed.  
</p>
<p> In its consideration of NHRIs under review, the Sub-Committee will apply the 
following process: 
</p>
<p> (a) A NHRI can be under review for a maximum of one and a half years only, 
during which time it may bring information to the Sub-Committee to demonstrate that, in 
the areas under review, the NHRI is fully compliant with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p> (b) During the period of review, all privileges associated with the existing 
accreditation status of the NHRI will remain in place; 
</p>
<p> (c) If at the end of the period of review, the concerns of the Sub-Committee have 
not been satisfied, then the accreditation status of the NHRI will lapse. 
</p>
<p><b>6.4. Suspension of Accreditation</b>: The Sub-Committee notes that the status of 
suspension means that the accreditation status of the Commission is temporarily suspended 
until information is brought before the Sub-Committee to demonstrate that, in the areas 
under review, the Commission is fully compliant with the Paris Principles. An NHRI with a 
suspended A status is not entitled to the benefits of an A status accreditation, including 
voting in the ICC and participation rights before the Human Rights Council, until the 
suspension is lifted or the accreditation status of the NHRI is changed.  
</p>
<p><b>6.5. Submission of information</b>: Submissions will only be accepted if they are in paper 
or electronic format. The Statement of Compliance with the Paris Principles is the core 
component of the application. Original materials should be submitted to support or 
substantiate assertions made in this Statement so that the assertions can be validated and 
confirmed by the Sub-Committee. No assertion will be accepted without material to support 
it. 
</p>
<p> Further, where an application follows a previous recommendation of the Sub-
Committee, the application should directly address the comments made and should not be 
submitted unless all concerns can be addressed.

</b></p>
<p><b>6.6. More than one national institution in a State</b>: The Sub-Committee acknowledges 
and encourages the trend towards a strong national human rights protection system in a 
State by having one consolidated and comprehensive national human rights institution. 
</p>
<p> In very exceptional circumstances, should more than one national institution seek 
accreditation by the ICC, it should be noted that Article 39 of the ICC Statute4 provides that 
the State shall have  one speaking right, one voting right and, if elected, only one ICC 
Bureau member. 
</p>
<p> In those circumstances the conditions precedent for consideration of the application 
by the Sub-Committee are the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) Written consent of the State Government (which itself must be a member of 
the United Nations); 
 (b) Written agreement between all concerned national human rights institutions 
on the rights and duties as an ICC member including the exercise of the one voting and the 
one speaking right. This agreement shall also include arrangements for participation in the 
international human rights system, including the Human Rights Council and the Treaty 
Bodies. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee stresses the above requirements are mandatory for the 
application to be considered. 
</p>
<p><b>6.7. NHRI annual report</b>: The Sub-Committee finds it difficult to review the status of 
an NHRI in the absence of a current annual report, that is, a report dated not earlier than 
one year before the time it is scheduled to undergo review by the Sub-Committee. The Sub-
Committee stresses the importance for an NHRI to prepare and publicize an annual report 
on its national situation with regard to human rights in general, and on more specific 
matters. This report should include an account of the activities undertaken by the NHRI to 
further its mandate during that year and should state its opinions, recommendations and 
proposals to address any human rights issues of concern.
