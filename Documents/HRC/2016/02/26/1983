</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and relevant international human rights treaties, in particular the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all relevant General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions on 
political participation, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any 
of the distinctions stipulated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
without unreasonable restrictions, to take part in the conduct of political and public affairs, 
directly or through freely chosen representatives, and to have access, on general terms of 
equality, to public service in his or her country, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that the will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of 
government and that every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of 
the distinctions stipulated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
without unreasonable restrictions, to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections 
which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, 
guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming further</i> that no distinctions are permitted among citizens in the 
enjoyment of the right to participate in the conduct of political and public affairs on the 
grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, disability, property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the critical importance of equal political participation for democracy, 
rule of law, social inclusion and economic development, and advancing gender equality, as 
well as for the realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the active participation of women, on equal terms with men, at all 
levels of decision-making, is essential to the achievement of equality, sustainable 
development, peace and democracy, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the rights of everyone to freedom of expression, to peaceful 
assembly and to freedom of association are among the essential conditions for equal 
political participation and must be protected, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>also </i>the need to intensify efforts to eliminate barriers in law and in 
practice and to actively facilitate equal political participation, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, the special procedures, the treaty bodies and other relevant human rights 
mechanisms on identifying and addressing obstacles to equal political participation, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Expresses</i> <i>concern</i> that, despite progress made in achieving equal political 
participation worldwide, many people continue to face obstacles, including discrimination, 
in the enjoyment of their right to participate in political and public affairs of their countries; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recognizes</i> that women, persons belonging to marginalized groups or to 
minorities, and persons in vulnerable situations are among the most affected by 
discrimination in political participation; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Reaffirms</i> the obligation of States to take all appropriate measures to ensure 
that every citizen has an effective right and opportunity to participate in political and public 
affairs on an equal basis; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Urges</i> all States to ensure the full and effective participation of all citizens in 
political and public affairs on an equal basis, including by, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Complying fully with their international human rights obligations and 
commitments with regard to equal political participation; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Taking all necessary measures to eliminate laws, regulations and practices 
that, directly or indirectly, discriminate against citizens in their right to political 
participation on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, disability, property, birth or other status; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Ensuring that no one&#8217;s right to participate in political and public affairs of his 
or her country is suspended or conditioned, except on objective and reasonable grounds 
which are duly established by law and in conformity with international law; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Taking proactive measures to eliminate all barriers in law and in practice that 
prevent or hinder citizens, in particular women, persons belonging to marginalized groups 
or minorities, and persons in vulnerable situations, from fully and effectively participating 
in political and public affairs; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Taking appropriate measures to publicly encourage and promote the 
importance of equal political participation of all citizens, in particular women, persons 
belonging to marginalized groups or to minorities, and persons in vulnerable situations; </p>


<p>(<i>f</i>) Ensuring the right of everyone to freedom of expression, to peaceful 
assembly and to freedom of association, and facilitating equal and effective access to 
information, media and communication technologies in order to enable pluralistic debates 
fostering equal political participation; 
</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) Providing full and effective access to justice and redress mechanisms to those 
citizens whose right to participate in political and public affairs has been violated; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Encourages</i> the Office of the High Commissioner, the special procedures, the 
treaty bodies and other relevant international human rights mechanisms to continue to 
address the promotion of equal political participation in their work, within their respective 
mandates; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a study on factors 
that impede equal political participation and on steps to overcome those challenges, while 
taking into account, inter alia, the relevant work of the special procedures, the treaty bodies 
and other relevant international human rights mechanisms, and to present the study to the 
Human Rights Council for consideration at its twenty-seventh session.
