<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eighteenth session 
from 27 January to 7 February 2014. The review of Cyprus was held at the 13th meeting on 
4 February 2014. The delegation of Cyprus was headed by Leda Koursoumba, Law 
Commissioner. At its 17th meeting, held on 6 February 2014, the Working Group adopted 
the report on Cyprus. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Cyprus: Republic of Korea, United States of 
America, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Cyprus: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/CYP/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/18/CYP/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/18/CYP/3).  
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, 
Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Cyprus through the troika. The questions are available 
on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Law Commissioner presented the national report. She underlined that Cyprus 
attributes great significance to the UPR process as the principal human rights protection 
mechanism. 
</p>
<p>6. Since the first review cycle, there had been significant developments regarding 
compliance by Cyprus with human rights instruments. Many laws had been enacted and 
policies adopted, and several national action plans had been initiated. Independent control 
mechanisms had been established by law, such as the National Independent Authority for 
Human Rights, the Independent Mechanism for the Promotion, Protection and Monitoring 
of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the National Mechanism 
for the Prevention of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. Independent authorities had been created, such as the Commissioner for 
Humanitarian Issues, and existing mechanisms such as the Commissioner for Children&#8217;s 
Rights, the Anti-Discrimination Body, the National Machinery of Women&#8217;s Rights and the 
Police Office for Combating Discrimination had further promoted their scope and actions. 
Cyprus had also transposed a number of European Union (EU) directives. 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>7. Cyprus had intensified its efforts for closer cooperation with human rights bodies 
and was now up-to-date with all its treaty reporting obligations. It had ratified, inter alia, 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and was promoting the ratification of 
the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, the Council of Europe 
Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic 
Violence and the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against 
Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. 
</p>
<p>8. Cyprus had introduced important initiatives for the promotion and protection of 
children&#8217;s rights. The Government, in collaboration with the Commissioner for Children&#8217;s 
Rights, had promoted new legislation in compliance with international human rights 
instruments on children&#8217;s rights, particularly the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In 
collaboration with the competent government authorities, the media, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and civil society, the Commissioner had organized seminars and 
workshops on empowering children and raising awareness of children&#8217;s rights among 
professionals and society at large. 
</p>
<p>9. In promoting human rights education, national action plans and projects had been 
implemented, including multicultural education projects, school curricula reform, measures 
to combat violence in schools, including bullying, and in-service training for teachers to 
combat discrimination by promoting tolerance.  
</p>
<p>10. Regarding women&#8217;s rights, Cyprus had consulted widely with women&#8217;s 
organizations in preparation for the restructuring and strengthening of the National 
Machinery for Women&#8217;s Rights. Cyprus was in the process of preparing the new Strategic 
Plan on Equality 2014&#8211;2017 in collaboration with civil society. Within the framework of 
women&#8217;s rights, Cyprus had launched an awareness-raising campaign against trafficking in 
human beings for sexual and labour exploitation, using the media to disseminate the 
campaign. More women had been appointed at the decision-making level, and significant 
efforts had been made to address the issues of labour discrimination and the gender pay 
gap. The gender pay gap in Cyprus was within the EU average of 16.2 per cent and a 
special project entitled &#8220;Actions for reducing the gender pay gap&#8221; had been launched. 
</p><p>11. One of the main priorities for Cyprus was preventing and combating domestic 
violence. The National Action Plan for the Prevention and Combating of Domestic 
Violence for the period 2010&#8211;2013 aimed to promote concrete policies on a holistic, 
integrated and systematic basis. 
</p>
<p>12. Cyprus acknowledged that migration was a major challenge. Within that framework, 
a series of policy-oriented measures had been adopted, including the signing in December 
2012 of a cooperation agreement with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 
regular training of staff by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) and the European Asylum Support Office, reinforcement of the staff at 
Kofinou Reception Centre, free education for all migrant children and free medical care for 
all vulnerable groups. Despite budgetary constraints, Cyprus aimed to maintain free access 
to health care, particularly for vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>13. Increased efforts to combat trafficking in human beings had included the adoption of 
relevant legislation and a National Action Plan, training of government officials, the 
abolition of the so-called &#8220;artist&#8217;s visa&#8221;, awareness-raising campaigns and bilateral 
cooperation with countries of origin. A bill harmonizing domestic legislation with the 2011 
EU directive on trafficking in human beings was under consideration by Parliament. 
</p>
<p>14. Cyprus was sensitive to issues concerning police ill-treatment and use of force. 
Special training programmes on human rights issues were provided to all police officers. 
Several independent bodies had been set up to investigate cases of police ill-treatment. </p>


<p>Another important development was the cooperation of the police with UNHCR and the 
Ombudsman in drafting of a code of conduct for checking migrants&#8217; residence status. 
</p>
<p>15. Prison reform was a high priority for the Government. A programme of short-, 
medium- and long-term measures had been adopted. Prison leadership and management 
teams were undergoing considerable restructuring in order to ensure that prison conditions 
respected inmates&#8217; human rights, in particular their dignity. The prison system was 
currently shifting from an over-controlling approach to a human rights-based approach. 
</p>
<p>16. As for the protection of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people&#8217;s 
rights, a bill criminalizing public incitement to discriminatory, hateful or violent acts 
against persons because of their sexual orientation or identity was pending before 
Parliament. Moreover, a bill regulating the civil partnership pact for same and opposite sex 
couples was currently open for consultation between government agencies and NGOs with 
a view to its enactment before the end of 2014. 
</p>
<p>17. Cyprus was determined to take significant measures in the fight against xenophobia. 
The relevant 2011 legislation criminalized public incitement to violence or hatred by 
reference to race, colour, religion, descent, and national or ethnic origin, and racist and 
xenophobic motivations constituted aggravating circumstances. The measures currently 
being implemented were a &#8220;No Hate Speech&#8221; television campaign, the drafting of an anti-
racist glossary by the Cyprus Youth Organization in cooperation with the Anti-
Discrimination Body, and the publication of a policy report for multicultural education, 
promoting the integration of non-native students. 
</p>
<p>18. Cyprus noted that, owing to the continued illegal foreign occupation of 36.2 per cent 
of the territory of the country since 1974, the Government was not in a position to ensure 
the application of human rights instruments in the area that was not under its effective 
control. It could not therefore submit reliable information on the enjoyment of the relevant 
rights by the population living in the occupied area of Cyprus. 
</p>

protect cultural heritage sites, including those of religious minorities, in the territory beyond 
the effective control of the Government. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Australia noted that the persistent division of the island inhibited the full enjoyment

requested that all erroneous references be omitted from the report. 
</p>
<p>68. The President of the Human Rights Council recalled that questions of a political and 
territorial nature did not fall within the mandate of the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review, particularly given that such issues were subject to the attention of other 
bodies that were more competent in those areas. The President invited all delegations to 
focus on human rights issues and avoid politicizing the debate. 
</p>
<p>69. Turkey pointed out that the most recent United Nations settlement plan had been 
approved by the Turkish Cypriots, but rejected by the Greek Cypriot authorities. Turkish 
Cypriots were deprived of basic human rights, such as communications with the outside 
world and representation in international forums, and their human rights situation could not 
be directly communicated to, or observed and reported by, relevant international bodies. 
Turkish Cypriots in the south were subjected to discrimination, ill-treatment and violence, 
and were denied the right to religious freedom, freedom of movement and education in their 
mother tongue. Turkey would continue to support the work of the Committee on Missing 
Persons in Cyprus. </p>

</p>
<p>76. Cyprus stated that the Government of the Republic remained fully committed to the 
objective of achieving a viable and functional settlement, pursuant to United Nations 
Security Council resolutions. Such a settlement must be based on the framework of a 
bizonal, bicommunal federation, which would safeguard the human rights of all people in 
the country. As for the Turkish Cypriots living in the Government-controlled areas of the 
Republic of Cyprus, the Government ensured their effective participation in economic, 
social and cultural life to the fullest extent possible. The root cause of the shortcomings in 
the human rights of Turkish Cypriots was the continuing illegal occupation of part of 
Cyprus by the Turkish military. 
</p>
<p>77. Turkey, raising a point of order, noted that the Cypriot delegation seemed to believe 
that the rules of procedure requiring States not to use the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review as a forum to discuss political issues were not applicable to it. Turkey 
stated that the 1960 Republic had been based on the political equality of Turkish Cypriots 
and Greek Cypriots. In December 1963, that partnership had been destroyed and all Turkish 
Cypriot elements had been removed by force of arms from all State organs. Between 1963 
and 1974, Turkish Cypriots had been subjected to all forms of human rights violations and 
armed attacks by Greek Cypriots. Turkey had intervened in the island in the wake of the 
coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, which had aimed at the final takeover of Cyprus at all costs. 
</p>
<p>78. The President of the Human Rights Council recalled that the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review was not a forum for dealing with bilateral matters or political 
confrontations and implored all parties to abide by the rules of procedure. Debates 
regarding bilateral or territorial issues were substantive matters and did not constitute points 
of order. </p>


<p>79. Pakistan, raising a point of order, considered that the intervention by the Turkish 
delegation and its point of order did not contain any inaccuracy and that it was the 
sovereign right of every State to express its views. 
</p>
<p>80. The Russian Federation, raising a point of order, supported the President&#8217;s ruling 
and stated that the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review was not a place for 
political debate or historical retrospectives. 
</p>
<p>81. Greece, raising a point of order, indicated that the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review had been convened to review the human rights situation in the Republic of 
Cyprus and that it was counterproductive to use it to raise political issues. Greece requested 
that the President ask Turkey to respect the rules of procedure of the UPR and the ruling of 
the President. 
</p>
<p>82. Egypt, raising a point of order, supported the President&#8217;s ruling and stated that all 
the States Members of the United Nations should be addressed by their official names, in 
line with the practices and methods of work of the Human Rights Council and the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review. 
</p>
<p>83. Armenia, raising a point of order, supported the ruling of the President of the Human 
Rights Council that a point of order should concern only procedural matters. 
</p>
<p>84. Cyprus, raising a point of order, reconfirmed that points of order should be 
concerned with procedural matters only and requested that all political or other erroneous 
terminology not be included in the record or any other document of the meeting. 
</p>
<p>85. The President of the Human Rights Council appealed to all delegations to refrain 
from politicizing in any way or interfering in bilateral or territorial matters, which were 
being addressed by other competent international bodies.  
</p>
<p>86. Cyprus explained that Turkish Cypriots were entitled to the full enjoyment of human 
rights by dint of being citizens of the Republic of Cyprus. The Government took special 
measures to ensure that those rights, including the rights to employment, education and 
religious freedom, were properly implemented. Thousands of Turkish Cypriots commuted 
daily to the Government-controlled area where they worked. They were entitled to social 
insurance benefits, provided that they made the necessary contributions in accordance with 
the law. The Government took a series of important measures to support the daily life of 
Turkish Cypriots. It also provided financial support for the maintenance and restoration of 
mosques, cemeteries and other Muslims sites. 
</p>
<p>87. The Government was committed to the reform of the juvenile justice system. The 
Commissioner for Children&#8217;s Rights had prepared a bill regulating prevention and 
intervention, which was fully compatible with United Nations principles and guidelines. 
The bill would be submitted for consultation in the near future. 
</p>
<p>88. Women played an important role in the peacebuilding process through their 
participation in various working groups and bicommunal structures. 
</p>
<p>89. The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance was in the process of ratification and the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was in the process of 
signature. The ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families was being addressed at European 
Union level. 
</p>
<p>90. In recent years, Cyprus had increased its efforts to combat trafficking in human 
beings by abolishing the so-called &#8220;artist&#8217;s visa&#8221;, adopting anti-trafficking legislation, 
establishing the National Coordinator and the Multidisciplinary Coordinating Group against </p>


<p>Trafficking in Human Beings, developing the 2010&#8211;2012 National Action Plan, training 
government officials and establishing international cooperation with other States. 
</p>
<p>91. Since the abolition of the artist&#8217;s visa and the introduction of a new system with 
stringent criteria, numerous establishments, primarily cabarets, that employed women who 
faced an increased risk of sexual exploitation had gone out of business. The new work 
permit for performing artists required that artists&#8217; qualifications and the establishments that 
employed them were thoroughly checked. As a result, the risk of trafficking had been 
significantly reduced, as the number of operational cabarets had fallen from 73 in 2009 to 
16, while the number of work permits issued for performing artists at cabarets and 
nightclubs had dropped dramatically between September 2012 and August 2013 in 
comparison to previous years. 
</p>
<p>92. The 2013&#8211;2015 National Action Plan against trafficking in human beings 
established a comprehensive framework for addressing the crime. It had been based on an 
evaluation of the 2010&#8211;2012 Plan and the recommendations of the working groups 
appointed to that end, and had been approved by the Council of Ministers on 10 April 2013. 
It took into consideration the provisions of the EU Directive on preventing and combating 
trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, the EU Strategy towards the 
Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings 2012&#8211;2016 and the recommendations of the 
Council of Europe Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. The 
2013&#8211;2015 National Action Plan covered all aspects of the issue, included practical 
measures and actions to be implemented within specified time frames and provided for the 
financing of the operations. 
</p>
<p>93. A person recognized as a refugee received the same treatment as that received by 
citizens of the Republic, under the relevant laws and regulations. Asylum seekers were 
protected from refoulement and had full access to housing, employment and social support, 
as provided by the Refugee Law. National legislation provided that asylum seekers had the 
right to legal assistance before the Supreme Court free of charge, as required by the 
relevant EU Directive (2005/85/EC). 
</p><p>94. For Cyprus, any police misconduct, including ill-treatment, racist attitudes and any 
other inappropriate behaviour, was unacceptable. A series of measures had been adopted to 
eliminate police misconduct, such as the appointment of a high-ranking officer to address 
complaints of police misconduct brought by the public and the launch of a website for 
online complaints submission. The police authorities were currently working in close 
cooperation with the Ombudsman to prepare a professional code of practice that set out the 
conditions, means of restraint and basic principles of professional conduct at every stage of 
police action. Police officers received continuous professional training. 
</p>
<p>95. The material conditions in police detention centres had recently been assessed by 
European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment and had been found to be satisfactory in many respects. All police detention 
centres were regularly renovated in order to ensure that they met human rights standards 
and norms. 
</p>
<p>96. A number of measures had recently been implemented in an effort to reform the 
prison system to bring it into full compliance with human rights standards and norms. The 
Ombudsman had confirmed that those measures would assist in implementing her 
recommendations. A number of specific steps aimed to improve detention conditions, 
protect vulnerable persons and provide alternatives to imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>97. A more individual-oriented policy aimed at improving the well-being of prisoners, 
providing for school programmes, sports activities and vocational work. Training of prison 
staff was an important aspect. Special emphasis was given to developing interpersonal 
communication skills based on respect for human dignity. </p>


<p>98. An Independent Committee appointed by the Council of Ministers had undertaken a 
fundamental review of the Prisons Law and regulations, particularly the disciplinary 
system, in line with international human rights instruments and norms and with the case law 
of the European Court of Human Rights. The project would be completed by the end of 
</p><p>2014. 
</p>
<p>99. An expert had been methodically reviewing all previously announced or 
unannounced policy and practice that had not been legislated for, with a view to issuing 
legislative provisions or protocols as appropriate. 
</p>
<p>100. The right of foreign workers to equal terms and conditions of employment as those 
enjoyed by Cypriot citizens was safeguarded through written contracts signed by the 
employer and the employee. Terms and conditions of employment were in accordance with 
the relevant collective agreements concluded by employers&#8217; and workers&#8217; organizations. 
Equal and fair treatment was further strengthened through the 2012 Private Employment 
Agency Law which regulated the establishment and operation of private employment 
agencies. In 2013, the Department of Labour Relations had examined 23 labour complaints 
and forwarded them to the police for further examination and prosecution of the persons 
responsible. 
</p>
<p>101. In order to protect the rights of all workers employed in Cyprus, regardless of 
whether they were Cypriot citizens, EU nationals or non-EU nationals, a complaints 
mechanism was in operation at each District Labour Relations &#927;ffice. In 2012, the 
complaints mechanism had been successful in providing relevant advice leading to 
mutually agreed satisfactory solutions and ongoing employment relationships between 30 
workers and their employers. From January to September 2013, 19 such complaints had 
been resolved, resulting in the preservation of the employment relationship. 
</p>
<p>102. Cyprus continuously strengthened its efforts to improve the working conditions of 
all non-EU national workers, which were clearly established in employment contracts. The 
terms of employment of non-EU national workers in all economic activities were the same 
as those provided in collective agreements, which safeguarded equal treatment among all 
workers in Cyprus. 
</p>
<p>103. All work permit applications submitted by employers were examined by a tripartite 
committee consisting of representatives of the Department of Labour Relations and 
workers&#8217; and employers&#8217; organizations. The committee inspectors conducted random 
inspections at workplaces. 
</p>
<p>104. Cyprus continuously enhanced its efforts to improve the working conditions of 
domestic workers, as established in the contracts of employment, which were signed by 
both parties. 
</p>
<p>105. The ILO Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189) addressed areas which 
were largely covered by EU law in the areas of social policy, anti-discrimination, judicial 
cooperation in criminal matters, asylum and immigration. Cyprus considered that the 
provisions of the Convention were largely met by national law and practice in that field. In 
view of the current financial situation in Cyprus, standards that had not already been met 
could not be fulfilled at that time. Therefore, Cyprus could not yet commit to ratifying that 
Convention. 
</p>
<p>106. Cyprus had adopted and was implementing a strategy to combat domestic violence 
through the pioneering Violence in the Family Laws. The Manual of Interdepartmental 
Cooperation on Domestic Violence provided a framework on collaboration between 
professionals and focused on interdepartmental cooperation. 
</p>
<p>107. Turkish Cypriot students could attend any public or a private school of their choice 
in the Government-controlled areas; their fees for private schools were fully subsidized by </p>


<p>the Government. In the past, Turkish Cypriot parents had expressed their preference that 
their children attend the public school of their area, indicating that the measures adopted 
were adequate and students&#8217; educational needs were met. Turkish Cypriot children had the 
opportunity to receive language lessons in Turkish. Public schools attended by a 
considerable number of Turkish Cypriot students provided lessons in the students&#8217; own 
language, religion and culture. 
</p>
<p>108. Cyprus had been a pioneer in introducing the Law for Education and Training of 
children with Special Needs in 1999, setting the legislative framework that regulated all 
matters regarding the education of children with special educational needs who attended 
public schools. The Law entitled children with special educational needs to &#8220;free 
appropriate public education&#8221; alongside their peers and stipulated that the State was 
responsible for making education and schools fully accessible to them. The inclusion of 
children with special educational needs in the common core of education was the 
underlying philosophy and policy of the Ministry of Education and Culture, and was fully 
aligned with international declarations and tendencies such as the Salamanca Statement and 
Framework for Action on Special Needs Education. The Commissioner for Children&#8217;s 
Rights, having consulted with stakeholders, had examined the application of the Law and 
issued a report which she had communicated to the Minister of Education and discussed in 
Parliament. Her recommendations were being taken into consideration in preparations for 
amending the current legislation. 
</p>
<p>109. The Government&#8217;s priority was to ensure equal access to education for all children 
living on the island. To that end, free and accessible education was offered to all pupils 
without prejudice based on gender, ability, language, colour, religion, political belief or 
ethnic background. The Policy Report for Multicultural Education promoted an 
intercultural policy regarding the integration of non-native speaking students with the 
collection and analysis of data, development of programmes, actions, language courses and 
teacher training. The aim of the policy was the smooth inclusion of students from all 
countries in the Cyprus Educational System. 
</p>
<p>110. Students from national religious minority groups could attend any public or private 
school of their choice. Whether they opted to attend their national school or another private 
school, the tuition fees and other expenses were fully subsidized by the Government. The 
cultural identity of Armenian, Latin and Maronite communities was safeguarded by the 
implementation of special programmes which were funded by the State. 
</p>
<p>111. With regard to racism and xenophobia, a multidisciplinary team of experts called the 
Task Force on School Violence had been established in order to provide immediate support 
and guidance to schools facing incidents of violence and racism. Through the team&#8217;s 
interventions in schools, vulnerable students received psychological support on a regular 
basis. Following a recommendation from the Anti-Discrimination Body, the Ministry of 
Education and Culture was currently drafting a Code of Conduct against Racism in schools, 
which was expected to contribute to a decrease in bullying and discrimination based on any 
form of diversity in schools. 
</p>
<p>112. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus believed that the results-oriented 
mechanism of the UPR, as well as its monitoring nature, could be seen as a road map for 
internal assessment and further improvement in compliance with international standards. 
Cyprus was committed to addressing the new challenges it faced in the field of human 
rights and to realizing the rights of all people in Cypriot society. 
</p>
<p>113. The President of the Human Rights Council brought to the attention of the 
delegations the rules of procedure for the preparation of the reports of the Working Group, 
according to which the reports were factual and must reflect the interventions made by the 
State under review and other delegations that took the floor. </p>
