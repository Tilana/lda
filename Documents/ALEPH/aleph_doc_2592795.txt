ENDURANCE EXPLORATION GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2016
(Unaudited)
NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A  summary  of  the  significant  accounting  policies  applied  in  the  preparation  of  the  accompanying
consolidated financial statements follows.
Description of Business
Endurance  Exploration  Group,  Inc.  (formerly  Tecton  Corporation)  (the  “Company”)  was  incorporated
under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 19, 2006, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hemis
Corporation.  On December 1, 2006 Hemis declared a dividend of Tecton shares to all shareholders as
of that date and concurrently cancelled its share ownership in the Company.  The effect of this dividend
declaration and share cancellation was that Tecton was spun off as an independent company.
On  November  8,  2013,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  a  change  of  the  Company’s  fiscal  year  from
January 31, to December 31.
On  December  31,  2013,  the  Company  acquired  100%  of  the  membership  interests  of  Endurance
Exploration  Group,  LLC  (“Endurance  LLC”),  a  Florida  limited  liability  company,  in  exchange  for
20,550,539 shares of the Company’s Common Stock being issued to the former members. Endurance
LLC is now a wholly owned subsidiary with its operations being the Company’s primary focus.
Endurance  Exploration  Group  LLC  –  is  engaged  in  the  archaeologically  sensitive  exploration  and
recovery of deep-ocean shipwrecks throughout the world. We intend to recover bullion precious metals,
numismatic-grade coinage, high-value non-ferrous metals and other valuable cargos from both historic
and modern shipwrecks.
On January 2, 2014, the Company changed its name to Endurance Exploration Group, Inc.
Our corporate headquarters are located in Clearwater, Florida.
Principles of consolidation and basis of presentation
These consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Endurance Exploration
Group, Inc. (formerly Tecton Corporation) and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016.  The acquisition of the
membership interests of Endurance LLC and its wholly owned Panamanian subsidiary formed to hold
the registry of a research vessel occurred as of the close of its business on December 31, 2013.
The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and
regulations  of  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  “SEC”).    Certain  information  and
footnote  disclosures  normally  included  in  annual  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to  such  SEC  rules  and  regulations,  although  the  Company  believes  that  the  disclosures  made  are
adequate  to  make  the  information  not  misleading.  It  is  suggested  that  these  consolidated  financial
statements  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  notes  thereto,
included in the Company’s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for
a fair statement of the financial position at June 30, 2016 and the results of operations for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015 have been made.  All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
8
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this Form 10-Q, to assess the need
for  potential  recognition  or  disclosure  in  this  report.  Based  upon  this  evaluation,  management
determined  that  all  subsequent  events  that  require  recognition  in  the  financial  statements  have  been
included.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Offering Costs
As of June 30, 2016, the Company has incurred $30,875 of deferred offering costs associated with the
planned  sale  of  securities.    This  amount  is  included  on  the  balance  sheet  in  prepaid  expenses  and
deferred costs.  These costs will be netted against proceeds upon completion of the offering, or they will
be expensed if the offering is unsuccessful.
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are stated at historical cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method at rates
based on the assets’ estimated useful lives which are normally between three and ten years.  When
retired  or  otherwise  disposed,  the  related  carrying  value  and  accumulated  depreciation  are  removed
from  the  respective  accounts  and  the  net  difference  less  any  amount  realized  from  disposition,  is
reflected in earnings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or lease
term, if shorter. Equipment and major overhaul items (such as engines or generators) that enhance or
extend the useful life of vessel related assets qualify to be capitalized and depreciated over the useful
life or remaining life of that asset, whichever is shorter. Certain major repair items required by industry
standards to ensure a vessel’s seaworthiness also qualify to be capitalized and depreciated over the
period of time until the next scheduled planned major maintenance for that item. All other repairs and
maintenance are accounted for under the direct-expensing method and are expensed when incurred.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.  Fair value is determined based
on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the assets. As of June 30,
2016 and 2015, there were no impairment losses recognized for long-lived assets.
Income Taxes
The  Company  uses  the  liability  method  to  record  income  tax  activity.  Deferred  taxes  are  determined
based  upon  the  estimated  future  tax  effects  of  differences  between  the  financial  reporting  and  tax
reporting bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of currently enacted tax laws.
The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements uses
the  threshold  of  more-likely-than-not  to  be  sustained  upon  examination  for  inclusion  or  exclusion.
Measurement of the tax uncertainty occurs if the recognition threshold has been met.
9
Net Earnings (Losses) Per Common Share
The  Company  computes  earnings  (loss)  per  share  by  dividing  net  earnings  (loss)  by  the  weighted
average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during
the  year.  Dilutive  common  stock  equivalents  may  consist  of  shares  issuable  upon  conversion  of
convertible  preferred  shares  and  the  exercise  of  the  Company's  stock  options  (calculated  using  the
treasury stock method).  As of June 30, 2016, there were 5,574,000 common stock equivalents that were
anti-dilutive and were not included in the calculation. Common stock issuable is considered outstanding
as of the original approval date for purposes of earnings per share computations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The  fair  value  of  financial  instruments,  which  include  cash,  loans  receivable,  accounts  payable  and
accrued  expenses  and  advances  from  related  parties  were  estimated  to  approximate  their  carrying
values due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Management is of the
opinion  that  the  Company  is  not  exposed  to  significant  interest,  currency  or  credit  risks  arising  from
financial instruments.
Comprehensive Income
The Company records comprehensive income as the change in equity of a business during a period
from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes
in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
Other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  includes  foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  and  unrealized
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. As of June 30, 2016 the Company had no items that
represent comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the
financial statements.
Stock Based Compensation
Stock  based  compensation  costs  are  measured  at  fair  value  on  date  of  grant  and  recognition  of
compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The Company determines the fair
value of awards using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
New Accounting Pronouncements
The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. No new standards had any material effect
on these financial statements. The accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to the date of these
financial statements that were considered significant by management were evaluated for the potential
effect on these consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe any of the subsequent
pronouncements will have a material effect on these consolidated financial statements as presented and
does  not  anticipate  the  need  for  any  future  restatement  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements
because of the retro-active application of any accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to June
30, 2016 through the date these financial statements were issued.
NOTE B – GOING CONCERN MATTERS
The  accompanying  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As shown in the accompanying financial statements for the period January 19, 2006 (date of inception)
to June 30, 2016, the Company incurred losses of $6,745,493. The Company has minimal liquid assets.
These factors, among others, indicate that the Company will be unable to continue as a going concern
for a reasonable period of time.
The Company's existence is dependent upon management's ability to develop profitable operations and
resolve its liquidity problems. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE C – ACQUISITION OF ENDURANCE EXPLORATION GROUP LLC MEMBERSHIP
INTERESTS
On December 31, 2013, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Endurance
Exploration Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“Endurance LLC”) by issuing 20,550,539
shares of its common stock.
10
The  majority  shareholders  of  the  Company  also  held  a  majority  interest  in  Endurance  LLC,  and
maintained controlling interests in both entities both before and after the transaction.  Accordingly, the
acquisition has been accounted for as a corporate reorganization because of the common control.  The
book value of Endurance LLC at the time of the acquisition was as follows:

NOTE D – PREPAID EXPENSES AND DEFERRED COSTS
On May 15, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Eclipse Group, Inc. to provide services,
equipment  and/or  personnel  in  support  of  anticipated  Endurance  salvage  projects,  to  inspect  and
recover  one  or  more  shipwreck  cargoes  located  by  Endurance.    The  Company  issued  2,000,000
common shares at $.25 per share with a value of $500,000.  These shares represent a prepayment for
Eclipse  services  pursuant  to  a  schedule  of  agreed  upon  costs  and  rates.    Eclipse  will  invoice  the
Company on a monthly basis as services are rendered.  During the year ended December 31, 2015,
Eclipse  rendered  $150,000  of  the  services  outlined  in  this  agreement.    As  of  June  30,  2016,  the
Company  has  not  received  any  additional  invoices  for  services  outlined  in  this  agreement,  and
consequently the remaining balance of $350,000 is included in prepaid expenses along with $30,875 of
deferred issuance costs for a total of $380,875 at June 30, 2016.
NOTE E – FIXED ASSETS

On December 31, 2013, the Company completed the purchase of 100% of the membership interests of
Endurance Exploration Group, LLC (“Endurance LLC”), from its members, Micah Eldred and Carl Dilley,
in exchange for 20,550,539 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $0.0186 per share, based

NOTE I – INCOME TAXES
There is no current or deferred income tax expense or benefit allocated to continuing operations for the
period ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company has not recognized an income tax benefit for its
operating losses generated through June 30, 2016 based on uncertainties concerning the Company’s
ability to generate taxable income in future periods.  The tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance
established against deferred tax assets arising from operating losses and other temporary differences,
the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not.  In future periods, tax benefits and
related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts
to be more likely than not.
For income tax purposes the Company has available a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately
$6,745,000  from  inception  to  June  30,  2016,  which  will  expire,  unless  used  to  offset  future  federal
taxable income beginning in 2024.  The tax years ending December 31, 2013 through December 31,
2014 are open for inspection by both Federal and State Agencies.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As used in this report, the terms "we", "us", "our," “Endurance” and “the Company” mean Endurance
Exploration Group, Inc. (formerly Tecton Corporation), unless otherwise indicated.
This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and
notes  included  elsewhere  in  this  report  and  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  in  the
Annual Report of the Company on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Our discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts,

other written or oral statements, which constitute forward-looking statements, from time to time. Words
such as “believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “seek,” variations of
such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Similarly,
statements  that  describe  our  future  plans,  objectives,  or  goals  also  are  forward-looking  statements.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and

Factors”  and  “Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of
Operations.”

Plan of Operation
Side-scan sonar survey operations on Project Connaught began in July of 2013. Over the course of this
initial survey, approximately 700 square miles were digitally mapped. This sonar imagery was then post-
processed and evaluated for potential targets. In October of 2014 we positively identified the target of
Project “Sailfish,” the Steamship Connaught via video and sonar imagery.  We intend to return to the site
of  the Connaught  in  2016  to  recover  its  cargo.  The  cost  of  recovering  the  cargo  of  the Connaught  is
estimated to be $1,200,000.  The Company needs additional working capital to recover the cargo of the
Connaught.  There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in securing additional
working  capital  and  therefore  cannot  represent  it  will  ever  be  in  position  to  recover  the  cargo  of  the
Connaught.
In November 2013, Endurance LLC entered into a contract with the sovereign government of an island
nation in the Indian Ocean. The contract provides us with a three-year period in which to operate within
the territorial waters of the nation with full permission to survey for and recover the “Black Marlin” and her
silver cargo.  We are currently pursuing an option to extend the existing contract. Net proceeds of our
recovery efforts, after payment of the costs to transport, store and insure any recovered items, will be split
between us (75%) and the island government (25%).  The cost of finding and recovering the cargo of the
“Black  Marlin”  is  estimated  to  be  $2,000,000.  The  Company  needs  additional  working  capital  to
undertake  the  search  for  the “Black Marlin”.    There  can  be  no  assurances  that  the  Company  will  be
successful in securing additional working capital and therefore cannot represent it will ever be in position
to search for and recover the cargo of the “Black Marlin”.
Results of Operations
The following information represents our results of operations for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015
15
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Revenue
Since inception through June 30, 2016, we  have  not  generated  any  revenues.    However,  during  this
period of time, the Company has acquired a ship, side scan sonar, topside computer processing of sonar
images and a remotely operated vehicle with cameras that can visually inspect things located by the
side  scan  sonar.    The  Company,  through  contracted  personnel,  has  also  developed  an  operational
capability for this ship and its equipment.  The Company can also access, on a contract basis, additional
ships,  equipment  and  personnel  on  a  case-by-case  basis  when  needed.    This  capability  allows  the
Company  to  offer  aquatic  research,  survey,  inspection  and  recovery,  as  well  as  maritime  contract
services  and  consulting  to  both  the  public  and  private  sectors  that  contract  for  such  equipment  and
services.  As of the time of this filing there are no agreement or contracts for the use of the Company
equipment  or  the  services  described  herein  and  the  Company  needs  additional  working  capital  to
continue to offer said equipment and services.  Therefore, the Company cannot represent that, in the
future, it will ever generate revenue from aquatic research, survey, inspection and recovery projects, as
well as maritime contract services and consulting.
Expenses
We incurred operations and research expenses of $11,138 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to $79,356 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of $68,218.  The primary
reason for this three month net decrease is due to the decreased spending on salvage operations.
We incurred marketing and promotion expenses of $2,511 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to $19,566 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of $17,055.  This decrease
is primarily due to an overall decrease in  both advertising and printing expenses.
We incurred general and administrative expenses of $27,457 for the three months ended June 30, 2016
as  compared  to  $63,648  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2015,  a  decrease  of  $36,491.    This
decrease in general and administrative costs is a result of decreased operations.
Other Income (Expense)
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, other income (expense) consisted only of interest expense of
($1,121) as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 which had interest expense of ($375)
offset by other income from a gain on cancelation of debt in the amount of $63,144.
Net Losses
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $67,848 as compared to a net loss
of $125,569 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Revenue
Since  inception  through  June  30,  2016,  we  have  not  generated  any  revenues.    However,  as  stated
above, during this period of time, the Company has acquired a ship, side scan sonar, topside computer
processing  of  sonar  images  and  a  remotely  operated  vehicle  with  cameras  that  can  visually  inspect
things located by the side scan sonar.  The Company, through contracted personnel, has also developed
an operational capability for this ship and its equipment.  The Company can also access, on a contract
basis,  additional  ships,  equipment  and  personnel  on  a  case-by-case  basis  when  needed.    This
capability  allows  the  Company  to  offer  aquatic  research,  survey,  inspection  and  recovery,  as  well  as
maritime contract services and consulting to both the public and private sectors that contract for such
equipment and services.  As of the time of this filing there are no agreement or contracts for the use of the
Company  equipment  or  the  services  described  herein  and  the  Company  needs  additional  working
capital to continue to offer said equipment and services.  Therefore, the Company cannot represent that,
in  the  future,  it  will  ever  generate  revenue  from  aquatic  research,  survey,  inspection  and  recovery
projects, as well as maritime contract services and consulting.
16
Expenses
We incurred operations and research expenses of $24,895 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared  to  $91,092  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2015,  a  decrease  of  $66,197.    The  primary
reason for this six month net decrease is a result of the decreased spending on salvage operations.
We incurred marketing and promotion expenses of $6,687 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to $19,566 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of $12,879.  This increase is
primarily due to a decrease in both advertising and printing expenses.
We incurred general and administrative expenses of $63,332 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to $101,397 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of $38,065.  This decrease in
general and administrative costs is a result of decreased operations..
Other Income (Expense)
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, other income (expense) consisted only of interest expense of
($1,496)  as  compared  to  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2015  which  had  interest  expense  of  ($750)
offset by other income from a gain on cancelation of debt in the amount of $63,144.
Net Losses
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $147,653 as compared to a net loss of
$198,780 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Current Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since  inception,  we  have  funded  our  operations  through  the  sale  of  equity  securities  and  advances
made to us by our officers and directors and their affiliated entities.
As of June 30, 2016, we had $5,920 in cash.
Net cash used by operating activities was $104,030 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
There was no cash used by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $109,125 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which
consisted  of  advances  from  related  parties  in  the  amount  of  $140,000  offset  by  $30,875  of  deferred
offering costs.
Other Recent Financings
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, Endeavour Cooperative Partners, LLC made net advances
to the Company in the aggregate amount of $140,000, in order to provide the Company with funds to
carry on its operations.  These advances do not bear interest, are unsecured and have no specific terms
of repayment.  As of June 30, 2016, the aggregate amount of such advances outstanding was $235,500.
Interest has not been imputed on this balance as management has deemed it to be immaterial.
Future Capital Requirements
Our current available cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements.  Our
capital requirements for 2016 will depend on numerous factors, including management’s evaluation of
the  timing  of  projects  to  pursue.  Subject  to  our  ability  to  generate  revenues  and  cash  flow  from
operations  and  our  ability  to  raise  additional  capital  (including  through  possible  joint  ventures  and/or
partnerships),  we  expect  to  incur  substantial  expenditures  to  carry  out  our  business  plan,  as  well  as
costs associated with our capital raising efforts and being a public company.
17
Our  plans  to  finance  our  operations  include  seeking  equity  and  debt  financing,  alliances  or  other
partnership  agreements,  or  other  business  transactions,  that  would  generate  sufficient  resources  to
ensure continuation of our operations.  .
The sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders. If we
raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could
have  rights  senior  to  those  of  our  common  stock  and  could  contain  covenants  that  would  restrict  our
operations.  Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we
were  unable  to  obtain  additional  financing,  we  may  be  required  to  reduce  the  scope  of,  delay  or
eliminate  some  or  all  of  our  planned  activities  and  limit  our  operations  which  could  have  a  material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Research and Development
For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred research and development expenses of
$545 and $0 respectively.
Application of critical accounting policies
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based
on  the  Company’s  audited  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  which  have  been  prepared  in
accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP).  The  preparation  of  financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  corresponding  disclosures  at  the  date  of  the  financial
statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On
an  ongoing  basis,  we  continue  to  evaluate  our  estimates  which  in  large  part  are  based  on  historical
experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The
results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.
Inflation
The  amounts  presented  in  the  financial  statements  do  not  provide  for  the  effect  of  inflation  on  our
operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the
effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement
costs or by using other inflation adjustments.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, we had no off balance sheet transactions that have or are reasonably likely to have
a  current  or  future  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  changes  in  our  financial  condition,  revenues  or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Not applicable.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of June 30, 2016, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as
defined  in  Rule  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended.    Our  disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to
be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period
specified  by  the  SEC’s  rules  and  forms,  and  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  management,
including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  as  appropriate  to  allow  timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. We concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.
There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended June
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls
over financial reporting.
