Item 1.01.Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 16, 2014, Halliburton Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), Baker
Hughes Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“Baker Hughes”), and Red Tiger LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger
Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to
which Baker Hughes, subject to certain conditions, will be merged with and into Merger Sub, with
Merger Sub surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”).
The Merger Agreement and the Merger have been unanimously approved by the boards of
directors of both the Company and Baker Hughes. The closing of the transactions is subject to
adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Baker Hughes, the approval by the
Company’s stockholders of the issuance of common stock of the Company (“Company
Common Stock”) to Baker Hughes’ stockholders (the “Stock Issuance”), receipt of certain
regulatory approvals and other conditions as described below. The closing of the transactions is
expected to occur in the second half of 2015.
Merger Agreement
Principal terms of the Merger Agreement include:
•  Consideration: In the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of
Baker Hughes (the “Baker Hughes Common Stock”) will be converted into the right to
receive (i) 1.12 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) $19.00 in cash (the “Merger
Consideration”).
•  Directors of the Company: Prior to the effective time of the Merger, the Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to increase the size of its board of directors (the “Company
Board”) to include, at the time of the closing, three members from the board of directors of
Baker Hughes (the “Baker Hughes Board”) who are independent with respect to the
Company and selected by mutual agreement of the Company and Baker Hughes (the
“Baker Hughes Directors”). The Company will take all necessary action to nominate the
Baker Hughes Directors for election to the Company Board in the proxy statement relating
to the first annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders following the closing.
•  Closing Conditions: In addition to customary closing conditions, the respective
obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions are subject to (1) adoption by
Baker Hughes’ stockholders of the Merger Agreement; (2) approval by the Company’s
stockholders of the Stock Issuance; (3) clearances and approvals under the rules of
antitrust and competition law authorities in various countries agreed upon among the
parties, including the United States and the European Economic Area; (4) the absence of
any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; (5) the effectiveness of a
registration statement on Form S-4 that will be filed by the Company relating to the shares
of Company Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and the approval of the listing of
such shares on the New York Stock Exchange; (6) the accuracy of representations and
warranties and the performance of covenants; and (7) the delivery of customary opinions
from counsel to the Company and Baker Hughes that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•  Representations and Warranties; Indemnification; Covenants: Baker Hughes, the
Company and Merger Sub each have made customary representations, warranties and
covenants in the Merger Agreement. Each of the Company and Baker Hughes has
generally covenanted (1) to conduct its business in the ordinary course; (2) to hold a
special meeting of its stockholders to, in the case of Baker Hughes, consider approval of
the Merger Agreement and, in the case of the Company, to approve the Stock Issuance;
and (3) subject to certain exceptions, to recommend such approvals by their respective
stockholders. Further, the Company has agreed to guarantee the full performance of all
rights to indemnification existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers and
employees of Baker Hughes, as provided in Baker Hughes’ organizational and governing
documents or under indemnification agreements, with such rights continuing in full force
and effect as obligations of the Merger Sub for not less than six years after the effective
time of the Merger. The parties have also agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with each other and respond to and comply promptly with any requests for
information with respect to antitrust and competition laws. In addition, the Company is
required to take all actions necessary to obtain antitrust clearance, provided that the
Company is not required to agree to divest or hold separate any assets or businesses or
agree to any conduct remedy or similar antitrust action regarding any assets or
businesses if such assets and businesses would account for, in the aggregate, more than
$7.5 billion of revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013.
•  No Solicitation: Each of the Company and Baker Hughes has agreed not to solicit
alternative transaction proposals and, subject to specified exceptions with respect to
unsolicited proposals, not to enter into or continue discussions or negotiations regarding
alternative transaction proposals and not to disclose nonpublic information with respect to
any alternative transaction proposal. Each of the Company Board and the Baker Hughes
Board may, in connection with the receipt of a Superior Proposal (as defined on the
Merger Agreement) or an Intervening Event (as defined in the Merger Agreement),
change its recommendation in favor of the Stock Issuance and the Merger Agreement,
respectively, subject to complying with notice and other specified conditions, including
giving the other party the opportunity to propose changes to the Merger Agreement.
•  Termination: The parties may terminate the Merger Agreement (1) by mutual written
consent; (2) if the closing has not occurred on or before October 30, 2015 (the
“Termination Date”) (subject to extension by either party one or more times to a date no
later than April 30, 2016 if all conditions have been satisfied except for antitrust approvals
or the absence of an antitrust-related injunction and except for conditions that by their
nature cannot be satisfied until the closing), provided that the party seeking to terminate
the Merger Agreement did not proximately cause the failure of the consummation of the
Merger; (3) if a governmental authority has issued a law, injunction, judgment, order or
decree which prohibits or enjoins the Merger and which shall have become permanent,
final and nonappealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate the Merger
Agreement shall have complied with its obligations to resist, lift or resolve such law,
injunction, judgment, order or decree and is not then in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement in the Merger Agreement such that the condition to
closing relating thereto is incapable of being satisfied; (4) if the required vote of the
Company’s stockholders is not obtained; (5) if the required vote of Baker Hughes’
stockholders is not obtained; or (6) due to material breaches of representations,
warranties or obligations by the other party (if not cured within 30 days of notice of such
breach). The Company may terminate the Merger Agreement if (1) the Company Board
approves entry, and enters, into a definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal, subject to
certain conditions; (2) the Baker Hughes Board adversely changes its recommendation in
favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement; or (3) Baker Hughes breaches in any
material respect its covenant not to solicit alternative transaction proposals. Baker
Hughes may terminate the Merger Agreement if (1) the Baker Hughes Board approves
entry, and enters, into a definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal; (2) the Company
Board adversely changes its recommendation in favor of the approval of the Stock
Issuance; or (3) the Company breaches in any material respect its covenant not to solicit
alternative transaction proposals.
•  Termination Fee; Reimbursement of Expenses: In the event of a termination of the Merger
Agreement under certain circumstances, the Company or Baker Hughes may be required
to pay a termination fee to the other. The Company would be required to pay to Baker
Hughes a termination fee of $1.5 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated (1) by
Baker Hughes as a result of a change in the Company Board’s recommendation to its
stockholders to approve the Stock Issuance; (2) by the Company in order to enter into a
definitive agreement with a third party in connection with a Superior Proposal; or (3) by
either party if the required vote of the Company’s stockholders is not obtained. Baker
Hughes would be required to pay to the Company a termination fee of $1 billion if the
Merger Agreement is terminated (1) by the Company as a result of a change in the Baker
Hughes Board’s recommendation to its stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement; or
(2) by Baker Hughes in order to enter into a definitive agreement with a third party in
connection with a Superior Proposal. In addition, Baker Hughes would be required to pay
to the Company a termination fee of $1 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated by
either party if the required vote of Baker Hughes’ stockholders is not obtained, there
having been a proposed alternative transaction publicly proposed or disclosed prior to
and not withdrawn at least 10 days prior to such meeting and, within twelve months of
such termination, Baker Hughes enters into a definitive agreement providing for, or
consummates, an alternative transaction with a third party. Baker Hughes would also be
required to reimburse the Company’s expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in an amount not to exceed $40
million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by either party as a result of Baker Hughes’
stockholders failing to adopt the Merger Agreement at a duly held meeting and there
having been a proposed alternative transaction publicly proposed or disclosed prior to
and not withdrawn at least 10 days prior to such meeting, provided that the termination
fee of $1 billion is not yet payable. The Company would be required to pay Baker Hughes
a termination fee of $3.5 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated (1) by either party
as a result of any antitrust-related final, nonappealable order or injunction prohibiting the
closing; (2) by Baker Hughes as a result of material breach of the Company’s antitrust-
related covenants such that the antitrust-related condition is incapable of being satisfied;
or (3) by either party as a result of the closing failing to occur on or before the Termination
Date, as it may be extended, due to the antitrust-related condition not being satisfied.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is
not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement,
a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto.
Investors are cautioned that the representations, warranties and covenants included in the
Merger Agreement were made by the Company, its subsidiaries and Baker Hughes to each
other. These representations, warranties and covenants were made as of specific
dates and only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and are subject to important exceptions
and limitations, including a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally
relevant to investors, and are qualified by information in disclosure schedules that the parties
exchanged in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not
necessarily reflected in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties
may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating risk between the
Company, its subsidiaries and Baker Hughes, rather than to establish matters as facts.
The Merger Agreement is described in this Current Report on Form 8-K and filed as Exhibit 2.1
hereto only to provide you with information regarding certain material terms and conditions, and,
except for its status as a contractual document that establishes and governs the legal relationship
among the parties thereto with respect to the transactions, not to provide any other factual
information regarding the Company, its subsidiaries or Baker Hughes or their respective
businesses or the actual conduct of their respective businesses during the pendency of the
Merger Agreement. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and
should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as
characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Company, its subsidiaries, Baker Hughes
or any other person referenced therein. Furthermore, you should not rely on the covenants in the
Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of the Company and Baker
Hughes, because either party may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the
disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate
party, which consent may be given without notice to the public.
