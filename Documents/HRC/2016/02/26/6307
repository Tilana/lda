<p><b>7/&#8230; Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p> <i>Guided </i>by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which affirms the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression,  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Right Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which reaffirms, in 
article 19, the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference, as well as the right to 
freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas 
of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art or 
through any other media of their choice and noting that these rights and freedoms are among 
those which give meaning to the right to participate effectively in a free society,  
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful also</i> that article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Politicial  Rights 
provides that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression carries with it special duties and 
responsibilities and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but that these shall be only 
such as are provided by law and are necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others, or 
for the protection of national security or of public order (<i>ordre public</i>), or of public health and 
morals, and that article 20 provides that any propaganda for war or advocacy of national, racial 
or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be 
prohibited by law,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> resolution 2005/38 on freedom of opinion and expression adopted by the 
Commission on Human Rights on 19 April 2005, and recalling all its previous resolutions on this 
issue,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression is one of 
the essential foundations of a democratic society; is enabled by a democratic environment which, 
inter alia, offers guarantees for its protection; is essential to full and effective participation in a 
free and democratic society; and is instrumental to the development and strengthening of 
effective democratic systems,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> that the effective exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression is an important indicator of the level of protection of other human rights and 
freedoms, bearing in mind that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated,  
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
continue to occur,  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the need to ensure that invocation of national security, including 
counter-terrorism, is not used unjustifiably or arbitrarily to restrict the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing also</i> the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information, including the fundamental importance of access to information, to democratic 
participation, to accountability and to combating corruption,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of all forms of the media, including the print media, radio, 
television and the Internet, in the exercise, promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression,  
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 entitled &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations 
Human Rights Council&#8221; and 5/2 entitled &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures 
Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council&#8221; and stressing that the mandate-holder shall 
discharge his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and the annexes thereto,
