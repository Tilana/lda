<p><b>I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council appointed Virginia B. Dandan as Independent Expert on 
human rights and international solidarity, effective 1 August 2011. In its resolution 18/5, 
the Human Rights Council took note of the work plan she presented at its eighteenth 
session and requested her to continue to identify areas to be addressed, the main concepts 
and norms that could form the basis of a framework, and good practices to inform the future 
development of law and policy with regard to human rights and international solidarity. 
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council requested the Independent Expert to continue her work 
in the preparation of a draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity and in further developing guidelines, standards, norms and 
principles with a view to promoting and protecting this right by addressing, inter alia, 
existing and emerging obstacles to its realization. It further requested her to take into 
account the outcomes of all major United Nations and other global summits and ministerial 
meetings in the economic, social and climate fields and to seek views and contributions 
from governments, United Nations agencies, other relevant international organizations and 
non-governmental organizations in the discharge of her mandate. 
</p>
<p>3. The Human Rights Council took note of the steps taken by the drafting group 
established by the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee and reiterated its requests to 
the Advisory Committee to consider the issue of human rights and international solidarity, 
and to prepare, in close cooperation with the Independent Expert, inputs for elaboration of 
the draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, and 
to the further development of guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a view to 
promoting and protecting this right.  
</p>
<p>4. In the same resolution 18/5, the Human Rights Council requested all States, United 
Nations agencies, other relevant international organizations and non-governmental 
organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity 
into their activities, and to cooperate with the Independent Expert on human rights and 
international solidarity in her mandate, to supply all necessary information requested by her 
and to give serious consideration to responding favourably to her requests to visit their 
country, to enable her to fulfil her mandate effectively. 
</p>
<p>5. Further, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to convene in 2012, prior to the twenty-first session of the 
Human Rights Council, a workshop for an exchange of views on, inter alia, the gender 
implications of international solidarity, the impact of a right to international solidarity in 
achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the realization of the right to 
development, with the participation of representatives from all interested States, the 
Independent Expert, the members of the Advisory Committee dealing with this issue, and 
civil society.   
</p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert acknowledges with appreciation, the previous work done by 
her predecessor Rudi Muhammad Rizki, who passed away in 2011, which will be taken 
into account in her own work. The outcomes of her own activities will be consolidated with 
his past work to comprise the empirical basis of a draft declaration on the right of peoples 
and individuals to international solidarity to be submitted to the Council by 2014. </p>


<p><b> II. Cooperation with the Human Rights Council Advisory 
Committee 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Independent Expert participated in the eighth meeting of the Human Rights 
Council Advisory Committee, during its preliminary consideration of its draft paper on 
human rights and international solidarity prepared by its drafting group 
(A/HRC/AC/8/CRP.1) as input to the work of the Independent Expert on a draft declaration 
on human rights and international solidarity, pursuant to the Council&#8217;s resolutions 9/2, 12/9 
</p>
<p>and 15/13. She presented her views about human rights and international solidarity and 
expressed her appreciation for the support and assistance of the Committee, stating that the 
mandate would benefit greatly from its guidance and wisdom.  
</p>
<p>8. She gave an update of her activities since she was appointed as mandate holder, and 
outlined her workplan. She commented on the draft paper prepared by the drafting group, 
pointing out how some parts would eventually inform the principles that will guide the draft 
declaration on international solidarity, which she will deliver to the Human Rights Council 
by 2014. 
</p>
<p>9. Advisory Committee members and the Independent Expert exchanged views on 
suggestions to further build the rationale to formulate the concept of human rights and 
international solidarity, including taking a closer look at the hard evidence from multilateral 
treaties emphasizing solidarity through commitments made by States, and the issue of 
international cooperation as a duty of States. The chairperson of the drafting group 
informed the Independent Expert that the draft paper would be adjusted in the light of the 
views she presented, and that the Committee intended to finalize at its next meeting the 
draft paper prepared by the working group.  
</p>
<p>10. A number of Human Rights Council member States took the floor to express 
appreciation for the cooperation between the Independent Expert and the Advisory 
Committee, and stated their views, including on: the relationship of international solidarity 
and the right to development in promoting all human rights; international solidarity being 
understood within the context of sustainability, peaceful coexistence and equity; the 
importance of preventive solidarity; and international cooperation for mutual benefit. The 
Independent Expert invited two members of the Advisory Committee to participate in the 
expert workshop held in Geneva on 7 and 8 June 2012, pursuant to Council resolution 18/5.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Expert workshop on human rights and international 
solidarity 
</b></p>
<p>11. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 18/5, the Expert Workshop on 
Human Rights and International Solidarity was held in Geneva on 7 and 8 June 2012, 
convened under the auspices of the Independent Expert on human rights and international 
solidarity.   
</p>
<p>12. In the same resolution, the Council also requested the Independent Expert to present 
a summary of the discussions held at the workshop, in conformity with the programme of 
the work of the Council. 
</p>
<p>13. A summary of the discussions held at the workshop is set out in the Addendum to 
this report. </p>


<p><b> IV. Country study mission: Brazil 
</b></p>
<p>14. International solidarity is an elusive concept, and is particularly resistant to 
definition, rendering it almost an abstraction. But where it exists, it is unmistakeable, 
permeating thought and action, its effects observable. For this reason the Independent 
Expert is of the belief that her task of developing norms and standards for what will 
eventually lead to the formulation of a draft declaration of the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity, calls for dialogue with States, United Nations and 
other international agencies, and as many stakeholders as possible.  
</p>
<p>15. Beyond this important consideration, it is critical to take into account the policy and 
actual practice of States which are vital conduits of international solidarity, and of 
international cooperation. The Independent Expert therefore considers that the most 
effective and appropriate way to understand policy on, and practice of, international 
solidarity is through empirical methods of study and observation on the ground. 
</p>
<p>16. The Independent Expert conducted her first official country study mission to Brazil 
from 25 to 29 June 2012, for the purpose of exchanging views with the Government and 
other actors, to gather information on the experiences of Brazil in international solidarity, 
including and in particular, in the context of its international cooperation activities.  
</p>
<p>17. The Independent Expert expresses her deep appreciation to the Government of 
Brazil for providing her the opportunity to observe and learn first-hand what she had only 
previously read and heard about regarding the &#8213;solidarity diplomacy&#8214; of Brazil, which has 
generated a growing interest on the part of the international community. The study visit 
took place in the Brasilia, home to government ministries and agencies. She was also in Rio 
de Janeiro in the week previous to the country visit, to attend Rio+20, and she was able to 
intersperse her activities at the conference, with visits to a government institution and to a 
regional agency whose offices are based in Rio de Janeiro. 
</p>
<p>18. The Independent Expert valued the warm reception she received from the 
Government of Brazil and its institutions dealing with international cooperation, as well as 
its openness in discussing a range of topics relevant to her mandate. She notes with 
appreciation that while the government officials she met with expressed their pride, and 
rightfully so, when speaking of the numerous high profile achievements of Brazil, including 
the attainment of a number of Millennium Development Goals well before the deadline of 
2015, they also readily acknowledged and identified the many difficulties and obstacles that 
remain to be addressed and surmounted. 
</p>
<p>19. During the country study mission, the Independent Expert met with officials of 
Government engaged in policy matters and activities in international cooperation. At the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Brasilia she met with the Director of the Brazilian  
Cooperation Agency (ABC); the Secretary for Cooperation and Trade Promotion; the 
Undersecretary General for Political Affairs I; the Undersecretary General for Policy II; the 
Director of the Department of the Environment and Special Themes; Director of the 
Department of Human Rights and Social Affairs; International Advisors at the Secretariat 
for Human Rights, Secretary for Policies for Promotion of Racial Equality and the 
Secretary for Policies for Women; the General Coordinator of International Actions against 
Hunger and his team; the Head of the Division of Educational Cooperation; the Head of the 
Division of Science, Technology and Innovation. 
</p>
<p>20. At government ministries in Brasilia, the Independent Expert met with the Secretary 
of Labour Inspection and her team; the General Coordinator for Cooperation of the 
Ministry of Health and his team; the Chief of the International Advisory Council, officials 
of the International Department of the Ministry of Social Development and Fight Against 
Hunger; officials of the Secretariat for Science and Technology and for Social Inclusion; </p>


<p>the International Advisor to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation; the 
Technical Cooperation Coordinator of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation 
(Embrapa), the Ministry of Agriculture; the Division Manager of the Bank of Brazil 
Foundation; and the Chief Counsel for International Affairs and Trade Promotion of the 
Ministry of Agrarian Development. 
</p>
<p>21. At the Presidency of the Republic, the Independent Expert met with the Special 
Advisor to the Foreign Policy Unit of the Office of the President of Brazil and his team. 
She also met with the President of the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA) and 
her team. She attended the National Council on Food Security (CONSEA) where she made 
a brief presentation on her mandate and the objectives of her study visit. 
</p>
<p>22. At the Brazilian Congress, the Independent Expert met with the Chair of the Human 
Rights Committee of the Senate and the Vice-Chair of the Human Rights Committee of the 
Lower House and former President. She also met with another member of parliament who 
was twice Chair of the Committee.  
</p>
<p>23. In Rio de Janeiro, the Independent Expert met with the Executive Director of the 
South American Institute of Government in Health (ISAGS) and his team; and with the 
Director of the Centre for International Relations of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation 
(Fiocruz) and his colleagues. 
</p>
<p>24. Consultation meetings were held with representatives of United Nations agencies in 
Brazil and with civil society organizations. A meeting was also held with the United 
Nations Resident Coordinator.  
</p>
<p>25. The Independent Expert thanks all of the above for their courtesies and the time 
shared with her. She is grateful to Carlos da Cunha Oliveira and his team, the focal point at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responsible for the country study mission, Maria Nazareth 
Farani Azev&#234;do, Permanent Representative of Brazil to the United Nations in Geneva, and 
her team at the Permanent Mission, for their support and assistance. 
</p>
<p>26. The consultations and dialogues of the Independent Expert with officials of the 
Government of Brazil have been consolidated into the summary account below, the primary 
consideration being given to the relevance of such information to the policy and practice of 
international solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Features of Brazilian international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>27. The 1988 Federal Constitution of Brazil lays down a number of principles that 
govern Brazilian international relations, among which are national independence, the 
prevalence of human rights, self-determination, non-intervention, and cooperation among 
peoples for the progress of mankind. These principles are underpinned by the solidarity of 
Brazilian society, which is also enshrined in the Constitution, and together are applied in 
building a policy of international cooperation integrated into foreign policy goals. 
</p>
<p>28. These Constitutional principles that govern international relations have shaped the 
features of Brazilian cooperation in the spirit of solidarity, as Brazil seeks to contribute to 
the social and economic progress of other countries through the sharing of lessons learned, 
knowledge gained from successful experiences, and best practices. Brazil makes use of 
solutions created and developed domestically to support other countries facing similar 
difficulties in overcoming obstacles to their development. 
</p>
<p>29. Brazilian cooperation is based on requests received from other countries, with 
paramount consideration given to their specific needs, as well as in response to 
humanitarian appeals from international specialized agencies. There are no conditions 
imposed and it is not profit oriented. The cooperation is driven by solidarity and adheres to </p>


<p>the requirements of the Brazilian Constitution on non-intervention, respect for sovereignty 
and self-determination.  
</p>
<p>30. The head of the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC) described Brazilian 
cooperation as an exchange between equals, rather than an interaction between donor and 
recipient. Brazilian cooperation is in the image of the Brazilian people, a nation with mixed 
societies that live in peace. They are in many ways idealistic, and despite the poverty, a 
strong feeling of solidarity, rather than pity, prevails. Cooperation should be seen as more 
than solving problems; it is a dialogue between nations and peoples to address problems 
together. 
</p>
<p>31. An important feature of Brazilian technical cooperation is that both partners learn 
from each other in the exchange of experiences and knowledge, affirming &#8213;reciprocal 
</p>
<p>solidarity&#8214; among peoples. It is a participatory engagement in which partner countries are 
not passive recipients but are actively involved right from the stage of negotiation, ensuring 
that cooperation methodology is appropriate to the context of the local reality. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Structure and scope 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Brazilian Cooperation Agency, which is affiliated to the Ministry of External 
Relations, is the agency mandated to negotiate, coordinate, implement and monitor 
technical cooperation programmes in which Brazil participates. ABC provides guidance to 
other Brazilian agencies regarding cooperation opportunities involving Brazil, supporting 
the preparation of projects, coordinating negotiations between the parties involved, 
monitoring and evaluating project implementation, and publicizing information on project 
development and results. This has made it possible to propagate technical knowledge from 
Brazilian institutions to their counterparts in more than 80 developing countries. It therefore 
requires a commitment to cooperation on the part of public agencies and entities, private 
universities and civil society organizations involved in the partnership. 
</p>
<p>33. Brazilian international technical cooperation is a demand-driven process based on 
solidarity between developing countries, with the aim of helping partner countries to 
strengthen their institutions and human resources. Thus the main goal of Brazilian South-
South technical cooperation is capacity development. Partner countries benefit from an 
effective transfer of knowledge, and from the exchange of experiences previously 
developed under similar socio-economic realities. 
</p>
<p>34. Technical cooperation, scholarships for foreigners, international humanitarian 
cooperation, and contribution to international organizations are the main modalities of what 
Brazil defines as &#8213;Brazilian cooperation for international development.&#8214; Agriculture, food 
</p>
<p>security and nutrition, health, education and vocational training are the key areas of 
cooperation. Brazilian cooperation in Africa also aims to strengthen relations with African 
Portuguese-speaking countries (PALOPs): Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, 
Mozambique, and S&#227;o Tom&#233; and Pr&#237;ncipe. The key focus for Asian cooperation projects is 
in East Timor, with an emphasis on agriculture and food security, education, the judicial 
system, vocational training and public administration. Brazil has recently initiated relations 
with four Asian countries that belong to the group of Least Developed Countries (LDC): 
Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>35. South-South cooperation contributes to consolidating the relations of Brazil with 
partner countries as it enhances general interchange; generates, disseminates and applies 
technical knowledge; builds human resource capacity; and, mainly, strengthens institutions 
in all nations involved while at the same time reinforcing public policies in Brazil. Brazilian 
cooperation agreements are in place with 30 developing countries in South, Central and </p>


<p>North America and the Caribbean. Brazil also maintains technical cooperation programmes 
with 38 African countries, 22 of which belong to the group of Least Developed Countries.  
</p>
<p>36. Brazil implements triangular technical cooperation guided by the same principles 
that inform its South-South cooperation. Triangular cooperation makes it possible to match 
the comparative advantage from South-South Cooperation and other development partners 
(bilateral and multilateral), leveraging the impact of knowledge sharing between developing 
countries.. These factors result in greater positive impact in fostering local development 
processes. Brazil has implemented or is implementing agreements of triangular cooperation 
with the United States, the European Union and its members, Japan, in African countries 
and in Latin America and the Caribbean. United Nations agencies are also playing an 
important role in Brazilian international cooperation including the International Labour 
Organization, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World 
Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The World 
Health Organization, UNAIDS, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and 
UN Women are also partnering with Brazil.  
</p>
<p>37. Brazil is also engaged in other modes of cooperation consistent with the principles 
applied to their other forms of cooperation and which are presently in the initial phase of 
implementation, including the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) In the interregional context, the India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum 
(IBSA) created in 2003 by the three countries, established the IBSA Fund for Alleviation of 
Poverty and Hunger, a pioneer initiative created in 2004 with the purpose of identifying 
replicable and scalable projects that can be jointly adapted and implemented in interested 
developing countries. Best practices of the three countries are shared with least developed 
countries through projects financed by the IBSA Fund, in areas such as agriculture 
development and food security, safe drinking water, health care and infrastructure, waste 
collection and recycling, and building capacity to combat HIV/AIDS. Also in the 
interregional sphere two important initiatives with growing importance are the Africa-South 
America Summit (ASA) and Arab Countries-South America Summit (ASPA). 
</p>
<p>(b) In the regional context, the South American Institute of Government in 
Health (ISAGS) is an intergovernmental entity that is a member of the South American 
Health Council of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) inaugurated in 2011 
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The strategic areas of the UNASUR five-year health plan are the 
South American health vigilance and response network, universal health system 
development, universal access to medication, health promotion and health determinants, 
human resources and management.  Committed to implementing the South American 
Health Agenda and the scope of priorities in the UNASUR 2010-2015 Five-Year Health 
Plan, ISAGS accordingly focuses its actions on the following strategies: interchange and 
training of human resources; lines of research and diagnostics; accumulation and 
dissemination of knowledge on governance in health; organization of the supply and 
demand for cooperation; and promotion of networking.  
</p>
<p>38. ABC has established a programme named Brazilian Technical Cooperation: 
Agriculture, Food Security and Social Policies for the 2011-2012 biennium. The 
programme consists of 24 short courses in 40 to 80 class hours, being held in Brazil for 
interested parties from countries in the Caribbean, Africa, Central and Southern Asia, the 
Pacific, Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. It is being implemented by ABC in collaboration 
with 20 Brazilian agencies with renowned competency in the fields of agriculture, the 
environment, fisheries and aquaculture, food safety, rural development, food safety policy 
and gender policy. Brazil believes this to be a legitimate example of South-South 
cooperation as it also expects to learn from partners, since all parties involved benefit from 
international technical exchange. </p>


<p><b> C. Good practices in international solidarity and cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>39. In the following summary, good practices are cited on the basis that their outcomes 
carry great potential for providing an enabling environment for the realization of human 
rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Agriculture and food security: towards realizing the right to food   
</b></p>
<p>40. Agriculture is a major field of Brazilian cooperation with Southern partners., the 
Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) under the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Livestock and Food Supply, has been one of the most important actors in the field of the 
country&#8217;s technical cooperation in agriculture. Its mission is to provide research, 
development and innovation towards finding feasible solutions for the sustainable 
development of agriculture for the benefit of the Brazilian society. Its research focus is 
concentrated on areas of fundamental importance for the development of the country. 
</p>
<p>41. Embrapa&#8217;s work is key to the success of Brazilian tropical agriculture, which has 
motivated countries with similar problems and challenges to seek information and 
partnership with Embrapa. International cooperation has been crucial in the establishment 
and consolidation of Embrapa, today considered the most advanced tropical agriculture 
research institute in the world. 
</p>
<p>42. It has a strong post-graduate programme, which has sent hundreds of young 
professionals abroad, to the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, the 
Netherlands, Germany and Australia. Projects funded by the World Bank, Inter-American 
Development Bank and the Japanese Government have been very important in financing 
this human development programme and also in equipping the research units. Embrapa 
presently has 46 research centres and is a major conduit for the cooperation of Brazil with a 
number of countries, to transfer its experiences and technology, and to adapt these to local 
conditions in partner countries.   
</p>
<p>43. Brazil has shared with partner countries its expertise in access and food  
production&#8212;genetic improvement; enhanced planting, irrigation and harvest methods; use 
of agricultural machinery; animal husbandry; and animal product processing&#8212;and in 
marketing. Brazil has sought to enhance food security and nutrition through strengthening 
family agriculture and has been particularly successful in establishing farmer cooperatives 
in order to add value to their produce and to increase family income. Sharing of best 
practices consolidated by the Brazilian Government with developing countries expands the 
geographic scope of Brazilian cooperation and introduces policies and programmes 
implemented successfully in Brazil to lift its people out of poverty. 
</p>
<p>44. The Africa-Brazil Agricultural Innovation Marketplace initiative is a process that 
focuses on generating benefits for smallholder farmers and producers. The objective of this 
initiative is to enhance agricultural innovation for development on the African continent 
through establishment and strengthening of partnerships between African and Brazilian 
organizations, engaging the full range of actors involved in the generation of agricultural 
knowledge including those in the fields of research, academia, the private sector, non-
governmental organizations, producers, and policymakers. The Marketplace was developed 
by Embrapa and the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA), with support from 
the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), the International 
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Bank, the Brazilian Cooperation 
Agency, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This South-South collaboration with 
active Northern support is making an important contribution to more productive agriculture 
and more affordable food for the poor in Africa, complementing other ongoing efforts. The 
same initiative has recently started implementation in another region, the Latin-American </p>


<p>and Caribbean (LAC) region. It is known as the LAC-Brazil Agricultural Innovation 
Marketplace. 
</p>
<p>45. A programme to provide support to the development of the cotton industry in C4 
Countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali), also known as the Cotton 4 Project, was 
set up in 2008 with the official support of the Brazilian Government for the WTO Cotton 
Initiative, brought forward by C4 countries as a result of their losses due to subsidy policies 
used in the international cotton market. The objectives of the project are: to contribute to 
enhancing the development of the cotton industry in C4 countries; to transfer Brazilian 
technology to increase the profitability of the cotton supply chain and to improve the 
quality of life and food security and nutrition levels in beneficiary countries. 
</p>
<p>46. Brazilian policies, experiences, and focus on social programmes provide an 
important element of linkage between goals set by the Caribbean, South and Central-
American countries with regard to development. Working with the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), the Brazilian Government is already implementing South-South 
Cooperation programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean, sharing its experiences and 
policies to promote food security in the region. 
</p>
<p>47. Of particular relevance are Brazilian programmes such as <i>Fome Zero</i> (Zero Hunger), 
now discontinued but covered by the<i> Brasil sem Mis&#233;ria</i> (Brazil without Extreme Poverty) 
programme,and activities supported by the Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA), the 
Ministry of Social Development (MDS) and the National Fund for Education Development 
(FNDE), inter alia, targeting social protection networks and agricultural development which 
have a clear research-based, pro-development focus on the poor and hungry.  
</p>
<p>48<i>. Fome Zero</i> has inspired a similar programme in Nicaragua and in other LAC 
countries. There are other similar programmes with similar ideas being implemented all 
over Latin America by the World Food Programme (WFP). Another important programme 
is the Purchase from Africans for Africa (PAA Africa Programme). The project draws on 
the expertise accumulated by Brazil in its own food purchasing programme and carried out 
by Brazil, FAO and WFP, the project extends financing for food purchases to five African 
countries (Ethiopia, Niger, Malawi, Mozambique and Senegal), aiming to benefit local 
small farmers and vulnerable populations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Health and the social determinants of health: towards realizing the right to health 
</b></p>
<p>49. Health is a priority both on the Brazilian domestic agenda and for international 
cooperation, where it applies its structural approach, characterized by efforts to develop 
individual and institutional capacity in partner countries, with sustainable results.  
</p>
<p>50. The main Brazilian cooperation projects in Africa and South America therefore 
focus on human resource training, capacity-building in research, teaching or services, and 
on strengthening or setting up health system institutions including ministries of health, 
schools of public health, national health institutes, faculties for higher professional training, 
polytechnic health colleges, technological development and production institutes and 
factories. The public health system of Brazil and its international health cooperation are 
based on the principle of universal access to the public health system.  
</p>
<p>(a) A trilateral agreement between Haiti, Cuba and Brazil is focused on the 
implementation of Haitian health structures, the establishment of a national outpatient 
system, the training of health workers, especially middle-level staff that the system urgently 
needs, and the control of infectious diseases. It involves the complete rebuilding of the 
health system to make it more capable of meeting the health needs of the Haitian people. 
The day after the earthquake, parameters were established to guide the reconstruction of the 
Haitian health system. One of the aims of the agreement is the provision of universal access </p>


<p>and the achievement thereof is based on the population&#8217;s wish to participate in the 
rebuilding of the country and its ability to develop innovative forms of solidarity. 
</p>
<p>(b) The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), affiliated with the Brazilian 
Ministry of Health, is involved in the establishment of an antiretroviral production plant in 
Mozambique. The project includes multidisciplinary implementation such as training of 
local technical staff in surveillance, inspection, certification and control of medication, and 
also its production and commercialization processes, so that the Mozambican regulatory 
agency can efficiently implant the antiretroviral (ARV) production plant. Fiocruz is 
renowned worldwide as a leading research centre for the control of diseases such as 
HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, inter alia. One of Fiocruz&#8217;s main missions is 
manufacturing strategic products for the Brazilian Unified Public Health System (SUS).  
With one of the largest public pharmaceutical laboratories in the country&#8212;the Drug 
Technology Institute (Farmanguinhos)&#8212;Fiocruz has vast experience in production 
technologies for drugs used in HIV/AIDS treatment. 
</p>
<p>51. Brazil&#8217;s first Human Milk Bank (HMB) was opened in 1943. In 1985, as a result of 
research, technology development, teaching and consultancy work invested by Fiocruz, 
HMBs developed to become the key elements in the establishment of what is known today 
as the world&#8217;s largest and most complex HMB network, the foremost government strategy 
</p>
<p>to reduce infant mortality. It is a model that combines high reliability and technical 
accuracy at a low operating cost. In 2001, the World Health Organization awarded the 
HMB network a prize for the greatest contribution to reducing infant mortality and 
promoting breastfeeding in the 1990s. International cooperation is increasing steadily as a 
result of the efforts of the Brazilian Cooperation Agency, with 19 projects already 
implemented in Latin America and the Caribbean, together with initiatives reproducing the 
Brazilian model in African countries. European countries such as Portugal and Spain have 
adopted the HMB technology developed by Brazil. 
</p>
<p><b>  Social protection: towards realizing the right to an adequate standard of living  
</b></p>
<p>52. The international policies of Brazil on cooperation mirror its domestic social policies 
such as: <i>Brasil sem Miseria</i> (Brazil without extreme poverty) <i>Fome Zero </i>(Zero Hunger), 
the National School Feeding Programme, <i>Bolsa Fam&#237;lia </i>(conditional cash transfer 
programme), <i>Luz para</i> <i>Todos</i> (electricity for all), <i>Casa para Todos</i> (housing for all), and 
most recently <i>Brasil Carinhoso</i> (Caring Brazil), an extension of <i>Bolsa Familia</i> especially 
for families with children 0 to 6 years old.  
</p>
<p>53. Given the positive results achieved in recent years, the Brazilian government 
through its Ministry of Social Development and Fight against Hunger, has been encouraged 
to put a special effort on social policy technology transfer, and to strengthen social 
development beyond its borders, putting into practice the so-called &#8213;diplomacy of social 
policy&#8214; that is presently being implemented. 
</p>
<p>54. International cooperation in the social field is guided by: a focus on building 
institutional capacities in partner countries; the importance of the multiplier effect in 
cooperation projects; cultural and linguistic similarities; and the transfer of social 
technology adaptable to local contexts. The following are a few examples of ongoing 
cooperation. 
</p>
<p>(a) Brazil-Africa Programme for cooperation on social protection is the outcome 
of a partnership between the Ministry of Social Development, UK-DFID and the 
International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth (IPC-IG). The cooperation was developed 
in four areas: regional technical cooperation, technical assistance, study missions and 
distance learning. The countries involved are Angola, Ghana and Mozambique. </p>


<p>(b) Promoting the right to adequate food through the reduction of social and food 
vulnerability of populations in African countries by strengthening programmes for local 
purchase of food supply, such as government and United Nations agencies&#8217; strategy for 
assistance and food aid, including school feeding programmes, also for humanitarian 
purposes, as in the case of the PAA Africa Programme. Partner countries are Ivory Coast, 
Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal and Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p>(c) Cooperation between Brazil, the United Kingdom and Ghana to support the 
design of the Livelihoods Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) programme of the 
Government of Ghana. 
</p>
<p>(d) In El Salvador: programme for promoting the institutional strengthening of 
entities involved in social policy management and implementation; optimizing the 
decentralized management of social policies and programmes; promoting the intersectoral 
commitment of all stakeholders to mobilize local, regional, national and international 
resources for implementation and management of social programmes and policies; 
supporting the formulation process of a normative proposal for the institutionalization of 
the Salvadoran social protection system; the creation of mechanisms to improve the 
dialogue between government and civil society; improving the ability of effective capacity 
of Salvadoran social policies and programme managers; promoting the integration of the 
children and adolescents protection system in El Salvador. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Remarks by the Independent Expert 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Independent Expert reiterates that the preceding paragraphs comprise only a 
summary account of some of her observations from her country study mission in Brazil. As 
such, the summary does not reflect other information that was gathered during her visit. To 
provide a broader frame of reference and a closer examination of the practices of 
international solidarity in the international cooperation programmes of Brazil, a full report 
will be forthcoming in this respect, and will be submitted to the 24th session of the Human 
Rights Council in September 2013.  
</p>
<p>56. Given what she has observed and learned from her first country study mission to 
Brazil, the Independent Expert commends the Government of Brazil for its policy and 
practice of solidarity in its international cooperation programme in all its modalities, both in 
South-South and triangular cooperation contexts. She is impressed by the iterative reference 
to solidarity as the driving force of Brazilian cooperation, across all ministries and offices 
of Government without exception which are involved in cooperation projects. 
</p>
<p>57. From this first country study mission, the Independent Expert has come to realize 
that in examining the interface between good practices of international solidarity in 
international cooperation and the realization of human rights, partnerships should be 
studied from both angles for a full validation of the impact of such practices. She hopes 
therefore, that her next country study mission will be to one of the partner countries of 
Brazil in Africa. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>58. Since taking office on 1 August 2011, in addition to the undertakings described 
above, the Independent Expert has released media messages on the following occasions: the 
Durban Climate Change Conference otherwise known as COP17; UN International Human 
Solidarity Day celebrated annually on December 20; and Rio+20. She also joined other 
special procedures mandate holders in media statements on the imperative of human rights </p>


<p>in Rio+20; in support of a global Financial Transaction Tax, and calling attention to the 
remaining gaps in the attainment of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>59. The Independent Expert was a speaker in various forums, notably in the following. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Human Rights Council panel discussion on the </b>theme: &#8220;The way 
<b>forward in the realization of the right to development: between policy 
</b></p>
<p>and practice&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>60. The panel discussion was held in Geneva on 14 September 2011 on the occasion of 
the 25th anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development (General Assembly 
resolution 41/128). The panel was moderated by the President of the Human Rights Council 
and opened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>61. The focus and objectives of the panel discussion were to enhance understanding of 
the contribution and potential of the Declaration on the Right to Development to thinking, 
policy and practice on development; to reflect on how the right to development could be 
implemented in the context of contemporary political, social, environmental and financial 
challenges; and to contribute to the shaping of future work on the effective implementation 
of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>62. The Independent Expert was one of the three panellists invited to present seminar 
papers on the theme and to participate in the interactive discussion following their 
presentations. Her paper dealt with how the achievement of the millennium development 
goals and the right to development call for a more enlightened approach based on a sense of 
community and international solidarity. Much could be learned from everyday people, who 
lived their lives in community, addressed their problems and eventually found solutions, 
coming together in solidarity, in the exercise of their right to development.1 
</p>
<p><b> B. 2011 Social Forum 
</b></p>
<p>63. In accordance with resolution 16/26 of the Human Rights Council, the 2011 Social 
Forum was held in Geneva from 3 to 5 October 2011. The 2011 Social Forum focused on 
the right to development and heard expert presentations, each complemented by interactive 
exchange of views, leading to recommendations in relation to the promotion and effective 
realization of the right to development, including the role and contribution of civil society, 
and of international assistance and cooperation.  
</p><p>64. The Independent Expert participated in the thematic panel on &#8213;The Declaration on 
the Right to Development at 25&#8214;, in which she pointed out that international solidarity 
should be an indispensable component of efforts to realize the right to development, which 
would help to lessen the gap between developed and developing countries, by buttressing 
rhetoric and declarations with tangible actions.2 
</p>
<p><b> C. </b>People&#8217;s Summit 2012, Rio+20<b> 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Independent Expert was one of the five speakers in a panel held on 18 June 
2012 at the People&#8217;s Summit in Rio de Janeiro, organized parallel to Rio+20 by civil 
society human rights and development organizations in the Latin American region. The 
</p>
<p>  
 1  See A/HRC/19/39 for a summary of the panel discussion.  
 2  See A/HRC/19/70 for the summary, conclusions and recommendations. </p>


<p>theme of the forum was on &#8213;the new role of rights-based organizations in the promotion of 
social and environmental justice.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>66. The Independent Expert spoke on the role of international solidarity in supporting 
the global agenda on sustainable development. She called for &#8213;solidarity cooperation,&#8214; 
</p>
<p>urging States and civil society to work together, building on their commonalities and 
surmounting differences in the spirit of partnership and mutual respect, for the sake of our 
common future.  
</p>
<p>67. An interactive discussion with the audience followed the presentations of the five 
speakers. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. International solidarity in outcomes of major United Nations 
and other global summits and ministerial meetings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Climate Vulnerable Forum, Dhaka Ministerial Meeting  
</b></p>
<p>68. The Dhaka 2011 Ministerial Meeting of the Climate Vulnerable Forum was hosted 
from 13 to 14 November 2011 by the Bangladesh Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Ministry of Environment and Forest, and its outcome is contained in the Dhaka 
Declaration.3 
</p>
<p>69. The Climate Vulnerable Forum brings together in a global partnership of 
governments from Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, with the common goal of the 
urgent resolution of the increasing climate crisis these countries confront, being most 
vulnerable to the harmful effects of climate change. The Forum members are Afghanistan, 
Bangladesh, Barbados, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Kiribati, Madagascar, 
Maldives, Nepal, Philippines, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, 
Vanuatu and Vietnam. 
</p>
<p>70. Since its inception, the Forum has met with considerable success in presenting the 
concerns of vulnerable countries as well as in creating an awareness and appreciation in 
international climate talks.  
</p>
<p>71. Highlights of the Dhaka Declaration include an acknowledgment in its preamble of 
the expression of solidarity of the United Nations Secretary-General and the request for him 
to use all means available to his Office to promote the cause of the Climate Vulnerable 
Forum; a call for a common framework/criteria for assessing climate vulnerability with 
respect to the allocation of funds,4 and for the immediate implementation of paragraph 14 
(f) of the Framework Convention on Climate Change (&#8213;Cancun Agreements&#8214;) 
(FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1), which recognizes that migration is a viable adaptation strategy 
to address human displacement induced by climate change, and includes undertaking 
measures to enhance understanding, coordination and cooperation with regard to climate-
induced displacements; migration and planned relocation; and call for the commencement 
of an international dialogue for an appropriate framework.5

<p><b> B. Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness  
</b></p>
<p>72. Busan, Republic of Korea, was the venue for the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid 
Effectiveness, from 29 November to 1 December 2011, where over 3,000 delegates met to 
review progress on implementing the principles of the Paris Declaration and discuss how to 
maintain the relevance of the aid effectiveness agenda in the context of the evolving 
development landscape. 
</p>
<p>73. The forum culminated in the signing of the Busan Partnership for Effective 
Development Co-operation by ministers of developed and developing nations, emerging 
economies, providers of South-South and triangular co-operation.6 For the first time in the 
history of the High Level Forum, a civil society representative took part in the actual 
negotiating process, marking a critical turning point in development cooperation. 
Furthermore, the language of the partnership emphasizes the link between fighting poverty 
and protecting human rights. 
</p>
<p>74. The Busan Partnership forges a &#8213;new global partnership&#8214; embracing diversity and 
acknowledging the distinct roles that all stakeholders in cooperation can play to support 
development. It is founded on a common set of principles guiding all forms of development 
cooperation, while at the same time recognizing how these principles differ in their 
application by various public and private stakeholders.  It stresses how lessons should be 
shared by those who participate in development cooperation such as South-South 
cooperation. It welcomes the contribution of civil society organizations and private actors. 
The partnership resolves to work together to learn from their achievements and 
innovations.7 
</p>
<p><b> C. Durban Climate Change Conference (28 November-1 December 2011) 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Durban Climate Change Conference held in Durban, South Africa consisted of a 
series of events, including the 17th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP17), the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the seventh 
meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto 
Protocol (CMP7). The COP17/CMP7 resulted in agreements to begin the process of forging 
a new treaty in 2012 to be completed by 2015 and coming into effect by 2020; to establish 
the Green Climate Fund; and to extend the life of the Kyoto Protocol for a number of 
countries.  
</p>
<p>76. The Conference resulted in 19 COP decisions and 17 CMP decisions and the 
approval of a number of conclusions by the subsidiary bodies. One of these subsidiary 
bodies was the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex 1 Parties under 
the Kyoto Protocol, whose outcome document contains the main agreements regarding the 
continuation of the Kyoto Protocol in its second commitment period, and includes in its 
preamble the importance of developing a comprehensive global response to the problem of 
climate change. 
</p>
<p>77. The major outcome document of the Conference is the Establishment of an Ad-Hoc 
Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action to launch the process for 
developing a protocol under the Convention, applicable to all parties.8

<p><b> D. UNCTAD XIII  
</b></p>
<p>78. The Thirteenth Ministerial Meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTAD XIII), held from 21 to 26 April 2012 in Doha, Qatar, adopted two 
outcome documents: the Doha Mandate and the Doha Manar, an Arabic word meaning 
&#8213;beacon.&#8214; These two documents affirm the core activities of UNCTAD, and declare its 
member States&#8217; solidarity in their quest for &#8213;a prosperous world.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>79. The Doha Mandate focuses on the theme &#8213;development-centred globalization: 
towards inclusive and sustainable growth and development&#8214;, contributing to reducing 
poverty and creating jobs. It confirms the role of UNCTAD as the United Nations focal 
point for the integrated treatment of trade and development, and related issues in the areas 
of finance, technology, investment and sustainable development. It stresses that UNCTAD 
should contribute to global efforts to transition toward a green economy.9 
</p>
<p>80. The Doha Manar is the closing declaration of UNCTAD XIII, stating on behalf of 
the 194 member States that: &#8213;Together, as a collection of sovereign nations, we have 
</p>
<p>endeavoured to construct a shared, interdependent and prosperous world through increased 
economic, political and social processes. By working to maximize the opportunities arising 
from globalization in international trade and investment, we have sought to promote 
economic growth and development with particular attention to reducing the inequalities 
between us and within our nations, and to improving our capacities to fulfil common 
purposes and exercise more effective and responsible stewardship of our natural and 
planetary resources. Above all, we have sought to fulfil, individually and collectively, our 
peoples&#8217; aspirations to live in peace and to enjoy in fullness, lives that are rich and diverse, 
and ever more stable and secure.&#8214;10 
</p>
<p><b> E. United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development: Rio+20 
</b></p>
<p>81. Rio+20 was held in Rio de Janeiro, from 20 to 22 June 2012. The very first line of 
its outcome document is an implicit affirmation of the spirit and principle of international 
solidarity informing the renewal of the commitment to sustainable development as a result 
of the meeting of Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives, and 
notably referring to the &#8213;full participation of civil society&#8214;, and &#8213;ensuring the promotion of 
</p>
<p>an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future for our planet and for 
present and future generations.&#8214; It is this same spirit of international solidarity that suffuses 
the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities set out in principle 7 of the Rio 
Declaration on Environment and Development. 
</p>
<p>82. The essence of international solidarity is implicit throughout the outcome document 
in its references to partnerships and cooperation, particularly in the attainment of the 
Millennium Goals, together with the need to strengthen international cooperation to address 
the challenges related to sustainable development. The outcome document emphasizes that 
sustainable development requires the engagement and action of a &#8213;broad alliance of people, 
</p>
<p>governments, civil society and the private sector, all working together to secure the future 
we want for present and future generations.&#8214;11 </p>

</p>
<p> </p>


<p>83. The following is a non-exhaustive sampling of a number of concepts from the 
outcome document which are directly linked to the notion of international solidarity for the 
realization of sustainable development, with the corresponding paragraph numbers 
indicated: the full and effective participation of all countries in global decision-making; 
supporting developing countries in their efforts at poverty eradication and promoting 
empowerment of the poor and people in vulnerable situations; the importance of gender 
equality and the empowerment of women for sustainable development and our common 
future; holistic and integrated approaches to sustainable development to guide humanity to 
live in harmony with nature; the active participation of major groups and other stakeholders 
as appropriate in processes contributing to the decision-making processes of sustainable 
development policies; the need to promote intergenerational dialogue and solidarity; the 
need to impart new momentum to the cooperative pursuit of sustainable development; 
enhance international cooperation in support of disaster risk reduction in developing 
countries; protection of the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations 
of humankind on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but 
differentiated responsibilities; the importance of a set of sustainable development goals that 
are consistent with international law, build upon commitments already made, and contribute 
to the full implementation of the outcomes of all major summits in the economic, social and 
environmental fields, including the present outcome document; the need for enhanced 
capacity-building for sustainable development and strengthening technical and scientific 
cooperation, including North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation.

<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Concept Note for the Expert Workshop on Human Rights and 
International Solidarity prepared by the Independent Expert sets out the structure of 
</b></p>
<p><b>her work, in three stages. Stage One consists of the work done by her predecessor, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>which international solidarity was affirmed in a variety of ways. In Stage Two, 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards, norms and principles to guide a draft declaration are being developed. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Stage Three will be devoted to writing the draft declaration on the right of peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b>and individuals to international solidarity, which will culminate in its submission to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Human Rights Council, in 2014. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Beyond serving merely as an index of the activities undertaken by the 
Independent Expert over the past twelve months since her appointment</b> <b>by the 
Council, this first report maps out how she intends to proceed in the ongoing Stage 
</b></p>
<p><b>Two on her way to Stage Three, towards her destination by 2014.  
</b></p>
<p><b>The present can thus be described as a period of gathering from the vast field of 
</b></p>
<p><b>concepts and practices in international solidarity and human rights which already 
</b></p>
<p><b>exist and which need not be reinvented. The present is also a period of listening to 
</b></p>
<p><b>what is being said, and just as importantly, to what is not being said, by voices 
</b></p>
<p><b>speaking whether in agreement or disagreement. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>During the Expert Workshop, participants were asked to suggest what the 
Independent Expert should include in her conclusions and recommendations to this 
</b></p>
<p><b>annual report. They offered the following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> To draft a resolution appealing for States to apply international solidarity in 
order to overcome the negative impacts of globalization.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>To initiate the task of describing the responsibilities relating to accountability 
derived from international solidarity, and of defining the actors at local, national and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transnational levels without necessarily defining entitlements.  </b></p>


<p>89. <b>To define the relationship of international solidarity to all human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> To compile standards developed by special procedures which refer to 
international solidarity.  
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> To consult with donor and recipient States on the topic of the right of peoples 
and individuals to international solidarity, not just on the Declaration but also on 
</b></p>
<p><b>general related issues from which specific inputs could be derived for the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Independent Expert will continue to listen, and continue to study and 
observe through the lens of human rights. She looks forward to the pursuit of Stage 
</b></p>
<p><b>Two of her work.
