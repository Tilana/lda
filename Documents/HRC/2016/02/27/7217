<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to its resolution 
</p>
<p>27/19, In the report, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, covers the 
</p>
<p>period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015, particularly in the context of the deterioration in 
</p>
<p>the security situation in Yemen since September 2014.  
</p>
<p>2. During the period under review, the increasing level of insecurity in Yemen severely 
</p>
<p>hampered the capacity of the Country Office of the Office of the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>(OHCHR) in Yemen to implement effectively its overall mandate, namely, that of 
</p>
<p>monitoring allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and violations and 
</p>
<p>abuses of international human rights law, and also of undertaking a wide range of human 
</p>
<p>rights activities, including capacity-building for national stakeholders. Notwithstanding the 
</p>
<p>afore-mentioned challenges, the present report is primarily based on human rights 
</p>
<p>monitoring carried out by OHCHR in Yemen and includes information provided by other 
</p>
<p>United Nations entities operating in Yemen. Unless specifically stated, all reports of 
</p>
<p>violations and abuses have been verified or cross-checked with a number of independent 
</p>
<p>and credible sources.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political developments and security situation  
</b></p>
<p>3. During the period under review, Yemen was afflicted by increasing tensions that 
</p>
<p>seriously compromised progress in a range of political and human rights developments. On 
</p>
<p>8 March 2014, presidential decrees No. 26/2014 and 27/2014 established a constitutional 
</p>
<p>drafting commission and named its 17 members, including four women. The decrees 
</p>
<p>provided that the drafting of the Constitution would be followed by public consultations 
</p>
<p>and a referendum within one year. That process was interrupted when violent outbreaks 
</p>
<p>increased in September 2014, with an immediate impact on the security situation in Sana&#8217;a 
</p>
<p>and several main cities in the country.  
</p>
<p>4. Tensions began to grow in June and July 2014, when an armed offensive was 
</p>
<p>launched in Amran Governorate by members of the Popular Committees, affiliated with the 
</p>
<p>Houthi movement,1 led by Abdel Malik al-Houthi, in conjunction with deserters from the 
</p>
<p>Yemeni Armed Forces and tribesmen loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh,2 against 
</p>
<p>troops from the 310th Armoured Brigade of the Yemeni Army, led by Brigadier General 
</p>
<p>Hamid Mohammed al-Qushaibi, as well as armed groups affiliated with the Islah party3 that 
</p>
<p>are also in conflict with the Houthis. Those clashes reportedly resulted in at least 204 
</p>
<p>casualties and the displacement of tens of thousands of people in June and July 2014 alone.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, is a movement based on the Zaidi doctrine, and followers of 
</p>
<p>the late Hussein al-Houthi, who was killed by the Yemeni Armed Forces in September 2004. The 
</p>
<p>Houthis are known to have a large presence in the northern Governorate of Sa&#8217;ada.  
</p>
<p> 2 Ali Abdullah Saleh was the president of Yemen from 1990 until 2012, and previously served as 
</p>
<p>President of North Yemen from 1978 until unification with South Yemen in 1990. In November 
</p>
<p>2011, following widespread protests against his Government, Saleh signed an agreement prepared by 
</p>
<p>the Gulf Cooperation Council whereby he agreed to transfer power to the then Vice-President, Abd 
</p>
<p>Rabbo Mansour Hadi, in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.  
</p>
<p> 3 The Islah is the name commonly used to refer to the Yemeni Congregation for Reform, a Yemeni 
</p>
<p>political party established in 1990 and believed to be affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. </p>


<p>5. On 9 July 2014, the Popular Committees attacked and took over Amran city (Amran 
</p>
<p>Governorate), north of Sana&#8217;a. The day before, Brigadier General Al-Qushaibi was killed in 
</p>
<p>clashes between the Popular Committees and the 310th Armoured Brigade. The 
</p>
<p>circumstances of his death remain unclear. Although allegations were made that Al-
</p>
<p>Qushaibi had been detained then executed, OHCHR was unable to verify them. The arsenal 
</p>
<p>in possession of the 310th Armoured Brigade fell into the control of the Popular 
</p>
<p>Committees. Their takeover of Amran aggravated the vulnerability of the capital and of the 
</p>
<p>sitting Government. 
</p>
<p>6. On 18 August 2014, tens of thousands of pro-Houthi demonstrators took to the 
</p>
<p>streets in Sana&#8217;a and several other cities to protest against the Government, blaming 
</p>
<p>President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi for failing to carry out the reforms promised. Abdel 
</p>
<p>Malik al-Houthi called upon President Hadi to dissolve the Government and reinstate fuel 
</p>
<p>subsidies, which had been abolished on 30 July 2014, resulting in a net increase in the cost 
</p>
<p>of fuel and other goods. Following the first day of demonstrations, members of the Popular 
</p>
<p>Committees began arriving in Sana&#8217;a, establishing protest camps in different locations 
</p>
<p>within the city, including nearby several ministries. Counter demonstrations by pro-
</p>
<p>Government supporters were held in Sana&#8217;a throughout the following month, some of 
</p>
<p>which degenerated into violent clashes between opponents.  
</p>
<p>7. On 29 August 2014, the Security Council adopted a statement by the President of 
</p>
<p>the Council, expressing grave concern about the deterioration of the security situation in 
</p>
<p>Yemen, and recalling that individuals or entities threatening the country&#8217;s peace, security or 
</p>
<p>stability could be subject to targeted sanctions (S/PRST/2014/18). 
</p>
<p>8. On 2 September 2014, President Hadi dismissed his cabinet and called upon the 
</p>
<p>Houthi leadership to participate in a new government. He also agreed to partially reinstate 
</p>
<p>fuel subsidies. The Houthis rejected the proposal and threatened to escalate their protests. In 
</p>
<p>the weeks that followed, fighting escalated in Al-Jawf Governorate between Houthis and 
</p>
<p>armed groups affiliated with the Islah party. 
</p>
<p>9. Fighting also broke out in Sana&#8217;a between supporters of the Houthis and government 
</p>
<p>forces as the Popular Committees launched an offensive on the city. OHCHR was informed 
</p>
<p>by witnesses that, between 18 and 21 September 2014, a total of 22 State buildings and the 
</p>
<p>premises of civil society organizations were seized and occupied by members of the 
</p>
<p>Popular Committees across Sana&#8217;a. 
</p>
<p>10. On 21 September 2014, President Hadi, together with Houthi delegates and major 
</p>
<p>political parties, signed the Peace and National Partnership Agreement to stop the fighting. 
</p>
<p>The Agreement called for a new, technocratic government to be established within one 
</p>
<p>month and for the reduction of fuel prices by 25 per cent. It also stipulated that President 
</p>
<p>Hadi should appoint two advisers from the Houthis and Al-Hirak,,4 and a new Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister within the first three days of the signing. On the following day, Houthi forces 
</p>
<p>attacked and seized the headquarters of the Sixth Regional Military Command (previously 
</p>
<p>known as the First Armoured Division) in Sana&#8217;a. At around the same time, Al-Hirak 
</p>
<p>renewed calls for independence and, on 14 October 2014, staged a demonstration with tens 
</p>
<p>of thousands of people in Aden in support of secession. Over the following weeks, pro-
</p>
<p>independence rallies continued in a number of cities, principally in Aden.  
</p>
<p>11. On 7 November 2014, pursuant to Security Council resolution 2140 (2014), in 
</p>
<p>which the Council established a panel of experts to investigate those who engaged in or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4  Al Hirak (&#8220;the Southern Movement&#8221;) is a political movement operating in the territory of what was 
</p>
<p>formerly South Yemen before it unified with the Republic of Yemen in 1994. The movement calls for 
</p>
<p>the independence of the South from the Republic of Yemen. </p>


<p><b> 5 
</b></p>
<p>provided support for acts that threatened the peace, security or stability of Yemen, the 
</p>
<p>Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2140 (2014) (2140 
</p>
<p>Sanctions Committee) designated three individuals as the subject of an assets freeze and 
</p>
<p>travel bans: Abd al-Khaliq al-Houthi and Abdullah Yahya al-Hakim, Houthi military 
</p>
<p>commanders; and Ali Abdullah Saleh, President of Yemen&#8217;s General People&#8217;s Congress 
</p>
<p>party and former President of Yemen. 
</p>
<p>12. On 7 January 2015, the Constitutional Drafting Committee submitted the draft 
</p>
<p>Constitution to President Hadi. On 17 January 2015, Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, Chief of 
</p>
<p>Staff of President Hadi and Secretary-General of the National Dialogue Conference, was 
</p>
<p>abducted by the Popular Committees while travelling to a meeting organized by the 
</p>
<p>national body to approve the draft Constitution. The draft was eventually endorsed by 16 of 
</p>
<p>the 17 members of the Constitutional Drafting Committee. The Houthis were opposed to 
</p>
<p>the draft, in particular the division of the country into six administrative regions. On 18 
</p>
<p>January, President Hadi ordered the security forces to restore government control over 
</p>
<p>Sana&#8217;a, large sections of which had been seized by the Popular Committees, affiliated with 
</p>
<p>the Houthis, since September 2014. On 19 January 2015, fighting broke out in Sana&#8217;a 
</p>
<p>between Houthi forces and members of the presidential guards. On the following day, the 
</p>
<p>Houthis seized the presidential palace and the residence of President Hadi, who was then 
</p>
<p>placed under house arrest, together with other senior officials.  
</p>
<p>13. On 21 January 2015, President Hadi and the Houthis announced a 10-point 
</p>
<p>agreement, including provisions to revise the draft Constitution and to allow the Houthis to 
</p>
<p>appoint new members to the Government. On 22 January, President Hadi, Prime Minister 
</p>
<p>Khaled Bahah and the entire Cabinet resigned. On 25 January, the Parliament was 
</p>
<p>scheduled to consider the resignation but its session was postponed; as at July 2015, it had 
</p>
<p>not reconvened. On 21 February 2015, President Hadi escaped to Aden, announcing that he 
</p>
<p>intended to continue to exercise his presidential functions. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister 
</p>
<p>and key ministers remained under house arrest by the Popular Committees affiliated with 
</p>
<p>the Houthis. On 19 March, the presidential palace in Aden came under aerial attack, 
</p>
<p>allegedly by pro-Houthi members of the Yemeni Air Forces. President Hadi fled to Saudi 
</p>
<p>Arabia on 25 March.  
</p>
<p>14. On 24 March 2015, President Hadi requested the Gulf Cooperation Council and the 
</p>
<p>League of Arab States to intervene militarily, citing Article 51 of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations (S/2015/217). On 25 March, a number of States members of the Gulf Cooperation 
</p>
<p>Council and the League of Arab States, led by Saudi Arabia, formed a coalition to initiate 
</p>
<p>military action alongside other countries against the Houthis, in response to President 
</p>
<p>Hadi&#8217;s request. On 26 March, coalition forces5 launched an aerial military campaign against 
</p>
<p>Houthi military targets in Yemen. The Government of the United States of America 
</p>
<p>announced that it would provide logistical and intelligence support for the coalition. In 
</p>
<p>addition to air strikes, coalition naval forces imposed a blockade on the ports of Aden and 
</p>
<p>Al-Hudaydah.  
</p>
<p>15. On 15 April 2015, the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Yemen, Jamal 
</p>
<p>Benomar, announced his resignation. Ismail Oud al-Cheikh Ahmed was appointed as the 
</p>
<p>new Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen on 25 April.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 The coalition consists of all the States members of the Gulf Cooperation Countries (with the 
</p>
<p>exception of Oman), as well as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and the Sudan.  </p>


<p><b> B. Humanitarian situation 
</b></p>
<p>16. The humanitarian situation began to deteriorate following the Houthi takeover of the 
</p>
<p>capital and other cities, beginning in September 2014. The armed conflict began to escalate 
</p>
<p>on 26 March 2015, when the  coalition forces commenced its aerial strikes and imposed a 
</p>
<p>naval blockade on the main seaports in Yemen. This dramatically worsened an already dire 
</p>
<p>humanitarian situation, particularly in the worst affected areas, such as Sa&#8217;ada, Hajjah, 
</p>
<p>Taizz, Al-Dhale&#8217;e, Aden and Lahj. As at June 2015, the humanitarian country team 
</p>
<p>estimated that 20.4 million people required humanitarian assistance in Yemen, in particular 
</p>
<p>water, protection, food and health care.6  
</p>
<p>17. Yemen essentially depends on commercial food and fuel imports to meet the basic 
</p>
<p>needs of the population. More than 90 per cent of food is imported. At the end of the period 
</p>
<p>under review, approximately 12.3 million people &#8211; about half the country&#8217;s population &#8211; 
</p>
<p>suffered to some degree from food insecurity. Furthermore, as much as 80 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>population relies on some form of assistance to maintain access to safe drinking water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation.7 Severe import restrictions, caused mainly by the naval blockade imposed by the 
</p>
<p>coalition forces during the conflict, have also aggravated the humanitarian situation, 
</p>
<p>resulting in fuel scarcity, which adversely affects the distribution of food and water, as well 
</p>
<p>as the functionality of hospitals.  
</p>
<p>18. Given that all domestic fuel refineries were forced to stop operating by to the 
</p>
<p>security situation, the country was heavily dependent on imported fuel.8 In April and May 
</p>
<p>2015, fuel imports were equivalent to only 1 per cent and 18 per cent respectively of the 
</p>
<p>total estimated fuel needs.  
</p>
<p>19. The humanitarian country team estimated that, as at June 2015, some 15.1 million 
</p>
<p>people required assistance to obtain basic health care. Some 1.5 million women and 
</p>
<p>children were in need of nutrition supplies, and 2.9 million children required emergency 
</p>
<p>access to education. About 1.2 million people (1 million internally displaced persons and 
</p>
<p>200,000 vulnerable host communities) required support for access to emergency shelter and 
</p>
<p>essential goods. Moreover, the humanitarian country team reported more 7,000 cases of 
</p>
<p>dengue fever since March 2015.9 
</p>
<p><b> C. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>20. Yemen is a party to seven of the nine core international human rights treaties and to 
</p>
<p>the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Despite approval 
</p>
<p>by the Cabinet, the Parliament has yet to approve the ratification of a number of human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments, namely, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
</p>
<p>from Enforced Disappearance, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

<p> 9 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, 19 June 
</p>
<p>2015. </p>


<p><b> 7 
</b></p>
<p>21. Yemen is a party to all four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and to 
</p>
<p>Additional Protocols I and II thereto, and to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions 
</p>
<p>on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively 
</p>
<p>Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects. 
</p>
<p>22. Yemen is also bound by customary international law, including customary 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law and customary international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>23. As a State party to the above-mentioned conventions, Yemen is legally bound to 
</p>
<p>respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of those within its jurisdiction. In addition, all 
</p>
<p>parties to the conflict in Yemen, including Saudi Arabia and other members of the 
</p>
<p>coalition, are obliged to respect the applicable rules of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>These include the obligations to respect the principles of distinction and proportionality, 
</p>
<p>and to take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population. Civilians and civilian 
</p>
<p>objectives are protected from attack. Hospitals, schools and religious sites are also subject 
</p>
<p>to heightened protections, and attacks on them have an impact on peoples&#8217; enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>their rights, including to health, education and freedom of religion. Parties to the conflict 
</p>
<p>must also allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of impartial humanitarian relief 
</p>
<p>for civilians in need. It is important to recall that a situation of armed conflict does not 
</p>
<p>exempt any State from its human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>24. While non-State actors cannot formally become parties to international human rights 
</p>
<p>treaties, non-State actors that exercise government-like functions and de facto control over 
</p>
<p>a territory are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations when their conduct affects the human rights of the individuals under their 
</p>
<p>control.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Situation of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conduct of hostilities 
</b></p>
<p>25. For years, Yemen has been torn by conflicts between different political and 
</p>
<p>ideological forces. The current conflict between the Government of Yemen and the armed 
</p>
<p>groups has polarized the country in an unprecedented manner. The subsequent intervention 
</p>
<p>of the coalition forces intensified hostilities. 
</p>
<p>26. The information reported below was gathered by OHCHR in Yemen, which has 
</p>
<p>continued to monitor the situation closely despite the security-related challenges, and while 
</p>
<p>having to relocate its international staff members to Amman intermittently since May 2014. 
</p>
<p>The stringent security restrictions and the intensification of the conflict have required 
</p>
<p>serious limitations to access to the areas where people have been most affected by the 
</p>
<p>violence. As a result, OHCHR was unable to verify the vast majority of allegations of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and abuses or violations of humanitarian law that had been reported 
</p>
<p>in relation to the ongoing conflict. The information below highlights examples of 
</p>
<p>allegations of attacks that were documented by OHCHR in Yemen throughout the period 
</p>
<p>under review.  
</p>
<p>27. In September 2014, the armed confrontation spread to Sana&#8217;a, resulting in further 
</p>
<p>casualties. According to the Ministry of Public Health, a total of 274 people, including 
</p>
<p>civilians, were killed as a result of fighting between Yemeni Armed Forces and the Popular 
</p>
<p>Committees between 17 and 21 September 2014.  
</p>
<p>28. According to information received by OHCHR, 1,527 civilians were killed and 
</p>
<p>3,548 injured between 26 March and 30 June 2015 as a result of the conflict, including by 
</p>
<p>air strikes. Of the casualties, at least 941 civilians were killed and 2,295 injured by coalition </p>


<p>air strikes, while 508 civilians were killed and 954 injured by joint operations led by the 
</p>
<p>Popular Committees and military forces loyal to former President Saleh in ground battles. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, 54 civilians were killed and 234 injured as a result of other armed 
</p>
<p>confrontations between parties to the conflict, while at least 24 civilians were killed and 65 
</p>
<p>injured in attacks claimed by Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula,10 mainly in Sana&#8217;a, Aden 
</p>
<p>and Taizz. 
</p>
<p>29. OHCHR received reports that at least 310 civilian infrastructures were partially or 
</p>
<p>completely destroyed by coalition air strikes and ground fighting throughout the country 
</p>
<p>from 26 March to 30 June 2015. They included 160 private homes and 150 civilian public 
</p>
<p>infrastructures that were partially or completely destroyed by the armed conflict. Of the 
</p>
<p>civilian public infrastructures, 95 civilian public buildings were affected by coalition air 
</p>
<p>strikes while 48 were damaged by shelling attributed to the Popular Committees. In 
</p>
<p>addition, four civilian public buildings were partially or completely destroyed by the local 
</p>
<p>armed groups opposing the Houthis as a result of armed clashes between the two opponent 
</p>
<p>groups. Lastly, at least three civilian public buildings were partially or completely 
</p>
<p>destroyed as result of attacks claimed by Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. 
</p>
<p>30. According to information received, at least 15 heritage sites, including the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site 
</p>
<p>of Old Sana&#8217;a and the Seera Castle in Aden were damaged by the armed conflict between 
</p>
<p>26 March and 30 June 2015. Sites were damaged by included air strikes, rocket attacks, 
</p>
<p>artillery shelling and ground fighting. Sites were also used for military advantage by 
</p>
<p>members of the Popular Committees and military units loyal to former President Saleh.  
</p>
<p>31. In addition, according to information available to OHCHR, 53 health facilities were 
</p>
<p>damaged or affected, and 96 schools were damaged, while 67 were used by armed groups 
</p>
<p>in the 18 governorates affected.11 
</p>
<p>32. According to satellite imagery acquired by the United Nations Institute for Training 
</p>
<p>and Research Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNITAR-UNOSAT) on 7 
</p>
<p>January and 17 May 2015, a total of 1,171 structures had been affected by the conflict: 
</p>
<p>approximately 273 structures had been destroyed, 271 were severely damaged and 627 
</p>
<p>moderately damaged. In addition, 35 impact craters were found within the city, the majority 
</p>
<p>of which were located along the runway of Sadah City Airport. Four medical facilities were 
</p>
<p>identified within 100 metres of damaged and destroyed buildings; it is possible that they 
</p>
<p>also sustained some damage. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been verified in 
</p>
<p>the field by OHCHR. Data will be cross-referenced and verified with the figures collected 
</p>
<p>above in due course.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Allegations of violations and abuses by the Popular Committees and forces loyal to Ali 
</b></p>
<p><b>Abdullah Saleh  
</b></p>
<p>33. OHCHR received reports that the Popular Committees affiliated with the Houthis 
</p>
<p>launched attacks that damaged public schools, mosques and Koranic schools. For example, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemeni chapter of Al-Qaida, is the result of the union of the 
</p>
<p>Saudi and Yemeni branches of Al-Qaida in January 2009. Its stated objectives include the overthrow 
</p>
<p>of the regime in Sana&#8217;a, and to kill Western nationals and their allies, including members of the Saudi 
</p>
<p>royal family. The group has been in conflict with the Government of Yemen since its establishment. 
</p>
<p>The Houthi advance has resulted in violent clashes with its fighters and has emboldened Al-Qaida in 
</p>
<p>the Arabian Peninsula in its quest to expand their control and recruit fighters from Sunni tribes, 
</p>
<p>claiming that the Houthis are Shia forces supported by the Islamic Republic of Iran.

<p><b> 9 
</b></p>
<p>according to witness accounts, the Popular Committees reportedly launched an attack in 
</p>
<p>early July 2014 that resulted in, inter alia, the destruction of a school in Beit al-Fakih and 
</p>
<p>the Dar al-Quran Mosque in Amran city. On 11 July 2014, the Al-Salam mosque was 
</p>
<p>reportedly occupied by the Popular Committees during the Friday sermon.  
</p>
<p>34. OHCHR received reports that, on 21 February 2015, in Lahj Governorate, three 
</p>
<p>civilians were killed as a result of shelling from the Anad Military Base, which is controlled 
</p>
<p>by forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. OHCHR interviewed witnesses but 
</p>
<p>was unable to verify the presence of any military targets that would justify these attacks.  
</p>
<p>35. On 31 March 2015, at least 20 employees at a cement factory in Lahj were killed 
</p>
<p>and 36 others injured as a result of shelling from Al-Anad military base. The base was 
</p>
<p>under the control of the Houthi and Saleh armed groups when the attack took place. 
</p>
<p>Vehicles and buildings were also destroyed. OHCHR documented structural damage to 
</p>
<p>three hospitals and 13 educational institutions in Al-Dhali Governorate as a result of intense 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate shelling, from 25 to 27 March, targeting residential areas by the 33rd 
</p>
<p>Armoured Brigade loyal to former President Saleh. According to information received by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, the hospitals affected included Al-Nasr Hospital (operated by Medecins sans 
</p>
<p>Fronti&#232;res) in Qasha&#8217;, Al-Salamah Hospital and Al-Dhali Hospital. Educational institutions 
</p>
<p>damaged by shelling include Al-Jumrok Faculty of Education, the Tadhamon Faculty of 
</p>
<p>Education and the Al-Dhali Community College. 
</p>
<p>36. On 10 April 2015, two civilians were killed and five others were injured as a result 
</p>
<p>of shelling allegedly by members of the Popular Committees. The shelling hit the Al-Salam 
</p>
<p>Area, Khormaksar District, Aden. All seven victims were inside their homes, which were 
</p>
<p>destroyed by the shelling launched during violent clashes near the Badr military base. 
</p>
<p>37. On 22 April 2015, in one incident in Crater District, in Aden, a child was shot in the 
</p>
<p>head and killed, and a man and a woman from the same family injured as a result of what 
</p>
<p>was apparently a sniper attack launched from the Al-Yafai building in the Al-Qate&#8217;e area. It 
</p>
<p>is believed that the area was controlled by the Popular Committees.  
</p>
<p>38. On 6 May 2015, a civilian was shot in the head and killed, allegedly by a sniper on 
</p>
<p>the roof of the Education College building in Al-Humaira village, Al-Dhali, under the 
</p>
<p>control of the Popular Committees affiliated with the Houthis.  
</p>
<p>39. On 16 May 2015, in Al-Mesrakh city (Taizz Governorate), eight civilians, including 
</p>
<p>four children and three women, were killed and two women and a child were wounded as a 
</p>
<p>result of artillery shelling reportedly launched from the position of the 22nd Armoured 
</p>
<p>Brigade, affiliated with the Popular Committees.  
</p>
<p>40. On 30 May 2015, in Sanah district (Al-Dhali Governorate), two civilians were 
</p>
<p>killed, including a woman, while 12 others were injured, including three children, as a 
</p>
<p>result of artillery shelling apparently launched from the area of the Al-Menshar military 
</p>
<p>location in Khobar. The attack was reportedly launched by members of the Popular 
</p>
<p>Committees and the 33rd Armoured Brigade loyal to former President Saleh. OHCHR 
</p>
<p>received reports that members of the Popular Committees and the 33rd Armoured Division 
</p>
<p>loyal to former President Saleh were shelling the villages of Khobar, Al-Kabeh, Al-Rebat, 
</p>
<p>Lakmaht Salah and Jouss Al-Jamal. The number of civilian casualties could therefore be 
</p>
<p>even higher.  
</p>
<p>41. On 9 June 2015, in the area of Sanah, Al-Dhali, seven civilians were killed, 
</p>
<p>including four children, and nine others, including a child, were injured as a result of 
</p>
<p>shelling by the 33rd Armoured Brigade loyal to former President Saleh. In the same 
</p>
<p>incident, 13 private houses were moderately or severely damaged. 
</p>
<p>42. On 11 June 2015, a child was reportedly killed after sustaining a gunshot wound to 
</p>
<p>the arm. Family members who witnessed the incident and interviewed by OHCHR reported </p>


<p>that the child was standing next to his mother queuing to purchase ice in Souq Al-Taweel 
</p>
<p>Market Area, Crater District, Aden. The shooting reportedly came from the direction of a 
</p>
<p>position held by combatants of the Popular Committees. On 12 June, nine civilians were 
</p>
<p>killed in Al-Mansourah, in Aden following artillery shelling reportedly carried out by 
</p>
<p>members of the Popular Committees. 
</p>
<p>43. Since the escalation of the conflict in Yemen on 26 March, OHCHR has 
</p>
<p>documented the killing of at least 18 civilians as a result of apparent sniper attacks in Aden, 
</p>
<p>Al-Dhali and Taizz.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Allegations of violations committed by coalition and joint government forces </b></p>
<p>44. Information gathered by OHCHR indicated that, on 30 March 2015, the coalition 
</p>
<p>forces launched a number of air strikes that hit the al-Mazraq camp for internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons in Harad.12 At least 19 civilians were reportedly killed and 35 others injured, 
</p>
<p>including 11 children. The camp, which shelters some 4,000 people, was established by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations in 2009 and, at the time of the attack, hosted at least 300 families recently 
</p>
<p>displaced from Sa&#8217;ada. Information provided to OHCHR did not identify the presence of 
</p>
<p>any military objectives in the area. 
</p>
<p>45. At least 20 civilians were killed and 59 others injured when a dairy factory was 
</p>
<p>directly hit in four air strikes in Hudaydah city (Al Hudaydah Governorate), on 31 March 
</p>
<p>2015. The people killed inside the factory were personnel. On 12 May, at least 43 civilians, 
</p>
<p>including eight women and 12 children, were killed, while an additional 135 were injured 
</p>
<p>as a result of four air strikes that directly hit the Al-Wajeeh building located in a busy 
</p>
<p>commercial hub in Zabeed (Al-Hudaydah Governorate). The majority of the casualties 
</p>
<p>belonged to Al-Muhamasheen community. The information received by OHCHR did not 
</p>
<p>clarify whether the building was deliberately targeted. 
</p>
<p>46. On 20 April 2015, at least 87 civilians were killed, including six children and two 
</p>
<p>women, and at least 647 others injured as a result of airstrikes that appeared to be directed 
</p>
<p>at the Faj Attan military base in Sana&#8217;a. Hundreds of homes and private businesses in the 
</p>
<p>vicinity of the base (as far as Al-Tahrir Square) were damaged. 
</p>
<p>47. On 21 April 2015, 40 civilians were killed, including seven children, and 70 
</p>
<p>civilians were injured as a result of air strikes that hit the Al-Dhaleel bridge (Ibb 
</p>
<p>Governorate). Reports indicated that the connection bridge between Ibb and the main route 
</p>
<p>to Sana&#8217;a Governorate was hit twice by air strikes, causing a large number of civilian 
</p>
<p>casualties. People were arriving to assist those injured by the first explosion when missiles 
</p>
<p>were launched in a second round of air strikes. 
</p>
<p>48. OHCHR received reports alleging that, in late April 2015 in Sa&#8217;ada Governorate, 
</p>
<p>cluster munitions were used by the coalition forces in several air strikes, which resulted in 
</p>
<p>at least six civilian casualties, including children. Owing to the continuing airstrikes, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR was unable to collect any further information. 
</p>
<p>49. On 5 May 2015, fighters from the Popular Committees from the Bakil al-Meer tribe 
</p>
<p>(in Hajjah) attacked areas of Najran city, including what appeared to be civilian objects, 
</p>
<p>and also reportedly attacked Saudi border guard posts. In retaliation, on 8 May, coalition 
</p>
<p>forces announced a military operation against Sa&#8217;ada, warning civilians to stay away from 
</p>
<p>what they said were Houthi locations and crowds. In particular, the coalition forces 
</p>
<p>declared the cities of Marran and Sa&#8217;ada military zones. According to Saudi State television 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 OHCHR, &#8220;Yemen: The world must be prepared for rapid collapse into mass displacement crisis &#8211; UN 
</p>
<p>expert&#8221;, 8 April 2015.  </p>


<p><b> 11 
</b></p>
<p>channel Al-Ekhbariya, flyers announcing the operation were released over Old Sa&#8217;ada. 
</p>
<p>According to information received by OHCHR, the limited availability of fuel, the 
</p>
<p>particularly challenging terrain, and barely operational telecommunications services 
</p>
<p>prevented tens of thousands of civilians from complying with the ultimatum launched by 
</p>
<p>the coalition.  
</p>
<p>50. Despite the obstacles, thousands of inhabitants fled from Sa&#8217;ada to the neighbouring 
</p>
<p>governorates of Amran and Hajjah, while at least 15,984 were internally displaced within 
</p>
<p>Sa&#8217;ada. Although OHCHR was unable to obtain detailed information on affected cities and 
</p>
<p>resulting casualties, it was informed that coalition air strikes hit at least six residential 
</p>
<p>homes and five markets in Sa&#8217;ada, reportedly with no evidence of Houthi military 
</p>
<p>deployment.  
</p>
<p>51. On 6 May 2015, 15 civilians were killed, including four children and three women 
</p>
<p>from the same family, when two homes collapsed while the families were inside. The 
</p>
<p>homes were hit by two air strikes in Al-Dhaid, Sa&#8217;ada.  
</p>
<p>52. OHCHR gathered information indicating that, on 7 June 2015, coalition forces 
</p>
<p>conducted air strikes against an area hosting a high concentration of internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons in Duaij village (Hajjah Governorate), allegedly killing four civilians, including 
</p>
<p>three women, and injuring 41 civilians, including 12 women and 16 children. Four 
</p>
<p>makeshift homes for displaced persons were allegedly destroyed in that incident. On 14 
</p>
<p>June, a family of 10, including four women and two children, were allegedly killed in Al-
</p>
<p>Hamza as a result of an air strike by coalition forces that struck their vehicle travelling from 
</p>
<p>Al-Jawf to Sana&#8217;a.  
</p>
<p>53. OHCHR documented allegations that, on 17 June 2015, two buses transporting 
</p>
<p>displaced families were hit by air strikes conducted by coalition forces in Al-Alam (Abyan 
</p>
<p>Governorate). It found that 17 civilians had been killed in the incident, including five 
</p>
<p>women and five children, while 10 others, including two women and three children, had 
</p>
<p>been injured. The victims were reportedly fleeing the violence from Al-Mansoura district 
</p>
<p>(Aden Governorate), and were on their way to Hadramout.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Armed drones </b></p>
<p>54. OHCHR was informed of reports of drone strikes in parts of the country with 
</p>
<p>allegations of civilian casualties. The attacks are believed to have been conducted by joint 
</p>
<p>forces of the United States of America and Yemen as part of a campaign against Al-Qaida 
</p>
<p>in the Arabian Peninsula. OHCHR received reliable information indicating that as many as 
</p>
<p>40 civilians, including a child, may have been killed during the period under review as a 
</p>
<p>result of drone attacks in Al-Baida, Al-Jawf, Marib and Shabwah. According to a Yemeni 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organization, a one-year-old boy and two adults were killed on 26 
</p>
<p>January 2015 after a Yemeni Air Force drone struck a vehicle at Huraib (in Marib 
</p>
<p>Governorate). The victims were in a car reportedly suspected of transporting members of 
</p>
<p>Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. No official investigation had been conducted at the end 
</p>
<p>of the period under review.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Arbitrary detention, allegations of torture and other ill-treatment and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prison conditions 
</b></p>
<p>55. Despite Cabinet decision No. 180 (2012) to release all those detained in relation to 
</p>
<p>their participation in the uprising 2011 against the former Government of Yemen, 16 </p>


<p>individuals continued to be held in pretrial detention in connection with the events. No 
</p>
<p>charges were brought against them nor were they tried during the period under review.13  
</p>
<p>56. OHCHR received reports indicating that at least 124 people, many believed to be 
</p>
<p>civilians, were detained by the Popular Committees between 3 and 21 November 2014 in 
</p>
<p>unrecognized places of detention, including the Amran Sport Stadium and in private homes 
</p>
<p>throughout Amran Governorate. The circumstances of detention are not known, given that 
</p>
<p>OHCHR was denied access to the detainees.  
</p>
<p>57. On 7 December 2014, OHCHR was informed by representatives of the Governorate 
</p>
<p>of Amran that about 250 men had been detained by members of the Popular Committees at 
</p>
<p>the Amran sports stadium. According to OHCHR sources, the majority of the detainees 
</p>
<p>were eventually released, with the exception of 18 individuals, who were still in detention 
</p>
<p>at the end of the period under review. The circumstances of detention remain unknown.  
</p>
<p>58. From 19 January to 19 February 2015, OHCHR documented 145 cases of persons 
</p>
<p>detained by the Popular Committees. Most cases involved detention of anti-Houthi 
</p>
<p>protestors. Witnesses informed OHCHR that they had been held between one and seven 
</p>
<p>days in former government prisons that had been taken over by the Popular Committees in 
</p>
<p>Sana&#8217;a, Houdaida, Ibb and Hajjah. Some alleged having been subjected to different forms 
</p>
<p>of ill-treatment, which may amount to torture, at the hands of the Popular Committees in 
</p>
<p>Sana&#8217;a.  
</p>
<p>59. OHCHR also learned that, on 4 February 2015, six students were detained by 
</p>
<p>members of the Popular Committees for organizing peaceful sit-ins organized to call for the 
</p>
<p>withdrawal of the Popular Committees from the student halls of residence in Arhab district 
</p>
<p>(Sana&#8217;a Governorate). The students were then reportedly transferred to an unknown 
</p>
<p>location aboard a military vehicle carrying a Houthi slogan. OHCHR has no information on 
</p>
<p>their whereabouts.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to freedom of expression  
</b></p>
<p>60. Freedom of expression was considerably undermined and the safety of journalists 
</p>
<p>dramatically deteriorated during the period under review. OHCHR documented dozens of 
</p>
<p>cases of violations of the right to freedom of expression, including incidents where 
</p>
<p>journalists had been subjected to threats and physical attacks. Some of the most salient 
</p>
<p>incidents documented by OHCHR are described below.  
</p>
<p>61. On 18 September 2014, members of the Popular Committees stormed the State 
</p>
<p>television station in Sana&#8217;a and clashed with security guards. The Minister for Information 
</p>
<p>later announced that members of the Popular Committees had seized control of State-run 
</p>
<p>television and of the national news agency Saba. On 22 January 2015, the Popular 
</p>
<p>Committees took control of the Aden State television station and suspended broadcasts. The 
</p>
<p>Popular Committees have exercised complete control over the State television broadcasts 
</p>
<p>since. 
</p>
<p>62. OHCHR received credible allegations that, from 21 January to 19 February 2015, at 
</p>
<p>least 17 journalists were illegally detained by members of the Popular Committees, eight of 
</p>
<p>whom had been detained repeatedly in previous months. Nine of them informed OHCHR 
</p>
<p>that they had been physically abused, while all but one had been reportedly threatened with 
</p>
<p>a weapon.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13 According to OHCHR sources, one of the demonstrators arrested in 2011 was released in July 2013. </p>


<p><b> 13 
</b></p>
<p>63. On 3 February 2015, two journalists employed by a satellite channel were detained 
</p>
<p>by members of the Popular Committees while covering events at Sana&#8217;a University. Both 
</p>
<p>were reportedly transferred to the 14th police station in Sana&#8217;a and held for three days 
</p>
<p>before being released without charges against them.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>64. Yemen has not ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights on the abolition of the death penalty. National legislation 
</p>
<p>imposes the death penalty for a wide range of offences,14 including financial crimes, 
</p>
<p>blasphemy, offences committed under <i>Hodoud</i> (religiously ordained crimes) and <i>Qisas</i> 
</p>
<p>(death in retribution) and drug-related offences. The Penal Law also maintains death by 
</p>
<p>stoning for extramarital heterosexual and consensual adult homosexual intercourse.15 
</p>
<p>65. While the Penal Law prohibits the death penalty for minors, courts still hand down 
</p>
<p>death sentences to minors or adults found guilty of committing crimes when they were 
</p>
<p>under the age of 18 years. The practice is attributed to, among other factors, the difficulty in 
</p>
<p>determining the age of offenders in the absence of birth certificates.  
</p>
<p>66. Yemen has not established a moratorium on the use of the death penalty. Despite 
</p>
<p>repeated requests by OHCHR, the Attorney General did not provide figures on the number 
</p>
<p>of individuals on death row or who have been executed during the period under review. The 
</p>
<p>imposition of the death penalty for any but the most serious crimes, or for persons under the 
</p>
<p>age of 18 years at the time of commission of the crime, is a contravention of international 
</p>
<p>law. In addition, death by stoning amounts to cruel and inhuman punishment.  
</p>
<p><b> E. </b>Children&#8217;s rights <b> 
</b></p>
<p>67. The overall situation of children in Yemen has significantly deteriorated since the 
</p>
<p>intensification of the conflict, particularly since March 2015. The United Nations country 
</p>
<p>task force on monitoring and reporting documented that 74 children were killed and 242 
</p>
<p>injured between 26 March and 11 June 2015.  
</p>
<p>68. Furthermore, as noted above, attacks affecting schools in the context of hostilities 
</p>
<p>have endangered children&#8217;s safety and restricted their right to education. OHCHR also 
</p>
<p>found that there had been a significant increase in child abductions, with at least 81 
</p>
<p>documented cases of children abducted by different groups between January and March 
</p>
<p>2015, as against only two documented incidents in the last three months of 2014.  
</p>
<p>69. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) informed OHCHR that the 
</p>
<p>recruitment and use of children in conflict rose sharply during the period under review. 
</p>
<p>Trained monitors and United Nations staff members documented numerous cases of 
</p>
<p>children manning checkpoints or being used by armed groups in the context of hostilities. 
</p>
<p>In 2014, 157 cases of children allegedly being used for military purposes were documented. 
</p>
<p>In the month and a half following the start of the aerial bombardments on 26 March 2015, 
</p>
<p>318 instances of children seen carrying weapons at checkpoints and elsewhere were 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 14 A total of 315 offences are punishable by the death penalty under four main laws: the Penal Law 
</p>
<p>(1994), the law on combating kidnapping (1998), the military Penal Code (1998) and the law on 
</p>
<p>combating trafficking and the illicit use of drugs and psychotropic substances (1993). A draft law on 
</p>
<p>combating human trafficking would introduce another offence punishable by death. 
</p>
<p> 15 According to international human rights jurisprudence, these crimes do not meet the threshold of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; and should not be punishable by death (see A/HRC/27/23, paras. 28&#8211;39). </p>


<p>documented. Even though appointed monitors could not always identify the group 
</p>
<p>responsible for the recruitment of children, reports indicate that both government and non-
</p>
<p>State armed groups &#8211; including the Popular Committees and the tribal militias affiliated 
</p>
<p>with the Islah party &#8211; are recruiting and using children as soldiers.  
</p>
<p>70. Under international law, the use and recruitment of children in armed conflict is 
</p>
<p>strictly prohibited. The use of children below 15 years of age in active hostilities is a war 
</p>
<p>crime.  
</p>
<p>71. OHCHR observed that, while the pattern of child marriage has been declining, it 
</p>
<p>remains a common practice, affecting around 10 per cent of girls under the age of 15.16 
</p>
<p>Early marriage, a practice that contravenes international human rights law, is perpetuated 
</p>
<p>by the lack of a legislative framework that identifies the minimum age of marriage and 
</p>
<p>persisting traditions. Following advocacy efforts by UNICEF and OHCHR, language was 
</p>
<p>included in the draft Constitution stipulating the minimum age for marriage as 18 years.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Refugees, migrants, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons  
</b></p>
<p>72. During the period under review, large numbers of refugees, asylum seekers and 
</p>
<p>migrants continued to arrive in Yemen. While a signatory to the Convention relating to the 
</p>
<p>Status of Refugees, Yemen has not incorporated the Convention into national law nor has it 
</p>
<p>established a procedure for determining refugee status. In the absence of such legislation, 
</p>
<p>the legal status of asylum seekers and refugees has been governed by a combination of 
</p>
<p>decrees and provisions. While the authorities may grant refugee status on a <i>prima facie</i> 
</p>
<p>basis to Somali refugees, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Refugees (UNHCR) determines refugee status for all other asylum seekers.  
</p>
<p>73. The scale and intensity of the conflict has left thousands of undocumented migrants 
</p>
<p>trapped and deprived of basic resources and attention. According to UNHCR and the 
</p>
<p>International Organization for Migration, more than 4,000 migrants arrived from the Horn 
</p>
<p>of Africa in April 2015 alone.  
</p>
<p>74. On 20 April 2015, the Protection Cluster formed a task force on population 
</p>
<p>movements to better coordinate partners&#8217; efforts in collecting and disseminating consistent 
</p>
<p>and reliable data on internally displaced persons in Yemen. Since the beginning of the 
</p>
<p>aerial bombardment by coalition forces on 26 March 2015, the total number of displaced 
</p>
<p>persons has increased to approximately 1 million.17 Furthermore, during the period under 
</p>
<p>review, documented incidents of administrative detention of newly arrived immigrants 
</p>
<p>appear to have increased. OHCHR understands that a large proportion of those detained are 
</p>
<p>being held in overcrowded facilities. 
</p>
<p>75. During the period under review, hundreds of men, women and children continued to 
</p>
<p>be victims of human trafficking into and from Yemen. OHCHR discovered numerous cases 
</p>
<p>of displaced persons, including children, reportedly kidnapped in camps and subsequently 
</p>
<p>trafficked abroad. Refugee women and children are at particular risk, and are often 
</p>
<p>kidnapped for ransom. Cases of physical and sexual violence against men and boys were 
</p>
<p>also reportede along the coast of the Red Sea. Smuggling and trafficking gangs have been 
</p>
<p>reportedly operating with impunity in Yemen.  
</p>
<p>76. Progress was recorded in the Government&#8217;s efforts to set up institutional 
</p>
<p>mechanisms to counter human trafficking. Established in 2013, the National Technical

<p><b> 15 
</b></p>
<p>Committee to Counter Human Trafficking, chaired by the Minister for Human Rights, met 
</p>
<p>several times during the period under review. Legislation criminalizing human trafficking 
</p>
<p>was drafted by the Ministry of Justice, reviewed by the Committee, commented on by 
</p>
<p>United Nations entities and submitted to the Parliament for review and enactment. At 
</p>
<p>August 2015, the draft bill was still pending parliamentary endorsement.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Marginalized groups 
</b></p>
<p>77. Yemen does not recognize in its legislation the marginalized status of some minority 
</p>
<p>groups, who continue to suffer from discrimination, in particular the Muhamasheen (also 
</p>
<p>known as Al-Akhdam), a social group whose exact number remains unknown (according to 
</p>
<p>unofficial sources, there are between 500,000 and 3.5 million Muhamasheen in Yemen). 
</p>
<p>The group has no political representation at the national level and suffers from extreme 
</p>
<p>levels of social stigma and discrimination, which exacerbates their socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>exclusion and poverty. For centuries, they have been excluded from mainstream society, 
</p>
<p>and they continue to be subjected to severe forms of descent-based discrimination. The 
</p>
<p>Muhamasheen mainly reside in underdeveloped neighbourhoods in the outskirts of Sana&#8217;a, 
</p>
<p>Aden, Taizz, Lahij, Al-Abyan, Al-Hudaydah and Al-Mukalla. According to a national 
</p>
<p>statistical and population monitoring survey conducted in 2012, the illiteracy rate among 
</p>
<p>the Muhamasheen community is around 90 per cent. Women and children are forced to beg 
</p>
<p>in rural areas, and to work as entertainers at weddings or community ceremonies. The 
</p>
<p>Government has also failed to adopt legislation criminalizing abuses against them, which 
</p>
<p>serves to reinforce discriminatory practices. The Muhamasheen community successfully 
</p>
<p>advocated for its rights during the National Dialogue Conference, particularly with regard 
</p>
<p>to participation in the public sphere.18 The Working Group on Rights and Freedoms of the 
</p>
<p>Conference recommended a 10 per cent participation of persons from the Muhamasheen 
</p>
<p>community in employment in public services, as well as equal access in leadership and 
</p>
<p>decision-making positions. Despite the community&#8217;s advocacy efforts, supported by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR and other actors, this minimum participation quota was not included in the first 
</p>
<p>draft Constitution.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Accountability and transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>78. Progress in setting up accountability and transitional justice mechanisms was 
</p>
<p>severely hampered by instability and violence. Throughout the period under review, 
</p>
<p>governance and security continued to be affected, a situation compounded by the ongoing 
</p>
<p>denial of social equity and justice, and a lack of basic services. 
</p>
<p>79. In 2014, the draft law on transitional justice and national reconciliation was further 
</p>
<p>amended to bring it into line with the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference. The 
</p>
<p>final draft did not, however, include any provisions on accountability and therefore did not 
</p>
<p>comply with international norms and standards. It sought rather to further strengthen 
</p>
<p>immunities for high officials and to establish a mandate for a transitional justice 
</p>
<p>commission. As the end of the period under review, the draft law had not been adopted. 
</p>
<p>80. Furthermore, a commission of inquiry mandated at the National Dialogue 
</p>
<p>Conference to investigate allegations of human rights violations committed during the 
</p>
<p>events of 2011 has still not become operational, given that its members have never been 
</p>
<p>appointed by the President. In addition, the work of the Land and Dismissals Commissions 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 18 See A/HRC/24/34, paras. 4-5. </p>


<p>in the Southern Governorates, established in January 2013 to investigate land-related 
</p>
<p>violations and to provide victims with compensation, has stalled owing to a lack of funds. 
</p>
<p>81. Yemen has an obligation to investigate alleged violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law and international human rights law, to bring those responsible to justice 
</p>
<p>and to provide victims with an adequate and effective remedy, including reparations and the 
</p>
<p>right to the truth. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p><b>for Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>82. Following the escalation of violence and the evacuation of international personnel 
</p>
<p>from Sana&#8217;a, OHCHR was forced to interrupt a number of technical assistance activities, 
</p>
<p>and to shift its focus to monitoring and documenting violations of international human 
</p>
<p>rights law and international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>83. OHCHR established a monitoring, documentation and investigation mechanism 
</p>
<p>through the deployment of monitors in conflict-affected areas. In addition, a series of 
</p>
<p>training workshops on monitoring and reporting human rights violations were conducted 
</p>
<p>for the benefit of members of the Protection Cluster and national non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations. During the period under review, OHCHR human rights monitoring and 
</p>
<p>documentation formed the basis of its advocacy and by other United Nations entities 
</p>
<p>regarding alleged violations of international humanitarian law and international human 
</p>
<p>rights law in Yemen. 
</p>
<p>84. Furthermore, OHCHR and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
</p>
<p>facilitated workshops aimed at empowering civil society organizations that had been 
</p>
<p>engaged in data collection relevant for the work of the Land and Dismissals Commissions. 
</p>
<p>85. OHCHR and UNDP also worked jointly to provide capacity-building to Government 
</p>
<p>officials and civil society across the country in the implementation of the recommendations 
</p>
<p>received by Yemen during the universal periodic review. Government sectors consequently 
</p>
<p>included pertinent review recommendations in their respective operational plans. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR and UNDP supported the Government in establishing a national human rights 
</p>
<p>institution. Before the hostilities spread to Sana&#8217;a in September 2014, OHCHR was 
</p>
<p>working with the Government on various technical assistance projects, some of which were 
</p>
<p>subsequently postponed owing to security challenges. 
</p>
<p>86. Through a joint project, OHCHR and UNDP provided support to different 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in the area of the transitional justice, including by facilitating consultation 
</p>
<p>workshops on the draft transitional justice law, convening representatives of the 
</p>
<p>Government, the Parliament, political parties, national dialogue members, lawyers, victims&#8217; 
</p>
<p>associations and tribal communities, as well as representatives of minorities and religious 
</p>
<p>communities.  
</p>
<p>87. OHCHR also supported civil society organizations advocating for the endorsement 
</p>
<p>of a draft law on missing persons and enforced disappearances. OHCHR delivered human 
</p>
<p>rights training workshops designed to increase the knowledge and capacity of law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials, judges and prosecutors on the rights of women, marginalized groups, 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities and migrants.  
</p>
<p>88. Lastly, OHCHR and UNDP provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights with a view to developing a national human rights strategy. A document outlining 
</p>
<p>the basis for the strategy was developed in consultation with civil society and relevant 
</p>
<p>government bodies. The strategy describes action to be undertaken by the Government, </p>

</b></p>
<p>building upon the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference and universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review and treaty body recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The High Commissioner is concerned about the continued escalation of violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Yemen and the related allegations of violations of international humanitarian law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>some of which may amount to war crimes, and violations and abuses of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights law. This situation is partly the result of failure to address past 
</b></p>
<p><b>grievances and to bring perpetrators to justice.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Recalling the recommendations already made by OHCHR in previous reports 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the situation of human rights in Yemen, the High Commissioner recommends that 
</b></p>
<p><b>all parties to the conflict: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b>and international human rights law, as applicable, including by taking all feasible 
</b></p>
<p><b>precautions to avoid and minimize civilian casualties; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To abide by the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions 
</b></p>
<p><b>in attacks in the conduct of hostilities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To end the recruitment and use of children for military purposes, and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that measures are taken to prevent such acts;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To ensure immediate, safe and unimpeded access of humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations to all areas under their control; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) To recall that the arms embargo pursuant to the Security Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolution 2216 (2015) should not result in restrictions of the right to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>movement and trade in commercial goods, including fuel;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) To return to negotiations and to find solutions to end the conflict.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the coalition forces and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government of Yemen ensure prompt, thorough, effective, independent and impartial 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations into alleged violations and abuses of international human rights law and 
</b></p>
<p><b>alleged violations of international humanitarian law. The investigations should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducted by independent bodies, their results should be made public, and those 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible should be brought to justice in a manner consistent with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights law and without resort to the death penalty. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of Yemen, pending 
</b></p>
<p><b>the abolition of the death penalty, establish a moratorium on its application. In the 
</b></p>
<p><b>meantime, Yemen should comply with its international human rights obligations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by not imposing the death penalty, except for the most serious offences; 
</b></p>
<p><b>suspending the application of the death penalty for crimes committed by persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>under the age of 18; and ensuring scrupulous respect for the rights to due process and 
</b></p>
<p><b>to a fair trial in death penalty cases. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The High Commissioner calls upon the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To encourage the establishment of an international independent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>impartial mechanism to investigate alleged violations and abuses of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights law and alleged violations of international humanitarian law that have 
</b></p>
<p><b>resulted in loss of life and/or serious injury; </b></p>


<p><b>(b) To ensure the scaling-up of humanitarian assistance in Yemen by 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing the urgently needed support to the Yemen humanitarian response plan; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To cooperate with the panel of experts charged with investigating 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals or entities engaging in or providing support for acts that threaten the 
</b></p>
<p><b>peace, security or stability of Yemen, pursuant to Security Council resolution 2140 
</b></p>
