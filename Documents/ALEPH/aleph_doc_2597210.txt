Commenting today, Per Wullf, CEO and President of Seadrill Management Ltd., said: "During Q2
2016 we have improved on the record uptime we achieved in Q1, reaching 98% economic
utilization, whilst continuing to see our costs reduce quarter over quarter.
There continues to be a significant supply overhang and the market conditions remain challenging,
however, there is some volume returning to the spot market, although primarily for short term work.
Our priorities for the remainder of the year continue to be delivering safe and efficient operations for
our customers whilst concluding on our financing plans."
 
--------------------------------------
EBITDA is defined as 'Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization'  and has been
calculated by taking operating income plus depreciation and amortization but excluding gains or
losses on disposals and impairment charges against goodwill. Contingent consideration realized
relates to Seadrill's ongoing residual interest in the West Vela and West Polaris customer
contracts, and has been included within EBITDA. Additionally, in any given period the Company
1
may have significant, unusual or non-recurring gains or losses which it may exclude from its Non
GAAP earnings for that period. When applicable, these items would be fully disclosed and
incorporated into the required reconciliations from US GAAP to Non GAAP measures. Refer to
Appendix for the reconciliation of Operating Income to EBTDA, as Operating income is the most
directly comparable US GAAP measure .
2Economic utilization is calculated as total revenue, excluding bonuses, for the period as a
proportion of the full operating dayrate multiplied by the number of days on contract in the period.
3Seadrill Group is defined as all companies currently consolidated into Seadrill Limited plus Seadrill
Partners LLC and SeaMex Limited.
Underlying is defined as reported results, adjusted for certain non-recurring items and other
exclusions as discussed in the Appendix. These numbers are reconciled to the US GAAP reported
4
results for corresponding periods in the Appendix.

Revenues of $868 million for the second quarter (Q1 2016: 891 million) were down primarily due to
the West Castor and West Prospero contracts ending and dayrate reductions on a number of units
as detailed further on.

The reductions to revenue were partially offset by the West Phoenix operating for a full quarter, the
Sevan Driller and the West Eclipse commencing operations during the second quarter, and a record
98% utilization (Q1 2016: 96%) across our operating fleet.
Net operating income for the quarter was $364 million (Q1 2016: $328 million). The increase
primarily reflects lower operating costs and overhead in the quarter, partially offset by lower
revenues.
Net financial and other items for the quarter resulted in an expense of $32 million (Q1 2016:
expense of $156 million).  The decrease primarily relates to a gain on debt extinguishment of $47
million related to $105 million of bond debt for equity exchanges and the revaluation of the
derivative hedge book.
Income taxes for the second quarter were $56 million, a decrease of $28 million from the previous
quarter mainly reflecting reserves for some uncertain tax positions and discrete items being
recorded in the first quarter and not repeated in the second quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $276 million (Q1 2016: $88 million) representing basic and diluted
earnings per share of $0.52.
Balance sheet
As of June 30, 2016, total assets were $23.0 billion (Q1 2016: $23.1 billion).
Total current assets were $3.0 billion, approximately in line with the preceding quarter.  During the
quarter, there was a $145 million decrease in marketable securities related to the sale of our stake
in SapuraKencana, partly offset by an increase in the share price of  Seadrill Partners common
units.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by $195 million, mainly reflecting the sale of our
SapuraKencana shares and the repayment by Seadrill Partners of a $109.5 million maturing loan,
partly offset by a $75 million loan to Archer, a related party, agreed last year as part of their
restructuring plans.
Total non-current assets were $20.0 billion, approximately in line with the preceding quarter.  The
main changes during the quarter relate to an increase in investment in associated companies
reflecting the equity accounting of higher earnings at SDLP, offset by normal depreciation of drilling
units.
Total current liabilities increased to $4.3 billion from $3.2 billion. The main movement here is the
reclassification of two loans from non-current to current, the $2 billion NADL facility and the $450
million West Eminence facility which were amended in April 2016.
Total non-current liabilities decreased to $8.4 billion from $9.8 billion. Similarly, the main
movements were the reclassification of the two loans noted above, partially offset by an increase in
long term debt due to related parties relating to Ship Finance VIEs declaring their annual dividends
to Ship Finance International.  These dividends have been recognized as related party payables.
Over the course of the quarter total net interest bearing debt (including related party debt and net of
cash and cash equivalents) decreased to $9.1 billion from $9.6 billion in the previous quarter,
reflecting normal quarterly installments and the retirement of $105 million of bonds via debt for
equity exchanges.
Total equity was $10.3 billion as of June 30, 2016 compared to $10.0 billion as of March 31, 2016.
Cash flow
As of June 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 billion, an increase of $195 million
compared to the previous quarter.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 was $303
million, net cash provided by investing activities was $259 million, and net cash used in financing
activities was $366 million.  Net cash provided by operating activities for the three month period
ended March 31, 2016 was $294 million, net cash used in investing activities was $2 million, and
net cash used in financing activities was $253 million.
Cost Reduction
Since the end of 2015 we have reduced headcount from 7,100 to 6,500 an 8% reduction.  Onshore
headcount has been reduced from 1,200 to 900 and offshore from 5,900 to 5,600.
The average operating cost including overhead in the first six months of 2016 on our operating
floater fleet has been reduced by 17% relative to full year 2015. Similarly, average daily jack-up
opex has been reduced by 28%.
During the quarter, vessel and rig operating costs declined by $42 million, contributing to a
sequential increase of approximately 5% to our operating margin.  $22 million of this improvement is
related to rigs in operations and $20 million is related to rigs becoming idle and improvements in
stacking costs.
In our first quarter report we indicated that for the full year 2016 total cash savings was expected to
be $340 million at a Group level.  During the quarter we have identified a further $50 million in cash
savings expected to be realized during 2016 and now expect full year cash savings of $390 million. 
During the first two quarters of the year we have delivered $285 million of this total and are on track
to achieve the full year estimate. The majority of the cost reductions achieved to date relate to
operating costs that are sustainable.
2
Newbuilding Program
We continue to make good progress on deferring newbuild deliveries.  During the second quarter
and for the third quarter to date we have concluded the following agreements:
1.
In April 2016, we entered into agreements with Dalian to further defer the deliveries of all eight
jack-ups under construction. Following this latest deferral agreement, five units are now scheduled
to be delivered in 2017, and three units in 2018.
2.
In April 2016, Sevan Drilling and Cosco agreed to exercise the second six-month deferral option
for the Sevan Developer newbuilding, which extends the deferral agreement until October 15,
2016.
3.
In June 2016, we agreed to extend the standstill period for the West Rigel with Jurong Shipyard
Pte. Ltd. ("Jurong"). This agreement extends the standstill period by a further three months to
September 2, 2016. The extension of the standstill period allows the parties to continue to explore
commercial opportunities for the Unit.  In the event no employment is secured for the Unit and no
alternative transaction is completed, the Company and Jurong will form a Joint Asset Holding
Company for joint ownership of the Unit, to be owned 23% by the Company and 77% by Jurong.
Discussions continue to progress regarding additional deferments.
Operations
During the second quarter we achieved record economic utilization at 98%. The West Castor and
West Prospero completed their contracts and the West Hercules was terminated, while the West
Phoenix returned to service. The second quarter status and performance of the Group's delivered rig
fleet is as follows:

During the second quarter:
1.
The West Cressida commenced a new 9 month contract with PTTEP in Thailand adding
approximately $18 million in backlog.
2.
The West Hercules received a notice of termination for convenience from Statoil. In accordance
with the contract, Seadrill will receive a lump sum payment of approximately $61 million, plus
dayrate and reimbursement of costs associated with the demobilization of the rig. The West
Hercules is currently being marketed for new work.
Additionally, during the third quarter to date we have concluded the following commercial
agreements:
1.
The jack-ups AOD I and AOD II received three year contract extensions from Saudi Aramco
expiring in June 2019 and July 2019, respectively. The extensions are in direct continuation of the
current contracts and will add approximately $225 million in contract backlog.
2.
The West Vigilant secured a 3 month contract under the existing agreement with Repsol in
Malaysia commencing in August, resulting in a $10 million increase in backlog.
3.
The West Ariel was moved to non-operating flotel mode and the dayrate was reduced to $120,000
per day from July 2016 through the remainder of its contract term, ending in February 2018,
resulting in a $20 million reduction in backlog.
4.
The West Freedom backlog was reduced by $16 million resulting from a discounted rate in 2016
related to non-operating flotel period. The West Freedom also received an extension to June 30,
2017, which is included in the backlog reduction, Cardon IV expect to recommence operations at
a rate of $225,000 per day in early 2017.
5.    The West Castor secured a new one-year contract with ENI in Mexico commencing in
December 2016, resulting in a $40 million increase in backlog which includes the provision of
onshore logistics services.
6.
The West Pegasus received a notice of termination from Pemex for the drilling contract effective
August 16, 2016 resulting in a potential backlog reduction of $266 million. Seadrill has disputed
the grounds for termination and is reviewing its legal options.
3
Seadrill's order backlog as of August 24th, 2016 is $3.6 billion, comprised of $2.6 billion for the
floater fleet and $1.0 billion for the Jack-up fleet. The average contract duration is 18 months for
floaters and 15 months for Jack-ups.
For the Seadrill Group, total order backlog is $8.0 billion.
Commercial contract renegotiation discussions continue to advance with some customers and the
Company continues to look toward finding commercial agreements that are beneficial to both parties
in order to be better positioned for future contract awards.
Market Development
Oil prices stabilized in the $40-50 range during the quarter and there is a growing belief that we are
at or near the bottom of this downcycle.  Decline curves have steepened and as oil companies
begin to see the impacts of spending cuts over the last two years, there is a growing realization that
the current level of investment is not sustainable and increased capital expenditure will be required
to slow decline curves and grow production at some point.
However, offshore drilling is a late cycle market and remains highly challenging.  There are some
signs of increases in tendering activity, albeit from an extremely low base and generally for short
term work.  There continues to be multiple rigs bid for all opportunities and a significant supply
overhang.  Although scrapping and stacking activity is addressing some of this overhang, it is still
unclear as to the timeframe over which rates will improve materially.  A better indication of demand
in 2017 may emerge from release of annual budgets later in the year.
The majority of customer conversations continue to relate to "blend and extend" arrangements and
other renegotiations.  In some instances rates are being negotiated lower without extending the
contract term with cancellation and re-tendering by oil companies as the alternative.  Robust
contract terms are increasingly important and many customers are keeping a watchful eye on
performance metrics in an effort to find grounds to terminate.
Floaters
The floater market is beginning to show some pockets of activity in the spot market for short term
work, albeit at dayrates that are at or near cash breakeven levels.  Given the available supply,
operators have developed a clear preference for units that are currently operating or have not been
idle for a significant period of time.  High specification units continue to have an advantage over
older units.  The developing spot market is a step in the right direction and may indicate that we are
close to or have reached the minimum number of active units required to sustain the degree of
production decline that can be accepted by oil companies.
Owners of older units that complete contracts and require significant capital expenditures to
continue working will likely continue to conclude that investments in these units does not make
economic sense at current rate levels.  This, together with ongoing delays in newbuild deliveries is
expected to result in continued reduction of the available fleet and will ultimately contribute to the
balancing of the floater market.
Jack-ups
Due to the shorter term nature of contracts in the jack-up market, utilization levels generally adjust at
a faster pace than in the floater market. We have seen some limited activity begin to return however
pricing remains challenging and, similar to the floater market, many units are competing for any
available opportunity.  Activity is focused in the Middle East and Southeast Asia both for short and
long term contracts.
High specification units continue to be preferred by operators with total fleet utilization for units able
to work in 350' and above standing at 60%, compared to 54% total fleet utilization for less capable
units.  Older units remain at a competitive disadvantage and fall short of many of the technical
requirements desired by operators without being able to offer materially lower pricing.
Scrapping activity in the jack-up market is not as pronounced as in the floater market due to the low
carrying cost of idle units.  However the longer a unit is without work, the less desirable it becomes
to an operator.  Older units that have been idle for a year or more are expected to be at a significant
disadvantage to currently operating or recently warm stacked units.
 
 
4
Financing Update
During the second quarter we extended our three nearest maturing borrowing facilities and
amended certain covenants across all our secured credit facilities, as the first part of a broader plan
to refinance and recapitalize the business.  By deferring our imminent maturities and resetting a
number of covenants we have established a more stable platform to pursue and conclude
negotiations with our stakeholders regarding a long term solution that will bridge us to a recovery in
the industry.
We have met our milestone obligations as they have become due and we remain in constructive
discussions with our banks regarding our overall recapitalization plan.  We continue to expect this
process will conclude by the year end.
Guidance
Third Quarter 2016
With a number of our units coming off contract and the impact of lower day rates, EBITDA will be
lower for the third quarter, at around $380 million.  This is based on third quarter expected Operating
Income of $183 million.
The following units are coming off contract or will have increased idle time during the third quarter:
 
•West Orion,
•West Alpha
•West Hercules
•Sevan Driller
•West Phoenix
•West Pegasus
•West Prospero (full quarter of idle time)
•West Castor (full quarter of idle time)
The following units will have lower dayrates compared to the second quarter:
 
•West Freedom
•West Cressida
•West Ariel
These reductions will be offset by commencement of operation or higher utilization on the following
units:
 
•Full operating quarter for the West Eclipse
Operationally, performance in the third quarter is strong with 95% utilization quarter to date.
Full Year 2016
For the full year we expect EBITDA to be around $1.8 billion. This is based on expected Operating
Income for the full year of $1.0 billion.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 – General information
Seadrill Limited is incorporated in Bermuda and is a publicly listed company on the New York Stock
Exchange and the Oslo Stock Exchange. We provide offshore drilling services to the oil and gas
industry. As of June 30, 2016 we owned and operated 38 offshore drilling units, had 13 units under
construction and an additional unit classified as held for sale. Our fleet consists of drillships, jack-up
rigs and semi-submersible rigs for operations in shallow and deepwater areas, as well as benign
and harsh environments.
As used herein, and unless otherwise required by the context, the term "Seadrill" refers to Seadrill
Limited and the terms "Company", "we", "Group", "our" and words of similar import refer to Seadrill
and its consolidated companies. The use herein of such terms as group, organization, we, us, our
and its, or references to specific entities, is not intended to be a precise description of corporate
relationships.
Basis of presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the
same basis as the Company's audited financial statements and, in the opinion of management,
include all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that are considered
necessary for a fair statement of the Company's financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). The accompanying
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements do not include all of the disclosures required in
complete annual financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with our annual financial statements filed with the SEC on Form 20-F for the year ended
December 31, 2015. The amounts are presented in United States dollar ("US dollar") rounded to the
nearest million, unless stated otherwise.
Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the unaudited interim financial statements are
consistent with those followed in the preparation of our annual audited consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 except as discussed below or unless otherwise
included in these unaudited interim financial statements as separate disclosures.
 
Dividends from Seadrill Partners Common Units
Historically the Company presented the dividend income received from Seadrill Partners Common
Units within "Share in results from associated companies". From the period ended September 30,
2015, the Company has elected to present this income separately within "Other financial items" in
order to distinguish the income from Seadrill Partners Common Units, which is accounted for as a
"Marketable Security", to income from the Company's other investments in Seadrill Partners, which
are accounted for as "Investment in associated companies" under the equity method and cost
method. Accordingly the Company has re-presented income of $18 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015 and $37 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 from "Share in results
from associated companies" to "Other financial items" on the statement of operations.
Note 2 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis, which changes guidance related to both the variable interest entity (VIE)
and voting interest entity (VOE) consolidation models. With respect to the VIE model, the standard
changes, among other things, the identification of variable interests associated with fees paid to a
decision maker or service provider, the VIE characteristics for a limited partner or similar entity, and
the primary beneficiary determination. With respect to the VOE model, the ASU eliminates the
presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless the
presumption can otherwise be overcome. Under the new guidance, a general partner would largely
not consolidate a partnership or similar entity under the VOE model. The Company adopted this
ASU effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not impact the Company's
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use
Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing
Arrangement, which provides explicit guidance about a customer's accounting for fees paid in a
cloud computing arrangement. Under the ASU, if a cloud computing arrangement includes a
software license, then the software license element of the arrangement should be accounted for
consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not
include a software license, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. The
Company adopted this ASU prospectively to arrangements entered into, or materially modified
beginning January 1, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not impact the Company's consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805):
Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. The amendments in this update
require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the
measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The
guidance further requires that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the
effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a
result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed
at the acquisition date and present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the
notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have
been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been
recognized as of the acquisition date.The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016
with prospective application. The adoption of this ASU did not impact the Company's consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which
provides new authoritative guidance on the methods of revenue recognition and related disclosure
requirements.  This new standard supersedes all existing revenue recognition requirements,
including most industry-specific guidance. The new standard requires a company to recognize
revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration that the company expects to receive for those goods or services. The new standard
also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. In April 2015 the FASB proposed to
defer the effective date of the guidance by one year.  Based on this proposal, public entities would
need to apply the new guidance for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, 
and shall be applied, at the Company's option, retrospectively to each period presented or as a
cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  Early adoption is not permitted until periods
beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this
standard update on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
F-8
Seadrill Limited
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides new authoritative guidance with regards to
management's responsibility to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to
provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The ASU will be effective for all
entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016 (December 31, 2016 for calendar
year-end entities) and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
impact of this standard update on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10):
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which made targeted
improvements to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The
update changes how entities measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are
not accounted for under the equity method and how they present changes in the fair value of
financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are attributable to their own credit. The
new guidance also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of current US GAAP.
The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted in some cases. The Company is in
the process of evaluating the impact of this standard update on its consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The update requires an
entity to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key
information about leasing arrangements. It also offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a
lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose
qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial
statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The
guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of
evaluating the impact of this standard update on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures
(Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting. The update eliminates

West Rigel
On December 2, 2015, the West Rigel was classified as an Asset held for sale.  As at the transfer
date the West Rigel held assets at its book value of $210 million and a loss on disposal of $82
million was recognized. Please refer to Note 20 for more details. The expected recoverable value of
$128 million is classified as an Asset held for sale on the Balance Sheet for the period ended
June 30, 2016.
Cancellation of the West Mira
On September 14, 2015, the Company cancelled the construction contract for the West Mira with
Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries Co Ltd. ("HSHI"), due to the Shipyard's inability to deliver the unit
within the timeframe required under the contract. The carrying value of the newbuild at the date of
cancellation was $315 million, which included $170 million of pre-delivery installments paid to
HSHI, with the remainder relating to purchased equipment, internally capitalized construction costs
and capitalized interest. Under the contract terms, the Company has the right to recoup the $170
million in pre-delivery installments, plus accrued interest.
On October 12, 2015, HSHI launched arbitration proceedings under the contract.  HSHI have
claimed that Seadrill's cancellation was a repudiatory breach and claim they were due various
extensions of time.  The Company refutes this vigorously, and believes it has the contractual right to
recover the $170 million in pre-delivery installments, plus accrued interest and legal costs. The
recovery is however now not expected until the conclusion of an arbitration process under English
law, which is expected to take up to two years.
Based both on management's assessment of the facts and circumstances, and advice from external
counsel, who have been engaged for the arbitration process, the Company believes the recovery of
the installment, plus accrued interest, is probable, as defined by US GAAP.  As such, the Company
has reclassified from "Newbuildings", a receivable of $170 million plus accrued interest of $29
million, which is presented in "Other non-current assets" on the balance sheet.  The Company will
continue to assess the recoverability throughout the arbitration process.
The Company redeployed a portion of equipment, totaling $48 million, within Seadrill's remaining
fleet, and did not write off these amounts. The resulting net loss on disposal recognized was $80
million, which is included in "(Loss)/gain on disposals" in the Statement of Operations.

Disposal of the West Polaris
On June 19, 2015, the Company sold the entities that owned and operated the West Polaris (the
"Polaris business"), to Seadrill Operating LP ("Seadrill Operating"), a consolidated subsidiary of
Seadrill Partners LLC and 42% owned by the Company. The entities continue to be related parties
subsequent to the sale.
The purchase price consisted of an initial enterprise value of $540 million, less debt assumed of
$336 million. The fair value of consideration recognized on disposal was $235 million, which
comprised of $204 million of cash consideration, and a working capital adjustment of $31 million,
due to the net working capital of the Polaris business being greater than the required working capital
prescribed in the sale and purchase agreement.
Additional contingent consideration in the form of a seller's credit of $50 million is also potentially
due from Seadrill Partners in 2021, which will carry interest at a rate of 6.5% per annum. The
repayment of the seller's credit is contingent on the future re-contracted day rate.  During the 3 year
period following the completion of the current customer contract, the final amount payable will be
adjusted downwards to the extent the average re-contracted operating day rate (net of
commissions), adjusted for utilization, over the period, is less than $450 thousand per day. If the rig
is off contract during this period, the reduction is equal to $450 thousand per day.
In addition, the Company may be entitled to receive further contingent consideration from Seadrill
Partners, consisting of (a) any day rates earned by Seadrill Partners in excess of $450 thousand per
day, adjusted for daily utilization, tax and agency commission for the remainder of the ExxonMobil
contract completing in March 2018 and (b) 50% of any day rate earned above $450 thousand per
day, adjusted for daily utilization, tax and agency commission fee after the conclusion of the existing
contract until 2025. In February 2016, the drilling contract with ExxonMobil  was amended such that
the day rate for the West Polaris was reduced from $653 thousand per day to $490 thousand per
day, effective January 1, 2016.
The Company's accounting policy is not to recognize contingent consideration before it is
considered realizable and has therefore not recognized on disposal any amounts receivable
relating to the elements of consideration which are contingent on future events.  From the disposal
date of the West Polaris on June 19, 2015 to June 30, 2016, the Company has recognized $36
million in contingent consideration, as it became realized, within "Contingent consideration
realized" included within operating income.
The loss recognized at the time of disposal of the Polaris business was $75 million, after taking into
account a goodwill allocation of $41 million. The loss has been presented in our consolidated
statement of operations, under "(Loss)/gain on disposals" included within operating income and
attributable to floaters segment.

Under the terms of various agreements between Seadrill and Seadrill Partners LLC, entered into in
connection with the initial public offering of Seadrill Partners LLC, Seadrill will continue to provide
management, technical and administrative services to the Polaris business.  See further discussion
in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for details of these services and agreements.
The sale of the Polaris business does not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation as the
sale of the Polaris business is not considered to represent a strategic shift expected to have a major
effect on the Company's operations and financial results.
During the second half of 2015, subsequent to the deconsolidation, certain immaterial
*
measurement period adjustments were made to the values of the net assets as at the date of
disposal, which increased the initial loss recognized by $2 million.

SeaMex Limited
During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement
with an investment fund controlled by Fintech Advisory Inc. ("Fintech"), for the purpose of owning
and managing certain jack-up drilling units located in Mexico under contract with Pemex. The West
Oberon, West Intrepid, West Defender, West Courageous and West Titania jack-up drilling rigs ("the
jack-up drilling rigs") were included within the joint venture. The transaction was completed on
March 10, 2015, when Fintech subscribed for a 50% ownership interest in the joint venture
company, SeaMex Limited ("SeaMex"), which was previously 100% owned by the Company, and
SeaMex simultaneously purchased the jack-up drilling rigs from Seadrill Limited.
As a result of the transaction the Company no longer controls the entities that own and operate
these jack-up drilling units (the "Disposal Group"), and accordingly the Company has
deconsolidated certain entities as of March 10, 2015, and has recognized its remaining 50%
investment in the joint venture at fair value.  The fair value of the retained 50% equity interest in the
SeaMex joint venture was determined by reference to the price paid by Fintech to obtain a 50%
equity interest in the disposal group from Seadrill.  Seadrill accounts for its 50% investment in the
joint venture under the Equity Method.
Total consideration in respect of the Disposal Group was $1,077 million from SeaMex to Seadrill. 
This was comprised of net cash of $586 million, a Seller's credit receivable of $250 million, short
term related party receivable balances of $90 million and direct settlement of Seadrill's debt facilities
relating to the West Oberon amounting to $150 million.   Subsequently, $162 million of related party
balance was received when the West Titania was refinanced.  The Seller's credit bears interest at a
rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 6.50% and matures in December 2019.  See Note 17 to the
consolidated financial statements for further details on the related party balances.
Seadrill utilized the cash consideration to repay outstanding debt facilities in respect of the West
Courageous, West Defender, West Intrepid and West Titania. See further details in Note 12 to the
consolidated financial statements.
The total recognized gain on disposal was $186 million, after taking into account a goodwill
allocation of $49 million, which has been presented in our consolidated statement of operations,
under "(Loss)/gain on disposals" included within operating income.
The Company has not presented this disposal group as a discontinued operation in the statement of
operations as it does not represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the
Company's operations and financial results.

Note 5 – Taxation
The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was 27.8% and 10.6%,
respectively. The income tax expense increased $37 million for the six months ended  June 30,
2016 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to a
change in balance of the relative components of our estimated 2016 earnings, with more earned in
jurisdictions with higher tax rates. In addition, book discrete losses, for which no benefits were
recognized, were higher during 2016. The Company has also recognized liabilities for uncertain tax
positions associated with prior periods.
Note 6 – Earnings per share
The computation of basic earnings per share ("EPS") is based on the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the effect of the assumed conversion of

$195 million, net of transaction costs. In the period ending March 31, 2016 we recognized a net
impairment charge to bring the carrying value of the asset to the realized value of $195 million. As a
result, we reclassified the accumulated unrecognized gains of $22 million as of December 31, 2015,
out of Other Comprehensive Income into earnings during the period. The resulting net impairment
was a loss of $11 million, which is recognized within "Loss on impairments of investments" in the

Seadrill Partners - Common Units
The Company's ownership interest in Seadrill Partners' common units is 28.6% of total outstanding
units as of June 30, 2016.
Seadrill deconsolidated Seadrill Partners in January 2014, recognizing its investment in common
units at market value of $30.60. Seadrill also purchased further units in 2014 at a similar price. From
October 2014 the share price began to fall to a position as at   June 30, 2016, where the market
price was at $5.37.
Following the $574 million other than temporary impairment of the Seadrill Partners investment
made in September 2015, the market price of Common Units continues to be below book value.
However, the market price for June 30, 2016 of $5.37 is an increase on the price as at December 31,
2015, thus resulting in a half-year marked to market gains of $45 million. This has been recognized
in accumulated Other Comprehensive Income for the six months ended June 30, 2016. We have
evaluated the near term prospects of our investment in Seadrill Partners in relation to the market
volatility and market down turn. Based on that evaluation and our ability and intent to hold the
investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value, we do not
consider the investment to be other than temporarily impaired as at June 30, 2016.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Seadrill Partners
Equity method investments
The Company holds investments, both in subordinated units of Seadrill Partners and direct
ownership interests in controlled subsidiaries of Seadrill Partners, which are accounted for under
the equity method.  The fair value of these investments is not readily determinable, as they are not
publicly traded.  These investments were recognized at fair value on the deconsolidation of Seadrill
Partners in January 2014, using valuations involving significant unobservable inputs, and
categorized at level 3 on the fair value hierarchy.
During the third quarter of 2015, due to the deteriorating market conditions in the offshore drilling
industry, the carrying value of the subordinated units was found to exceed the fair value by $125
million, and the carrying value of the direct ownership interests was found to exceed the fair value
by $302 million. The company recognized an other than temporary impairment of the investments
within "Loss on impairment of Investments" in the Statement of Operations for the period ended
September 30, 2015.
Cost method investments
The Company also holds the Seadrill member interest, which is a 0% non-economic interest, and
which holds the rights to 100% of the Incentive Distribution Rights "IDRs" of Seadrill Partners.  The
Seadrill Member Interest and the IDRs in Seadrill Partners are accounted for as cost-method
investments on the basis that they do not represent common stock interests and their fair value is not
readily determinable. The fair value of the Company's interest in the Seadrill Member and the
attached IDRs at deconsolidation in January 2014, was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation
method ("Monte Carlo model"). The method takes into account the cash distribution waterfall,
historical volatility, estimated dividend yield and share price of the common units as of the
deconsolidation date.
During the third quarter of 2015, due to the deteriorating market conditions in the offshore drilling
industry, the Company recognized an other than temporary impairment of $106 million. The
company recognized this impairment within "Loss on impairment of Investments" in the Statement of
Operations for the period ended September 30, 2015.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 Seadrill Partners' unit price has since increased from
$3.65 at December 31, 2015 to $5.37 at June 30, 2016.  We have evaluated the near term prospects
of our investment in Seadrill Partners in relation to the market volatility and market down turn. Based
on that evaluation and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time
sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value, we do not consider the investment to be other than
temporarily impaired as at June 30, 2016.
SeaMex Limited
During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement
with an investment fund controlled by Fintech, for the purpose of owning and managing certain jack-
up drilling units located in Mexico under contract with Pemex. The West Oberon, West Intrepid,
West Defender, West Courageous and West Titania jack-up drilling rigs were included within the
joint venture. The transaction was completed on March 10, 2015, when Fintech subscribed for a
50% ownership interest in SeaMex, which was previously 100% owned by the Company, and the
jack-up drilling rigs were acquired by SeaMex from Seadrill.
As a result of the transaction the Company no longer controls the entities that own and operate
these jack-up drilling rigs, and accordingly the Company deconsolidated these entities as of
March 10, 2015, and recognized its retained 50% investment in the joint venture at fair value. See
Note 4 to the Financial Statements for further details.
Itaunas Drilling, Camburi Drilling, and Sahy Drilling
Itaunas Drilling BV, Camburi Drilling BV and Sahy Drilling BV are joint ventures which are currently
constructing three drillships. The joint ventures are owned 70% by Sete International (a subsidiary
of Sete Brasil Participacoes SA) and 30% by the Company. During the six months ended June 30,
2016, due to the deteriorating market conditions in the offshore drilling industry, the uncertainty
around the financial condition of Sete Brasil Participacoes SA, and the uncertainty around the
recoverability of the investments, the Company recognized an other than temporary impairment of
$13 million to write down the value of these investments to nil. The company has recognized this
impairment within "Loss on impairment of Investments" in the Statement of Operations.

Accumulated impairment losses
Total closing goodwill
 
As at September 30, 2015, after a 43% decline in Seadrill closing spot price over a three month
period, an impairment test was conducted. This resulted in the Company recognizing an impairment
loss of $563 million relating to the Floaters reporting unit which represented all of the Goodwill
attributable to that reporting unit. Following the impairment the Company no longer retains any
Goodwill balance. The impairment is a result of deteriorating market conditions and the Company's
outlook on expected conditions through the current down-cycle.  The impairment charge was
allocated between the parent and non-controlling interests based upon the non-controlling interests'
share in each drilling unit within the Floater segment. The overall charge to the reporting unit was
first allocated to each drilling unit based upon the relative fair values of those drilling units. The
percentage non-controlling interest in each drilling unit was then applied to the allocated charge in
order to determine the portion attributable to non-controlling interests. The total impairment allocated
to the non-controlling interest was $95 million.
The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was derived using an income approach, using
discounted future free cash flows.  The Company's estimated future free cash flows are primarily
based on its expectations around day rates, drilling unit utilization, operating costs, capital and long
term maintenance expenditures and applicable tax rates.  The cash flows are estimated over the
remaining useful economic lives of the assets but no longer than 30 years in total, and discounted
using an estimated market participant weighted average cost of capital of 10%.
The assumptions used in the Company's estimated cash flows were derived from unobservable
inputs (level 3) and are based on management's judgments and assumptions available at the time
of performing the impairment test.

The significant developments relating to the Company's debt in the six months ended June 30, 2016
are explained below.
Bond conversion
In May 2016, Seadrill Limited entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement with certain
holders of its outstanding 5 5/8% (subsequently increased to 6.125%) Senior Notes due 2017 (the
"2017 Notes"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue a total of 8,184,340 new shares of
its common stock, par value $2.00 per share, in exchange for $55.0 million principal amount of the
2017 Notes in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Settlement occurred on May 20, 2016, upon which the Company had a total of 500,944,280 shares
of its common stock issued and outstanding.
In June 2016, Seadrill Limited entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement with certain
holders of its outstanding 5 5/8% (subsequently increased to 6.125%) Senior Notes due 2017 (the
"2017 Notes"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue a total of 7,500,000 new shares of
its common stock, par value $2.00 per share, in exchange for $50.0 million principal amount of the
2017 Notes in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Settlement occurred on June 13, 2016, upon which the Company had a total of 508,444,280 shares
of its common stock issued and outstanding.
As a result of the exchange the Company recorded a $47 million gain on debt extinguishment which
has been included within other financial items in the Company's consolidated statement of
operations.
Loans contained within the Ship Finance Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs")
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the three VIEs that we consolidate in our financial
statements, SFL Hercules Ltd, SFL Deepwater Ltd and SFL Linus Ltd, each drew down $50 million
on the revolving credit tranches of their respective $375 million term loan, $390 million term loan
and $475 million term loan. Subsequently the VIE's repaid balances with Ship Finance, a related
party to Seadrill, thus reducing the consolidated related party net debt.
Covenants contained in our debt facilities
The full list of the Company's covenants are disclosed in the annual report on 20-F for the year
ended December 31, 2015.
April 2016 Amendments to Senior Secured Credit Facilities
On April 28, 2016,  the Company executed temporary amendment agreements in respect of all of its
senior secured credit facilities. The Company also executed maturity extension agreements in
respect of three senior secured credit facilities maturing in the near term. The key terms and
conditions of these agreements are as follows:
◦
•Extensions:
$450 million Senior Secured Credit Facility: The maturity of the $450 million senior secured credit
facility, relating to the West Eminence rig, has been extended from June 20, 2016 to December 31,
2016. The outstanding balance on the credit facility of $291 million is classified as a short term debt
facility in the consolidated Balance Sheet as at June 30, 2016.
$400 million Senior Secured Credit Facility: The maturity of the $400 million senior secured credit
facility, relating to  jack-up rigs West Cressida, West Callisto, West Leda and West Triton, has been
extended from December 8, 2016 to May 31, 2017. The outstanding balance on the credit facility of
$220 million is classified as a short term debt facility in the consolidated Balance Sheet as at June
30, 2016.
$2 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility: The maturity of the $2 billion senior secured credit facility
of our majority-owned subsidiary NADL has been extended from April 15, 2017 to June 30, 2017.
The outstanding balance on the credit facility of $1,117 million is classified as a short term debt
facility in the consolidated Balance Sheet as at June 30, 2016.
◦
◦
◦
•
•Key amendments and waivers:
Equity ratio: The Company is required to maintain a total equity to total assets ratio of at least
30.0%.  Prior to the amendment, both total equity and total assets were adjusted for the difference
between book and market values of drilling units, as determined by independent broker valuations.
The amendment removes the need for the market value adjustment from the calculation of the
equity ratio until June 30, 2017.
Leverage ratio: The Company is required to maintain a ratio of net debt to EBITDA. Prior to the
amendment the leverage ratio had to be no greater than 6.0:1, falling to 5.5:1 from October 1, 2016,
and falling again to 4.5:1 from January 1, 2017.   The amendment retains the ratio at 6.0:1 until
December 31, 2016, and then increases to 6.5:1 between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2017.
Minimum-value-clauses: The Company's secured bank credit facilities contain loan-to-value
clauses, or minimum-value-clauses ("MVC"), which could require the Company to prepay a portion
of the outstanding borrowings should the value of the drilling units securing borrowings under each
of such agreements decrease below required levels.  This covenant has been suspended until
June 30, 2017.
Minimum  Liquidity: The Company has previously been required to maintain a minimum of $150
million of liquidity. This has been reset to $250 million.

in each case, subject to limited exceptions.
•Other changes and provisions:
◦Undrawn availability: The Company has agreed to refrain from borrowing any undrawn
commitments under its senior secured credit facilities.
◦Fees: The Company has agreed to pay certain fees to its lenders in consideration of these
extensions and amendments.
These extensions and amendments are designed to provide the Company and the banking group
with a period of stability and certainty while a more comprehensive financing package is agreed.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
 
Note 15 – Risk management and financial instruments
The majority of gross earnings from the Company's drilling units are receivable in US dollars and
the majority of the Company's other transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated in US
dollars, the functional currency of the Company. However, the Company has operations and assets
in a number of countries worldwide and incurs expenditures in other currencies, causing its results
from operations to be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily relative to the US
dollar. The Company is also exposed to changes in interest rates on floating interest rate debt, and
to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on primarily NOK and SEK denominated debt.
There is a potential that currency and interest rate fluctuations may have a positive or negative effect
on the value of the Company's cash flows.
Interest rate risk management
The Company's exposure to interest rate risk relates mainly to its floating interest rate debt and
balances of surplus funds placed with financial institutions. This exposure is managed through the
use of interest rate swaps and other derivative arrangements. The Company's objective is to obtain
the most favorable interest rate borrowings available without risking exposure to fluctuating interest
rates. Surplus funds are generally used to repay revolving credit facilities, which yield higher returns
than are available on fixed or overnight deposits with banks. The extent to which the Company
utilizes interest rate swaps and other derivatives to manage its interest rate risk is determined by the
net debt exposure.
Interest rate swap agreements not qualified as hedge accounting
At June 30, 2016 the Company had interest rate swap agreements with an outstanding principal of
$6,417 million (December 31, 2015: $7,266 million). The agreements have maturity dates between
September 2016 and January 2027, swapping the floating element of interest on our facilities for
fixed rates ranging between 0.69% and 3.83%. In addition we have one interest rate swap
agreement with an outstanding principal of $170 million (December 31, 2015: $178 million) under
which we pay a floating rate of LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of 2.12%. These agreements do not
qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly any changes in the fair values of the swap agreements
are included in the consolidated statement of operations under "Loss on derivative financial
instruments". The total fair value of the interest rate swaps outstanding at June 30, 2016 amounted
to a gross liability of $228 million, a net liability of $223 million due to master netting agreements
with our counterparties, and an asset of nil (December 31, 2015: a gross liability of $191 million, a
net liability of $134 million and an asset of $2 million). The fair value of the interest rate swaps are
classified as either "Other current liabilities" or "Other current assets" in the balance sheet.
Cross currency interest rate swaps not qualified as hedge accounting
At June 30, 2016 the Company had outstanding cross currency interest rate swaps with a principal
amount of $807 million (December 31, 2015: $807 million) with maturity dates between March 2018
and March 2019, swapping the floating element of interest as well as fluctuations in exchange rates
on our facilities for fixed rates ranging from 4.94% to 6.18%. These agreements do not qualify for
hedge accounting and accordingly any changes in the fair values of the swap agreements are
included in the consolidated statement of operations under "Loss on derivative financial
instruments". The total fair value of cross currency interest swaps outstanding at June 30, 2016
amounted to a gross and net liability of $274 million (December 31, 2015: gross and net liability of
$291 million). The fair value of the cross currency interest swaps are classified as other current
liabilities in the balance sheet.
Interest rate hedge accounting
A Ship Finance subsidiary consolidated by the Company as a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") (refer
to Note 16) has entered into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate its exposure to variability in cash
flows for future interest payments on the loans taken out to finance the acquisition of the West
Linus.  These interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting and any changes in its fair value are
included in "Other comprehensive income". Below is a summary of the notional amount, fixed
interest rate payable and duration of the outstanding principal as of June 30, 2016.

The total fair value of interest swaps under hedge accounting at June 30, 2016 amounted to a
liability of $4 million (December 31, 2015: liability of $2 million), classified as other non-current
liabilities in the balance sheet.
In the six months ended June 30, 2016, the VIE Ship Finance subsidiary recognized $2 million fair
value losses (six months  ended June 30, 2015: nil). Any such losses or losses recorded by the VIE
in "Other comprehensive income"  are allocated to "Non-controlling interests" in our consolidated
statement of changes in equity due to their ownership by Ship Finance.  Any change in fair value
resulting from hedge ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings.
The VIE, and therefore the Company, recognized no gain or loss due to hedge ineffectiveness in the
consolidated financial statements during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 (three and
six months ended June 30, 2015: no fair value gain or loss).

Foreign exchange risk management
The Company and the majority of its subsidiaries use the US dollar as their functional currency
because the majority of their revenues and expenses are denominated in US dollars.  The
Company's reporting currency is also US dollars. We do, however, earn revenue and incur
expenses in other currencies and there is thus a risk that currency fluctuations could have an
adverse effect on the value of our cash flows.
Foreign currency forwards not qualified as hedge accounting
As at June 30, 2016 the Company had no outstanding forward currency forwards.
Other derivative agreements
Total Return Swap Agreements
On June 3, 2016, the Company settled TRS agreements for 4,000,000 Seadrill Limited shares at a
strike price of NOK 21.16. The Company subsequently entered into a new TRS agreement for
4,000,000 Seadrill Limited common shares. The expiry date for the new TRS is September 5, 2016
and the reference price is NOK 26.2 per share.
The fair value of the TRS agreements at June 30, 2016 was a liability of $0 million (December 31,
2015: liability of $9 million). The fair values of the TRS agreements are classified as other current
liabilities/(liabilities) in the balance sheet as at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively.
SapuraKencana financing agreements
In September 2013, the Company entered into two derivative contract arrangements with a bank to
finance a portion of its equity investment in SapuraKencana, in which the Company received $250
million upfront as prepayment for one of the agreements.  The agreements had a settlement date
three years from the inception date and include an interest equivalent component which is based on
the prepaid amount received and LIBOR plus 1.9% per annum.
On July 8, 2015, the Company amended the financing arrangement relating to its equity investment
in SapuraKencana and extended the agreement to July 2018. The total financing was reduced by
$90 million to $160 million, and the corresponding restricted cash held as collateral of $93 million
was settled against the liability. In addition the interest rate increased to LIBOR plus 2.6%. As at
December 31, 2015, the Company had associated restricted cash of $160 million due to the
significant fall in the share price of SapuraKencana.
As part of these agreements, all of shares which we owned SapuraKencana were pledged as
security, the value of which as of December 31, 2015 was $228 million, and was presented as a
long term marketable security on the balance sheet. The unrealized gains and losses resulting from
measuring the fair value of these contracts as at December 31, 2015 were a gross asset of $135
million and gross liability of $135 million, which were offset in the balance sheet and income
statement as these agreements met the criteria for offsetting. The $160 million received as a
prepayment to Seadrill was included in other long-term liabilities as at December 31, 2015.
On February 24, 2016, the Company elected to exercise the optional termination notice under the
prepaid forward and equity swap agreements, and the corresponding liability of $160 million and
restricted cash of $160 million were settled, and the pledged security was released.
Realized gains and losses
The total realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statement of
operations relating to above derivative arrangements for the three and six months ended June 30,

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
 
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, which are liquid, is a
reasonable estimate of fair value and categorized at level 1 on the fair value measurement
hierarchy.
The fair value of the related party loans receivable from Seadrill Partners and SeaMex are estimated
to be equal to the carrying value. This debt is not freely tradable and cannot be recalled by the
Company at prices other than specified in the loan note agreements. The loans were entered into at
market rates. They are categorized as level 2 on the fair value measurement hierarchy. Refer to
Note 17 for further information.
The fair value of the current and long-term portion of floating rate debt is estimated to be equal to the
carrying value since it bears variable interest rates, which are reset regularly, usually every one to
six months. This debt is not freely tradable and cannot be purchased by the Company at prices other
than the outstanding balance plus accrued interest. We have categorized this at level 2 on the fair
value measurement hierarchy.
The fair value of the long-term portion of the fixed rate CIRR loans is equal to the carrying value, as
they are matched with equal balances of restricted cash. We have categorized this at level 2 on the
fair value measurement hierarchy.
The fixed interest rate bonds are freely tradable and their fair value has been set equal to the price
at which they were traded at on June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We have categorized this at
level 1 on the fair value measurement hierarchy.
The floating interest bonds are freely tradable and their fair value has been set equal to the price at
which they were traded at on June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We have categorized this at
level 1 on the fair value measurement hierarchy.
The related party fixed rate debt relates to the loans provided by Ship Finance to the Company's
VIE's totaling $415 million. The fair value of these loans are estimated to be equal to the carrying
value as the loans were entered into at market rates.  The debt is not freely tradable and cannot be
purchased by the Company at prices other than the outstanding balance. We have categorized this
at level 2 on the fair value measurement hierarchy. Refer to Note 17 for further information.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
US GAAP emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair
value measurements, US GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the
reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy) and
the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs
classified within level three of the hierarchy).
Level one input utilizes unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
that the Company has the ability to access. Level two inputs are inputs other than quoted prices
included in level one that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level
two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as
inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, other than quoted prices, such as interest rates,
foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level
three inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's
own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the
determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value
hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The
Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its
entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
Quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair value of marketable securities, which are valued
at fair value on a recurring basis.
The fair value of total return equity swaps is calculated using the closing prices of the underlying
listed shares, dividends paid since inception and the interest rate charged by the counterparty.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward exchange contracts are
calculated using well-established independent valuation techniques, using the income method
approach, applied to contracted cash flows and LIBOR, NIBOR and STIBOR interest rates as of
June 30, 2016.
The fair value of other derivative instruments is calculated using the closing prices of the underlying
securities, dividends paid since inception and the interest charged by the counterparty.
Credit risk
The Company has financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities,
other receivables and certain amounts receivable on derivative instruments, mainly forward
exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. These assets expose the Company to credit risk arising
from possible default by the counterparty. The Company considers the counterparties to be
creditworthy financial institutions and does not expect any significant loss to result from non-
performance by such counterparties. The Company, in the normal course of business, does not
demand collateral. The credit exposure of interest rate swap agreements, currency option contracts
and foreign currency contracts is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value
at the end of each period, reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. It is the Company's
policy to enter into master netting agreements with the counterparties to derivative financial
instrument contracts, which give the Company the legal right to discharge all or a portion of amounts
owed to counterparty by offsetting them against amounts that the counterparty owes to the
Company.
Note 16 – Variable Interest Entities
As of June 30, 2016, the Company leased two semi-submersible rigs, and one jack-up rig from Ship
Finance VIEs under capital leases. Each of the units had been sold by the Company to single
purpose subsidiaries of Ship Finance and simultaneously leased back by the Company on bareboat
charter contracts for a term of 15 years. The Company has several options to repurchase the units
during the charter periods, and obligations to purchase the assets at the end of the 15 year lease
period.
The following table gives a summary of the sale and leaseback arrangements, as of June 30, 2016:

The Company has determined that the Ship Finance subsidiaries, which own the units, are VIEs,
and that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards connected with the
ownership of the units and the charter contracts. Accordingly, these VIEs are fully consolidated in
the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company did not record any gains from the
sale of the units, as they continued to be reported as assets at their original cost in the Company's
balance sheet at the time of each transaction. The equity attributable to Ship Finance in the VIEs is
included in non-controlling interests in the Company's consolidated accounts. At June 30, 2016 and
at December 31, 2015 the units are reported under drilling units in the Company's balance sheet.
The bareboat charter rates are set on the basis of a Base LIBOR Interest Rate for each bareboat
charter contract, and thereafter are adjusted for differences between the LIBOR fixing each month
and the Base LIBOR Interest Rate for each contract. A summary of the bareboat charter rates per
day for each unit is given below.

(f) Bareboat charter arrangements
In connection with the transfer of the West Aquarius operations to Canada, the West Aquarius
drilling contract was assigned to Seadrill Canada Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Seadrill
Partners, necessitating certain changes to the related party contractual arrangements relating to the
West Aquarius. Seadrill China Operations Ltd, the owner of the West Aquarius and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Seadrill Partners, had previously entered into a bareboat charter arrangement with
Seadrill Offshore AS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seadrill, providing Seadrill Offshore AS with the
right to use the West Aquarius. In October 2012, this bareboat charter arrangement was replaced
with a new bareboat charter between Seadrill China Operations Ltd and Seadrill Offshore AS, and
at the same time, Seadrill Offshore AS entered into a bareboat charter arrangement providing
Seadrill Canada Ltd. with the right to use the West Aquarius in order to perform its obligations under
the drilling contract described above. The net effect to Seadrill of the bareboat charters for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 was net revenue of $5 million (six months ended June 30, 2015: net
expense of $5 million).

credit facility agreements for the T-15 and T-16, certain subsidiaries of the Company and Seadrill
Partners are jointly and severally liable for their own debt and obligations under the relevant facility
and the debt and obligations of other borrowers who are also party to such agreements. These
obligations are continuing and extend to amounts payable by any borrower under the relevant

obligations related to these facilities which do not relate to the T-15 and T-16.
West Vencedor loan agreement - The West Vencedor Loan Agreement between the Company and
Seadrill Partners was scheduled to mature in June 2015 and all outstanding amounts thereunder

Archer transactions
Loans
On March 6, 2015, the Company purchased a $50 million subordinated loan made by Metrogas, a
related party, to Archer, a related party. The aggregate consideration paid for the loan by the
Company to Metrogas was $51 million which is equal to the sum of the outstanding principal
amount of $50 million and $1 million accrued commitment fee and interest on the loan. The loan
bears interest at 7.5% per annum and has a commitment fee of 1% on any undrawn amount. As of
the date of the purchase by the Company there was no undrawn amount. Interest and any
commitment fee is due upon maturity of the loan on June 30, 2018. Interest income for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 for this loan was $2 million (six months ended June 30, 2015: $1
million)
In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's $50 million subordinated loan to Archer was
written down to nil due to the Company's share of net losses of Archer reducing the investment
balance. The Company's accounting policy, once its investment in the common stock of an investee
has reached nil, is to apply the equity method to other investments in the investees securities, loans
and or advances based on seniority and liquidity. The Company's share of equity method losses or
gains is determined based on the change in the Company's claim on net assets of the investee.
Archer's net losses and other comprehensive income were therefore applied to the Company's loan
to Archer at its invested ownership of 39.89%.
On May 27, 2016, the Company granted a $75 million subordinated loan to Archer. The loan bears
interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum and is repayable together with the interest on June 30, 2018.
During the quarter, the $75 million loan was written down by $18 million due to the Company's
share of net losses of Archer reducing the investment balance. The Company's accounting policy
once it's investment in the common stock of an investee has reached nil is to apply the equity
method to other investments in the investees securities, loans and or advances based on seniority
and liquidity. The Company's share and equity method losses or gains is determined based on the
change in the Company's claim on net assets of the investee. Archer's net losses and other
comprehensive income were therefore applied to the Company's loan to Archer at its invested
ownership of 39.89%. The outstanding book value of the loan as at June 30, 2016 was $57 million.

support to Seamex. Simultaneously, the lenders to SeaMex have provided a short-term amendment
to the bank facility to provide some additional flexibility.

Legal Proceedings
From time to time we are a party, as plaintiff or defendant, to lawsuits in various jurisdictions for
demurrage, damages, off-hire and other claims and commercial disputes arising from the
construction or operation of our drilling units, in the ordinary course of business or in connection with
our acquisition or disposal activities.  We believe that the resolution of such claims will not have a
material impact individually or in the aggregate on our operations or financial condition. Our best
estimate of the outcome of the various disputes has been reflected in our financial statements as of
June 30, 2016.
In December 2014, a purported shareholder class action lawsuit, Fuchs et al. v. Seadrill Limited et
al., No. 14-cv-9642 (LGS)(KNF), was filed in US Federal District Court in the Southern District of
New York, alleging, among other things, that Seadrill and certain of its executives made materially
false and misleading statements in connection with the payment of dividends. In January 2015, a
second purported shareholder class action lawsuit, Heron v. Seadrill Limited et al., No. 15-cv-0429
(LGS)(KNF), was filed in the same court on similar grounds. In March 2015, a third purported
shareholder class action lawsuit, Glow v. Seadrill Limited et al., No. 15-cv-1770 (LGS)(KNF), was
filed in the same court on similar grounds. On March 24, 2015, the court consolidated these
complaints into a single action. On June 23, 2015 the court appointed co-lead plaintiffs and co-lead
counsel and ordered the co-lead plaintiffs to file a single consolidated amended complaint by July
23, 2015.
The amended complaint was filed on July 23, 2015 alleging, among other things, that Seadrill, North
Atlantic Drilling Limited and certain of their executives made materially false and misleading
statements in connection with the payment of dividends, the failure to disclose the risks to the
Rosneft transaction as a result of various enacted government sanctions and the inclusion in
backlog of $4.1 billion attributable to the Rosneft transaction.
The defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss the Complaint on October 13, 2015. The plaintiffs, in
turn, filed their Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss on November 12, 2015 and the defendants'
Reply Brief was served on December 4, 2015.
On June 21, 2016 the court issued an order granting the defendants' Motion to Dismiss. On July 15,
2016 the Court entered a judgment dismissing the Complaint with prejudice. The thirty days' appeal
period has expired without appeal and the matter is therefore closed.
In addition, the Company has received voluntary requests for information from the US Securities and
Exchange Commission concerning, among other things, statements in connection with its payment
of dividends, inclusion of contracts in the Company's backlog, and its contracts with Rosneft.
 
Other matters
On October 12, 2015, HSHI launched arbitration proceedings with regard to Seadrill's cancellation
of the West Mira construction contract. HSHI have claimed that Seadrill's cancellation was a
repudiatory breach and claim they were due various extensions of time. The Company refutes this
vigorously, and believes it has the contractual right to recover the $170 million in pre-delivery
installments, plus accrued interest, and legal costs. The recovery is however now not expected until
the conclusion of an arbitration process under English law, which is expected to take up to two
years. Based both on management's assessment of the facts and circumstances, and advice from
external counsel, who have been engaged for the arbitration process, the Company believes the
recovery of the installment, plus accrued interest, and legal costs, is probable, as defined by US
GAAP. As such, the Company has reclassified from "Newbuildings," a receivable of $170 million
plus accrued interest of $38 million, which is presented in "Other non-current assets" on the balance
sheet. The Company will continue to assess the recoverability throughout the arbitration process.
Sevan Drilling is a controlled subsidiary of the Company. On June 29, 2015, Sevan Drilling
disclosed that it had initiated an internal investigation into activities with an agent under certain
drilling contracts with Petrobras in Brazil, which were entered prior to the separation from the Sevan
Marine Group. On October 16, 2015, Sevan further disclosed that Sevan Drilling ASA had been
accused of breaches of Sections 276 a and 276 b of the Norwegian Criminal Code in respect of
payments made in connection with the performance during 2012 to 2015 of drilling contracts
originally awarded by Petrobras to Sevan Marine ASA in the period between 2005-2008. For further
details please refer to the Sevan Drilling Annual Report and Financial Statements for the Year
Ended December 31, 2015, which is publicly available. We cannot predict whether any other
governmental authority will seek to investigate this matter, or if a proceeding were opened, the
scope or ultimate outcome of any such investigation and as a result no loss contingency has been
recognized in Seadrill's consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In February 2016, NADL was notified of certain customer claims. After an initial assessment
including advice from external counsel, NADL fully refutes the validity of these claims and will take
appropriate actions related to its position. The client has withheld amounts from invoice payments
due in the first quarter of 2016, which total $36.2 million. No provision has been recognized in
relation to these claims.
North Atlantic Drilling, and all other offshore contractors that are members of the Norwegian
Shipowners' Association, lost a Norwegian court case in July 2015 concerning the pension rights of
night shift compensation for offshore workers. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of
Norway and the hearing was held in June 2016. The Supreme Court of Norway ruled in favor of the
members of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association, and as such the Company does not consider
there to be any remaining contingent liability.

Note 20 – Assets held for sale
On December 2, 2015, NADL signed an amendment with Jurong Shipyard ("Jurong") for the deferral
of the delivery of the semi-submersible drilling unit, the West Rigel (the "Unit"). The deferral period
lasts until June 2016, following completion of which, the Company and Jurong have agreed to form
a Joint Asset Holding Company for joint ownership of the Unit, to be owned 23% by the NADL and
77% by Jurong, in the event no employment is secured for the Unit and no alternative transaction is
completed. Until the end of the deferral period, the Company will continue to market the unit for an
acceptable drilling contract, and the Unit will remain at the Jurong Shipyard in Singapore. The
Company and Jurong may also consider other commercial opportunities for the Unit during this
period. However, based on current market conditions, management deems the most probable
outcome to be that the Unit will be contributed to the Joint Asset Holding Company.
 
As a result, the Company classified the Unit  as "Held for Sale" in its balance sheet. This resulted in
a loss of $82 million being the difference between the net book value of the unit of $210 million,
compared to the expected recoverable value of the Company's investment in the Joint Asset
Holding Company of $128 million. The loss was recognized in "Loss on disposal" in the Statement
of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Note 21 – Subsequent Events
West Pegasus
On August 22, 2016 the Company received a notice of termination from Pemex Exploracion y
Servicios ("Pemex") for the West Pegasus drilling contract (the "Contract") effective 16 August
2016.  Seadrill has disputed the grounds for termination and is reviewing its legal options. During
the second quarter of 2015 Seadrill signed a provisional commitment for a two year extension to the
Contract with Pemex for the West Pegasus. In conjunction with the extension, the dayrate for the
remaining term of the initial contract was reduced. The extension of the Contract was finalized
during the first quarter of 2016. As part of this agreement, Seadrill and Seamex Limited ("Seamex"),
our 50% owned joint venture with Fintech, agreed to reduce the dayrate on five jack-ups for a period
of 365 days. The agreement to reduce the dayrates of the existing contracts was contingent upon
final confirmation of the two year extension of the West Pegasus by Pemex management. In the
event of termination, Seadrill and Seamex are entitled to recover the dayrate concessions as well as
the demobilization for the West Pegasus.  In addition, Seadrill will seek reimbursement of certain
costs incurred in anticipation of the extension.
