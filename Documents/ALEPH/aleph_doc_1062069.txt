structures based on measurements of the gravity of rocks. 
Layered granite-like rock. 
An iron-oxide rich weathered product overlying a sulphide deposit. 
A coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock consisting of quartz, feldspar and mica. 
Grams per tonne. 
Rock alteration simply means changing the mineralogy of the rock.  The old 
minerals are replaced by new ones because there has been a change in the 
conditions.  These changes could be changes in temperature, pressure, or 
chemical conditions or any combination of these.  Hydrothermal alteration is a 
change in the mineralogy as a result of interaction of the rock with hot water 
fluids, called “hydrothermal fluids”. 
Hydrothermal fluids cause hydrothermal alteration of rocks by passing (hot) 
water fluids through the rocks and changing their composition by adding or 
removing or redistributing components.  Temperatures can range from weakly 
elevated to boiling.  Fluid composition is extremely variable.  They may contain 
various types of gases, salts (briney fluids), water, and metals. 
Illite is a layered alumino-silicate clay that is formed from hydrothermal 
environments. 
A geophysical survey method which measures the electrochemical properties of 
rocks.  Time domain IP methods measure the voltage decay or chargeability over 
a specified time interval after the induced voltage is removed.  Frequency 
domain IP methods use alternating currents (AC) to induce electric charges in the 
subsurface, and the apparent resistivity is measured at different AC frequencies. 
 
Grams per tonne gold. 
A blue/grey igneous rock which contains olivine, serpentine, calcite and silica.  
A measure of distance known as a kilometre. 
To dissolve from a rock. For example, when acidic water passes through 
fractured rocks, soluble minerals leach or dissolve from the rocks. 
Zone of metal veins. 
The chemical symbol for molybdenum. 
The chemical symbol for magnesium. 
Igneous rocks with dark minerals. 
A specific type of electromagnetic geophysical survey. 
One of the grand divisions of geologic time, follows the Paleaozoic and 
succeeded by the Cenozoic. 
The study of extracting metals from their ores. 
The concentration of metals and their chemical compounds within a body of rock. 
The chemical symbol for nickel. 
Net Smelter Returns.  A royalty paid from the sale of mined minerals. 
Ounce per ton. 
A natural aggregate of one or more minerals, which at a specified time and place, 
may be mined and sold at a profit, or which from some part may be profitably 
separated. 
A measure of weight known as an ounce. 
A deposit of sand and gravel containing valuable metals such as gold, tin or 
diamonds.

Period of time in Earth’s history between 2.5 billion years ago and 544 million 
years ago. 
Parts per million. 
A yellow iron sulphide mineral, normally of little value. It is sometimes referred 
to as "fool's gold". 
The calculation of an age in years of geologic materials by any one of several age 
determination methods based on nuclear decay of natural radioactive elements 
contained in the material. 
A small portion of rock or a mineral deposit taken so that the metal content can 
be determined by assaying. 
Selecting a fractional but representative part of a mineral deposit for analysis. 
The deformation of rocks by lateral movement along innumerable parallel 
planes, generally resulting from pressure and producing such metamorphic 
structures as cleavage and schistosity. 
The coarse or bearing of a bed or layer of rock. 
Material rejected from a mill after most of the recoverable valuable minerals 
have been extracted. 
The chemical symbol for thorium. 
The chemical symbol for uranium. 
Uranium oxide. The mixture of uranium oxides produced after milling uranium 
ore from a mine.  Sometimes loosely called “yellowcake”.  It is yellow in colour 
and is usually represented by the empirical formula U3O8. Uranium is sold in this 
form. 
A boundary separating two or more rocks of markedly different ages, marking a 
gap in the geologic record. 
The theoretical model for the characterization of major uranium deposits located 
in the Athabasca Basin.  Deposition/concentration of high-grade “unconformity” 
uranium deposits are thought to result from the chemical interaction of dissolved 
uranium present in water-saturated sediments above the unconformity with 
reducing gases and fluids generated from significant hydrothermal activity 
emanating from below the unconformity.  High-grade uranium deposits have 
been observed to occur at, above, and/or below the unconformity. 
 
Many unconformity-type deposits are marked by the surrounding presence of 
sandstone and basement rocks that have also been chemically-altered due to 
hydrothermal activity.  These larger rock “alteration” zones represent the primary 
targets for uranium explorers as the altered physical properties of the rocks can 
be detected via various airborne and land-based geophysical survey methods.  In 
addition, the presence of geological fault structures is highly-correlated with 
high-grade uranium deposition, with the fault structures likely acting as the 
conduits for the upwelling of hydrothermal fluids. 
A mineral consisting of uranium oxide and trace amounts of radium and thorium 
and polonium and lead and helium; uraninite in massive form is called 
pitchblende which is the chief uranium ore. 
A fissure, fault or crack in a rock filled by minerals that have traveled upwards 
from some deep source. 
Igneous rocks formed from magma that has flowed out or has been violently 
ejected from a volcano.

* The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended April 30, 2009 and 2008 have been restated 
to reflect the income tax losses and other carry forward balances as reported by the Company on its formal Canadian 
income  tax  filings  and  as  ultimately  assessed  by  Canada  Revenue  Agency.    The  differences  between  the  previously 
reported amounts and the restated amounts are due to changes in taxation estimates, the expiration of Canadian non-
capital loss balances in 2009 and 2008, and accounting for the income tax effect of flow-through shares issued in 2009.

D. 
 
The Company is engaged in the exploration of mineral properties, an inherently risky business. The funds spent on the 
exploration  and  development  of  a  mineral  deposit  may  not  result  in  the  discovery  of  an  economic  ore  body.  Most 
exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits.  
 
(1)
Commodity Prices
Risk Factors
The profitability of the Company’s operations will be dependent upon the market price of mineral commodities. Mineral 
prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the Company. The prices of mineral 
commodities  have  fluctuated  widely  in  recent  years.  Current  and  future  price  declines  could  cause  commercial 
production  to be  impracticable.  The  Company’s  future revenues  and  earnings  also  could  be  affected by  the prices  of 
other commodities such as fuel and other consumable items, although to a lesser extent than by the price of mineral 
commodities. 
 
(2) 
 
The  mining  industry  is  intensely  competitive  in  all  of  its  phases,  and  the  Company  competes  with  many  companies 
possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities than itself with respect to the discovery and acquisition of 
interests in mineral properties, the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and other persons to carry out its 
mineral exploration activities. Competition in the mining industry could adversely affect the Company’s prospects for 
mineral exploration in the future. 
 
 (3)
Foreign Political Risk
Competition
The Company’s material property interests are currently located in Canada, USA and New Zealand. An insignificant 
portion  of  the  Company’s  interests  are  exposed  to  various  degrees  of  political,  economic  and  other  risks  and 
uncertainties.  The  Company’s  operations  and  investments  may  be  affected  by  local  political  and  economic 
developments,  including  expropriation,  nationalization,  invalidation  of  government  orders,  permits  or  agreements 
pertaining  to  property  rights,  political  unrest,  labour  disputes,  limitations  on  repatriation  of  earnings,  limitations  on 
mineral exports, limitations on foreign ownership, inability to obtain or delays in obtaining necessary mining permits, 
opposition  to  mining  from  local,  environmental  or  other  non-governmental  organizations,  government  participation, 
royalties,  duties,  rates  of  exchange,  high  rates  of  inflation,  price  controls,  exchange  controls,  currency  fluctuations, 
taxation and changes in laws, regulations or policies as well as by laws and policies of Canada affecting foreign trade, 
investment and taxation.
11
Title to Properties
Estimates of Mineral Resources
Government Laws, Regulation and Permitting
(4) 
 
Mining  and  exploration  activities  of  the  Company  are  subject  to  both  domestic  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations 
governing  prospecting,  development,  production,  taxes,  labour  standards,  occupational  health,  mine  safety,  waste 
disposal,  toxic  substances,  the  environment  and  other  matters.  Although  the  Company  believes  that  all  exploration 
activities are currently carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations, no assurance can be given that 
new rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing rules and regulations will not be applied in a manner which 
could limit or curtail production or development. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing the operations 
and activities of the Company or more stringent implementation thereof could have a substantial adverse impact on the 
Company. 
 
The  operations  of  the  Company  will  require  licenses  and  permits  from  various  governmental  authorities  to  carry  out 
exploration  and  development  at  its  projects.  In  Canada,  the  issuance  of  governmental  licenses  and  permits  are 
increasingly being influenced by land use consultations between the government and local First Nations communities. 
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the necessary licences and permits on acceptable 
terms,  in  a  timely  manner or at  all.  Any failure  to  comply  with permits  and  applicable  laws  and regulations,  even  if 
inadvertent, could result in the interruption or closure of operations or material fines, penalties or other liabilities. 
 
(5) 
 
Acquisition of rights to the mineral properties is a very detailed and time-consuming process. Title to, and the area of, 
mineral properties may be disputed. Although the Company has investigated the title to all of the properties for which it 
holds concessions or other mineral leases or licenses or in respect of which it has a right to earn an interest, the Company 
cannot give an assurance that title to such properties will not be challenged or impugned. 
 
The Company has the right to earn an increased economic interest in certain of its properties. To earn this increased 
interest,  the  Company  is  required  to  make  certain  exploration  expenditures  and  payments  of  cash  and/or  Company 
shares. If the Company fails to make these expenditures and payments, the Company may lose its right to such properties 
and forfeit any funds expended up to such time. 
 
(6) 
 
The  mineral  resource  estimates  used  by  the  Company  are  estimates  only  and  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  any 
particular  level  of  recovery  of  minerals  will  in  fact  be  realized  or  that  an  identified  resource  will  ever  qualify  as  a 
commercially  mineable  (or  viable)  deposit  which  can be  legally  or  commercially  exploited.  In  addition,  the  grade of 
mineralization ultimately mined may differ from that indicated by drilling results and such differences could be material. 
 
(7) 
The  Company  has  limited  financial  resources,  no  sources  of  operating  cash  flows  and  no  assurances  that  sufficient 
funding,  including  adequate  financing,  will  be  available.  If  the  Company’s  exploration  programs  are  successful, 
additional funds will be required in order to complete the development of its projects. The sources of funds currently 
available to the Company are the raising of equity capital, further financing from the Companies strategic partners, or the 
offering  of  an  ownership  interest  in  its  projects  to  a  third  party.  There  is  no  assurance  that  the  Company  will  be 
successful  in  raising  sufficient  funds  to  conduct  further  exploration  and  development  of  its  projects  or  to  fulfill  its 
obligations under the terms of any option or joint venture agreements, in which case the Company may have to delay or 
indefinitely postpone further exploration and development, or forfeit its interest in its projects or prospects. 
 
(8) 
 
The  success  of  the  Company  will  be  largely  dependent  upon  the  performance  of  its  key  officers,  consultants  and 
employees. Locating mineral deposits depends on a number of factors, not the least of which is the technical skill of the 
exploration  personnel  involved.  The  success  of  the  Company  is  largely  dependent  on  the  performance  of  its  key 
individuals. Failure to retain key individuals or to attract or retain additional key individuals with necessary skills could 
have a materially adverse impact upon the Company’s success. 
 
(9)
Cash Flows and Additional Funding Requirements
Key Management
Volatility of Share Price
Market  prices  for  shares  of  early  stage  companies  are  often  volatile.  Factors  such  as  announcements  of  mineral 
discoveries, financial results, and other factors could have a significant effect on the price of the Company’s shares and 
the amount of financing that can be raised by the Company.
12
(10)
Foreign Currency Exchange
A small portion of the Company’s expenses are now incurred in foreign currencies. The Company’s business will be 
subject to risks typical of an international business including, but not limited to, differing tax structures, regulations and 
restrictions and general foreign exchange rate volatility. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar 
and  such  other  currencies  may  have  a  material  effect  on  the  Company’s  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of 
operations and could result in downward price pressure for the Company’s products or losses from currency exchange 
rate fluctuations. The Company does not actively hedge against foreign currency fluctuations. 
 
(11) 
 
Some  of  the  Company’s  directors  and  officers  are  directors  and  officers  of  other  natural  resource  or  mining-related 
companies.  These associations may give rise from time to time to conflicts of interest.  As a result of such conflict, the 
Company may miss the opportunity to participate in certain transactions.
Conflict of Interest

Forward Looking Information
Forward-looking information is included in this Form 20-F, which involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and 
other factors that may cause actual results, performance, achievements or industry results, to be materially different from 
any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking information.  Forward-
looking  information  is  identified  by  the  use  of  terms  and  phrases  such  as  “anticipate”,  “believe”,  “could”,  “estimate”, 
“expect”, “intend”, “may”, “plan”, “predict”, “project”, “will”, “would”, and similar terms and phrases, including references 
to assumptions.  Such information may involve, but are not limited to, comments with respect to strategies, expectations, 
planned operations or future actions.
Forward-looking  information  reflects  current  expectations  of  management  regarding  future  events  and  operating 
performance as of the date of this Annual Report.  Such information involves significant risks and uncertainties, should 
not be read as guarantees of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of whether or 
not such results will be achieved.  A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results 
discussed in the forward-looking information, including, but not limited to, the following factors (as discussed above): 
industry;  commodity  prices;  competition;  foreign  political  risk;  government  laws;  regulation  and  permitting;  title  to 
properties; estimates of mineral resources; cash flows and additional funding requirements; key management; possible 
dilution to present and prospective shareholders; material risk of dilution presented by large number of outstanding share 
purchase options and warrants; trading volume; volatility of share price; foreign currency risk; and conflict of interest.
Although  the  forward-looking  information  contained  in  this  Annual  Report  is  based  upon  what  the  Company’s 
management  believes  to  be  reasonable  assumptions,  the  Company  cannot  assure  investors  that  actual  results  will  be 
consistent with such information.  Forward-looking information reflects management’s current beliefs and is based on 
information currently available to the Company.  Such information reflects current assumptions regarding future events 
and operating performance including, without limitation, a strong global demand for  mineral commodities, continued 
funding and continued strength in the industry in which the Company operates, and speaks only as of the date of this 
discussion.  The forward-looking information is made as of the date of this Annual Report.

Cree East is a high-priority project located in the south-eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin, 35 kilometres west of the 
formerly producing Key Lake mine and 5 to 22 kilometres north of the south rim of the Athabasca Basin. The project is 
comprised  of  16  contiguous  mineral  claims  totaling  approximately  56,000  hectares.  A  Korean  Consortium  (Hanwha 
Corp., Korea Electric Power Corp., Korea Resources Corp. and SK Energy Co. Ltd.), in December 2007 agreed to spend 
$19 million on the properties to earn into a 50% interest in the Cree East project.  
 
As of April 30, 2010, the Korean Consortium has contributed $12.6 million towards exploration of the project and holds 
a 40.6% ownership interest in both CanAlaska Korea Uranium Ltd. and the Canada-Korea Uranium Limited Partnership. 
The following table summarizes the Korean Consortium expenditures and advances by quarter, fiscal year ended, and 
life to date (“LTD”) on the project. The table does not include a $0.6 million payment made directly to CanAlaska for 
intellectual property associated with the project.

In April  2010,  the  Company  announced  the  preliminary  results  from  the  April  2010 (Q410) winter drilling program, 
where 14 holes were completed (6,139 metres). Initial information from the winter drill program indicates four areas of 
basement faulting, hydrothermal alteration, and radioactivity, consistent with Athabasca uranium deposit models. At the 
commencement of the program, ten separate target zones had been defined by airborne and ground geophysics, along a 5 
kilometre trend. Locally, these features exhibited strong electromagnetic responses.  
 
The Company is currently awaiting laboratory assay results from drill core zones with high radiometric counts, as well as 
the results of the trace element geochemistry for these and surrounding drill holes. Based on the preliminary Winter 2010 
results, Zone A warrants additional drilling in the summer of 2010 to precisely test the East-West structural trends, and 
the associated large fault uplifts (over 50 metres vertical).  
 
Drill hole CRE043 at Zone G exhibited several zones of strong fracturation and bleaching in the sandstone over 97.5 
metres (from 231 metres to the unconformity at 328.5 metres). At this location, the basement rocks also gave indications 
of uranium mineralization at 402 metres (maximum of 2,224 counts per second on probe), this equates to a radiometric 
grade  of  2.15  metres  @  0.024  eU1.  CRE043  also  exhibited  hematite  alteration  to  431  metres  depth.  For  a  complete 
understanding of the drilling results reference should be made to the Company’s press release of April 13, 2010. 
 
In July 2009, the Company embarked on a $0.9 million program of geophysics investigation, comprising hi-resolution 
airborne  magnetic,  close-spaced  airborne  VTEM  (4,368  kilometres)  and  ground  TDEM  surveys.  The  targeting  data 
received from these surveys will be used to guide future drilling efforts. In Q110 and Q210 respectively, the Company 
also conducted 40 and 85 kilometres of induced polarization (“IP”) resistivity surveys. In fiscal 2010, 28% and 26% of 
exploration  expenditures  were  associated  with  geophysics and  drilling  respectively.    Under  the  Cree  East  agreement, 
CanAlaska is entitled to charge an operator fee of 10% to recoup its indirect costs associated with the project, which the 
Company recognizes as management fees.

The  West  McArthur  project  in  the  Athabasca  Basin,  Saskatchewan,  was  optioned  in  April  2007  to  MC  Resources 
Canada Ltd. (formerly Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd.), a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan. Under the 
option agreement, MC Resources Canada Ltd. (“MC Canada”) could exercise an option to earn a 50% interest in the 
property by investing $11 million. In February 2010, MC Canada exercised their option with a payment to the Company 
and an unincorporated 50/50 joint venture was formed between the parties to pursue further exploration and development 
of the property. The Company acts as project operator and earns a fee between 5% and 10%, based on expenditures 
incurred.  The  West  McArthur  project  is  located  immediately  west  of  the  McArthur  River  uranium  mine  operated  by 
Cameco Corp.

During Q410, the Company carried out a 6,071 metre drilling program combined with ground geophysics. The six-hole 
drill program was focused on a large conductive zone in the Grid 1 area on the western portion of the project. Previous 
drill holes, located over an area 2.0 kilometres by 2.5 kilometres, have intersected separate zones of anomalous uranium 
mineralization, silicification, and sandstone alteration. The 2010 winter drilling was successful in intersecting graphitic 
horizons  which  follow  the  conductive  trend.  Of  particular  note  is  uranium  mineralization  in  two  holes.    Drill  hole 
WMA022: (0.5 metres @ 0.013% U3O8 in the basement (888.1-888.6 metres)) and drill hole WMA024: (0.5 metres @ 
0.018% U3O8 in sandstone (729.4-729.9 metres)). 
 
Where  there  was  evidence  of  hydrothermal  alteration,  it  extended  well  into  the  sandstone  and  matches  the  typical 
alteration  model  of  Athabasca  unconformity  style  uranium  deposits.  There  is  evidence  of  uranium  mineralization  in 
multiple  areas,  either  as  enrichment  at  the  unconformity  or  in  basement  stringers.  The  most  compelling  features  for 
further exploration are the uranium values in sandstone higher in the stratigraphy, the hematized and broken rock in the 
sandstone, and the pattern of basement offsets and geophysical conductivity.  
 
Following  discussion  of  the  winter  2010  exploration  results  at  a  recent  joint  venture  management  meeting,  the  joint 
venture will now contract further geophysical surveys on a property-wide basis commencing this summer and extend the 
winter geophysical survey for Grid 5 (located 10 kilometres SSE of Grid 1), where a well-defined conductor and low 
resistivity geophysical zone has been identified. The plan for exploration is progressively to test the seven grids on the 
property  with  Phase  1  surveys  to  outline  potential  and  to  provide  the  basis  for  Phase  2  target  definition.  Drilling  is 
planned on Grid 5 in Winter 2011 as part of the Phase 1 evaluation program. For a complete understanding of the drilling 
results reference should be made to the Company’s press release of June 21, 2010. 
 
In fiscal 2010, drilling costs comprised 43% of the total exploration costs at West McArthur from the 6,071 metre drill 
program  completed  in  the  fourth  quarter.  Included  within  Other  expenses  are  management  fees  charged  to  and 
reimbursed by Mitsubishi for CanAlaska acting as project operator.

The Poplar project, comprising approximately 71,000 hectares, was staked by the Company in 2006 and covers all of the 
northern edge of the Athabasca Basin located between CanAlaska’s Helmer and Lake Athabasca projects. 
 
In June 2009, the Company announced that it had executed an MOU with East Resource Inc. (“ERI”) on the Poplar 
project.  ERI  had  a  prior,  similar  MOU  with  the  Company  to  undertake  uranium  exploration  at  the  Company's  NE 
Wollaston project in the Province of Manitoba. However, due to prolonged delays in receiving exploration permits for 
NE  Wollaston  from  the  Province  of  Manitoba  which  required  aboriginal  consultations,  East  Resource  Inc.  and 
CanAlaska  agreed  to  work  together  on  the  Poplar  project  under  similar  earn-in  terms  as  the  prior  MOU  for  NE 
Wollaston.

During fiscal 2009, the Company conducted 1,130 kilometres of prospecting and seismic geophysics over approximately 
1,600 kilometres. This work program outlined uranium mineralization in basement rocks located north of the edge of 
Lake Athabasca, and indicated continuity of mineralized units and structural breaks associated with mineralizing systems 
further to the south into areas covered by the lake. The airborne surveys and extensive geophysical seismic surveying in 
the lake-covered area also show a large number of anomalous conductive zones and structural breaks, which elsewhere 
are generally thought to be associated with mineralizing events. Detailed analysis of the data continues. 
 
Under the terms of the MOU, ERI may earn a 40% interest in the Poplar project by undertaking a minimum of 100,000 
metres of diamond drilling within 5 years. ERI may earn a 70% interest by undertaking a minimum of 50,000 metres of 
diamond drilling, successfully completing feasibility study for a minimum economic reserve of 15 million pounds U3O8 
and fully-financing the costs of mine construction. ERI may earn an 80% interest by undertaking a minimum of 50,000 
metres  of  diamond  drilling,  successfully  completing  feasibility  study  for  a  minimum  economic  reserve  of  35  million 
pounds U3O8 and fully-financing the costs of mine construction. ERI may also earn an additional 15% interest to hold a 
cumulative  95%  ownership  by  granting  to  CanAlaska  a  5%  gross  revenue  royalty  from  the  production  and  sale  of 
minerals. 
 
In August 2009, ERI funded $270,000 under their MOU for exploration work on the project. Accordingly, in Q210, six 
ERI geologists from China, along with CanAlaska personnel commenced geological mapping and prospecting of 5 target 
zones in preparation for future drilling programs.  In Q410, discussions on a definitive agreement between the Company 
and ERI in respect of the Poplar project continued.

On October 18, 2006, CanAlaska optioned the Fond Du Lac project from the Fond Du Lac Denesuline First Nation. The 
project spans approximately 36,000 hectares and contains a uranium deposit with a historical (non 43-101 compliant) 
resource. CanAlaska can earn a 49% interest in the project by funding $2 million in exploration over 5 years. In addition, 
the Company is committed to pay to the Fond Du Lac Denesuline First Nation a further $130,000 in cash consideration 
($50,000 paid; June 2010: $40,000; June 2011:$40,000) and 300,000 shares (200,000 shares issued; June 2010: 50,000;

Black Lake Project, Saskatchewan – Optioned from Black Lake Densuline First Nation
The Company received its exploration permit from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada on June 24, 2008. In July and 
August  2008,  the  Company  carried  out  a  1,300  metre  drill  program  in  the  vicinity  of  the  zone  of  known  uranium 
mineralization. In mid-September 2008, the Company released the first drill results from the program, confirming good 
uranium mineralization and significant response from ongoing geophysical surveys over the target area. 
 
In  Q209  and  Q309,  the  Company  undertook  over  2,500  kilometres  of  airborne  geophysics  and  63  line  kilometres  of 
prospecting.  The  results  from  the  geophysics  and  drill  program  indicate  the  potential  for  further  zones  of  uranium 
mineralization  within  the  vicinity  of  the  known  mineral  deposit.  Additionally,  the  drill  program  intercepted  fault 
structures  and  hematite  alteration  zones  in  the  basement  rocks  underlying  the  target  area,  indicating  the  potential  for 
basement hosted uranium mineralization.  
 
During January, 2010, the Company completed 2,814 metres of drilling. In September 2009, CanAlaska reported assay 
results from its August 2009 drill program at Fond Du Lac which included the results from hole FDL017. Hole FDL017 
returned 40.4 metres averaging 0.32% U3O8, including 6 metres averaging 1.13% U3O8 with individual values of half-
metre samples grading up to 3.77% U3O8. For a complete understanding of the assays results from this drill program, 
reference  should  be  made  to  the  Company’s  press  release  of  September  22,  2009.  It  also  undertook  surface  trench 
sampling and mapping on the western portion of the Fond Du Lac project where significant surface, and near surface 
uranium  mineralization,  was  discovered.  For  a  full  understanding  of  the  results,  reference  should  be  made  to  the 
Company’s press release of September 16, 2009.  
 
In fiscal 2010, drilling comprised 30% and geology comprised 20% of the exploration expenditures at Fond Du Lac. The 
decrease in camp costs and operations for fiscal 2010 is consistent with the drill program that was being conducted at 
that time. The second half of the year was focused on interpretation of the drilling data. 
 
5. 
 
In December 2006, the Company acquired from the Black Lake Denesuline First Nation an option to earn a 49% interest 
in  the  project.  To  earn  its  interest  the  Company  must  make  payments  totaling  $130,000  ($101,628  paid;  July  2011: 
$28,372),  issue  300,000  shares  (200,000  issued;  July  2010:  50,000  shares;  July  2011:  50,000  shares),  and  incur 
exploration  expenditures  of  $2  million  ($1.0  million  incurred;  July  2010:  $0.7  million;  July  2011:  $1.2  million;  July 
2012: $2.0 million).

In Q110, the Company completed its 1,923 metre drill program, which comprised 649 metres in Q409 and 1,272 metres 
in Q110.  In August 2009, the results of Q409 drill campaign at Black Lake were announced with elevated uranium 
values  of  12  parts  per  million  (“ppm”)  being  intersected  in  the  north  and  the  eastern-most  drill  hole  in  the  south 
intersecting 140 ppm of uranium. For full results of the winter-spring drill program, reference should be made to the 
Company’s press release of August 5, 2009. 
 
In Q110, the Company paid $51,628 to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada on behalf of the Black Lake Denesuline First 
Nations.  These  payments  will  be  offset  against  future  options  payments.  During  the  remainder  of  fiscal  2010,  only 
limited activity was undertaken on the project as the Company was interpreting the drilling data. 
 
In  fiscal  2010,  drilling  costs  comprised  44%  of  the  total  exploration  costs  at  Black  Lake  from  the  1,272  metre  drill 
program completed in the first quarter.

Collins Bay Extension Project – Optioned from Bayswater Uranium
6. 
 
In  July  2009,  the  Company  executed  an  option  agreement  with  Bayswater  Uranium  Corporation  to  commence 
exploration  on  the  Collins  Bay  Extension  uranium  project  (“CBX”),  which  is  directly  adjacent  to,  and  following  the 
North-East  strike  of  the  past-producing  uranium  mines  at  Rabbit  Lake  and  Collins  Bay,  and  the  current  producing 
uranium  mine  at  Eagle  Point  in  Saskatchewan.  CBX  contains  a  significant  number  of  exploration  targets  within  the 
Snowbird and Fife Island areas. Under the terms of the option agreement, CanAlaska shall act as the exploration operator 
and  may  earn  a  51%  participating  interest  in  the  project  by  undertaking  a  minimum  of  $4.0  million  in  exploration 
expenditures within 5 years, and issuing a total of 500,000 (100,000 issued) shares to Bayswater over the same period. 
The Company may increase its participating interest to a 70% level by successfully undertaking a further $2.0 million in 
exploration expenditures over a further period of 3 years.

In Q110, the $8,000 option payment cost represents the fair value of the 50,000 CanAlaska shares issued to Bayswater. 
 
In September 2009, field crews mapped and sampled mineralization in the Fife Island area north of the Eagle Point mine, 
and along the same geological trend in preparation for the winter drill program. 
 
In  Q410,  CanAlaska  carried  out  a  two  drill  program  on  the  property.  One  program  concentrated  on  the  vein 
mineralization on the northern part of Fife Island. This drilling intersected uranium mineralization in four drill holes. The 
second  program  southwest  of  Blue  Island  was  identified  from  the  VTEM  airborne  geophysical  survey  completed  in 
2007.  In house inversion of the data defined two large zones (700 metres by 500 metres) of very high conductivity in 
basement  rocks,  located  below  conductive  lake  sediments,  and  straddling  an  east-west  magnetic  structural  trend.  
Detailed gravity surveys across the target in January 2010 have confirmed a large gravity low associated with each of the 
deeper conductive zones.  The drill program provided evidence of a large geological event with uranium, breccias and 
structured displacement. 
 
In fiscal 2010, drilling costs comprised 31% of the total exploration costs at Collins Bay Extension from the 1,133 metre 
drill program completed in the fourth quarter. 
 
7. 
 
The Grease River project covers approximately 70,000 hectares in three separate claim blocks that extend from Bulyea 
River, north of Fond Du Lac, to Marytnuik Lake, north of Stony Rapids, and covers four geological domains. 
 
On April 10, 2007, the Company granted an option to Yellowcake plc, and subsequently consented to the introduction of 
Uranium Prospects plc to earn a 60% interest in the project. Uranium Prospects plc could have exercised its option to 
earn  a  60%  interest  in  the  project  by  making  payments,  issuing  shares,  and  making  exploration  expenditures  of  $5 
million. This option was terminated in June 2009.

In Q109, the Company undertook detailed prospecting and mapping on the Grease River property. The Company had 
recorded accruals for the reimbursement of costs from Uranium Prospects. This receivable was reversed and written-off 
in Q409, as no cash had been received. The option was subsequently terminated in June 2009. Only minimal activity 
occurred on the property during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2010. 
 
In  August  2010,  the  Company  executed  an  option  agreement  with  Westcan  Uranium  Ltd.  (“Westcan”)  (formerly 
International  Arimex  Resources  Inc.)  to  commence  exploration  of  the  Grease  River  project.  Under  the  terms  of  the 
option agreement, Westcan may earn a 50% interest in the property by issuing up to 5% of the issued and outstanding 
shares of Westcan and making exploration expenditures of $4,500,000 by December 2013.  The Company will act as the 
operator for the exploration project and will earn a management fee of 10% of the exploration expenditures incurred. 
 
8. 
 
The  Cree  West  project  comprises  a  100%  interest  in  4  mineral  claims  (approximately  13,000  hectares)  located  70 
kilometres northwest of the Key Lake uranium mine and between 25 and 57 kilometres north of the south rim of the 
Athabasca Basin. On April 24, 2006, the Company granted to Westcan an option to earn up to a 75% interest in the Cree 
West project. Westcan can earn a 50% interest in the property by making cash payments of $150,000 (received), issuing 
600,000  shares  (received)  and  making  $3.6  million  of  exploration  expenditures.  Westcan  may  elect  to  acquire  an 
additional 10% interest by expending an additional $4 million on exploration within 2 years of vesting its 50% interest. 
Westcan may elect to acquire a further 15% ownership, for a total of 75%, by completing a feasibility study within 2 
years,  issuing  to  the  Company  400,000  additional  common  shares,  and  expending  a  minimum  of  $1  million  on  the 
project. 
 
The Company will act as the operator of the project until Westcan has a vested 60% interest. Upon attaining commercial 
production, the Company will receive a 3% net smelter royalty. As of April 30, 2010, Westcan had contributed $0.8 
million  towards  exploration  expenditures.  The  Company  has  granted  an  extension  to  Westcan  in  respect  of  its 
exploration commitments under the agreement and expects Westcan to continue the exploration of the project in 2010.

An airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey was carried out in 2006, and ground AMT surveys were carried out in 
early winter 2007 and 2008. Drill testing has been recommended to determine the cause of the anomalous geophysical 
targets.

The  Key  Lake  project  comprises  four  mineral  claims  in  three  separate  blocks  totaling  approximately  6,000  hectares 
located  within  15  kilometres  of  the  formerly  producing  Key  Lake  uranium  mine.  On  March  2,  2006,  the  Company 
optioned to Westcan up to a 75% interest in the Key Lake project. Westcan may, at its option, earn a 50% interest in the 
property by making cash payments of $150,000 (received), issuing 300,000 shares (received), and making exploration 
expenditures  of  $2  million.  Westcan  may  elect  to  acquire  an  additional  10%  interest  by  expending  an  additional  $2 
million on exploration, and may elect to acquire a further 15% ownership, for a total of 75%, by completing a feasibility 
study within 2 years, issuing to the Company 200,000 additional common shares, and expending a minimum of $500,000 
per year on the Project. The Company will act as the operator of the project until Westcan has a vested 60 % interest. 
Upon commercial production, the Company will receive a 3% net smelter royalty. As of April 30, 2010, Westcan had 
contributed $ 0.9 million towards exploration expenditures. The Company granted an extension to Westcan in respect of 
its exploration commitments under the agreement and expects Westcan to continue exploration of the project in 2010.

In winter 2007, three holes costing $150,868 were drilled on a conductor on one claim, providing one intersection of 
minor uranium mineralization (0.058% U3O8 over 1 metre), but with strong alteration and faulting. In winter 2008, an 
additional target was drill-tested on another claim, returning highly-anomalous rare earths mineralization.  
 
10. 
 
The Helmer Project comprises a contiguous block of 19 mineral claims totaling approximately 57,000 hectares in the 
central part of the north rim of the Athabasca Basin west and south of Fond Du Lac, and 50 kilometres southeast of 
Uranium City. 
 
In Q410, the Company drill tested a group of targets along the Grease River fault, which were modeled from airborne 
EM and gravity surveys. The target area is just south of CanAlaska’s Fond Du Lac project, and is located on the eastern 
part of the Helmer project.  Previous airborne surveys provided strong evidence of conductive targets in the lower levels 
of  the  Athabasca  sandstone,  immediately  above  a  strong  zone  of  dislocation  in  the  Grease  River  fault  system.    The 
drilling was completed in March 2010, and the Company is reviewing results and interpreting the drill data. 
 
In fiscal 2010, drilling costs comprised 29% and camp cost & operations comprised 32% of the total exploration costs at 
Helmer.

The Lake Athabasca project comprises 13 contiguous mineral claims totaling approximately 41,000 hectares, chiefly on 
Lake Athabasca, southwest of Uranium City and the former producing Gunnar Uranium Mine. About 8% of the property 
area is comprised of islands located south of the Crackingstone Peninsula.

Drilling began in winter 2007. These holes confirmed the existence of uranium mineralizing events over a considerable 
area of the unconformity in this area and at Grouse Island, 3.5 kilometres to the south-east. In early winter 2008, the 
Company  completed  five  more  drill  holes  at  three  new  targets  near  Johnston  Island.  Two  holes  targeted  uranium 
mineralization in basement intrusive rocks. Holes near Johnston Island focused on known mineralized zones. The third 
target south of Johnston Island defined a very prominent geophysical target that has now been shown as related to a large 
local uplift in the unconformity. Additional drilling is currently being considered. 
 
12. 
 
NE Wollaston comprises mineral claims of approximately 144,000 hectares which straddle the Saskatchewan-Manitoba 
border  and  lie  between  90  and  170  kilometres  northeast  along  the  Wollaston  trend  of  basement  formations  hosting 
uranium  deposits,  which  include  Rabbit  Lake,  Collins  Bay  and  Eagle  Point  Uranium  Mines.  The  geological  targets 
across  the  NE  Wollaston  project  match  the  styles  of  mineralization  reported  from  basement-hosted  mineral  deposits 
further south in the Athabasca Basin. There is clear observation of late replacement pitchblende mineralization in vein 
zones, fractures, and as disseminations in host rocks. There is also evidence of more-disseminated mineralization across 
stratigraphic  horizons,  and  multitudes  of  pegmatitic  intrusive  events,  many  of  them  containing  primary  uranium 
mineralization, or with brecciation and later uranium mineralization. 
 
In  2004,  CanAlaska  acquired  the  mineral  leases  in  the  area  and  began  systematic  prospecting  and  lake  sediment 
sampling. With encouraging results, this continued in 2006 with airborne surveys, systematic prospecting, geochemical 
and  geophysical  surveys.  The  highlight  was  the  discovery  of  extensive  uranium-mineralized  belts,  either  within,  or 
cutting across all rock types in the area. The Company aborted drill testing of initial targets in early 2007 due to drill 
contractor difficulties. However, further detailed work was carried out in the summer of 2007 on each of the current 
targets as well as on additional preliminary targets for a total cost of $1.6 million. In early 2008, the Company released 
details of 1,620 higher-grade uranium samples, taken from 47 separate zones with extensive boulder dispersion trains 
and surface uranium mineralization.

Further exploration on the project awaited the conclusion of land use consultations between the Province of Manitoba 
and local First Nations communities and on March 13, 2010, the Manitoba Government issued exploration permits for 
ground work and drilling on the property. Community consultation is ongoing. 
 
13. 
 
The  McTavish  project  covers  16,000  hectares.  The  claims are  centered  approximately  50  kilometres  southeast  of  the 
McArthur  River  mine  and  40  kilometres  northwest  of  the  Key  Lake  mine,  with  the  southeastern  claim  located 
approximately 10 kilometres due west of Cameco Corp.’s Millennium uranium deposit. Work-to-date includes summer 
2006 ground-based sampling/lake sediment analysis, and a Geotech VTEM airborne survey. The claims covering the 
main VTEM conductive targets were re-staked in 2007.

In August 2009, the Company announced that it had entered into an option agreement with Kodiak Exploration Limited 
("Kodiak") on the McTavish project. Kodiak has been granted an option to acquire up to a 70% interest in the project. In 
order  to  earn  an  initial  50%  interest,  Kodiak  must  complete  $4.0  million  in  exploration  and  issue  1,000,000  Kodiak 
shares to CanAlaska (100,000 issued) as follows: 100,000 on or before the date of acceptance of the transaction by the 
TSX Venture Exchange and then, on or before each anniversary date thereafter, make annual work expenditures and 
issue shares respectively of: first year – $0.6 million and 50,000 shares; second year – $0.8 million and 50,000 shares; 
third year – $1.2 million and 50,000 shares; fourth year – $1.4 million and 50,000 shares, and; fifth year – $nil and the 
remaining balance of 700,000 shares. 
 
Kodiak  may  earn  a  further  10%  interest  in  the  project  (60%  total),  by:  (1)  expending  a  further  $3  million,  over  an 
additional three year period; (2) issuing an additional 550,000 Kodiak shares, and; (3) producing a 43-101 compliant 
resource estimate containing at least 35 million pounds of U3O8 in the measured and indicated categories. By defining a 
resource of 50 million pounds or more of U3O8 during the same period, Kodiak's interest may increase to 70%.  
 
Kodiak carried out ZTEM airborne geophysical surveys across the property in September 2009 and carried out a drill 
program consisting of two holes in March and April 2010. 
 
The negative option payment amount of $67,000 in Q210 represents the fair value of the 100,000 Kodiak common shares 
received as part of our option agreement.

Carswell is comprised of approximately 29,000 hectares of mineral claims in the vicinity of Cluff Lake, Saskatchewan.  
In December 2009, the Company issued 1,250,000 shares and made a $62,500 cash payment under a purchase agreement 
with  Hawk  Uranium  Inc.  to  acquire  mineral  claims  in  the  Cluff  Lake  area  adjacent  to  its  Carswell  property.  Hawk 
Uranium Inc. will retain a 2.5% Net Smelter Return (“NSR”), 2% of which will be purchasable by the Company for 
payment of $2.0 million. The Company is currently completing a comprehensive project report. 
 
The option payment amount of $200,000 in Q310 represents the fair value of the 1,250,000 CanAlaska common shares 
issued to Hawk Uranium Inc. as part of our option agreement.

ITEM 5.  OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 
 
A. 
 
This discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the 
fiscal year ended April 30, 2010 attached as Appendix (A) and the Management Discussion and Analysis for the same 
period attached as Appendix (B). 
 
Critical Accounting Policies 
 
The Company’s significant accounting policies are set out in Note 3 of the audited consolidated financial statements for 
the year ended April 30, 2010.   
 
Financial assets and liabilities 
 
Financial  assets  and  liabilities  are  initially  recognized  at  fair  value  and  are  subsequently  measured  based  on  their 
classification as held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, available-for-sale or held-for-trading. The classification is not 
changed subsequent to initial recognition.  
 
Held-for-trading 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities that are purchased and incurred with the intention of generating profits in the 
year term are classified as held-for-trading. These instruments are measured at fair value with the change in the fair value 
recognized in income.  
 
Available-for-sale securities  
 
Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on 
available-for-sale securities are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income.
Mineral properties and deferred exploration expenditures
The Company is in the process of exploring its mineral properties and has not yet determined whether these properties 
contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable. 
 
Mineral  exploration  and  development  costs  are  capitalized  on  an  individual  prospect  basis  until  such  time  as  an 
economic  ore  body  is  defined  or  the  prospect  is  determined  by  management  to  be  impaired  or  abandoned.  Amounts 
received for the sale of resource properties, for option payments for exploration advances and for recovery of mineral 
property expenditures are treated as reductions of the cost of the property and payments in excess of capitalized costs are 
recognized in income. 
 
The  recoverability  of  the  amounts  capitalized  for  the  undeveloped  mineral  properties  is  dependent  upon  the 
determination  of  economically  recoverable  ore  reserves,  confirmation  of  the  Company's  interest  in  the  underlying 
mineral  claims,  the  ability  to  obtain  the  necessary  financing  to  complete  their  development,  and  future  profitable 
production or proceeds from the disposition thereof. 
 
Management  of  the  Company  regularly  reviews  the  net  carrying  value  of  each  mineral  property.  Where  events  or 
changes in circumstances suggest impairment, estimated future cash flows are calculated using estimated future prices, 
proven and probable reserves, value beyond proven and probable reserves, probability weighted outcomes and operating 
capital and reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis. If it is determined that the future cash flows are less than the 
carrying  value,  a  write-down  to  the  estimated  fair  value  is  expensed  for  the  period.  The  Company  presently  has  no 
proven  or  probable  reserves.  Where  estimates  of  future  net  cash  flows  are  not  available  and  where  other  conditions 
suggest impairment, management assesses if carrying values can be recovered. If the carrying values exceed estimated 
recoverable values, then the project is written-down to estimated fair values with the write-down expensed in the period. 
 
Management’s estimates of future  mineral prices, recoverable resources, initial and operating capital and reclamation 
costs are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may affect the recoverability of mineral property costs. Although 
management has made its best estimate of these factors, it is possible that changes could occur that could adversely affect 
management’s estimate of the net cash flows to be generated from its properties.
26
Title to mineral properties involves inherent risks due to the difficulties of determining the validity of certain claims as 
well  as  the  potential  for problems  arising from  the  frequently  unreliable  conveyancing history  characteristic  of  many 
mineral properties. The Company has investigated title to all of its mineral properties and, to the best of its knowledge, 
all of its properties are in good standing. 
 
Mineral exploration tax credits (“METC”) 
 
The Company recognizes METC amounts when the Company’s METC application is approved by the relevant taxation 
authorities or when the amount to be received can be reasonably estimated and collection is reasonably assured.  
 
Asset retirement obligations 
 
The Company  recognizes the  legal liability for obligations relating to retirement of property, plant, and equipment, and 
arising from the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of those assets. Such asset retirement cost are 
recognized at fair value, when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be estimated, in the period in which it is incurred, 
added to the carrying value of the related asset, and amortized into income on a systematic basis over the related assets 
useful life. The liability is adjusted for changes in the expected amounts and timing of cash flows required to discharge the 
liability and accreted to full value over time through periodic charges to earnings. 
 
There are no asset retirement obligations as at April 30, 2010 and 2009. 
 
Income taxes 
 
The  Company  uses  the  asset  and  liability  method  of  accounting  for  future  income  taxes.  Under  this  method,  future 
income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax and accounting bases of assets 
and  liabilities  as  well  as  for  the  benefit  of  losses  available  to  be  carried  forward  to  future  years  at  the  substantively 
enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to be reversed.  The amount 
of future tax assets recognized is limited to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
 
Stock-based compensation 
 
All  stock-based  awards  made  to  employees  and  non-employees  are  measured  and  recognized  using  a  fair  value  based 
method. For employees, the fair value of the options is measured at the date of the grant. For non-employees, the fair value 
of the options is measured on the earlier of the date at which the counterparty performance is complete or the date the 
performance commitment is reached or the date at which the equity instruments are granted if they are fully vested and non-
forfeitable.  For  employees  and  non-employees,  the  fair  value  of  options  is  accrued  and  charged  to  operations,  with  the 
offsetting credit to contributed surplus, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. If and when the stock options are 
ultimately exercised, the applicable amounts of contributed surplus are transferred to share capital. 
 
Flow-through shares 
 
Canadian Income Tax Legislation permits an enterprise to issue securities referred to as flow-through shares, whereby 
the  investor  can  claim  the  tax  deductions  arising  from  the  renunciation  of  the  related  resource  expenditures.  Under 
Canadian GAAP, when resource expenditures are renounced to the investors and the Company has reasonable assurance 
that the expenditures will be completed, future income tax liabilities are recognized with a corresponding reduction in 
share capital. 
 
If a Company has sufficient unused tax losses and deductions (“losses”) to offset all or part of the future income tax 
liabilities  and  no  future  income  tax  assets  have  been  previously  recognized  on  such  losses,  a  portion  of  such 
unrecognized losses (losses multiplied by the effective corporate tax rate) is recorded as income up to the amount of the 
future income tax liability that was previously recognized on the renounced expenditures. 
 
The Company follows the recommendations of the Emerging Issues Committee (“EIC”) of the CICA with respect to 
flow-through shares, as outlined in EIC-146.  The application of EIC-146 requires the recognition of the foregone tax 
benefit on the date the Company renounces the tax credits associated with exploration expenditures, provided there is 
reasonable assurance that the expenditures will be made.
27
Recently Adopted Standards 
 
Section 3064 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 
Effective  May  1,  2009,  the  Company  adopted  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants’  (“CICA”)  new 
Handbook Section 3064 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”. This Section replaced Section 3062 “Goodwill and Intangible 
Assets”  and  Section  3450  “Research  and  Development  Costs”,  and  establishes  revised  standards  for  the  recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of goodwill and intangible assets. On adoption of this new Standard, EIC 27 
“Revenues and Expenditures during the Pre-operating Period” was withdrawn, and so various pre-production and start-
up  costs  are  required  to  be  expensed  as  incurred.  No  material  adjustments  were  required  upon  adoption  of  this  new 
Standard. 
 
EIC – 173 – Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
 
In January 2009, the CICA issued Emerging Issues Committee (“EIC”) Abstract 173 – Credit Risk and the Fair Value of 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“EIC-173”). EIC-173 provides guidance on how to take into account credit 
risk of an entity and counterparty when determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including 
derivative instruments.  EIC-173 is applicable for the Company’s interim and annual consolidated financial statements 
for  its  fiscal  year  ending  April  30,  2010,  with  retroactive  application.    The  adoption  of  EIC-173  did  not  result  in  a 
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
 
EIC – 174 - Mining Exploration Costs 
 
On March 27, 2009, the Emerging Issues Committee issued EIC-174 “Mining Exploration Costs”. The EIC provides 
additional guidance in light of the potential adverse impact of the current economic and financial turmoil on the carrying 
value of the deferred exploration costs. The EIC is effective for financial statements issued on or after the date of the 
date of the EIC. This EIC did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements as it had previously 
recognized a significant impairment charge with respect to its exploration projects in the prior financial statements. 
 
Section 3862 - Financial Instruments - Disclosures 
 
In  June  2009,  the  CICA  amended  Section  3862,  Financial  Instruments  -  Disclosures  (“Section  3862”),  to  include 
additional disclosure requirements about fair value measurement for financial instruments and liquidity risk disclosures. 
These  amendments  require  a  three-level  hierarchy  that  reflects  the  significance  of  the  inputs  used  in  making  the  fair 
value  measurements.  The  amendments  to  Section  3862  apply  for  annual  financial  statements  relating  to  fiscal  years 
ended after September 30, 2009. The three levels of fair value hierarchy under Section 3862 are:
o  Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
o  Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly; 
o  Level 3 - Inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data.
and
The disclosures required as a result of adopting the new section are presented in note 20 of the Audited Consolidated 
Financial Statements dated April 30, 2010. 
 
Future Accounting Changes 
 
Section 1582 – Business Combinations, Section 1601 – Consolidated Financial Statements and Section 1602 – Non-
Controlling Interests 
 
In  January  2009,  the  CICA  issued  new  accounting  standards,  Handbook  Section  1582  “Business  Combinations”, 
Handbook Section 1602 “Non-Controlling Interests”, and Handbook Section 1601 “Consolidated Financial Statements”, 
which are based on the International Accounting Standards Board’s (“IASB”) International Financial Reporting Standard 
3,  “Business  Combinations”.  The  new  standards  replace  the  existing  guidance  on  business  combinations  and 
consolidated financial statements. The objective of the new standards is to harmonize Canadian accounting for business 
combinations with the international and U.S. accounting standards. The new standards are to be applied prospectively to 
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period 
beginning on or after January 1, 2011, with earlier application permitted. Assets and liabilities that arose from business 
combinations  whose  acquisition  dates  preceded  the  application  of  the  new  standards  shall  not  be  adjusted  upon 
application  of  these  new  standards.  Section  1602  should  be  applied  retrospectively  except  for  certain  items.  The
28
Company has not adopted these new standards but continues to evaluate the attributes and effect of early adoption of 
these standards if a business combination were to occur.
Section 3855 – Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement 
 
On  April  29,  2009,  the  CICA  amended  Section  3855,  “Financial  Instruments  –  Recognition  and  Measurement”, 
adding/amending  paragraphs  regarding  the  application  of  effective  interest  method  to  previously  impaired  financial 
assets  and  embedded  prepayment  options.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  interim  and  annual  financial  statements 
relating to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011 with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not 
expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. 
 
IFRS Convergence 
 
In February 2008, the CICA announced that GAAP for publicly accountable enterprises is to be replaced by International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. Companies are required 
to provide IFRS comparative information for the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, the conversion from GAAP to IFRS 
is  to  be  applicable  to  the  Company’s  reporting  for  the  first  quarter  of  its  2012  year  end  for  which  the  current  and 
comparative information will be prepared under IFRS. The Company is required to apply all of those IFRS standards 
which are effective for fiscal year ending April 30, 2012 and apply them to its opening May 1, 2010 balance sheet.  The 
Company intends to file its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as permitted for Foreign Private 
Issuers with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2012.

Narrative Discussion - Results of Operations  
 
As the Company is in a loss position the basic loss per share and diluted loss per share are equivalent. 
 
Net indirect exploration expenses are the costs associated with running CanAlaska’s field operation office in Saskatoon, 
Saskatchewan (“SK”), Canada and our warehouse in La Ronge, SK and payroll and related cost of our exploration teams 
where they are not directly chargeable to an exploration project. Net indirect exploration expenses were $320,000 (2009: 
$1,017,000; 2008: $915,000). The decrease in net indirect exploration expenses in 2010 is a result of a reallocation of 
exploration costs which were directly allocated to specific projects.

Mineral property write-offs were $349,000 (2009: $494,000; 2008: $550,000).  In 2010, the Company recorded property 
write-downs  on  two  of  its  projects  (Ford  Lake  and  Camsell)  where  it  chose  not  to  renew  its  permits.  In  2009,  the 
Company recorded property write-downs on two of its New Zealand projects where it withdrew its license application 
prior to fiscal year end. Subsequent to fiscal year end, the Company also did not renew its license on the Puhi Puhi (Mt 
Mitchell) property and recorded a further write-down of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
 
Included in mineral property write-offs for 2008 were $399,000 associated with the Rise and Shine Joint Venture and 
$90,000 associated with an impairment charge on the Company’s Alaska property.  
 
Camp and other miscellaneous exploration equipment owned by the Company is maintained at our La Ronge warehouse. 
Equipment rental income is comprised of income (cost recapture) from charging exploration projects for the rental of this 
equipment. Equipment rental income was $267,000 (2009: $316,000; 2008: $429,000). The equipment rental income in 
2010 is consistent with the winter drilling program. The slight decrease in equipment rental income in 2009 is consistent 
with the decrease in exploration activity year on year.  In 2009, the Company had spent over $11.6 million in exploration 
compared with $21.7 million in the previous year.  Prior to 2008, the Company was not separately recovering its indirect 
costs through equipment rental as all the indirect expenditure was being allocated to the projects and deferred on the 
balance sheet.  
 
Net  option  payments  represent  payments  generated  from  properties  in  excess  of  the  cost  of  those  properties,  these 
payments may include either cash or the fair value of shares received from the Company’s that optioned our properties. 
In 2010, net options payments were $75,000 (2009: income $187,000; 2008: income $137,000), these amounts will vary 
annually depending on what projects the Company currently has optioned and their cost base.  Net option payments in 
2010 is an expense as a result of the Company writing-off the option payments from District Gold on the Rainbow Hill 
property in Alaska, USA. The Company had previously accrued for these receivables. In 2009, $101,000 was recorded in 
respect of the Rainbow Hill property in Alaska (that had previously been written-off), the 2008 amount was received in 
respect of the Key Lake property. 
 
Consulting, labour and professional fees were $1,438,000 (2009: $1,049,000; 2008: $1,474,000) Consulting, labour, and 
professional fees were higher in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily attributed to increases 
in salaried expenses, consulting service and audit related fees. The decrease in fees from 2008 to 2009 can be attributed 
to legal costs incurred in 2008 in excess of $260,000 due in part from the legal costs associated with the completion of 
the legal agreement between the Korean Consortium and the Company with regards to Cree East project. 
 
Depreciation & amortization was $211,000 (2009: $232,000; 2008: $188,000) which is consistent with the increase in 
the property and equipment over the same period. 
 
Foreign exchange gain was $16,000 (2009: loss $193,000; 2008: loss $28,000). The primary reason why it was a gain 
was due to the stronger Canadian dollar. 
 
Insurance, licenses & filing fees was $103,000 (2009: $61,000; 2008: $212,000). Insurance, licenses & filing fees were 
higher in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.  The increase was due to the increase in filing fees. 
 
Interest  income  was  $88,000  (2009:  $167,000;  2008:  $280,000).  The  decrease  in  2010  compared  to  2009  can  be 
attributed to lower average cash balances and lower average interest rates. 
 
Other corporate cost was $236,000 (2009:$218,000; 2008: $180,000).  The other corporate cost was up in 2010 primarily 
as a result of a $54,000 provision for doubtful accounts in Q210. The remaining difference is consistent with prior period 
results. 
 
Investor relations & presentation costs were $90,000 (2009: $60,000; 2008: $343,000).  The increase was due to greater 
spending in advertisement.  For 2009, the decrease was a result of a conscious decision to reduce activities over the past 
eighteen months due to the economic environment.  Included within the 2008 comparative, was the cost of producing a 
corporate video. 
 
Rent costs were up in 2010 was $167,000 2009 ($200,000; 2008:$95,000). There was a slight decrease in 2010.  The 
increase in 2009 was a result of transferring the Glitter Lake property and its associated costs, to exit an existing office 
sub-lease agreement and also the establishment of an office in downtown Vancouver in 2008.
31
Stock-based  compensation  was  $1,052,000  (2009:  $1,509,000;  2008:  $1,095,000).   The  large  increase  in  stock-based 
compensation  in  2009  is  consistent  with  the  increase  in  the  total  number  of  options  outstanding  each  year  as  the 
Company fair values, these options using the Black-Scholes methodology, and expenses them over the vesting period of 
the options. 
 
Travel and accommodation was $85,000 (2009: $80,000; 2008: $212,000). Compared with 2009, there was only a slight 
increase in 2010. 
 
Impairment and loss on disposal of available-for-sale securities were $89,000 (2009: $394,000 ; 2008: gain $149,000). In 
2009,  the  economic  downturn  a  number  of  the  Company’s  available-for-sale  securities  experienced  significant  price 
deterioration and the Company viewed these decreases as other than temporary and recorded write-downs of $394,000. 
The gain in 2008 resulted from the sales of approximately $175,000 of various available-for-sale securities. 
 
Management fees stem from operator fees that are charged on projects that have been optioned to various third parties 
including the Cree East and West McArthur properties.  Management fees decreased in 2010 $439,000 (2009: $628,000; 
2008: $895,000) which is consistent with a reduction in exploration expenses year over year particularly the reduced 
level of spending on the West McArthur project. 
 
Future  income  tax  recovery  of  $461,000  (2009:  $268,000;  2008:  $298,000).  The  increase  in  2010  was  due  to  the 
recovery of non-capital losses of the renouncement of flow-through shares. 
 
Unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities was $1,000 (2009: loss $157,000; 2008: loss $360,000) was due to mark 
to market evaluations of available-for-sale securities.  These amounts will vary each year based on the carrying value of 
the underlying investments. 
 
B. 
 
As of April 30, 2010 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $8.7 million (April 30, 2009: $6.3 million). The 
Company’s working capital position as at April 30, 2010 was $8.5 million (April 30, 2009: $6.4 million). 
 
The  Company  has  entered  into  joint  venture  agreements  with  the  Korean  Consortium  and  Mitsubishi  and  they  are 
currently fully or partially funding exploration on two of its properties located in Athabasca. As of April 30, 2010, the 
Korean Consortium has funded $12.6 million out of a total commitment of $19 million and in February 2010, Mitsubishi 
completed $11.0 million of funding, and CanAlaska and Mitsubishi entered into a 50/50 joint venture. Subsequent to the 
formation of the joint venture, Mitsubishi has provided funding of $1.6 million for the West McArthur project. 
 
With the impact of the global credit crisis still being felt in the junior mining sector, CanAlaska views itself as fortunate 
to  have  strong  strategic  relationships  with  its  partners.  The  long-term  and  strategic  support  from  Mitsubishi  and  our 
Korean  Consortium  partners  allows  the  Company  to  continue  to  advance  two  significant  projects  forward  in  these 
challenging economic times. CanAlaska has also been conscious to maintain a reasonable treasury and is continually 
evaluating all of its projects.  
 
From August to December 2009, the Company closed four non-brokered flow-through private placements and one non-
brokered private placement for gross proceeds of $6.2 million. The Company believes that with the completion of these 
private  placements,  its  current  treasury,  and  the  support  of  its  strategic  partners  that  it  can  continue  to  maintain 
operations  over  the  next  twelve  months  and  work  towards  its  strategic  goal  of  discovering  one  or  more  high  grade 
uranium deposits. 
 
The  Company  however  remains  in  nature  an  exploration  enterprise  and  will,  at  some  point,  need  to  seek  additional 
financings either through equity offerings or the formation of additional strategic partnerships.

During the fourth quarter (April 2010), the Company recorded a permanent impairment on a number of its investments 
and wrote the balances down to their markets values due to the significant decline in market value that was viewed as 
other than a temporary impairment. 
 
The increase in accounts payable can be attributed to the drill program and geophysics program that was undertaken in 
the fourth quarter that remained unpaid at April 30, 2010.

The Annual Report includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and 
Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").  Any statements that express 
or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or 
future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as "expects" or "does not expect", "is 
expected", "anticipates" or "does not anticipate", "plans", "estimates" or "intends", or stating that certain actions, events 
or results "may", "could", "would", "might" or "will" be taken, occur or be achieved) are not statements of historical fact 
and may be "forward looking statements".  Such statements are included, among other places in this Annual Report, in 
the  sections  entitled  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations”, 
"Description  of  Business"  and  "Description  of  Property".    Forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  expectations, 
estimates and projections at the time the statements are made that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which 
could  cause  actual  results  or  events  to  differ  materially from  those  presently  anticipated.    These  include,  but  are  not 
limited to, the risks of mining industry (for example, operational risks of exploring for, developing and producing crude 
oil and natural gas, risks and uncertainties involving geology of mineral deposits, the uncertainty of reserve estimates 
and estimates relating to production volumes, cost and expense projections, potential cost overruns and health, safety and 
environmental  risk),  risks  relating  to  the  Company's  properties  (for  example,  lack  of  operating  history  and 
transportation),  fluctuations  in  mineral  prices  and  exchange  rates  and  uncertainties  resulting  from  potential  delays  or 
changes  in  plans  with  respect  to  exploration  or  development  projects    capital  expenditures  (collectively  "Cautionary 
Statements").  Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are 
reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct.

Compensation Discussion & Analysis
During the financial year ended April 30, 2010, the Company had the following NEOs: Peter Dasler, President and CEO; 
Ram  Ramachandran,  CFO;  Damian  Towns,  former  CFO;  Joseph  Bowes,  former  CFO;  Emil  Fung,  Vice  President, 
Corporate Development; and Karl Schimann, Vice President, Exploration. 
 
 
 
Compensation of the NEOs of the Company is set by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) as recommended by 
the Company’s compensation committee (the “Compensation Committee”).  The Compensation Committee reviews, at least 
on  an  annual  basis,  the  cash  compensation,  performance  and  overall  compensation  package  for  each  NEO.    The 
Compensation  Committee  then  presents  its  findings  and  any  recommendations  to  the  Board  for  consideration  and,  if 
acceptable  to  the  Board,  approval.    The  Compensation  Committee  recognizes  the  need  to  provide  a  total  compensation 
package that will attract and retain qualified and experienced executives as well as align the compensation level of each of 
the NEOs. 
 
The Company’s executive compensation practices are intended to provide both current and long term rewards to its NEOs 
that are competitive within the compensation practices of the industry and consistent with their individual performance and 
contribution to the Company’s objectives.  Compensation components include base salary, bonus and long term incentives 
in the form of stock options. 
 
In  determining  the  appropriate  base  salary  of  an  executive  officer,  the  Compensation  Committee  considers  the 
responsibilities  of  the  individual,  comparable  salaries  in  the  industry,  the  experience  level  of  the  individual  and  overall 
performance.  Once the base salary has been established it will be reviewed by the Compensation Committee on an annual 
basis. For further details see “Termination and Change of Control Provisions” of this Information Circular.

Option Based Awards
The Company’s executive officers are also eligible for annual bonuses.  Bonuses are generally based on overall success in 
obtaining  the  financial  goals  and  exploration  objectives  of  the  Company  during  the  calendar  year  and  largely  upon  the 
Company’s cash position. 
 
 
 
The Company maintains a stock option plan to provide additional long-term incentives to the Company’s executive officers, 
as well as its directors, employees and consultants.  The Compensation Committee reviews the level of incentive options 
periodically and makes any new issuance recommendations to the Board for approval.  Previous grants of option-based 
awards are taken into account when considering new grants.

The Company subscribes to a Directors and Officers Liability Insurance to a limit of $5,000,000 per claim.  The policy 
insures the Company against any wrongful act committed by its Directors and Officers, including any actual or alleged

Board Practices

until the next Annual General Meeting or until their replacements are elected or appointed, subject to the provisions of 
the Company’s Articles.
Board of Directors
There  currently  are  no  service  contracts  in  place  for  the  Company’s  board  members,  providing  for  benefits  upon 
termination of employment, except as disclosed previously in Employment Agreements with the CEO, Vice President 
Corporate Development and Vice President Exploration as disclosed in Section B - Compensation, under Termination 
and Change of Control Benefits. 
 
 
 
Independence 
 
Section  1.4  of  National  Instrument  52-110  –  Audit  Committees  (“NI  52-110”)  sets  out  the  standard  for  director 
independence.  Under NI 52-110, a director is independent if he or she has no direct or indirect material relationship with 
the Company.  A material relationship is a relationship which could, in the view of the Board, be reasonably expected to 
interfere  with  the  exercise  of  a  director’s  independent  judgment.    NI  52-110  also  sets  out  certain  situations  where  a 
director will automatically be considered to have a material relationship to the Company. 
 
Applying the definition set out in section 1.4 of NI 52-110, four of the six members of the Board are independent.  The 
members who are independent are Hubert Marleau, Jean Luc Roy, Amb. Thomas Graham Jr. and Victor Fern.  Peter 
Dasler is not independent by virtue of the fact that he is an executive officer of the Company (President and CEO).  Emil 
Fung  is  not  independent  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  he  is  an  executive  officer  of  the  Company  (VP  Corporate 
Development). 
 
In order to facilitate its exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of the Board, the Board 
ensures that its independent Directors are in attendance at all Board meetings.

Board Mandate 
 
The Corporate Governance Committee has the responsibility to adopt and manage a written mandate which outlines and 
acknowledges the responsibly of its members.  The mandate discusses establishing a culture of integrity throughout the 
organization,  strategic  planning,  succession  planning,  the  handling  of  conflicts  of  interest  and  disclosure  policies.    A 
copy of the board mandate can be found at the company’s web site www.canalaska.com . 
   
Orientation and Continuing Education 
 
The Company has not adopted a formalized process of orientation for new Board members.  Orientation of new directors 
is conducted on an ad hoc basis.  The Board is notified of any material changes in reporting or regulations that may have 
an impact on their duties via e-mail from the CEO or Corporate Secretary. 
 
Directors are kept informed as to matters impacting, or which may impact, the Company’s operations through reports 
and presentations at the Board meetings.  Directors are also provided the opportunity to meet with senior management 
and other employees, advisors and directors, who can answer any questions that may arise. 
 
Nomination of Directors 
 
The Corporate Governance Committee acts informally as the nominations committee.  There currently is not a formal 
procedure with respect to the nomination of directors.  The nominees are generally the result of recruitment efforts by the

Approval of Consolidation of Shares
2010.    In  addition  to  the  regular  business  of  the  AGM,  the  shareholders  are  being  asked  to  consider  the  following 
proposed changes: 
 
1. 
 
The Board believes that, having regard to the large number of common shares of the Company outstanding, it is in the 
best interests of the Company and the shareholders to consolidate all of the issued and outstanding common shares on the 
basis of one new share for every ten existing shares, or such lower consolidation ratio as the directors may determine (the 
“Proposed  Consolidation”)  in  order  to  facilitate  any  future  financings.  As  of  the  Record  Date,  there  are  171,916,213 
common shares issued and outstanding and approximately 17,191,621 common shares will be issued and outstanding if 
and  when  the  Proposed  Consolidation  is  effected.    The  Proposed  Consolidation  is  subject  to  TSX  Venture  and 
shareholder approval. 
 
The Board proposes that the shareholders consider and approve a special resolution to authorize the Board to give effect 
to the Proposed Consolidation. If, as a result of the Proposed Consolidation, a shareholder would otherwise be entitled to 
a fraction of a common share in respect of the total aggregate number of pre-consolidation common shares held by such 
shareholder, no such fractional common share will be awarded and the aggregate number of common shares that such 
shareholder is entitled to will be rounded down to the next closest whole number of common shares if the fraction is less 
than half of a share, as provided by section 83 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “Act”). If the 
fraction is at least half of a share, it may be changed to one whole common share as provided for by section 83 of the 
Act. Except for any change resulting from the rounding described above, the change in the number of common shares 
outstanding that would result from the Proposed Consolidation will cause no change in the stated capital attributable to 
the common shares. The Proposed Consolidation will not materially affect the percentage of ownership in the Company 
by  the  shareholders  even  though  such  ownership  will  be  represented  by  a  smaller  number  of  common  shares.  The 
Proposed Consolidation will merely proportionately reduce the number of common shares held by the shareholders. The 
number  of  common  shares  issuable  upon  the  exercise  of  any  outstanding  convertible  securities  of  the  Company  (i.e. 
stock options or warrants) and the exercise price therefor, will also be adjusted proportionately to reflect the Proposed 
Consolidation. 
 
Assuming approval and implementation of the Proposed Consolidation, a letter of transmittal will be sent by mail to 
shareholders instructing them to surrender the certificates evidencing their common shares for replacement certificates 
representing  the  number  of  post-consolidation  common  shares  to  which  they  are  entitled  as  a  result  of  the  Proposed 
Consolidation. Shareholders will not have to pay a transfer or other fee in connection with the exchange of certificates. 
Shareholders  should  not  submit  certificates  for  exchange  until  requested  to  do  so.  Until  surrendered,  each  certificate 
formerly  representing  common  shares will  be deemed  for  all  purposes to  represent  the  number  of  common  shares  to 
which the holder thereof is entitled as a result of the Proposed Consolidation. 
 
Accordingly, shareholders of the Company will be asked at the Meeting to pass a special resolution in the following 
terms:
“RESOLVED as a special resolution that: 
 
1.  
subject to acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange, the issued and outstanding common shares of the 
Company be consolidated on the basis of ten old common shares for one new common share or such lower 
consolidation ratio as the directors may determine; 
 
2.  
documents and instruments as may be necessary or desirable to give effect to this special resolution; and 
 
3.  
notwithstanding the approval of the proposal to consolidate the issued and outstanding common shares 
of the Company, the directors of the Company be authorized without further approval of the shareholders to 
revoke the special resolution consolidating the issued and outstanding common shares before it is acted upon if 
the directors determine it would be in the best interests of the Company to do so.
any one director or officer of the Company is authorized to do all such things and execute all such
A special resolution requires the approval of at least two-thirds of the votes cast at the Meeting. It is the intention of the 
persons named in the accompanying Proxy, if not expressly directed to the contrary in such Proxy, to vote such proxies 
FOR the special resolution authorizing the Proposed Consolidation. 
 
The  Board  of  Directors  unanimously  recommends  that  shareholders  vote  in  favour  of  the  resolution  approving  the 
consolidation.

Repricing of Stock Options
2. 
 
Due  to  present  market  conditions,  and  in  order  to  bring  the  exercise  price  of  the  outstanding  stock  options  of  the 
Company in line with the current market price of the Company’s shares, the Board has approved, subject to acceptance 
by  the  TSX  Venture,  the  reduction  in  the  exercise  price  of  all  outstanding  stock  options  (the  “Options”)  previously 
granted to directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company, some of whom are insiders of the Company.  
As of the date hereof 20,772,500 options are outstanding under the Existing Plan.  The policies of the TSX Venture 
require the reduction in the price of options held by insiders to be approved by a majority of votes cast at a meeting of 
shareholders,  other  than  votes  attaching  to  shares  beneficially  owned  by  insiders  and  their  associates.    None  of  the 
holders of  the  Options  are  insiders  of  the Company  other  than  the  persons  listed  in  the  table  below  (the  “Insiders”), 
which persons hold the number of Options set forth opposite their respective names:

The  exercise price  of  all  the Options,  including  the Options  held  by Insiders, will  be reduced  to  $0.085, ($0.85  post 
consolidation) being the close of market price of the common shares of the Company on August 16, 2010, the date of 
this Information Circular.  Pursuant to the policies of the TSX Venture, the exercise price of any Options which were
granted within six months of the date of acceptance of the re-pricing of the Options by the TSX Venture will not be 
reduced.  The policies of the TSX Venture require that at least six months have elapsed since the date of grant of an 
option before it may be re-priced. 
 
Shareholders  of  the  Company,  with  the  Insiders  and  their  associates  abstaining  from  voting,  will  be  requested  at  the 
Meeting to pass an ordinary resolution in the following terms:
“RESOLVED, as an ordinary resolution of the disinterested shareholders, that: 
 
1. 
subject to acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange, the existing exercise price of all the outstanding 
unexercised  stock  options  of  the  Company  currently  issued  to  insiders  and  others  be  reduced  to  $0.085  the 
closing market price of the Company’s common shares on August 16, 2010; and  
 
2. 
any one director or officer of the Company is authorized and directed to do all such acts and things and 
to  execute  and  deliver  under  the  corporate  seal  or  otherwise  all  such  deeds,  documents,  instruments  and 
assurances  as  may  be  necessary  or  desirable  to  give  effect  to  the  foregoing  resolution  and  to  complete  all 
transactions in connection with the re-pricing of the stock options.
Approval of New Share Option Plan
The re-pricing of the Options will not be effective unless and until it has been approved by the disinterested shareholders 
of the Company at the Meeting and accepted for filing by the TSX Venture.   
 
3. 
 
The shareholders of the Company will be asked at the Meeting to approve the proposed new Share Option Plan (the 
“New Plan”). The New Plan increases the maximum aggregate number of common shares of the Company which may 
be reserved for issuance under the New Plan to 34,000,000 common shares, which represents approximately 20% of the 
current issued and outstanding common shares of the Company.  Implementation of the New Plan is subject to approval 
by the TSX Venture and the shareholders of the Company.  
 
As set forth under the heading “Existing Stock Option Plan”, the Company has in place the Existing Plan, the principal 
purpose  of  which  was  to  give  directors,  officers,  employees  and  consultants  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  the 
profitability and growth of the Company by granting to such individuals options, exercisable over periods of up to ten 
years as determined by the Board, to buy shares of the Company at a price not less than the closing market price of the 
Company’s shares on the day preceding the date of granting of the option. The Existing Plan provides for the reservation 
of a maximum of 27,500,000 common shares of the Company for the issuance of stock options. As of the date hereof, a 
total of 20,772,500 options are outstanding under the Existing Plan. 
 
The Board of Directors of the Company concluded that it would be in the Company’s best interests to adopt the New 
Plan and approved the New Plan on July 15, 2010. The New Plan was conditionally approved by the TSX Venture on 
July 21, 2010, and the Company is seeking shareholder approval of the New Plan at the Meeting.  The New Plan requires 
approval by ordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company before it may be implemented by the Company. 
 
The New Plan, if approved, will replace the Existing Plan and, except to the extent that the rights and entitlements of an 
optionee would be impaired, options previously governed by the Existing Plan will be governed by the New Plan.  The 
principal changes from the Existing Plan to the New Plan are that the New Plan:  
 
(a)
accommodates the rules and policies (the “Exchange Policies”) of both the TSX Venture and The Toronto Stock 
Exchange (“TSX”), depending upon which stock exchange the shares of the Company are listed for trading at 
the relevant time;
(b)
(c)
provides that the maximum aggregate number of common shares reserved for issuance under the New Plan and 
all other share compensation arrangements of the Company is 34,000,000 common shares, representing 
approximately 20% of the Company’s current issued and outstanding shares;
provides that if an option expires:
(i)
during a period (a “Blackout Period”) in which the Company has imposed restrictions on trades in its 
securities by its directors, officers or employees, the expiry date will be a date which is 10 business 
days after expiry of the Blackout Period; or
54
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
(h)
(ii)
immediately following a Blackout Period, the expiry date will be a date which is 10 business days after 
expiry of the Blackout Period less the number of business days between the date of expiry of the option 
and the date on which the Blackout Period ends;
The expiry dates for Blackout Periods are subject to the discretion of the board of directors;
provides for accelerated vesting of options on a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or a 
change of control of the Company;
provides that, to the extent the grant or exercise of an option gives rise to any tax or other statutory withholding 
obligations, prior to the delivery of an option or any common shares being acquired upon the exercise of an 
option, as the case may be, the Company may require an optionee to remit to the Company a cash payment, or 
may withhold from any remuneration or consideration payable to an optionee, an amount sufficient to pay any 
tax or other statutory withholding obligations associated with the grant or exercise of an option;
provides that the directors may amend the New Plan or any option without shareholder approval, subject to any 
necessary approvals required by securities regulators or the Exchange Policies, amend, suspend, terminate or 
discontinue the New Plan or the terms of any option granted under the New Plan, or revoke or alter any action 
taken in connection therewith, except that no general amendment or suspension of the New Plan will, without 
the  written  consent  of  all  optionees,  impair  the  rights  and  entitlements  of  any  optionee  pursuant  to  a  then-
outstanding  option  unless  such  amendment  is  the  result  of  a  change  in  the  Exchange  Policies,  and  without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, may: 
 
(i)
amend the time or times that the shares subject to each option will become purchasable by an optionee, 
including accelerating the vesting terms, if any, applicable to an option;
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v) 
 
(vi)
amend the process by which an optionee who wishes to exercise his or her option can do so, including 
the required form of payment for the shares being purchased, the form of exercise notice and the place 
where such payments and notices must be delivered;
reduce the exercise price or extending the term of an option, other than an option held by an insider of 
the Company;
amend the terms of the plan relating to the effect of termination, cessation or death of an optionee on 
the right to exercise options (including options held by an insider of the Company);
make any amendments of a typographical, grammatical or clerical nature; and
make  any  amendments  necessary  to  bring  the  plan  into  compliance  with  applicable  securities  and 
corporate laws and the Exchange Policies;
provides  that  an  option  commitment,  in  a  prescribed  form,  be  completed  and  delivered  to  each  optionee 
detailing the terms of options granted under the New Plan including vesting terms, if any;
provides, in compliance with certain TSX Venture policies:
(i)
(ii)
a  condition  that  no  more  than 5% of  the  issued  shares of  the  Company  may  be  granted  to  any  one 
individual  in  any  12  month  period,  unless  the  Company  has  obtained  disinterested  shareholder 
approval; 
a provision that the Company must obtain disinterested Shareholder approval of options if the Plan, 
together with all of the Company’s previously established and outstanding stock option plans or grants, 
could result at any time in:
A.
B.
the number of shares reserved for issuance under options granted to Insiders exceeding 10% 
of the Company’s shares; or
the grant to Insiders, within a 12 month period, of a number of options exceeding 10% of the 
issued shares;
55
a provision requiring vesting terms on options granted to Consultants conducting Investor Relations 
Activities; and
a provision allowing for the issuance of shares on the exercise of options without the TSX Venture 
hold period on the shares where the exercise price of the options is greater than or equal to the current 
market price of the Company’s shares.
The full text of the New Plan will be available at the Meeting.  You may also request a copy of the proposed New Plan 
by contacting the Company, see “Additional Information” below. 
 
Accordingly, the shareholders of the Company will be requested at the Meeting to pass an ordinary resolution in the 
following terms:
“RESOLVED that: 
 
the Company’s new Share Option Plan dated August 16, 2010, be and is hereby adopted and approved 
1. 
including reserving a maximum of 34,000,000 common shares for issuance under the new Share Option Plan; 
and 
 
2. 
any one director or officer of the Company is authorized and directed to do all such acts and things and 
to  execute  and  deliver  under  the  corporate  seal  or  otherwise  all  such  deeds,  documents,  instruments  and 
assurances  as  may  be  necessary  or  desirable  to  give  effect  to  the  foregoing  resolutions  and  to  complete  all 
transactions in connection with adopting the new Share Option Plan.”
(iii)
(iv)
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the resolution approving the New 
Plan. 
 
Investor Relations Contract
On September 1, 2010 the Company announced that it has retained CHF Investor Relations (Cavalcanti Hume Funfer 
Inc., “CHF”), a well-established Canadian investor relations firm headquartered in Toronto and operating under the same 
management for the past 17 years.
The IR  services  agreement,  effective  September  1st, 2010,  is for  a  term  of up  to  12 months,  subject  to  a satisfactory 
performance  review  at  the  six-month  mark.    It  is  intended  that  CHF  will  initiate  a  market  liquidity  program,  more 
commonly referred to as market-making, through CHF's Calgary office.  The market-making activity will be undertaken 
by CHF through a registered broker in compliance with the guidelines established by the TSX Venture Exchange Policy 
3.4 and other relevant policies.
Subject  to  TSX  Venture  Exchange  approval,  CanAlaska  will  compensate  CHF  with  monthly  fees  of  $7,500  and 
incentive  stock  options.    CanAlaska  has  granted  CHF  300,000  CVV  options  exercisable  at  10  cents  and  200,000 
exercisable at 15 cents, exercisable for two years. All stock options are subject to the minimum vesting rules of the TSX-
V, which specifies that no more than 25 per cent of the granted options may vest in any three-month period.  In the event 
of CHF's termination, any outstanding options would expire according to provisions of the company's stock option plan.

a  change  in  control  of  the  Company  and  that  would  operate  only  with  respect  to  a  merger,  acquisition  or 
corporate restructuring involving the Company or its subsidiaries.
There are no provisions in the Company’s articles governing ownership threshold.
With respect to items 2 through 8 above, the law applicable to the company in these areas is not significantly
different from that in the host country.

There is no law or governmental decree or regulation in Canada that restricts the export or import of capital, or affects 
the  remittance  of  dividends,  interest  or  other  payments  to  a  non-resident  holder  of  common  shares,  other  than 
withholding tax requirements.   
 
There is no limitation imposed by Canadian law or by the constituent documents of the Company on the right of a non-
resident to hold or vote common shares, other than are provided in the Investment Canada Act (Canada).  The following 
summarizes the material features of the Investment Canada Act (Canada). 
 
The Investment Canada Act (Canada) requires certain "non-Canadian" individuals, governments, corporations or other 
entities  who  wish  to  acquire  a  "Canadian  business"  (as  defined  in  the  Investment  Canada  Act),  or  establish  a  "new 
Canadian business" (as defined in the Investment Canada Act) to file either a notification or an application for review 
with  a  governmental  agency  known  as  "Investment  Canada".    The  Investment  Canada  Act  requires  that  certain 
acquisitions of  control of  a Canadian  business by  a  "non-Canadian" must  be  reviewed  and  approved by  the Minister 
responsible for the Investment Canada Act on the basis that the Minister is satisfied that the acquisition is "likely to be of 
net benefit to Canada", having regard to criteria set forth in the Investment Canada Act.  Only acquisitions of control are 
reviewable  under  the  Investment  Canada  Act;  however,  the  Investment  Canada  Act  provides  detailed  rules  for  the 
determination of whether control has been acquired and, pursuant to those rules, the acquisition of one-third or more of 
the voting shares of a corporation may,  in some circumstances, be considered to constitute an acquisition of control.  
Certain  reviewable  acquisitions  of  control  may  not  be  implemented  before  being  approved  by  the  Minister;  if  the 
Minister  does  not  ultimately  approve  a  reviewable  acquisition  which  has  been  completed,  the  acquired  Canadian 
business be divested.  Failure to comply with the review provisions of the Investment Canada Act could result in, among 
other things, an injunction or a court order directing disposition of assets or shares.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences 
 
The following is a general discussion of certain possible United States federal income tax consequences, under current 
law, generally applicable to a U.S. Holder (as hereinafter defined) of common shares of the Company. This discussion 
does  not  address  all  potentially  relevant federal  income  tax  matters  and it  does not  address  consequences peculiar  to 
persons  subject  to  special  provisions  of federal  income  tax  law,  such  as  those described  below  as excluded  from  the 
definition of a U.S. Holder. In addition, this discussion does not cover any state, local or foreign tax consequences (see 
“Canadian Federal Income Tax Consequences” below). 
 
The following discussion is based upon the sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), 
Treasury Regulations, published Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) rulings, published administrative positions of the IRS 
and court decisions that are currently applicable, any or all of which could be materially and adversely changed, possibly 
on a retroactive basis, at any time and which are subject to differing interpretations. This discussion does not consider the
Taxation
59
potential effects, both adverse and beneficial, of any recently proposed legislation, which, if enacted, could be applied, 
possibly on a retroactive basis, at any time. This discussion is for general information only and it is not intended to be, 
nor  should  it  be  construed  to  be,  legal  or  tax  advice  to  any  holder  or  prospective  holder  of  common  shares  of  the 
Company and no opinion or representation with respect to United States federal income tax consequences to any such 
holder or prospective holder is made. Accordingly, holders and prospective holders of common shares of the Company 
should consult their own tax advisors about the federal, state, local, and foreign tax consequences of purchasing, owning 
and disposing of common shares of the Company. 
 
U.S. Holders 
 
As  used  herein,  a  “U.S.  Holder”  means  a  holder  of  common  shares  of  the  Company  who  is  a  citizen  or  individual 
resident of the United States, a corporation or partnership created or organized in or under the laws of the United Sates or 
of any political subdivision thereof, an estate whose income is taxable in the United States irrespective of source or a 
trust subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and control of a United States fiduciary as 
described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code. This summary does not address the tax consequences to, and U.S. Holder 
does not include, persons subject to specific provisions of federal income tax law, such as tax-exempt organizations, 
qualified  retirement  plans,  individual  retirement  accounts  and  other  tax-deferred  accounts,  financial  institutions, 
insurance  companies,  real  estate  investment  trusts,  regulated  investment  companies,  broker-dealers,  nonresident  alien 
individuals, or foreign corporations whose ownership of common shares of the Company is not effectively connected 
with conduct on a trade or a business in the United States, persons or entities that have a “functional currency” other than 
the U.S. dollar, shareholders who hold common shares as part of a straddle, hedging or a conversion transaction, and 
shareholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, and shareholders who acquired their common shares through the 
exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation for services. This summary is limited to U.S. Holders 
who  own  common  shares  as  capital  assets.  This  summary  does  not  address  the  consequences  to  a  person  or  entity 
holding an interest in a shareholder or the consequences to a person of the ownership, exercise or disposition of any 
options, warrants or other rights to acquire common shares. 
 
Distribution on Common Shares of the Company 
 
U.S. Holders receiving dividend distributions (including constructive dividends) with respect to shares of the Company 
are  required  to  include  in  gross  income  for  United  States  federal  income  tax  purposes  the  gross  amount  of  such 
distributions, equal to the U.S. dollar value of such distributions on the date of receipt (based on the exchange rate on 
such  date),  to the  extent  that  the  Company  has  current  or  accumulated  earnings  or profits,  without  reduction for any 
Canadian income tax withheld from such distributions. Such Canadian tax withheld may be credited, subject to certain 
limitations, against the U.S. Holder’s federal income tax liability or, alternatively, may be deducted in computing the 
U.S. Holder’s federal taxable income by those who itemize deductions (see more detailed discussion at “Foreign Tax 
Credit” below).  To the extent that distributions exceed current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Company, they 
will be treated first as a return of capital up to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted basis in the common shares and thereafter as 
gain from the sale or exchange of the common shares. Preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains are applicable to a 
U.S. Holder, which is an individual, estate or trust. There are currently no preferential tax rates for long-term capital 
gains for a U.S. Holder, which is a corporation. 
 
In the case of foreign currency received as a dividend that is not converted by the recipient into U.S. dollars on the date 
of receipt, a U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in the foreign currency equal to its U.S. dollar value on the date of receipt. 
Generally any gain or loss recognized upon a subsequent sale or other disposition of the foreign currency, including the 
exchange for U.S. dollars, will be ordinary income or loss. However, an individual whose realized gain does not exceed 
$200 will not recognize that gain, to the extent that there are no expenses associated with the transaction that meet the 
requirement for deductibility as a trade or business expense (other than travel expenses in connection with a business 
trip) or as an expense for the production of income. 
 
Dividends paid on the common shares of the Company generally will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
provided  to  corporations  receiving  dividends  from  certain  United  States  corporations.  A  U.S.  Holder  which  is  a 
corporation  may,  under  certain  circumstances,  be  entitled  to  a  70%  (or  80%)  deduction  of  the  United  States  source 
portion of dividends received from the Company (unless the Company qualifies as a “foreign personal holding company” 
or a “passive foreign investment company,” as defined below) if such U.S. Holder owns shares representing at least 10% 
(or 20%) of the voting power and value of the Company. The availability of this deduction is subject to several complex 
limitations that are beyond the scope of this discussion.
60
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
 
Under  current  Treasury  Regulations,  dividends  paid  on  the Company’s  common  shares,  if  any,  generally  will  not  be 
subject to information reporting and generally will not be subject to U.S. backup withholding tax. However, dividends 
and the proceeds from a sale of the Company’s common shares paid in the U.S. through a U.S. or U.S. related paying 
agent (including a broker) will be subject to U.S. information reporting requirements and may also be subject to the 30% 
U.S. backup withholding tax, unless the paying agent is furnished with a duly completed and signed Form W-9. Any 
amounts withheld under the U.S. backup withholding tax rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the 
U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS. 
 
Foreign Tax Credit 
 
A  U.S.  Holder  who  pays  (or  has  withheld from  distributions)  Canadian  income  tax  with  respect  to  the  ownership of 
common shares of the Company may be entitled, at the option of the U.S. Holder, to either receive a deduction or a tax 
credit for such foreign tax paid or withheld. Generally, it will be more advantageous to claim a credit because a credit 
reduces United States federal income taxes on a dollar-for-dollar basis, while a deduction merely reduces the taxpayer’s 
income subject to tax. This election is made on a year-by-year basis and applies to all foreign taxes paid by (or withheld 
from) the U.S. Holder during that year. There are significant and complex limitations which apply to the credit, among 
which is the general limitation that the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share of the U.S. Holder’s United States 
income tax liability that the U.S. Holder’s foreign source income bears to his or its worldwide taxable income. In the 
determination of the application of this limitation, the various items of income and deduction must be classified into 
foreign and domestic sources. Complex rules govern this classification process. In addition, this limitation is calculated 
separately  with  respect  to  specific  classes  of  income  such  as  “passive  income”,  “high  withholding  tax  interest”, 
“financial services income”, “shipping income,” and certain other classifications of income. Dividends distributed by the 
Company will generally constitute “passive income” or, in the case of certain U.S. Holders, “financial services income” 
for these purposes. The availability of the foreign tax credit and the application of the limitations on the credit are fact 
specific,  and  U.S.  Holders  of  common  shares  of  the  Company  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  regarding  their 
individual circumstances. 
 
Disposition of Common Shares of the Company 
 
A U.S. Holder will recognize a gain or loss upon the sale of common shares of the Company equal to the difference, if 
any, between (i) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property received, and (ii) the shareholder’s tax 
basis  in  the  common  shares  of  the  Company.  Preferential  tax  rates  apply  to  long-term  capital  gains  of  U.S.  Holders 
which are individuals, estates or trusts. This gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss if the common shares are a capital 
asset  in  the  hands  of  the  U.S.  Holder,  which  will  be  a  long-term  capital  gain  or  loss  if  the  common  shares  of  the 
Company are held for more than one year. Deductions for net capital losses are subject to significant limitations. For 
U.S. Holders who are not corporations, any unused portion of such net capital loss may be carried over to be used in later 
tax  years  until  such  net  capital  loss  is  thereby  exhausted.  For  U.S.  Holders  which  are  corporations  (other  than 
corporations subject to Subchapter S of the Code), an unused net capital loss may be carried back three years from the 
loss year and carried forward five years from the loss year to be offset against capital. 
 
Currency Exchange Gains or Losses 
 
U.S.  Holders  generally  are  required  to  calculate  their  taxable  incomes  in  United  States  dollars.  Accordingly,  a  U.S. 
Holder who purchases common shares of the Company with Canadian dollars will be required to determine the tax basis 
of such shares in United States dollars based on the exchange rate prevailing on the settlement date of the purchase (and 
may be required to recognize the unrealized gain or loss, if any, in the Canadian currency surrendered in the purchase 
transaction). Similarly, a U.S. Holder receiving dividends or sales proceeds from common shares of the Company in 
Canadian dollars will be required to compute the dividend income or the amount realized on the sale, as the case may be, 
in United States dollars based on the exchange rate prevailing at the time of receipt in the case of dividends and on the 
settlement  date  in  the  case  of  sales  on  an  established  securities  exchange.  A  gain  or  loss,  if  any,  recognized  on  a 
disposition of Canadian currency in connection with the described transaction generally will be treated as an ordinary 
gain or loss. 
 
Other Considerations 
 
In the following circumstances, the above sections of this discussion may not describe the United States federal income 
tax consequences resulting from the holding and disposition of common shares.
61
Foreign Personal Holding Company 
 
If at any time during a tax year more than 50% of the total combined voting power or the total value of the Company’s 
outstanding  shares  is  owned,  directly  or  indirectly,  by  five  or  fewer  individuals  who  are  citizens  or  residents  of  the 
United States and 60% or more of the Company’s gross income for such year was derived from certain passive sources 
(e.g.,  from  dividends  received  from  its  subsidiaries),  the  Company  may  be  treated  as  a  “foreign  personal  holding 
company”. In that event, U.S. Holders that hold common shares would be required to include in gross income for such 
year their allocable portions of such passive income to the extent the Company does not actually distribute such income. 
The Company does not believe that it currently qualifies as a foreign personal holding company. However, there can be 
no assurance that the Company will not be considered a foreign personal holding company for the current or any future 
taxable year. 
 
Foreign Investment Company 
 
If 50% or more of the combined voting power or total value of the Company’s outstanding shares are held, directly or 
indirectly, by citizens or residents of the United States, United States domestic partnerships or corporations, or estates or 
trusts other than foreign estates or trusts (as defined by the Code Section 7701(a)(31)), and the Company is found to be 
engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, commodities, or any interest therein, it 
is possible that the Company may be treated as a “foreign investment company” as defined in Section 1246 of the Code, 
causing all or part of any gain realized by a U.S. Holder selling or exchanging common shares to be treated as ordinary 
income  rather  than  a  capital  gain.  The  Company  does  not  believe  that  it  currently  qualifies  as  a  foreign  investment 
company. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be considered a foreign investment company 
for the current or any future taxable year. 
 
Passive Foreign Investment Company (“PFIC”) 
 
The  Code  contains  rules governing  “passive  foreign  investment  companies”  (“PFIC”)  which  can have  significant tax 
effects on U.S. Holders of foreign corporations. These rules do not apply to non-U.S. Holders. Section 1297 of the Code 
defines a PFIC as a corporation that is not formed in the United States and, for any taxable year, either (i) 75% or more 
of  its  gross  income  is  “passive  income”,  which  includes  interest,  dividends  and  certain  rents  and royalties  or  (ii)  the 
average percentage, by fair market value (or, if the Company is not publicly traded and either is a controlled foreign 
corporation  or  makes  an  election,  by  adjusted  tax  basis),  of  its  assets  that  produce  or  are  held  for  the  production  of 
“passive income” is 50% or more. The Company believes that it qualified as a PFIC for the fiscal year ended April 30, 
1988  and  the  fiscal  years  ended  from  April  30,  1989  through  April  30,  2010.    There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the 
Company’s determination concerning its PFIC status will not be challenged by the IRS, or that it will be able to satisfy 
record  keeping  requirements  which  will  be  imposed  on  a  qualified  electing  fund  (“QEF”).  Each  U.S.  Holder  of  the 
Company is urged to consult a tax advisor with respect to how the PFIC rules affect their tax situation. 
 
A U.S. Holder who holds stock in a foreign corporation during any year in which such corporation qualifies as a PFIC is 
subject to United States federal income taxation under one of two alternative tax regimes at the election of each such 
U.S.  Holder.  The  following  is  a  discussion  of  such  two  alternative  tax  regimes  applied  to  such  U.S.  Holders  of  the 
Company. In addition, special rules apply if a foreign corporation qualifies as both a PFIC and a “controlled foreign 
corporation” (as defined below) and a U.S. Holder owns, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined 
voting power of classes of stock entitled to vote of such foreign corporation (see more detailed discussion at “Controlled 
Foreign Corporation” below). 
 
A U.S. Holder who elects in a timely manner to treat the Company as a QEF (an “Electing U.S. Holder”) will be subject, 
under Section 1293 of the Code, to current federal income tax for any taxable year in which the Company qualifies as a 
PFIC on his pro rata share of the Company’s (i) “net capital gain” (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net 
short-term capital loss), which will be taxed as a long-term capital gain to the Electing U.S. Holder and (ii) “ordinary 
earnings”  (the  excess  of  earnings  and  profits  over  net  capital  gain),  which  will  be  taxed  as  ordinary  income  to  the 
Electing U.S. Holder, in each case, for the shareholder’s taxable year in which (or with which) the Company’s taxable 
year ends, regardless of whether such amounts are actually distributed. 
 
The effective QEF election also allows the Electing U.S. Holder to (i) generally treat any gain realized on the disposition 
of his Company common shares (or deemed to be realized on the pledge of his shares) as capital gain; (ii) treat his share 
of the Company’s net capital gain, if any, as a long-term capital gain instead of ordinary income; and (iii) either avoid
62
interest charges resulting from PFIC status altogether, or make an annual election, subject to certain limitations, to defer 
payment of current taxes on his share of the Company’s annual realized net capital gain and ordinary earnings subject, 
however, to an interest charge. If the Electing U.S. Holder is not a corporation, such an interest charge would be treated 
as “personal interest” that is not deductible. 
 
The procedure a U.S. Holder must comply with in making an effective QEF election will depend on whether the year of 
the election is the first year in the U.S. Holder’s holding period in which the Company is a PFIC. If the U.S. Holder 
makes a QEF election in such first year, i.e., a timely QEF election, then the U.S. Holder may make the QEF election by 
simply filing the appropriate documents at the time the U.S. Holder files his tax return for such first year. If, however, 
the Company qualified as a PFIC in a prior year, then in addition to filing documents, the U.S. Holder must elect to 
recognize under the rules of Section 1291 of the Code (discussed herein), any gain that he would otherwise recognize if 
the U.S. Holder sold his stock on the qualification date or if the Company is a controlled foreign corporation, the U.S. 
Holder’s pro rata share of the Company’s post-1986 earnings and profits as of the qualification date. The qualification 
date is the first day of the Company’s first tax year in which the Company qualified as a QEF with respect to such U.S. 
Holder. The elections to recognize such gain or earnings and profits can only be made if such U.S. Holder’s holding 
period for the common shares of the Company includes the qualification date. By electing to recognize such gain or 
earnings and profits, the U.S. Holder will be deemed to have made a timely QEF election. A U.S. Holder who made 
elections to recognize gain or earnings and profits after May 1, 1992 and before January 27, 1997 may, under certain 
circumstances, elect to change such U.S. Holder’s qualification date to the first day of the first QEF year. U.S. Holders 
are urged to consult a tax advisor regarding the availability of and procedure for electing to recognize gain or earnings 
and profits under the foregoing rules. In addition, special rules apply if a foreign corporation qualifies as both a PFIC and 
a “controlled foreign corporation (as defined below) and a U.S. Holder owns, actually or constructively, 10% or more of 
the  total  combined  voting  power  of  classes  of  stock  entitled  to  vote  of  such  foreign  corporation  (see  more  detailed 
discussion at “Controlled Foreign Corporation” below). 
 
If  the  Company  is  a  PFIC  for  any  taxable  year  during  which  a  Non-Electing  U.S.  Holder  holds  Company  common 
shares, then the Company will continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such Company common shares, even if it 
is no longer definitionally a PFIC. A Non-Electing U.S. Holder may terminate this deemed PFIC status by electing to 
recognize  a  gain  (which  will  be  taxed  under  the  rules  discussed  above  for  Non-Electing  U.S.  Holders)  as  if  such 
Company common shares had been sold on the last day of the last taxable year for which it was a PFIC. 
 
Effective  for  tax  years  of  U.S.  Holders  beginning  after  December  31,  1997,  U.S.  Holders  who  hold  (actually  or 
constructively) marketable stock of a foreign corporation that qualifies as a PFIC, may annually elect to mark such stock 
to the market (a “mark-to-market election”). If such an election is made, such U.S. Holder will not be subject to the 
special  taxation  rules  of  Section  1291  discussed  above.  However,  if  the  mark-to-market  election  is  made  by  a  Non-
Electing U.S. Holder after the beginning of the holding period for the PFIC stock, then the Section 1291 rules will apply 
to certain dispositions of, distributions on and other amounts taxable with respect to the Company’s common shares. A 
U.S. Holder who makes the mark-to-market election will include in income for the taxable year for which the election 
was made an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the common shares of the Company as of the 
close of such tax year over such U.S. Holder’s adjusted basis in such common shares. In addition, the U.S. Holder is 
allowed a deduction for the lesser of (i) the excess, if any, of such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in common shares 
over the fair market value of such shares as of the close of the tax year, or (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the mark-to-
market gains for the common shares in the Company included by such U.S. Holder for prior tax years, including any 
amount which would have been included for any prior tax year but for the Section 1291 interest on tax deferral rules 
discussed  above  with  respect  to  Non-Electing  U.S.  Holders,  over  (B)  the  mark-to-market  losses  for  shares  that  were 
allowed as deductions for prior tax years. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares of the Company will 
be adjusted to reflect the amount included in or deducted from income as a result of a mark-to-market election. A mark-
to-market election applies to the taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year, unless 
the Company’s common shares cease to be marketable, as specifically defined, or the Secretary of the IRS consents to 
revocation of the election. Because the IRS has not established procedures for making a mark-to-market election, U.S. 
Holders should consult their tax advisor regarding the manner of making such an election. 
 
Under Section 1291(f) of the Code, the IRS has issued Proposed Treasury Regulations that, subject to certain exceptions, 
would treat as taxable certain transfers of PFIC stock by Non-Electing U.S. Holders that are generally not otherwise 
taxed, such as gifts, exchanges pursuant to corporate reorganizations, and transfers at death. Generally, in such cases the 
basis of the Company’s common shares in the hands of the transferee and the basis of any property received in exchange 
for  those  common  shares  would  be  increased  by  the  amount  of  the  gain  recognized.  Under  the  Proposed  Treasury 
Regulations, an Electing U.S. Holder would not be taxed on certain transfers of PFIC stock, such as gifts, exchanges 
pursuant  to  corporate  reorganizations,  and  transfers  at  death.  The  transferee’s  basis  in  this  case  will  depend  on  the 
manner of transfer. In a transfer at death, for example, the transferee’s basis is equal to (i) the fair market value of the
63
Electing U.S. Holder’s common shares reduced by the U.S. Holder’s adjusted basis in these common shares at death. 
The specific tax effect to the U.S. Holder and the transferee may vary based on the manner in which the common shares 
are transferred. Each U.S. Holder of the Company is urged to consult a tax advisor with respect to how the PFIC rules 
affect their tax situation. 
 
Certain special, generally adverse, rules will apply with respect to the Company common shares while the Company is a 
PFIC whether or not it is treated as a QEF. For example, under Section 1298(b)(6) of the Code, a U.S. Holder who uses 
PFIC stock as security for a loan (including a margin loan) will, except as may be provided in regulations, be treated as 
having made a taxable disposition of such shares. 
 
If the Company is classified as a PFIC, U.S. Holders who do not make timely QEF Elections (as discussed above) will 
be subject to a number of special tax rules. For example, gains recognized on disposition of the Company stock or the 
receipt of an “excess distribution” from the Company is (i) treated as if it were ordinary income earned  ratably on each 
day of the period the U.S. Holder owns shares of the Company at the highest marginal rate in effect during the period in 
which it was deemed included and (ii) subject to an interest charge as if the resulting tax had actually been due in such 
earlier year or years (an excess distribution is the amount of any distribution received by the U.S. Holder during the 
taxable  year  that  exceeds  125%  of  the  immediately  preceding  three  year  average  of  distributions  received  from  the 
Company, subject to certain adjustments.) Proposed Regulations broadly define a disposition to include any transaction 
or event that constitutes an actual or deemed transfer of property for any purpose under the Code, including (but not 
limited to) a sale, exchange, gift, transfer at death, and the pledging of PFIC stock to secure a loan. If the tax described 
above is not imposed on transfer at death, the recipient of the PFIC stock receives a basis in the transferred stock equal to 
the lesser of the fair market value or the adjusted basis of the stock in the hands of the U.S. Holder immediately before 
death.  Finally,  the  foregoing  rules  will  continue  to  apply  with  respect  to  a  U.S.  Holder  who  held  the  stock  of  the 
Company while the Company met the definition of a PFIC even if the Company ceases to meet the definition of a PFIC.  
 
Controlled Foreign Corporation 
 
If more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares entitled to vote or the total value of the 
shares of the Company is owned, actually or constructively, by citizens or residents of the United States, United States 
domestic partnerships and corporations or estates or trusts other than foreign estates or trusts (as defined by the Code 
Section 7701 (a)(31), each of which own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of 
all classes of shares of the Company (“United States Shareholder”), the Company could be treated as a controlled foreign 
corporation (“CFC”) under Subpart F of the Code. This classification would effect many complex results, one of which 
is the inclusion of certain income of a CFC which is subject to current U.S. tax. The United States generally taxes United 
States Shareholders of a CFC currently on their pro rata shares of the Subpart F income of the CFC. Such United States 
Shareholders are generally treated as having received a current distribution out of the CFC’s Subpart F income and are 
also subject to current U.S. tax on their pro rata shares of the CFC’s earnings invested in U.S. property. The foreign tax 
credit described above may reduce the U.S. tax on these amounts. In addition, under Section 1248 of the Code, gain from 
the sale or exchange of shares by a U.S. Holder of common shares of the Company which is or was a United States 
Shareholder at any time during the five-year period ending with the sale or exchange is treated as ordinary income to the 
extent of earnings and profits of the Company attributable to shares sold or exchanged. If a foreign corporation is both a 
PFIC  and  a  CFC,  the  foreign  corporation  generally  will  not  be  treated  as  a  PFIC  with  respect  to  United  States 
shareholders of the CFC. This rule generally will be effective for taxable years of United States Shareholders beginning 
after  1997  and  for  taxable  years  of  foreign  corporations  ending  with  or  within  such  taxable  years  of  United  States 
Shareholders.  Special  rules  apply  to  United  States  Shareholders  who  are  subject  to  the  special  taxation  rules  under 
Section 1291 discussed above with respect to a PFIC. Because of the complexity of Subpart F, a more detailed review of 
these rules is outside the scope of this discussion. The Company does not believe that it currently qualifies as a CFC. 
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be considered a CFC for the current or any future taxable 
year. 
 
Material Canadian Federal Income Tax Consequences 
 
The  summary  below  is  restricted  to  the  case  of  a  holder  (a  “Holder”)  of  one  or  more  common  shares  who  for  the 
purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the “Act”) is a non-resident of Canada, holds his common shares as capital 
property and deals at arm’s length with the Company. 
 
The following is a general discussion of certain possible Canadian federal income tax consequences, under current law, 
generally  applicable  to  a  non-resident  of  Canada  (as  hereinafter  defined)  of  common  shares  of  the  Company.  This 
discussion  does  not  address  all  potentially  relevant  federal  income  tax  matters  and  it  does  not  address  consequences 
peculiar to persons subject to special provisions of federal income tax law, such as those described above as excluded
64
from  the  definition  of  a  U.S.  Holder.  In  addition,  this  discussion  does  not  cover  any  provincial,  local  or  foreign  tax 
consequences. 
 
Dividends 
 
A Holder will be subject to Canadian withholding tax (“Part XIII Tax”) equal to 25%, or such lower rate as may be 
available under an applicable tax treaty, of the gross amount of any dividend paid or deemed to be paid on his common 
shares. Under the 1995 Protocol amending the Canada-US Income Tax Convention (1980) (the “Treaty”) the rate of Part 
XIII Tax applicable to a dividend on common shares paid to a Holder who is a resident of the United States is, if the 
Holder is a company that beneficially owns at least 10% of the voting stock of the Company, 5% and in any other case, 
15% of the gross amount of the dividend. The Company will be required to withhold the applicable amount of Part XIII 
Tax  from  each  dividend  so  paid  and  remit  the  withheld  amount  directly  to  the  Receiver  General  for  Canada  for  the 
account of the Holder. 
 
Capital Gains 
 
A Holder who disposes of a common share, including by deemed disposition on death, will not be subject to Canadian 
tax  on  any  capital  gain  (or  capital  loss)  thereby  realized  unless  the  common  share  constituted  “taxable  Canadian 
property” as defined by the Act. Generally, a common share will not constitute taxable Canadian property of a Holder 
unless  he  held  the  common  shares  as  capital  property  used  by  him  carrying  on  a  business  (other  than  an  insurance 
business) in Canada, or he or persons with whom he did not deal at arm’s-length alone or together held or held options to 
acquire, at any time within the five years preceding the disposition, 25% or more of the shares of any class of the capital 
stock of the Company. 
 
A Holder who is resident of the United States and realizes a capital gain on disposition of a common share that was 
taxable Canadian property will nevertheless, by virtue of the Treaty, generally be exempt from Canadian tax thereon 
unless (a) more than 50% of the value of the common share is derived from, or forms an interest in, Canadian real estate, 
including  Canadian  mineral  resource  properties,  (b)  the  common  share  formed  part  of  the  business  property  of  a 
permanent establishment that the Holder has or had in Canada within the 12 months preceding disposition, or (c) the 
Holder (i) was a resident of Canada at any time within the ten years immediately the disposition and for a total of 120 
months during the 20 years, preceding the disposition, and (ii) owned the common share when he ceased to be a resident 
of Canada. 
 
A Holder who is subject to Canadian tax in respect of a capital gain on disposition of a common share must include one-
half  of  the  capital  gain  (taxable  capital  gain)  in  computing  his  taxable  income  earned  in  Canada.  This  Holder  may, 
subject to certain limitations, deduct one half of any capital loss (allowable capital loss) arising on disposition of taxable 
Canadian property from taxable capital gains realized in the year of disposition in respect of taxable Canadian property 
and, to the extent not so deductible, from such taxable capital gains of any of the three preceding years or any subsequent 
year.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
ITEM 11. 
 
The Company anticipates its primary market risk, if any, to be related to fluctuations in exchange rates. Exchange rate 
risk may arise if the Company is required to use different currencies for various aspects of its operations.  At present, the 
functional currency for the Company is the Canadian dollar.  Based on the Company’s overall exchange rate risk as at 
April 30, 2010, the Company believes that a ten percent change in exchange rates would not have a material adverse 
effect on its financial position, results of operations, or changes in financial position.  The Company intends to monitor 
its exchange rate risk and take reasonable steps to reduce its exposure.  The Company does not intend to purchase or sell 
derivative instruments for speculative purposes.

ITEM 15.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (“DCP”) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all 
relevant information is communicated to senior management, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Based on this evaluation, these officers concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report on Form 20-F, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required 
to be disclosed by our company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized 
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These 
disclosure  controls  and  procedures  include  controls  and  procedures  designed  to  ensure  that  such  information  is 
accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our company’s principal executive officer and 
principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The conclusion that the disclosure 
controls  and  procedures  were  not  effective  was  due  to  the  presence  of  material  weaknesses  in  internal  control  over 
financial  reporting  as  identified  below  under  the  heading  “Internal  Controls  over  Financial  Reporting  Procedures”  ” 
Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the material weaknesses 
are remediated.
Internal Controls over Financial Reporting Procedures
The  management  of  the  Company  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  controls  over 
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).  The Company’s internal control system was 
designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  to  the  Company’s  management  and  the  board  of  directors  regarding  the 
reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  published  financial  statements  for  external 
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
(1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that  in  reasonable  detail  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and 
dispositions of the assets of the Company (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
66
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company and (3) provide 
reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use  or  disposition  of  the 
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter 
how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only 
reasonable  assurance  with  respect  to  financial  statement  preparation  and  presentation.    Because  of  its  inherent 
limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.    Projections  of  any 
evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of 
changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an 
evaluation of the design and operation of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2010. This evaluation 
included  review  of  the  documentation  of  controls,  evaluation  of  the  design  effectiveness  of  controls,  testing  of  the 
operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded 
our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  not  effective  as  at  April  30,  2010  due  to  the  following  material 
weaknesses: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and 
procedures for accounting, financial reporting and corporate governance. 
 
A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote 
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 
The  following  material  weakness  was  identified  in  management's  assessment  as  resulting  from  the  inadequate 
segregation of duties. 
 
The specific deficiency in question was that management’s verification of the future income tax calculations failed to 
detect  a  computational  error  contained  therein.  This  resulted  in  the  overstatement  of  prior  year  income  tax  recovery 
amounts  under  Canadian  GAAP  with  a  corresponding  effect  on  the  U.S.  GAAP  reconciliation.  The  appropriate 
corrections were made prior to the completion of the financial statements and resulted in an increase to the Company's 
net losses for the years ended April 30, 2009 and 2008. Such a control deficiency, if not remediated, could result in a 
material misstatement to the financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 
The  Company  has  taken  steps  to  enhance  and  improve  the  design  of  our  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting, 
however these steps were not complete as of April 30, 2010. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 
20-F,  the  Company  has  not  been  able  to  remediate  the  material  weaknesses  identified  above.  To  remediate  such 
weaknesses, the Company plans to implement the following changes during fiscal year ending December 31, 2010: (i) 
address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and 
procedures for accounting, financial reporting and corporate governance.  
 
The remediation efforts set out above are largely dependent upon the Company securing additional financing to cover the 
costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be 
adversely affected in a material manner. 
 
The  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  not  subject  to  attestation  by  our  independent  registered 
public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only 
management’s report in this annual report. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of 
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within the Company have been detected. These 
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur 
because of simple error or mistake.
During  the  Company’s  most  recently  completed  financial  year  ended  April  30,  2010,  there  were  no  changes  in  the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, its 
internal control over financial reporting.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal 
control  over  financial  reporting.  Management's  report  was  not  subject  to  attestation  by  the  our  registered  public 
accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report.

EXEMPTIONS FROM THE LISTING STANDARDS FOR AUDIT COMMITTEES
PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE ISSUER AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS
From time to time, management of the Company recommends to and requests approval from the audit committee for non-
audit  services  to  be  provided  by  the  Company’s  auditors.    The  audit  committee  routinely  considers  such  requests  at 
committee meetings, and if acceptable to a majority of the audit committee members, pre-approves such non-audit services 
by a resolution authorizing management to engage the Company’s auditors for such non-audit services, with set maximum 
dollar amount for each itemized service.  During such deliberations, the audit committee assesses, among other factors, 
whether  the  services  requested  would  be  considered  “prohibited  services”  as  contemplated  by  the  US  Securities  and 
Exchange  Commission,  and  whether  the  services  requested  and  the  fees  related  to  such  services  could  impair  the 
independence of the auditors.

Act  with  honesty  and  integrity,  handling  in  an  ethical  manner  any  actual  or  apparent  conflicts  of  interest  between

conflict in any way (or even appear to interfere or conflict) with the interests of the Company. 
 
Provide constituents with information that is accurate, complete, objective, relevant, timely and understandable.  If I am 
the CEO or CFO, I shall review the Company’s annual reports before certifying and filing them with the SEC. 
 
Comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of federal, provincial, territorial, state and local governments, and 
other appropriate private and public regulatory agencies. 
 
Act  in  good  faith,  responsibly,  with  due  care,  competence  and  diligence,  without  misrepresenting  material  facts  or 
allowing my independent judgment to be subordinated. 
 
Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in the course of business except when authorized or otherwise legally 
obligated to disclose the information.  I acknowledge that confidential information acquired in the course of business is 
not to be used for personal advantage. 
 
Promote  ethical  behavior  among  employees  at  the  Company  and  as  a  responsible  partner  with  industry  peers  and 
associates. 
 
Maintain control over and responsibly manage all assets and resources employed or entrusted to me by the Company. 
 
Report illegal or unethical conduct by any director, officer or employee that has occurred, is occurring or may occur, 
including any potential violations of the Company’s Code of Ethics (the “Code”).  Such report shall be made to the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors and shall include conduct of a financial or non-financial nature. 
 
Comply with the Code.  I understand that if I violate any part of the Code, I will be subject to disciplinary action. 
 
I understand that the Code is subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
 
I understand that there shall be no waiver of, modification of, or change to any part of the Code except by a vote of the Board 
of Directors or a designated Board committee.  In the event that a waiver of, modification of, or a change to the Code is 
granted, then the notice of the waiver, modification and/or change shall be posted on the Company’s website within five 
business days of the Board of Directors’ or designated Board committee’s vote or shall be disclosed otherwise as required by

CanAlaska Uranium Ltd. 
(An Exploration Stage Company)
Consolidated Financial Statements
April 30, 2010 and 2009
where indicated)
Report of Independent Registered Chartered Accountants 
 
To the Shareholders of  
CanAlaska Uranium Ltd. 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of CanAlaska Uranium Ltd. and 
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of April 30, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of loss and 
comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  The consolidated financial statements of the 
Company as of April 30, 2009 and for the years ended April 30, 2009 and 2008 were audited by other 
auditors whose report, dated July 31, 2009 (except for the effects of the restatement discussed in Note 4 
for which the date is August 19, 2010), expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the 
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). These standards require 
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of CanAlaska Uranium Ltd. and subsidiaries as at April 30, 2010, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Canadian generally accepted 
accounting principles.  
 
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control 
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a 
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposes of 
expressing an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we 
express no such opinion.

Comments by Independent Registered Chartered Accountants on 
Canada-United States of America Reporting Differences 
 
The standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) require the addition of 
an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion paragraph) when the financial statements are affected by 
conditions and events that cast substantial doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
such as those described in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.  Although we conducted our 
audit in accordance with both Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), our report to the Shareholders, dated 
August 19, 2010, is expressed in accordance with Canadian reporting standards which do not permit a 
reference to such conditions and events in the auditor’s report when these are adequately disclosed in the 
financial statements.

To the Shareholders of 
CanAlaska Uranium Ltd. 
 
We  have  audited  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  of  CanAlaska  Uranium  Ltd.  (the  “Company”)  (an  exploration  stage 
company) as at 30 April 2009 and the related consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity 
and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended 30 April 2009.  These consolidated financial statements are 
the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial 
statements based on our audits. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and with the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America).  Those standards require that we plan and perform 
an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes

includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
In  our  opinion,  these  consolidated  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the 
Company as at 30 April 2009 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period 
ended 30 April 2009 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  
Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
As discussed in Note 4, the consolidated financial statements as at 30 April 2009 and for the years ended 30 April 2009 and 
2008 have been restated.

CanAlaska Uranium Ltd.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

 (Expressed in Canadian dollars except where indicated)

Nature of Operations 
 
CanAlaska  Uranium  Ltd.  (the  “Company”  or  “CanAlaska”)  and  its  subsidiaries  are  principally  engaged  in  the 
exploration of uranium properties. The Company will attempt to bring the properties to production, structure joint 
ventures with others, option or lease properties to third parties or sell the properties outright. The Company has 
not determined whether these properties contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable and the Company 
is considered to be in the exploration stage. 
 
These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which  implies  the  Company  will 
continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.  CanAlaska has incurred 
losses since inception and as at April 30, 2010 has cumulative losses of $30.7 million (2009: $27.7 million).  The 
Company  has  never  paid  dividends  and  is  unlikely  to  pay  dividends  or  generate  earnings  in  the  immediate  or 
foreseeable  future.    At  April  30,  2010,  the  Company  has  cash  and  cash  equivalents  of  $8.7  million  (2009: 
$6.3 million) (note 7) and working capital of $8.5 million (2009: $6.4 million).  Management believes that the 
cash on hand at April 30, 2010 is sufficient to meet corporate, administrative and exploration activities for the 
coming twelve months.  However, the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the 
continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing 
to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations.  These factors raise substantial doubt regarding 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  Although CanAlaska has been successful in raising funds 
in the past, there can be no assurance that CanAlaska will be able to raise sufficient funds in the future.  Should 
CanAlaska be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, the net 
realizable value of its assets may be materially less than the amounts on the balance sheet. 
 
Recently Adopted Standards and Future Accounting Changes 
 
Section 3064 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 
Effective May 1, 2009, the Company adopted the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants’ (“CICA”) new 
Handbook Section 3064 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”. This Section replaced Section 3062 “Goodwill and 
Intangible Assets” and Section 3450 “Research and Development Costs”, and establishes revised standards for the 
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of goodwill and intangible assets. On adoption of this new 
Standard, EIC 27 “Revenues and Expenditures during the Pre-operating Period” was withdrawn, and so various 
pre-production and start-up costs are required to be expensed as incurred. No material adjustments were required 
upon adoption of this new Standard. 
 
EIC – 173 – Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
 
In January 2009, the CICA issued Emerging Issues Committee (“EIC”) Abstract 173 – Credit Risk and the Fair 
Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“EIC-173”). EIC-173 provides guidance on how to take into 
account credit risk of an entity and counterparty when determining the fair value of financial assets and financial 
liabilities,  including  derivative  instruments.    EIC-173  is  applicable  for  the  Company’s  interim  and  annual 
consolidated  financial  statements  for  its  fiscal  year  ending  April  30,  2010,  with  retroactive  application.    The 
adoption of EIC-173 did not result in a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Recently Adopted Standards and Future Accounting Changes 
 
EIC – 174 - Mining Exploration Costs 
 
On  March  27,  2009,  the  Emerging  Issues  Committee  issued  EIC-174  “Mining  Exploration  Costs”.  The  EIC 
provides additional guidance in light of the potential adverse impact of the current economic and financial turmoil 
on the carrying value of the deferred exploration costs. The EIC is effective for financial statements issued on or 
after  the  date  of  the  date  of  the  EIC.  This  EIC  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial 
statements as it had previously recognized a significant impairment charge with respect to its exploration projects 
in the prior financial statements. 
 
Section 3862 - Financial Instruments - Disclosures 
 
In June 2009, the CICA amended Section 3862, Financial Instruments - Disclosures (“Section 3862”), to include 
additional  disclosure  requirements  about  fair  value  measurement  for  financial  instruments  and  liquidity  risk 
disclosures. These amendments require a three-level hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in 
making  the  fair  value  measurements.  The  amendments  to  Section  3862  apply  for  annual  financial  statements 
relating to fiscal years ended after September 30, 2009. The three levels of fair value hierarchy under Section 
3862 are:
The disclosures required as a result of adopting the new section are presented in note 20. 
 
Future Accounting Changes 
 
Section  1582  –  Business  Combinations,  Section  1601  –  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  Section 
1602 – Non-Controlling Interests 
 
In January 2009, the CICA issued new accounting standards, Handbook Section 1582 “Business Combinations”, 
Handbook  Section  1602  “Non-Controlling  Interests”,  and  Handbook  Section  1601  “Consolidated  Financial 
Statements”, which are based on the International Accounting Standards Board’s (“IASB”) International Financial 
Reporting  Standard  3,  “Business  Combinations”.  The  new  standards  replace  the  existing guidance  on business 
combinations and consolidated financial statements. The objective of the new standards is to harmonize Canadian 
accounting for business combinations with the international and U.S. accounting standards. The new standards are 
to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of 
the first annual reporting period beginning on or after January 1, 2011, with earlier application permitted. Assets 
and liabilities that arose from business combinations whose acquisition dates preceded the application of the new 
standards  shall  not  be  adjusted  upon  application  of  these  new  standards.  Section  1602  should  be  applied 
retrospectively  except  for  certain  items.  The  Company  has  not  adopted  these  new  standards  but  continues  to 
evaluate the attributes and effect of early adoption of these standards if a business combination were to occur.

Recently Adopted Standards and Future Accounting Changes (continued) 
 
Section 3855 – Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement 
 
On April 29, 2009, the CICA amended Section 3855, “Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement”, 
adding/amending  paragraphs  regarding  the  application  of  effective  interest  method  to  previously  impaired 
financial assets and embedded prepayment options. The amendments are effective for interim and annual financial 
statements  relating  to  fiscal  years  beginning  on  or  after  January  1,  2011  with  early  adoption  permitted.  These 
amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. 
 
IFRS Convergence 
 
In  February  2008,  the  CICA  announced  that  GAAP  for  publicly  accountable  enterprises  is  to  be  replaced  by 
International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (“IFRS”)  for  fiscal  years  beginning  on  or  after  January  1,  2011. 
Companies are required to provide IFRS comparative information for the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, the 
conversion from GAAP to IFRS is to be applicable to the Company’s reporting for the first quarter of its 2012 
year  end  for  which  the  current  and  comparative  information  will  be  prepared  under  IFRS.  The  Company  is 
required to apply all of those IFRS standards which are effective for fiscal year ending April 30, 2011 and apply 
them to its opening May 1, 2010 balance sheet. 
 
Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Principles of consolidation 
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  assets,  liabilities  and  results  of  all  entities  controlled  by  the 
Company. The effects of transactions between entities on the consolidated group are eliminated. Where control of 
an entity is obtained during a financial year, its results are included in the consolidated statements of loss and 
deficit from the date on which control commences. Where control of an entity ceases during a financial year, its 
results are included for that part of the year during which control exists. 
 
Basis of consolidation 
 
These  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company’s  wholly-owned  subsidiaries, 
CanAlaska  Resources  Ltd.  USA  (a  Nevada  company),  CanAlaska  West  McArthur  Uranium  Ltd.  (a  B.C. 
company),  Golden  Fern  Resources  Limited  (a  New  Zealand  company)  and  Poplar  Uranium  Limited.  (a  B.C. 
company).   
 
The  Company  consolidates  the  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  of  Canada-Korea  Uranium  Limited 
Partnership  (“CKU  Partnership”)  and  CanAlaska  Korea  Uranium  Limited  (“CKUL”)  in  accordance  with  the 
guidance of Accounting Guideline 15 - Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (“AcG-15”). It recognizes the 
other Partners’ ownership as non-controlling interest. The Company also proportionately consolidates its interest 
in the Rise and Shine joint venture (a New Zealand joint venture).

Measurement uncertainties 
 
The  preparation  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  Canadian  GAAP  requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported, and disclosed in the financial 
statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Realization  of  the  Company’s  assets  and  liabilities  is  subject  to  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  reserve  and 
resource  estimation,  future  uranium  and  precious  and  base  metal  prices,  estimated  costs  of  future  production, 
changes  in  government  legislation  and  regulations,  estimated  future  income  taxes,  and  the  availability  of 
financing and various operational factors.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash at banks, cash on hand and other short term investments with a 
maturity of less than 90 days. 
 
Financial assets and liabilities 
 
Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair value and are subsequently measured based on their 
classification as held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, available-for-sale or held-for-trading. The classification 
is not changed subsequent to initial recognition.  
 
Held-for-trading 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities that are purchased and incurred with the intention of generating profits in 
the year term are classified as held-for-trading. These instruments are measured at fair value with the change in 
the fair value recognized in income.
Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses 
on  available-for-sale  securities  are  included  in  shareholders’  equity  as  a  component  of  other  comprehensive 
income.  
 
Comprehensive income 
 
Comprehensive  income  is  composed  of  the  Company’s  earnings  and  other  comprehensive  income.  Other 
comprehensive  income  includes  unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  available-for-sale  securities,  foreign  currency 
translation  gains  and  losses  on  the  net  investment  in  self-sustaining  operations  and  changes  in  the  fair  market 
value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, all net of income taxes. Cumulative changes in 
other comprehensive income are included in accumulated other comprehensive income which is presented as a 
category in shareholders’ equity.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Mineral properties and deferred exploration expenditures
The  Company  is  in  the  process  of  exploring  its  mineral  properties  and  has  not  yet  determined  whether  these 
properties contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable. 
 
Mineral exploration and development costs are capitalized on an individual prospect basis until such time as an 
economic  ore  body  is  defined  or  the  prospect  is  determined  by  management  to  be  impaired  or  abandoned. 
Amounts  received  for  the  sale  of  resource  properties,  for  option  payments  for  exploration  advances  and  for 
recovery of mineral property expenditures are treated as reductions of the cost of the property and payments in 
excess of capitalized costs are recognized in income. 
 
The  recoverability  of  the  amounts  capitalized  for  the  undeveloped  mineral  properties  is  dependent  upon  the 
determination of economically recoverable ore reserves, confirmation of the Company's interest in the underlying 
mineral claims, the ability to obtain the necessary financing to complete their development, and future profitable 
production or proceeds from the disposition thereof. 
 
Management of the Company regularly reviews the net carrying value of each mineral property. Where events or 
changes in circumstances suggest impairment, estimated future cash flows are calculated using estimated future 
prices, proven and probable reserves, value beyond proven and probable reserves, probability weighted outcomes 
and operating capital and reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis. If it is determined that the future cash flows 
are less than the carrying value, a write-down to the estimated fair value is expensed for the period. The Company 
presently  has  no  proven  or  probable  reserves.  Where  estimates  of  future  net  cash  flows  are  not  available  and 
where  other  conditions  suggest  impairment,  management  assesses  if  carrying  values  can  be  recovered.  If  the 
carrying values exceed estimated recoverable values, then the project is written-down to estimated fair values with 
the write-down expensed in the period. 
 
Management’s  estimates  of  future  mineral  prices,  recoverable  resources,  initial  and  operating  capital  and 
reclamation  costs  are  subject  to  certain  risks  and  uncertainties  that  may  affect  the  recoverability  of  mineral 
property costs. Although management has made its best estimate of these factors, it is possible that changes could 
occur that could adversely affect management’s estimate of the net cash flows to be generated from its properties. 
 
Title  to  mineral  properties  involves  inherent  risks  due  to  the  difficulties  of  determining  the  validity  of  certain 
claims  as  well  as  the  potential  for  problems  arising  from  the  frequently  unreliable  conveyancing  history 
characteristic of many mineral properties. The Company has investigated title to all of its mineral properties and, 
to the best of its knowledge, all of its properties are in good standing. 
 
Mineral exploration tax credits (“METC”) 
 
The Company recognizes METC amounts when the Company’s METC application is approved by the relevant 
taxation authorities or when the amount to be received can be reasonably estimated and collection is reasonably 
assured.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Asset retirement obligations 
 
The Company recognizes the legal liability for obligations relating to retirement of property, plant, and equipment, 
and  arising  from  the  acquisition,  construction,  development,  or  normal  operation  of  those  assets.  Such  asset 
retirement cost are recognized at fair value, when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be estimated, in the period 
in which it is incurred, added to the carrying value of the related asset, and amortized into income on a systematic 
basis over the related assets useful life. The liability is adjusted for changes in the expected amounts and timing of 
cash  flows  required  to  discharge  the  liability  and  accreted  to  full  value  over  time  through  periodic  charges  to 
earnings. 
 
There are no asset retirement obligations as at April 30, 2010 and 2009. 
 
Property and equipment  
 
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company provides for depreciation 
on  the  following  basis:  Office  equipment  -  20%  declining  balance  method;  Automotive  equipment  -  30% 
declining balance method; Mining equipment - 30% declining balance method; and Leasehold improvements - 
straight-line method over the life of the lease. 
 
Income taxes 
 
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for future income taxes. Under this method, future 
income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax and accounting bases of 
assets  and  liabilities  as  well  as  for  the  benefit  of  losses  available  to  be  carried  forward  to  future  years  at  the 
substantively enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to be 
reversed.  The amount of future tax assets recognized is limited to the amount that is more likely than not to be 
realized. 
 
Stock-based compensation 
 
All  stock-based  awards  made  to  employees  and  non-employees  are  measured  and  recognized  using  a  fair  value 
based method. For employees, the fair value of the options is measured at the date of the grant. For non-employees, 
the fair value of the options is measured on the earlier of the date at which the counterparty performance is complete 
or the date the performance commitment is reached or the date at which the equity instruments are granted if they are 
fully vested and non-forfeitable. For employees and non-employees, the fair value of options is accrued and charged 
to operations, with the offsetting credit to contributed surplus, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. If and 
when  the  stock options are ultimately exercised, the applicable amounts of  contributed  surplus  are transferred to 
share capital.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Loss per share 
 
Loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted 
loss per share is calculated using the treasury stock method whereby all "in the money" options and warrants are 
assumed to have been exercised at the beginning of the period and the proceeds from the exercise are assumed to 
have been used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period. Basic and diluted loss 
per share is the same as the effect of the exercise of outstanding options and warrants would be anti-dilutive. 
 
Foreign currency translation 
 
The accounts of the Company's foreign operations have been translated into Canadian dollars as follows: 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities are converted at the year-end rates and all other assets and liabilities at historical 
rates. Revenue and expense and exploration and development items at the average rate of exchange prevailing 
during the year. 
 
Exchange gains and losses arising from these translations are reflected in income or expense in the year that they 
occur. 
 
Flow-through shares 
 
Canadian  Income  Tax  Legislation  permits  an  enterprise  to  issue  securities  referred  to  as  flow-through  shares, 
whereby  the  investor  can  claim  the  tax  deductions  arising  from  the  renunciation  of  the  related  resource 
expenditures.  Under  Canadian  GAAP,  when  resource  expenditures  are  renounced  to  the  investors  and  the 
Company  has  reasonable  assurance  that  the  expenditures  will  be  completed,  future  income  tax  liabilities  are 
recognized with a corresponding reduction in share capital. 
 
If a Company has sufficient unused tax losses and deductions (“losses”) to offset all or part of the future income 
tax liabilities and no future income tax assets have been previously recognized on such losses, a portion of such 
unrecognized losses (losses multiplied by the effective corporate tax rate) is recorded as income up to the amount 
of the future income tax liability that was previously recognized on the renounced expenditures. 
 
The Company follows the recommendations of the Emerging Issues Committee (“EIC”) of the CICA with respect 
to  flow-through  shares,  as  outlined  in  EIC-146.    The  application  of  EIC-146  requires  the  recognition  of  the 
foregone tax benefit on the date the Company renounces the tax credits associated with exploration expenditures, 
provided there is reasonable assurance that the expenditures will be made.

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended April 30, 2009 and 2008 have been 
restated  to  reflect  the  income  tax  losses  and  other  carry  forward  balances  as  reported  by  the  Company  on  its 
formal  Canadian  income  tax  filings  and  as  ultimately  assessed  by  Canada  Revenue  Agency.    The  differences 
between the previously reported amounts and the restated amounts are due to changes in taxation estimates, the 
expiration of Canadian non-capital loss balances in 2009 and 2008, and accounting for the income tax effect of 
flow-through shares issued in 2009.  The restatement is summarized as follows:

Basic and diluted loss per share 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended April 30, 2009 and 2008 as reported 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) have been restated 
to reflect the accounting for non-controlling interest related to the write-off of mineral exploration costs.  As a 
result of the restatement, the net loss attributable to common shareholders and the non-controlling interest for the 
years 2009 and 2008 as presented under US GAAP each decreased by $1,097,000 and $532,000, respectively.  
Basic  and  diluted  loss  per  share  under  US  GAAP  decreased  from  $0.08  to  $0.07  for  2009  as  a  result  of  the 
restatement. 
 
 Interests in Variable Interest Entities 
 
CanAlaska Korean Uranium Joint Venture 
 
In  December  2007,  the  Company  formed  a  partnership,  CKU  Partnership,  with  Hanwha  Corporation,  Korea 
Electric Power Corporation, Korea Resources Corp., and SK Energy Co. Ltd. (together the “Korean Consortium”) 
to  develop  the  Cree  East  uranium  exploration  project  (“Cree  East”),  which  consists  of  approximately  56,000 
hectares  of  contiguous  mineral  claims  in  a  region  known  as  the  Athabasca  Basin  (“Athabasca”),  located  in 
Saskatchewan, Canada. 
 
Under  the  terms  of  agreements,  the  Korean  Consortium  will  invest  $19  million  towards  the  earn-in  of  a  50% 
ownership interest in the CKU Partnership over a 4-year period. As of April 30, 2010, the Korean Consortium has 
contributed $12.6 million (April 30, 2009: $7.6 million) and has a 40.6% interest (April 30, 2009: 29.6%) in the

Rise and Shine Joint Venture 
 
Rise and Shine, New Zealand 
 
Rise and Shine is located 20 kilometres (“km”) northeast of Cromwell, New Zealand and encompasses a number 
of historical high-grade underground gold mines in the Bendigo Gold field. Effective July 1, 2007, the Company 
has completed its earn-in requirements in a joint venture with Oceana Gold (New Zealand) Limited (“Oceana”) 
(30%) and CanAlaska (70%). If either party elects to not fund or only partially-fund their respective portion of a 
proposed budget then the defaulting party dilutes their equity in the joint venture down to a minimum of 15% at 
which point the relevant party’s interest in the joint venture will revert to a 2% royalty on gold produced. As of 
April 30, 2010, CanAlaska’s current interest in Rise and Shine is 72% and Oceana’s interest is 28%. 
  
In  June  2009,  the  Company  announced  an  agreement  with  Glass  Earth  Gold  Ltd.  (“Glass  Earth”)  which  was 
subsequently terminated in June 2010 (note 22). The option agreement with Glass Earth was for the sale of a 70% 
ownership interest in the claim.

During the year, flow-through shares totalling $4.3 million (2009 - $3.7 million) were issued, which funds are 
required  to  be  spent  on  certain  Qualifying  Canadian  Exploration  Expenditures  (note  13).  As  the  Company  no 
longer has the ability to use the expenditures for tax purposes, the Company is required to record a future tax 
liability  which  is  equal  to  the  renunciation  at  the  corporate  tax  rate  when  expenditures  are  renounced.  This 
amounted  to  $1.2  million  (2009  -  $1.0  million).  However,  the  Company  can  utilize  previously  unrecognized 
future income tax assets to offset the liability to the extent available. The excess future income tax liability of 
$3.4 million (2009: $2.7 million) has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Hierarchy 
 
The fair value hierarchy establishes three levels to classify inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair 
value. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active  markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability,  either  directly,  such  as  prices,  or  indirectly  (derived  from  prices).  Level  3  inputs  are  unobservable 
(supported by little or no market activity), such as non-corroborative indicative prices for a particular instrument 
provided by a third party.  
 
The Company has classified the financial assets as follows:
•  Level 1
o  Cash and cash equivalents. 
o  Available-for-sale securities. 
o  No items are included in this category. 
o  No items are included in this category.
•  Level 2
•  Level 3
There were no transfers between the above categories during the year.

20  Financial Instruments (continued)
Fair Values 
 
As  at  April  30,  2010,  the  Company's  carrying  values  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  receivable,  and 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short term to maturity. 
 
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  are  designated  as  held-for-trading.  The  Company  has  financial  assets  classified  as 
available-for-sale.  The  Company  has  recorded  its  available-for-sale  securities  at  current  market  value  through 
either permanent impairment or revaluation through other comprehensive income.  
 
Capital disclosure  
 
The Company considers its common shares, options and warrants as capital. As the Company is in the exploration 
stage  its  principal  source  of  funds  is  from  the  issuance  of  common  shares.  It  is  the  Company’s  objective  to 
safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to explore and develop its projects for 
the benefit of its stakeholders.  
 
Credit Risk 
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and 
accounts  receivable.  The  Company  deposits  cash  and  cash  equivalents  with  high  credit  quality  financial 
institutions as determined by rating agencies. 
 
Currency Risk 
 
The Company maintains a majority of its cash and cash equivalents in Canadian dollars and also incurs a majority 
of its expenditures in Canadian dollars and therefore, has a minimal exposure to foreign currency fluctuation.  
 
Interest Rate Risk 
 
Included in the loss for the year in these financial statements is interest income on Canadian and U.S. dollar cash 
and cash equivalents. If interest rates throughout the year had been 10 basis points (0.1%) lower (higher) then net 
loss would have been $8,000 lower ($8,000 higher).  
 
Liquidity Risk 
  
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities. The Company is reliant upon equity issuances and funding from its strategic partners as its two sources 
of cash. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining an adequate level of cash and cash equivalents to 
meet its ongoing obligations. The Company continuously reviews its actual expenditures and forecast cash flows 
and matches the maturity dates of its cash equivalents to capital and operating needs.  The Company’s accounts 
payable and accrued liabilities are all due within the year.  The Company has been successful in raising equity 
financing in the past; however, there is no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future (note 1).

21  Differences between Canadian and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(“GAAP”) 
 
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted 
in Canada (“Canadian GAAP”). The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requires that 
financial  statements  of  foreign  companies  contain  a  reconciliation  presenting  the  statements  on  the  basis  of 
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (“US  GAAP”).  Any  differences  in 
accounting  principles  as  they  pertain  to  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  are  not  material, 
except as follows: 
 
a)     US GAAP requires that mineral property exploration and land use costs must be expensed as incurred, until 
commercially mineable deposits are determined to exist within a particular property. Accordingly, for US GAAP 
purposes,  for  all  periods  presented,  the  Company  has  expensed  all  land  use  costs  for  mineral  properties  and 
deferred  exploration  costs,  which  have  been  incurred  by  the  Company,  for  which  commercially  mineable 
revenues do not exist. The expensing of these costs has a consequential impact on future income taxes.  Under 
Canadian GAAP, such costs have been deferred. For Canadian GAAP, cash flows relating to mineral property 
exploration  and  land  use  costs  are  reported  as  investing  activities.  For  US  GAAP,  these  costs  would  be 
characterized as operating activities. 
 
b)     US GAAP requires that stock-based compensation expense is recorded for shares held in escrow which 
become eligible for release, at the market value of the shares at that time. Under Canadian GAAP, no value is 
attributed  to such  shares  released  and  no  compensation  expense  is  recorded.  Shares  previously  held  in  escrow 
were performance shares which were issued to certain directors who reorganized the Company’s business affairs 
to fund the Company’s business plan. 
 
c)      Under Canadian GAAP a premium to market on the issuance of flow-through shares would be  recorded 
in 
share  capital.  For  US  GAAP  purposes,  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (“ASC”)  740,  “Income  Taxes”,  the 
proceeds should be allocated between the offering of the shares and the sale of tax benefits when the shares are 
issued. The allocation is made based on the difference between the quoted price of the shares and the amount the 
investor  pays  for  the  flow-through  shares.  A  future  tax  liability  is  recognized  for  the  premium  paid  by  the 
investors and is then recognized as a future income tax recovery in the period of renunciation. 
 
For Canadian GAAP purposes, the Company records a future income tax liability and a corresponding reduction 
of share capital in respect of flow-through share financing. For US GAAP purposes no such entry is recorded. 
 
d)    Under  Canadian  GAAP,  investments  in  joint  ventures  are  accounted  for  using  the  proportionate 
consolidation method. Under US GAAP, investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. 
The different accounting treatment affects only the display and classification of financial statement items and not 
net earnings or shareholders’ equity. As allowed under the SEC rules applicable to Form 20-F, no adjustment has 
been made for this difference. 
 
e)      Under US GAAP, funds raised from the issuance of flow-through shares, which have not yet been disbursed 
on  qualifying  exploration  expenditures,  would  be  disclosed  as  restricted  cash.  Accordingly,  cash  and  cash 
equivalents under US GAAP would be reduced by $833,000 at April 30, 2010, $nil at April 30, 2009, and $nil at 
April 30, 2008.

k)    New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
In  December  2007,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  160  (ASC  Subtopic  805-20),  “Non-controlling  Interests  in 
Consolidated Financial Statements” (“SFAS No. 160”), which specifies that non-controlling interests  are to be 
treated  as  a  separate  component  of  equity,  not  as  a  liability  or  other  item  outside  of  equity.  Because  non-
controlling interests are an element of equity, increases and decreases in the parent’s ownership interest that leave 
control  intact  are  accounted  for  as  capital  transactions.  The  statement  is  effective  for  business  combinations 
entered into on or after December 15, 2008, and, except for the changes to presentation and disclosure, is to be 
applied  prospectively  to  all  non-controlling  interests,  including  any  that  arose  before  the  effective  date.  The 
Company adopted this standard effective May 1, 2009 and, except for presentation changes above, did not have a 
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.   
 
In June 2008, FASB Task Force reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 07-5 (ASC Topic 815), “Determining 
Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock” (EITF 07-5”). The standard 
provides that an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) would not be considered indexed to the 
entity’s  own stock  if  the  strike  price  is  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  issuer’s  functional  currency. 
EITF 07-5 is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted this standard 
effective May 1, 2009 and determined that the adoption had no impact on the Company’s financial statements.

21  Differences between Canadian and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(“GAAP”) (continued) 
 
k)    New Accounting Pronouncements (continued) 
 
FASB  Accounting  Standard  Codification  (“ASC”)  No.  805  Business  Combinations  (“ASC  805”)  establishes 
principles  and  requirements  for  how  the  acquirer  recognizes  and  measures  the  identifiable  assets  acquired, 
liabilities  assumed,  and  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree;  recognizes  and  measures  the  goodwill 
acquired  in  the  business  combination  or  a  gain  from  a  bargain  purchase  and  determines  what  information  to 
disclose  to  enable  users  of  the  financial  statements  to  evaluate  the  nature  and  financial  effects  of  the  business 
combination. This statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or 
after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of 
this standard had no impact on the Company’s financial statements. 
 
In May 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 165 (ASC Subtopic 855-10), 
Subsequent Events, (“SFAS 165”). The statement is effective for financial statements ending after June 15, 2009. 
SFAS 165 establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events that occur after the 
balance  sheet  date.  Entities  are  also  required  to  disclose  the  date  through  which  subsequent  events  have  been 
evaluated and the basis for that date.  
 
In  January  2010,  the  FASB  issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  No.  2010-06,  “Fair  Value  Measurements 
Disclosures,”  which  amends  Subtopic  820-10  of  the  FASB  Accounting  Standards  Codification  to  require  new 
disclosures  for  fair  value  measurements  and  provides  clarification  for  existing  disclosures  requirements.  More 
specifically, this update will require (a) an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and 
out of Levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers; and (b) information 
about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements to be presented separately (i.e. present the activity on a gross 
basis  rather  than  net)  in  the  reconciliation  for  fair  value  measurements  using  significant  unobservable  inputs 
(Level 3 inputs). This update clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for 
classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and 
inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using Level 2 and 
Level 3 inputs. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will materially expand its 
consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures. 
 
In July 2009, U.S. GAAP switched to SFAS No. 168 (ASU 2009-1) “FASB Accounting Standards Codification”, 
a completely new codification scheme aimed to simplify U.S. GAAP; however, it is not intended to change US 
GAAP.  The  statement  is  effective  for  financial  statements  issued  for  interim  and  annual  periods  ending  after 
September 15, 2009 and has been adopted by the Company in the annual consolidated financial statements for the 
year ended April 30, 2010.

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167 (ASC Subtopic 855-10) “Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 
46 (R)”, which are amended standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable  interest entity. These 
new standards amend the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and 
requires ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. 
The provisions of the new standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009 
and interim periods within those fiscal years. These standards will be effective for the Company beginning in the 
first  quarter  of  fiscal  2010.  The  adoption  of  the  new  standards  will  not  have  an  impact  on  the  Company’s 
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Subsequent to the year ended April 30, 2010, the following events occurred: 
 
Zeballos 
 
In May 2010, the Company executed an option agreement with Ridgeback Global Resources Plc (“Ridgeback”) to 
commence exploration of the Zeballos project. Under the terms of the option agreement, Ridgeback may earn a 
50% interest in the property by making payments of $60,000 ($10,000 received), issuing up to 15% of the issued 
and outstanding shares of Ridgeback and making exploration expenditures of $2,500,000 by May 2014. 
 
Ridgeback  may  acquire  an  additional  25%  interest  by  completing  a  feasibility  study,  spending  a  minimum  of 
$500,000  per  year  and  issuing  1,000,000  additional  shares.  Upon  commercial  production,  the  Company  will 
receive a 2% net smelter royalty. 
 
Rise and Shine 
 
In  June  2010,  Glass  Earth  terminated  its  option  agreement  with  CanAlaska  in  respect  of  the  Rise  and  Shine 
Project (note 6). 
 
Cree East Funding 
 
On  July  2010,  the  Company  received  $1.72  million  from  the  Korean  Consortium  for  the  2010  Summer 
exploration program at Cree East. 
 
Grease River 
 
In  August  2010,  the  Company  executed  an  option  agreement  with  Westcan  to  commence  exploration  of  the 
Grease River project. Under the terms of the option agreement, Westcan may earn a 50% interest in the property 
by  issuing up  to  5%  of  the  issued  and  outstanding shares  of  Westcan  and  making  exploration  expenditures  of 
$4,500,000 by December 2013.  The Company will act as the operator for the exploration project and will earn a 
management fee of 10% of the exploration expenditures incurred.

exploration
In  the  Athabasca,  the  Company  controls  an 
exploration portfolio of 21 large projects totalling 
over  4,000  square  miles  (1.095  million  hectares) 
and  has  a  land  position  that  rivals  the  combined 
holdings  of  established  uranium  producing  giants 
Cameco Corporation and Areva. The Company has 
built  a  strong  in-house  exploration  team  and  has 
established 
funding 
relationships with MC Resources Canada, a wholly 
owned 
Japan’s  Mitsubishi 
Corporation  Ltd.  (“Mitsubishi”)  (on  the  West 
McArthur  property),  with  a  Korean  Consortium 
comprised  of  Hanwha  Corp.,  Korea  Resources 
Corp. 
(“KORES”),  Korea  Electric  Power 
Corporation (“KEPCO”), and SK Energy Co. Ltd. 
(on  the  Cree  East  property),  and  entered  into  a 
memorandum  of  understanding  with  Chinese-
based  East  Resource  Inc.  (“ERI”)  (for  its  Poplar 
project). CanAlaska also has option arrangements 
with Westcan Uranium Corp. in respect of its Cree 
West  and  Key  Lake  properties  and,  Kodiak 
Exploration Limited is earning into the Company’s 
McTavish property.  
In  addition,  CanAlaska  has  entered  into  option

Cash and Financing
agreements on the Black Lake, Fond Du Lac, and Collins Bay Extension projects with other third-parties through which the Company 
has committed to undertake and fund the exploration work. CanAlaska plans to actively market other projects to potential partners. 
CanAlaska’s commitment to the Athabasca has also resulted in its building strong ties with the local First Nations communities. The 
Company obtained approval from the communities of Black Lake and Fond Du Lac to undertake exploration on their reserve lands 
under  the  official  sanction  of  Indian  and  Northern  Affairs  Canada  (“INAC”).  In  achieving  this,  CanAlaska  has  the  distinction  of 
becoming the first company to undertake uranium exploration on First Nations’ reserve territory in Saskatchewan in over twenty-five 
years. CanAlaska’s record of operational safety and environmental compliance were recognized as key contributing factors during the 
lengthy review and approval process. 
The  Company’s  exploration  activities  are  managed  through  CanAlaska  offices  maintained  in  Vancouver,  BC  (Head  Office), 
Saskatoon, SK (Field Support Office), and La Ronge, SK (Equipment Warehouse). 
The Company believes that the increasingly attractive fundamentals of the nuclear power industry and the economic superiority of 
uranium over other energy fuels, will ensure the long-term future of global uranium markets and prices.  Since 2004, CanAlaska has 
expended over $64 million on exploration and research towards the advancement of uranium discovery on our twenty one project 
areas. 
 
1.2 
As of April 30, 2010 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $8.7 million (April 30, 2009: $6.3 million). The Company’s 
working capital position as at April 30, 2010 was $8.5 million (April 30, 2009: $6.4 million). 
 
The Company has entered into joint venture agreements with the Korean Consortium and Mitsubishi and they are currently fully or 
partially funding exploration on two of its properties located in Athabasca. As of April 30, 2010, the Korean Consortium has funded 
$12.6 million out of a total of $19 million and in February 2010, Mitsubishi completed $11.0 million of funding, and CanAlaska and 
Mitsubishi entered into a 50/50 joint venture. Subsequent to the formation of the joint venture, Mitsubishi has provided funding of 
$1.6 million for the West McArthur project. 
 
With the impact of the global credit crisis still being felt in the junior mining sector, CanAlaska views itself as fortunate to have strong 
strategic relationships with  its  partners. The  long-term  and  strategic  support from  Mitsubishi  and our Korean  Consortium  partners 
allows the Company to continue to advance two significant projects forward in these challenging economic times. CanAlaska has also 
been conscious to maintain a reasonable treasury and is continually evaluating all of its projects.  
 
From  August  to  December  2009,  the  Company  closed  four  non-brokered  flow-through  private  placements  and  one  non-brokered 
private placement for gross proceeds of $6.2 million (section 3.3). The Company believes that with the completion of these private 
placements,  its  current  treasury,  and  the  support  of  its  strategic  partners  that  it  can  continue  to  maintain  operations  over  the  next 
twelve months and work towards its strategic goal of discovering one or more high grade uranium deposits. 
 
The Company however remains in nature an exploration enterprise and will, at some point, need to seek additional financings either 
through equity offerings or the formation of additional strategic partnerships.

In June 2010, the Company commenced the summer operations for further intensive diamond drilling on the Cree East project.  The 
twenty drill hole campaign, comprising approximately 9,000 metres, will be split between the targets at Zone A and Zone G on the 
property. 
 
In June 2010, the Company reported results from the winter drill program at the West McArthur project and the commencement of 
additional summer 2010 exploration.  Of particular note is uranium mineralization in two holes.  Drill hole WMA022: (0.5 metres @ 
0.013% U3O8 in the basement (888.1-888.6 metres) and drill hole WMA024: (0.5 metres @ 0.018% U3O8 in sandstone (729.4-729.9 
metres)).   
 
In  May  2010,  the  Company  reported  on  new  gold  mineralization  of  up  to  24.36  grams  per  tonne  (“g/t”)  identified  on  the  Poplar 
project.  Channel rock samples collected from mineralized zones during the summer of 2009 have provided new high gold values in 
addition to other mineralization previously found at Felix Bay of up to 47.94 g/t gold and 19.7 g/t platinum. 
 
In April 2010, the Company reported preliminary drill results from its Collins Bay Extension project, a uranium property under option 
from Baywater Uranium.  The winter drill program tested uranium mineralized targets on Fife Island, and then advanced to a second, 
large, well-defined conductivity and gravity anomaly located due east of the Collins Bay and Eagle Point mine areas.  The Company 
intersected a new geological feature showing uranium mineralization and extensive breccia development. 
 
In April 2010, the Company announced its preliminary drill results at the Cree East project, where drill data indicated four areas of 
basement  faulting,  hydrothermal  alteration,  and  radioactivity,  consistent  with  Athabasca  uranium  deposit  models.    Based  on  the 
preliminary results, Zone A on the property warrants additional drilling in the summer to precisely test the east-west structural trends, 
and the associated large fault uplifts (over 50 metres vertical). In addition, drill hole CRE043 at Zone G exhibited several zones of 
strong fracturation and bleaching in the sandstone over 97.5 metres (from 231 metres to the unconformity at 328.5 metres). 
 
In  March  2010,  the  Company  reported  that  drilling  was  underway  on  its  Helmer  project,  situated  along  the  northern  rim  of  the 
Athabasca Basin.  Drilling will test a group of strong targets along the Grease River fault, which were modeled from airborne EM and 
gravity surveys. 
 
In March 2010, the Company reported that after a 3 year hiatus, the Manitoba Government had completed consultation with local First 
Nations and has issued exploration permits for ground work and drilling on the NE Wollaston project.  The permit now allows the 
Company  to  explore  the property  and  entertain new partnerships for  ongoing  intensive  exploration  in  an  environment  where  local 
communities are supportive of the Company’s efforts. 
 
In March 2010, the Company reported that drilling was underway on the Fife Island target on the Collins Bay Extension project, and 
that additional drilling was planned for a second, large and well-defined conductivity/gravity anomaly target located due east of the 
Collins Bay and  Eagle Point mines. 
 
In February 2010, the Company announced that Mitsubishi completed the $11 million investment specified under the project’s option 
agreement  and  formally  earned  a  50%  ownership  interest  in  the  West  McArthur  uranium  project.    An  unincorporated  50:50  joint 
venture was formed between the parties to pursue further exploration and development of the property. The Company and Mitsubishi 
have outlined a future multi-year $20 million exploration program for the West McArthur property that will progressively test the 
current target areas and reach across the remainder of the property to evaluate other target areas. 
 
In January 2010, the Company received funding of $3.0 million for planned winter 2010 geophysics and drilling programs, and a 
further $1.12 million for planned summer 2010 work from its Korean Consortium partners for its Cree East Project. During the third 
quarter, in late January, mobilization of the camp equipment was completed. To April 30, 2010, the Company’s Korean partners had 
funded a total of $12.6 million of their $19.0 million commitment.  
 
In  January  2010,  the  Company  commenced  initial  drilling  in  the  McTavish  property.  Kodiak  Exploration  Limited  was  granted  an 
option by the Company to acquire an initial 50% interest in the Project for $4.0 million in exploration, $600,000 of which is to be 
completed before June, 2010. Additional interests can be earned by Kodiak, with further work programs or the definition of uranium 
resources on the Project.

In December 2009, the Company closed a non-brokered flow-through private placement of 3,876,300 units at $0.21 per unit for gross 
proceeds of $0.8 million and an ordinary unit private placement of 10,897,571 units at $0.175 per unit for gross proceeds of $1.9 
million. 
 
In November 2009, the Company announced its purchase of mineral claims in the Cluff Lake area from Hawk Uranium Ltd., which 
CanAlaska  plans  to  incorporate  into  its  existing  Carswell  project.  Consideration  paid  by  CanAlaska  to  Hawk  Uranium  included 
1,250,000 CanAlaska shares and cash of $62,500. Under the terms of the agreement, Hawk Uranium also retains a 2.5% net smelter 
royalty, of which 2% is purchasable by CanAlaska. 
 
In November 2009, the Company closed a tranche of a non-brokered flow-through private placement of 10,714,428 units at $0.21 per 
unit for gross proceeds of $2.25 million. 
 
In October 2009, the Company closed a tranche of a non-brokered flow-through private placement of 1,190,000 units at $0.21 per unit 
for gross proceeds of $0.25 million. 
 
In October 2009, the Company reported extensive zones of heavy and light rare earth mineralization in surface rocks and boulder 
trains on the North East Wollaston project. Reported total rare earth element (“REE”) mineralization ranged from 0.2% to 10% and, in 
many cases, was the most valuable mineralization component of the samples. In other samples, REE occurs as a significant potential 
by-product  from  uranium  or  base-metal  mineralized  zones.  Because  of  the  varying  ratio  of  heavy  to  light  REE,  the  in-situ  value 
estimate is quite variable. REE minerals have been recently identified as important industrial mineral commodities.  
 
In September 2009, the Company reported assay results from its August 2009 drill program at Fond Du Lac. Hole FDL017 returned 
40.4  metres  averaging  0.32%  U3O8,  including  6  metres  averaging  1.13%  U3O8  and  with  individual  values  of  half-metre  samples 
grading up to 3.77% U3O8.  
 
In August 2009, the Company closed two tranches of a non-brokered flow-through private placement of 5,826,764 units at $0.17 per 
unit for gross proceeds of $1.0 million. 
 
In August 2009, the Company secured Kodiak Exploration as a funding exploration partner for its McTavish project. Kodiak has been 
granted  an option  to  acquire  up  to  a 70% interest.  In order  to  earn  an  initial  50%  interest,  Kodiak must  complete  $4.0  million in 
exploration and issue 1,000,000 Kodiak shares to CanAlaska (100,000 issued) as follows: 100,000 on or before the date of acceptance 
of  the  transaction  by  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  and  then,  on  or  before  each  anniversary  date  thereafter,  make  annual  work 
expenditures  and  issue  shares  respectively  of:  first  year  –  $0.6  million  and  50,000  shares;  second  year  –  $0.8  million  and  50,000 
shares;  third  year  –  $1.2  million  and  50,000  shares;  fourth  year  –  $1.4  million  and  50,000  shares,  and;  fifth  year  –  $  nil  and the 
remaining balance of 700,000 shares.  
 
In August 2009, the Company received $270,000 from East Resource Inc. for exploration work on the Poplar project. Accordingly, in 
Q210, six ERI geologists from China, along with CanAlaska personnel, commenced geological mapping and prospecting of 5 target 
zones  in  preparation  for  future  drilling  programs.  The  Company  continues  in  discussions  with  ERI  in  respect  of  a  definitive 
agreement. 
 
In July 2009, the Company executed an option agreement with Bayswater Uranium Corporation ("Bayswater"). Under the agreement, 
the Company will undertake and fund an exploration program on the Collins Bay Extension project, which is directly adjacent to, and 
follows the North-East strike of past-producing uranium mines at Rabbit Lake and Collins Bay, and the current producing uranium 
mine at Eagle Point in the Province of Saskatchewan. The project hosts multiple zones of known uranium mineralization, and on Fife 
Island, at least one zone of ore-grade values. This project will investigate previous interesting drill intercepts. 
 
In July 2009, the Company completed exploration work on its Fond Du Lac project which including 2,000 metres of drilling, and 
geophysics testing of multiple gravity and chargeability targets near the historic Fond Du Lac uranium deposit. In 2008, the Company 
conducted reconnaissance work and the first drill sampling of the deposit since the late 1970's. CanAlaska’s first drill holes through 
the eastern end of the mineralized zone intercepted significant intervals of mineralized sandstone above the unconformity. Below the 
unconformity, the drill holes intercepted hematitic alteration zones with similarities to typical feeder zones for classical unconformity 
style deposits. In August 2009, the Company announced that its exploration program at Fond Du Lac had been extended based on 
mineralization discovered in basement structures.

2.2.1  Cree East Project, Saskatchewan – Korean Consortium 
Cree East is a high-priority project located in the south-eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin, 35 kilometres west of the formerly 
producing  Key  Lake  mine  and  5  to  22  kilometres  north  of  the  south  rim  of  the  Athabasca  Basin.  The  project  is  comprised  of  16 
contiguous  mineral  claims  totalling  approximately  56,000  hectares.  A  Korean  Consortium  (Hanwha  Corp.,  Korea  Electric  Power 
Corp., Korea Resources Corp. and SK Energy Co. Ltd.), in December 2007 agreed to spend $19 million on the properties to earn into 
a 50% interest in the Cree East project.  
 
As of April 30, 2010, the Korean Consortium has contributed $12.6 million towards exploration of the project and holds a 40.6% 
ownership interest in both CanAlaska Korea Uranium Ltd. and the Canada-Korea Uranium Limited Partnership. The following table 
summarizes the Korean Consortium expenditures and advances by quarter, fiscal year ended, and life to date (“LTD”) on the project. 
The table does not include a $0.6 million payment made directly to CanAlaska for intellectual property associated with the project.  
 
Due to the nature of the partnership agreements, the Company accounts for the joint venture as a variable-interest entity (“VIE”), and 
fully consolidates the joint venture and shows the Korean Consortium’s contributions as a non-controlling interest on CanAlaska’s 
consolidated balance sheet.

In April 2010, the Company announced the preliminary results from the April 2010 (Q410) winter drilling program, where 14 holes 
were  completed  (6,139  metres).  Initial  information  from  the  winter  drill  program  indicates  four  areas  of  basement  faulting, 
hydrothermal alteration, and radioactivity, consistent with Athabasca uranium deposit models. At the commencement of the program, 
ten  separate  target  zones  had  been  defined  by  airborne  and  ground  geophysics,  along  a  5  kilometre  trend.  Locally,  these  features 
exhibited strong electromagnetic responses.  
 
The Company is currently awaiting laboratory assay results from drill core zones with high radiometric counts, as well as the results of 
the trace element geochemistry for these and surrounding drill holes. Based on the preliminary Winter 2010 results, Zone A warrants 
additional drilling in the summer of 2010 to precisely test the East-West structural trends, and the associated large fault uplifts (over 
50 metres vertical).  
 
Drill hole CRE043 at Zone G exhibited several zones of strong fracturation and bleaching in the sandstone over 97.5 metres (from 231 
metres to the unconformity at 328.5 metres). At this location, the basement rocks also gave indications of uranium mineralization at 
402 metres (maximum of 2,224 counts per second on probe), this equates to a radiometric grade of 2.15 metres @ 0.024 eU1. CRE043 
also exhibited hematite alteration to 431 metres depth. For a complete understanding of the drilling results reference should be made 
to the Company’s press release of April 13, 2010. 
 
In  July  2009,  the  Company  embarked  on  a  $0.9  million  program  of  geophysics  investigation,  comprising  hi-resolution  airborne 
magnetic, close-spaced airborne VTEM (4,368 kilometres) and ground TDEM surveys. The targeting data received from these surveys 
will be used to guide future drilling efforts. In Q110 and Q210 respectively, the Company also conducted 40 and 85 kilometres of 
induced  polarization  (“IP”)  resistivity  surveys.  In  fiscal  2010,  28%  and  26%  of  exploration  expenditures  were  associated  with 
geophysics  and  drilling  respectively.    Under  the  Cree  East  agreement,  CanAlaska  is  entitled  to  charge  an  operator  fee  of  10%  to 
recoup its indirect costs associated with the project, which the Company recognizes as management fees.  
 
2.2.2  West McArthur Project, Saskatchewan – Optioned to Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd. 
The West McArthur project in the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, was optioned in April 2007 to Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd., a 
subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan. Under the option agreement, Mitsubishi could exercise an option to earn a 50% interest 
in the property by investing $11 million. In February 2010, Mitsubishi exercised their option with a payment to the Company and an 
unincorporated 50/50 joint venture was formed between the parties to pursue further exploration and development of the property. The 
Company acts as project operator and earns a fee between 5% and 10%, based on expenditures incurred. The West McArthur project 
is located immediately west of the McArthur River uranium mine operated by Cameco Corp.

During Q410, the Company carried out a 6,071 metre drilling program combined with ground geophysics. The six-hole drill program 
was focused on a large conductive zone in the Grid 1 area on the western portion of the project. Previous drill holes, located over an 
area  2.0  kilometres  by  2.5  kilometres,  have  intersected  separate  zones  of  anomalous  uranium  mineralization,  silicification,  and 
sandstone alteration. The 2010 winter drilling was successful in intersecting graphitic horizons which follow the conductive trend. Of 
particular note is uranium mineralization in two holes.  Drill hole WMA022: (0.5 metres @ 0.013% U3O8 in the basement (888.1-
888.6 metres)) and drill hole WMA024: (0.5 metres @ 0.018% U3O8 in sandstone (729.4-729.9 metres)). 
 
Where there was evidence of hydrothermal alteration, it extended well into the sandstone and matches the typical alteration model of 
Athabasca unconformity style uranium deposits. There is evidence of uranium mineralization in multiple areas, either as enrichment at 
the unconformity or in basement stringers. The most compelling features for further exploration are the uranium values in sandstone 
higher  in  the  stratigraphy,  the  hematized  and  broken  rock  in  the  sandstone,  and  the  pattern  of  basement  offsets  and  geophysical 
conductivity.  
 
Following discussion of the winter 2010 exploration results at a recent joint venture management meeting, the joint venture will now 
contract further geophysical surveys on a property-wide basis commencing this summer and extend the winter geophysical survey for 
Grid  5  (located  10  kilometres  SSE  of  Grid  1),  where  a  well-defined  conductor  and  low  resistivity  geophysical  zone  has  been 
identified. The plan for exploration is progressively to test the seven grids on the property with Phase 1 surveys to outline potential 
and to provide the basis for Phase 2 target definition. Drilling is planned on Grid 5 in Winter 2011 as part of the Phase 1 evaluation 
program. For a complete understanding of the drilling results reference should be made to the Company’s press release of June 21, 
2010. 
 
In  fiscal  2010,  drilling  costs  comprised  43%  of  the  total  exploration  costs  at  West  McArthur  from  the  6,071  metre  drill  program 
completed in the fourth quarter. Included within Other expenses are management fees charged to and reimbursed by Mitsubishi for 
CanAlaska acting as project operator. 
 
2.2.3 
The Poplar project, comprising approximately 71,000 hectares, was staked by the Company in 2006 and covers all of the northern 
edge of the Athabasca Basin located between CanAlaska’s Helmer and Lake Athabasca projects. 
 
In June 2009, the Company announced that it had executed an MOU with East Resource Inc. (“ERI”) on the Poplar project. ERI had a 
prior, similar MOU with the Company to undertake uranium exploration at the Company's NE Wollaston project in the Province of 
Manitoba. However, due to prolonged delays in receiving exploration permits for NE Wollaston from the Province of Manitoba which 
required aboriginal consultations, East Resource Inc. and CanAlaska agreed to work together on the Poplar project under similar earn-
in terms as the prior MOU for NE Wollaston.

During  fiscal  2009,  the  Company  conducted  1,130  kilometres  of  prospecting  and  seismic  geophysics  over  approximately  1,600 
kilometres. This work program outlined uranium mineralization in basement rocks located north of the edge of Lake Athabasca, and 
indicated continuity of mineralized units and structural breaks associated with mineralizing systems  further to the south into areas 
covered by the lake. The airborne surveys and extensive geophysical seismic surveying in the lake-covered area also show a large 
number  of  anomalous  conductive  zones  and  structural  breaks,  which  elsewhere  are  generally  thought  to  be  associated  with 
mineralizing events. Detailed analysis of the data continues. 
 
Under the terms of the MOU, ERI may earn a 40% interest in the Poplar project by undertaking a minimum of 100,000 metres of 
diamond  drilling  within  5  years.  ERI  may  earn  a  70%  interest  by  undertaking  a  minimum  of  50,000  metres  of  diamond  drilling, 
successfully completing a feasibility study for a minimum economic reserve of 15 million pounds U3O8 and fully-financing the costs 
of mine construction. ERI may earn an 80% interest by undertaking a minimum of 50,000 metres of diamond drilling, successfully 
completing  a  feasibility  study  for  a  minimum  economic  reserve  of  35  million  pounds  U3O8  and  fully-financing  the  costs  of  mine 
construction. ERI may also earn an additional 15% interest to hold a cumulative 95% ownership by granting to CanAlaska a 5% gross 
revenue royalty from the production and sale of minerals. 
 
In August 2009, ERI funded $270,000 under their MOU for exploration work on the project. Accordingly, in Q210, six ERI geologists 
from China, along with CanAlaska personnel, commenced geological mapping and prospecting of 5 target zones in preparation for 
future drilling programs.  In Q410, discussions on a definitive agreement between the Company and ERI in respect of the Poplar 
project continued.

On October 18, 2006, CanAlaska optioned the Fond Du Lac project from the Fond Du Lac Denesuline First Nation. The project spans 
approximately 36,000 hectares and contains a uranium deposit with a historical (non 43-101 compliant) resource. CanAlaska can earn 
a 49% interest in the project by funding $2 million in exploration over 5 years. In addition, the Company is committed to pay to the 
Fond  Du  Lac  Denesuline  First  Nation  a  further  $130,000  in  cash  consideration  ($50,000  paid;  June  2010:  $40,000;  June 
2011:$40,000) and 300,000 shares (200,000 shares issued; June 2010: 50,000; June 2011: 50,000).

The Company received its exploration permit from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada on June 24, 2008. In July and August 2008, 
the Company carried out a 1,300 metre drill program in the vicinity of the zone of known uranium mineralization. In mid-September 
2008, the Company released the first drill results from the program, confirming good uranium mineralization and significant response 
from ongoing geophysical surveys over the target area. 
 
In Q209 and Q309, the Company undertook over 2,500 kilometres of airborne geophysics and 63 line kilometres of prospecting. The 
results from the geophysics and drill program indicate the potential for further zones of uranium mineralization within the vicinity of 
the known mineral deposit. Additionally, the drill program intercepted fault structures and hematite alteration zones in the basement 
rocks underlying the target area, indicating the potential for basement hosted uranium mineralization.  
 
During January, 2010, the Company completed 2,814 metres of drilling. In September 2009, CanAlaska reported assay results from its 
August  2009  drill  program  at  Fond  Du  Lac  which  included  the  results  from  hole  FDL017.  Hole  FDL017  returned  40.4  metres 
averaging 0.32% U3O8, including 6 metres averaging 1.13% U3O8 with individual values of half-metre samples grading up to 3.77% 
U3O8. For a complete understanding of the assays results from this drill program, reference should be made to the Company’s press 
release of September 22, 2009. It also undertook surface trench sampling and mapping on the western portion of the Fond Du Lac 
project where significant surface, and near surface uranium mineralization, was discovered. For a full understanding of the results, 
reference should be made to the Company’s press release of September 16, 2009.  
 
In fiscal 2010, drilling comprised 30% and geology comprised 20% of the exploration expenditures at Fond Du Lac. The decrease in 
camp costs and operations for fiscal 2010 is consistent with the drill program that was being conducted at that time. The second half of 
the year was focused on interpretation of the drilling data. 
 
2.2.5 
In  December  2006,  the  Company  acquired  from  the  Black  Lake  Denesuline  First  Nation  an  option  to  earn  a  49%  interest  in  the 
project. To earn its interest the Company must make payments totalling $130,000 ($101,628 paid; July 2011: $28,372), issue 300,000 
shares (200,000 issued; July 2010: 50,000 shares; July 2011: 50,000 shares), and incur exploration expenditures of $2 million ($1.0 
million incurred; July 2010: $0.7 million; July 2011: $1.2 million; July 2012: $2.0 million).

In Q110, the Company completed its 1,923 metre drill program, which comprised 649 metres in Q409 and 1,272 metres in Q110.  In 
August 2009, the results of Q409 drill campaign at Black Lake were announced with elevated uranium values of 12 parts per million 
(“ppm”) being intersected in the north and the eastern-most drill hole in the south intersecting 140 ppm of uranium. For full results of 
the winter-spring drill program, reference should be made to the Company’s press release of August 5, 2009. 
 
In Q110, the Company paid $51,628 to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada on behalf of the Black Lake Denesuline First Nations. 
These  payments  will  be  offset  against  future  options  payments.  During  the  remainder  of  fiscal  2010,  only  limited  activity  was 
undertaken on the project as the Company was interpreting the drilling data. 
 
In fiscal 2010, drilling costs comprised 44% of the total exploration costs at Black Lake from the 1,272 metre drill program completed 
in the first quarter. 
 
2.2.6  Collins Bay Extension Project – Optioned from Bayswater Uranium 
In  July  2009,  the  Company  executed  an  option  agreement  with  Bayswater  Uranium  Corporation  to  commence  exploration  on  the 
Collins  Bay  Extension  uranium  project  (“CBX”),  which  is  directly  adjacent  to,  and  following  the  North-East  strike  of  the  past-
producing uranium mines at Rabbit Lake and Collins Bay, and the current producing uranium mine at Eagle Point in Saskatchewan. 
CBX contains a significant number of exploration targets within the Snowbird and Fife Island areas. Under the terms of the option 
agreement, CanAlaska shall act as the exploration operator and may earn a 51% participating interest in the project by undertaking a 
minimum  of  $4.0  million  in  exploration  expenditures  within  5  years,  and  issuing  a  total  of  500,000  (100,000  issued)  shares  to 
Bayswater over the same period. The Company may increase its participating interest to a 70% level by successfully undertaking a 
further $2.0 million in exploration expenditures over a further period of 3 years.

In September 2009, field crews mapped and sampled mineralization in the Fife Island area north of the Eagle Point mine, and along 
the same geological trend in preparation for the winter drill program. 
 
In Q410, CanAlaska carried out a two drill program on the property. One program concentrated on the vein mineralization on the 
northern part of Fife Island. This drilling intersected uranium mineralization in four drill holes. The second program southwest of Blue 
Island was identified from the VTEM airborne geophysical survey completed in 2007.  In house inversion of the data defined two 
large zones (700 metres by 500 metres) of very high conductivity in basement rocks, located below conductive lake sediments, and 
straddling an east-west magnetic structural trend.  Detailed gravity surveys across the target in January 2010 have confirmed a large 
gravity low associated with each of the deeper conductive zones.  The drill program provided evidence of a large geological event 
with uranium, breccias and structured displacement. 
 
In fiscal 2010, drilling costs comprised 31% of the total exploration costs at Collins Bay Extension from the 1,133 metre drill program 
completed in the fourth quarter. 
 
2.2.7  Grease River Project, Saskatchewan - Optioned to Westcan Uranium 
The Grease River project covers approximately 70,000 hectares in three separate claim blocks that extend from Bulyea River, north of 
Fond Du Lac, to Marytnuik Lake, north of Stony Rapids, and covers four geological domains. 
 
On April 10, 2007, the Company granted an option to Yellowcake plc, and subsequently consented to the introduction of Uranium 
Prospects plc to earn a 60% interest in the project. Uranium Prospects plc could have exercised its option to earn a 60% interest in the 
project by making payments, issuing shares, and making exploration expenditures of $5 million. This option was terminated in June 
2009.

In  Q109,  the  Company  undertook  detailed  prospecting  and  mapping  on  the  Grease  River  property.  The  Company  had  recorded 
accruals for the reimbursement of costs from Uranium Prospects. This receivable was reversed and written-off in Q409, as no cash had 
been received. The option was subsequently terminated in June 2009. Only minimal activity occurred on the property during the fiscal 
year ended April 30, 2010. 
 
In August 2010, the Company executed an option agreement with Westcan Uranium Ltd. (“Westcan”) (formerly International Arimex 
Resources Inc.) to commence exploration of the Grease River project. Under the terms of the option agreement, Westcan may earn a 
50% interest in the property by issuing up to 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of Westcan and making exploration expenditures 
of $4,500,000 by December 2013.  The Company will act as the operator for the exploration project and will earn a management fee 
of 10% of the exploration expenditures incurred. 
 
2.2.8  Cree West Project, Saskatchewan – Optioned to Westcan Uranium 
The  Cree  West  project  comprises  a  100%  interest  in  4  mineral  claims  (approximately  13,000  hectares)  located  70  kilometres 
northwest of the Key Lake uranium mine and between 25 and 57 kilometres north of the south rim of the Athabasca Basin. On April 
24, 2006, the Company granted to Westcan an option to earn up to a 75% interest in the Cree West project. Westcan can earn a 50% 
interest in the property by making cash payments of $150,000 (received), issuing 600,000 shares (received) and making $3.6 million 
of  exploration  expenditures.  Westcan  may  elect  to  acquire  an  additional  10%  interest  by  expending  an  additional  $4  million  on

exploration within 2 years of vesting its 50% interest. Westcan may elect to acquire a further 15% ownership, for a total of 75%, by 
completing a feasibility study within 2 years, issuing to the Company 400,000 additional common shares, and expending a minimum 
of $1 million on the project. 
 
The Company will act as the operator of the project until Westcan has a vested 60% interest. Upon attaining commercial production, 
the Company will receive a 3% net smelter royalty. As of April 30, 2010, Westcan had contributed $0.8 million towards exploration 
expenditures. The Company has granted an extension to Westcan in respect of its exploration commitments under the agreement and 
expects Westcan to continue the exploration of the project in 2010.

An airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey was carried out in 2006, and ground AMT surveys were carried out in early winter 
2007 and 2008. Drill testing has been recommended to determine the cause of the anomalous geophysical targets. 
 
2.2.9  Key Lake Project, Saskatchewan – Optioned to Westcan Uranium  
The Key Lake project comprises four mineral claims in three separate blocks totalling approximately 6,000 hectares located within 15 
kilometres of the formerly producing Key Lake uranium mine. On March 2, 2006, the Company optioned to Westcan up to a 75% 
interest in the Key Lake project. Westcan may, at its option, earn a 50% interest in the property by making cash payments of $150,000 
(received), issuing 300,000 shares (received), and making exploration expenditures of $2 million. Westcan may elect to acquire an 
additional 10% interest by expending an additional $2 million on exploration, and may elect to acquire a further 15% ownership, for a 
total  of  75%,  by  completing  a  feasibility  study  within  2  years,  issuing  to  the  Company  200,000  additional  common  shares,  and 
expending a minimum of $500,000 per year on the Project. The Company will act as the operator of the project until Westcan has a 
vested 60 % interest. Upon commercial production, the Company will receive a 3% net smelter royalty. As of April 30, 2010, Westcan 
had  contributed  $  0.9  million  towards  exploration  expenditures.  The  Company  granted  an  extension  to  Westcan  in  respect  of  its 
exploration commitments under the agreement and expects Westcan to continue exploration of the project in 2010.

In winter 2007, three holes costing $150,868 were drilled on a conductor on one claim, providing one intersection of minor uranium 
mineralization (0.058% U3O8 over 1 metre), but with strong alteration and faulting. In winter 2008, an additional target was drill-
tested on another claim, returning highly-anomalous rare earths mineralization.  
 
2.2.10  Helmer Project, Saskatchewan 
The Helmer Project comprises a contiguous block of 19 mineral claims totalling approximately 57,000 hectares in the central part of 
the north rim of the Athabasca Basin west and south of Fond Du Lac, and 50 kilometres southeast of Uranium City. 
 
In Q410, the Company drill tested a group of targets along the Grease River fault, which were modeled from airborne EM and gravity 
surveys. The target area is just south of CanAlaska’s Fond Du Lac project, and is located on the eastern part of the Helmer project.  
Previous airborne surveys provided strong evidence of conductive targets in the lower levels of the Athabasca sandstone, immediately 
above a strong zone of dislocation in the Grease River fault system.  The drilling was completed in March 2010, and the Company is 
reviewing results and interpreting the drill data. 
 
In fiscal 2010, drilling costs comprised 29% and camp cost & operations comprised 32% of the total exploration costs at Helmer.

Drilling began in winter 2007. These holes confirmed the existence of uranium mineralizing events over a considerable area of the 
unconformity in this area and at Grouse Island, 3.5 kilometres to the south-east. In early winter 2008, the Company completed five 
more drill holes at three new targets near Johnston Island. Two holes targeted uranium mineralization in basement intrusive rocks. 
Holes near Johnston Island focused on known mineralized zones. The third target south of Johnston Island defined a very prominent 
geophysical target that has now been shown as related to a large local uplift in the unconformity. Additional drilling is currently being 
considered.

2.2.12  NE Wollaston Project, Manitoba 
NE Wollaston comprises mineral claims of approximately 144,000 hectares which straddle the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border and lie 
between 90 and 170 kilometres northeast along the Wollaston trend of basement formations hosting uranium deposits, which include 
Rabbit Lake, Collins Bay and Eagle Point Uranium Mines. The geological targets across the NE Wollaston project match the styles of 
mineralization reported from basement-hosted mineral deposits further south in the Athabasca Basin. There is clear observation of late 
replacement pitchblende mineralization in vein zones, fractures, and as disseminations in host rocks. There is also evidence of more-
disseminated  mineralization  across  stratigraphic  horizons,  and  multitudes  of  pegmatitic  intrusive  events,  many  of  them  containing 
primary uranium mineralization, or with brecciation and later uranium mineralization. 
 
In  2004,  CanAlaska  acquired  the  mineral  leases  in  the  area  and  began  systematic  prospecting  and  lake  sediment  sampling.  With 
encouraging results, this continued in 2006 with airborne surveys, systematic prospecting, geochemical and geophysical surveys. The 
highlight was the discovery of extensive uranium-mineralized belts, either within, or cutting across all rock types in the area. The 
Company aborted drill testing of initial targets in early 2007 due to drill contractor difficulties. However, further detailed work was 
carried out in the summer of 2007 on each of the current targets as well as on additional preliminary targets for a total cost of $1.6 
million.  In  early  2008,  the  Company  released  details  of  1,620  higher-grade  uranium  samples,  taken  from  47  separate  zones  with 
extensive boulder dispersion trains and surface uranium mineralization.

Further exploration on the project awaited the conclusion of land use consultations between the Province of Manitoba and local First 
Nations communities and on March 13, 2010, the Manitoba Government issued exploration permits for ground work and drilling on 
the property. Community consultation is ongoing. 
 
2.2.13  McTavish Project, Saskatchewan 
The McTavish project covers 16,000 hectares. The claims are centered approximately 50 kilometres southeast of the McArthur River 
mine and 40 kilometres northwest of the Key Lake mine, with the southeastern claim located approximately 10 kilometres due west of 
Cameco Corp.’s Millennium uranium deposit. Work-to-date includes summer 2006 ground-based sampling/lake sediment analysis, 
and a Geotech VTEM airborne survey. The claims covering the main VTEM conductive targets were re-staked in 2007.

In August 2009, the Company announced that it had entered into an option agreement with Kodiak Exploration Limited ("Kodiak") on 
the McTavish project. Kodiak has been granted an option to acquire up to a 70% interest in the project. In order to earn an initial 50% 
interest,  Kodiak  must  complete  $4.0  million  in  exploration  and  issue  1,000,000  Kodiak  shares  to  CanAlaska  (100,000  issued)  as 
follows: 100,000 on or before the date of acceptance of the transaction by the TSX Venture Exchange and then, on or before each 
anniversary  date  thereafter,  make  annual  work  expenditures  and  issue  shares  respectively  of:  first  year  –  $0.6  million  and  50,000 
shares; second year – $0.8 million and 50,000 shares; third year – $1.2 million and 50,000 shares; fourth year – $1.4 million and 
50,000 shares, and; fifth year – $nil and the remaining balance of 700,000 shares. 
 
Kodiak may earn a further 10% interest in the project (60% total), by: (1) expending a further $3 million, over an additional three year 
period; (2) issuing an additional 550,000 Kodiak shares, and; (3) producing a 43-101 compliant resource estimate containing at least 
35 million pounds of U3O8 in the measured and indicated categories. By defining a resource of 50 million pounds or more of U3O8 
during the same period, Kodiak's interest may increase to 70%.  
 
Kodiak  carried  out  ZTEM  airborne  geophysical  surveys  across  the  property  in  September  2009  and  carried  out  a  drill  program 
consisting of two holes in March and April 2010. 
 
The negative option payment amount of $67,000 in Q210 represents the fair value of the 100,000 Kodiak common shares received as 
part of our option agreement.

For analysis and discussion of the movement in cash and cash equivalents reference should be made to Section 5 of this MD&A. 
Included within cash and cash equivalents are $2.0 million in funds from the CKU Partnership which are dedicated to the Cree East 
project. Reference should be made to note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further details.  
 
Included within accounts receivable and prepaids is approximately $1.0 million in GST refunds. The increase from April 30, 2009 is 
due primarily to an increase in the GST receivable account. 
 
During the fourth quarter (April 2010), the Company recorded a permanent impairment on a number of its investments and wrote the 
balances  down  to  their  markets  values  due  to  the  significant  decline  in  market  value  that  was  viewed  as  other  than  a  temporary 
impairment. 
 
The increase in accounts payable can be attributed to the drill program and geophysics program that was undertaken in the fourth 
quarter that remained unpaid at April 30, 2010.

Table 19: ($000’s) 
Other Assets and Liabilities 
Property and equipment 
Mineral property interests (section 2.2) 
Reclamation bonds 
Future income tax liability 
Non-controlling interest 
 
Reclamation bonds increased principally as a result of additional bonds being posted (Key Lake, Moon, Helmer, Arnold and Carswell 
claims) with the Saskatchewan Government.  
 
Future income tax liability and future income recovery have been restated for the year ended April 30, 2009 and 2008 to reflect the 
income tax losses and other carry forward balances as reported by the Company on its formal Canadian income tax filings and as 
ultimately assessed by Canada Revenue Agency.  The differences between the previously reported amounts and the restated amounts 
are due to changes in taxation estimates, the expiration of Canadian non-capital loss balances in 2009 and 2008 and accounting for the 
income tax effect of flow-through shares issued in 2009. 
 
The non-controlling interest represents the total funding from our Korean partners for their contributions towards the partnership. It 
also includes $0.6 million that was contributed for Intellectual Property during the formation of the Partnership that was purchased 
from CanAlaska. During the year, the Koreans have committed $5.0 million in funding for the Cree East project.

As the Company is in a loss position the basic loss per share and diluted loss per share are equivalent and therefore only loss per share 
is presented in the above table. 
 
Net indirect exploration expenses are the costs associated with running CanAlaska’s field operation office in Saskatoon, SK and our 
warehouse  in  La  Ronge,  SK  and  payroll  and  related  costs  of  our  exploration  teams  where  they  are  not  directly  chargeable  to  an 
exploration project. Prior to Q409, these costs had been deferred on the balance sheet, and management fees and rental income were 
applied against them, thus reducing these deferred costs. For better clarity on the Company’s actual expenditures and to reflect the

CASHFLOW REVIEW
indirect  nature  of  these  costs,  the  Company  changed  its  accounting  disclosure  regarding  these  accounts  in  Q409.  Therefore,  the 
charges in the Q409 represent these expenses for the full fiscal year rather than simply for the quarter then ended. The negative net 
indirect exploration expense in Q410 is a result of a reallocation of exploration costs which were directly allocated to specific projects.  
 
In Q410, the Company recorded property write-downs on two of its projects (Ford Lake and Camsell) where it chose not to renew its 
permits. No mineral property write downs occurred in Q110, Q210, or Q310. 
 
Camp and other miscellaneous exploration equipment owned by the Company is maintained at our La Ronge warehouse. Equipment 
rental  income  is  comprised  of  income  (cost  recapture)  from  charging  exploration  projects  for  the  rental  of  this  equipment.  The 
equipment rental income in Q410 is consistent with the winter drilling program.  
 
Net option payments in Q110 is an expense as a result of the Company writing-off the option payments from District Gold on the 
Rainbow Hill property in Alaska, USA. The Company had previously accrued for these receivables. 
 
Consulting, labour, and professional fees were higher in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.  The increase was primarily attributed to 
increases in salaried expenses, consulting service and audit related fees.   
 
Other corporate costs are up in Q210 primarily as a result of a $54,000 provision for doubtful accounts. The remaining difference is 
consistent with prior period results. 
 
5. 
 
As of April 30, 2010, the Company had $8.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $8.5 million and as of April 
30, 2009, the Company had $6.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $6.4 million. 
 
5.1 
The Company’s operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1.5 million and $1.6 million for the fiscal years ended April 30, 
2010 and 2009 respectively which is consistent with the net loss for the periods. 
 
5.2 
Financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of $10.9 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2010. During the fiscal year ended 
2010, the Company received net proceeds of $5.9 million from flow-through and ordinary unit financings completed between August 
and December 2009 and cash contributions of $5 million from our Korean joint venture partners.   
 
5.3 
Investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $7.1 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2010 as the Company continued to 
invest in the exploration of its Athabasca Basin properties.   
 
6. 
CanAlaska remains focused on its corporate mission of exploration for the discovery of one or more significant uranium deposits in 
the Athabasca region of Northern Saskatchewan, and believes that it has the projects, strategic partners, people & knowledge base, 
corporate treasury and fund raising ability to deliver on this mission. 
 
Our  winter  drill  programs  at  the  Cree  East  and  West  McArthur  projects  have  further  defined  our  target  zones  and  identified  new 
targets for future drill programs. At Cree East, our Korean Partners have approved a $3.58 million summer drill program. The twenty 
drill holes program, comprising approximately 9,000 metres, will be split between two target zones on the property. As at April 30, 
2010, our Korean partners have contributed $12.6 million of their 19.0 million funding commitment. 
 
At the West McArthur project, exploration is being carried out under a 50/50 joint venture with MC Resources Canada, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation, and CanAlaska. In February 2010, after the start of the winter season, MCRC earned a 
50% interest in the Project by completing the Cdn$11 million investment specified under the Project's option agreement. Over the next 
five years, the joint venture is planning to expend between Cdn$3.5-$4.2 million annually to progressively test the 7 targets which 
exist on the property.

Related Party Transactions
At the Collins Bay Extension project, results from the Company’s winter drill program provided strong exploration targets for the 
2011 winter season. The Company’s summer exploration program will consist of seismic profiling of the large breccia targets on the 
property.  
 
At the Fond Du Lac project, the Company will be continuing to test for the extension of the higher grade uranium mineralization 
intersected in the August 2009 drill program (40.2 metres @0.32% U3O8).   
 
CanAlaska is also actively marketing other projects to potential partners.

The  Company  had  an  office  lease  agreement  from  the  former  Chairman  of  the  Company,  this  lease  agreement  was  terminated  in 
March 2009. 
 
The Company had previously paid consulting fees to the Vice-President Corporate Development and a former Corporate Secretary.  
Consulting fees are no longer charged by the Vice-President Corporate Development as his is now a salaried employee. 
 
The Vice-President Exploration currently provides his services through a consulting company.  
 
Two  former  Chief  Financial  Officers  had  billed  their  time  through  consulting  companies  and  the  current  Chief  Financial  Officer 
provides his service through a consulting company as well and is disclosed above. 
 
All transactions are recorded at the amounts agreed upon by the two parties. 
 
Effective  February  2005,  each  outside  director  is  entitled  to  receive  $500  per  month,  $500  per  directors  meeting  and  $500  per 
committee meeting. During the year, $70,980 (2009: $71,572) has been paid/accrued to directors. At year end, $8,465 (2009: $10,326) 
is owing to directors.  This is due on demand and non-interest bearing. 
 
7.2 
Management believes that the funds on hand at April 30, 2010 are sufficient to meet corporate, administrative, exploration activities 
for the next twelve months given the continuing funding from our joint venture partners. Should management be successful in its 
coming exploration programs it may either need to dilute its ownership in its properties or secure additional financing to continue to 
advance the development of its projects.

Critical Accounting Estimates
7.3 
 
7.3.1  Mining Properties and Deferred Exploration Expenditures 
Mining property acquisition costs and related direct exploration and development expenditures, net of recoveries, are deferred until the 
properties are placed into production. These net costs will be amortized against income using the unit-of-production method based on 
estimated recoverable reserves if the properties are brought into commercial production, or written off if the properties are abandoned, 
or sold, or the carrying value is determined to be in excess of possible recoverable amounts. The recoverability of amounts shown for 
mining  properties  and  deferred  exploration  expenditures  is  dependent  upon  the  discovery  of  economically  recoverable  reserves, 
confirmation  of  the  Company’s  interest  in  the  underlying  claims,  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  obtain  financing  to  complete 
development of the properties, and on profitability of future production or proceeds from the disposition of the properties. 
 
Mineral properties are reviewed for possible impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When events or changes in circumstances suggest possible impairment, estimated 
future net cash flows for a mine or development project are calculated using estimated future prices, mineral resources and operating 
and capital costs on an undiscounted basis. When estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the asset 
is considered impaired. Reductions in carrying values are recorded to the extent the book values exceed the fair values of the mining 
properties. Recoverable value is estimated based upon current exploration results and upon management’s assessment of the future 
probability of positive cash flows from the property or from the sale of the property. 
 
7.3.2 
The Company has in effect a Stock Option Plan. Stock options awarded are accounted for using the fair value-based method. Fair 
value  is  calculated  using  the  Black  Scholes  model  with  the  assumptions  described  in  the  notes  to  the  financial  statements.  These 
assumptions are estimated by management based on available information and may be subject to change. 
 
7.4 
The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (“DCP”) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information 
is communicated to senior management, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management has concluded, and the 
audit committee has agreed that taking into account the present stage of the Company's development, the Company does not have 
sufficient size and scale to warrant the hiring of additional staff to address all the requirements of internal controls over financial 
reporting.  The  Chief  Financial  Officer  is  responsible  for  preparing,  authorizing,  and  reviewing  information  that  is  key  to  the 
preparation of financial reports. He is also responsible for preparing and reviewing the resulting financial reports. This weakness has 
the potential to result in material misstatements in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Forward Looking Statements
Recently Adopted Standards and Future Accounting Changes
7.5 
Certain  statements  included  in  this  “MD&A”  constitute  forward-looking  statements,  including  those  identified  by  the  expressions 
“anticipate”, “believe”, “plan”, “estimate”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “should” and similar expressions to the extent they relate to the 
Company or its management. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts but reflect current expectations regarding future 
results  or  events.  This  MD&A  contains  forward-looking  statements.  These  forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  current 
expectations and various estimates, factors and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.  
 
Information  concerning  the  interpretation  of  drill  results  also  may  be  considered  forward-looking  statements,  as  such  information 
constitutes a prediction of what mineralization might be found to be present if and when a project is actually developed. The estimates, 
risks and uncertainties described in this MD&A are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent 
the Company’s estimates only as of the date of this MD&A and should not be relied upon as representing the Company’s estimates as 
of  any  subsequent  date.  The  material  factors  and  assumptions  that  were  applied  in  making  the  forward-looking  statements  in  this 
MD&A include: (a) execution of the Company’s existing plans or exploration programs for each of its properties, either of which may 
change due to changes in the views of the Company, or if new information arises which makes it prudent to change such plans or 
programs;  and  (b)  the  accuracy  of  current  interpretation  of  drill  and  other  exploration  results,  since  new  information  or  new 
interpretation of existing information may result in changes in the Company’s expectations. Readers should not place undue reliance 
on the Company’s forward-looking statements, as the Company’s actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially 
from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements if known or unknown 
risks, uncertainties or other factors affect the Company’s business, or if the Company’s estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate. 
Therefore, the Company cannot provide any assurance that forward-looking statements will materialize. 
 
7.6 
There were no changes in significant accounting policies of the Company for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2010, except as noted 
below and noted in the Company’s audited financial statements. 
 
Section 3064 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
Effective May 1, 2009, the Company adopted the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants’ (“CICA”) new Handbook Section 
3064  “Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets”.  This  Section  replaced  Section  3062  “Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets”  and  Section  3450 
“Research and Development Costs”, and establishes revised standards for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure 
of goodwill and intangible assets. On adoption of this new Standard, EIC 27 “Revenues and Expenditures during the Pre-operating 
Period”  was  withdrawn,  and  so  various  pre-production  and  start-up  costs  are  required  to  be  expensed  as  incurred.  No  material 
adjustments were required upon adoption of this new Standard. 
 
EIC – 173 – Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
In January 2009, the CICA issued Emerging Issues Committee (“EIC”) Abstract 173 – Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial 
Assets  and  Financial  Liabilities  (“EIC-173”).  EIC-173  provides  guidance  on how  to  take  into  account  credit  risk  of  an  entity  and 
counterparty when determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including derivative instruments.  EIC-173 is 
applicable  for  the  Company’s  interim  and  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  for  its  fiscal  year  ending  April  30,  2010,  with 
retroactive  application.    The  adoption  of  EIC-173  did  not  result  in  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial 
statements. 
 
EIC – 174 - Mining Exploration Costs 
On  March  27,  2009,  the  Emerging  Issues  Committee  issued  EIC-174  “Mining  Exploration  Costs”.  The  EIC  provides  additional 
guidance in light of the potential adverse impact of the current economic and financial turmoil on the carrying value of the deferred 
exploration costs. The EIC is effective for financial statements issued on or after the date of the date of the EIC. This EIC did not have 
a material impact on the Company's financial statements as it had previously recognized a significant impairment charge with respect 
to its exploration projects in the prior financial statements.

Section 3862, Financial Instruments - Disclosures  
In June 2009, the CICA amended Section 3862, Financial Instruments - Disclosures (“Section 3862”), to include additional disclosure 
requirements about fair value measurement for financial instruments and liquidity risk disclosures. These amendments require a three-
level hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurements. The amendments to Section 
3862 apply for annual financial statements relating to fiscal years ended after September 30, 2009. The three levels of fair value 
hierarchy under Section 3862 are:
o  Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
o  Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly; and 
o  Level 3 - Inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data. 
The effects of adopting the new section are presented in note 20 to the financial statements. 
 
Future Accounting Changes 
 
Section 1582 – Business Combinations, Section 1601 – Consolidated Financial Statements and Section 1602 – Non-Controlling 
Interests 
In January 2009, the CICA issued new accounting standards, Handbook Section 1582 “Business Combinations”, Handbook Section 
1602  “Non-Controlling  Interests”,  and  Handbook  Section  1601  “Consolidated  Financial  Statements”,  which  are  based  on  the 
International Accounting Standards Board’s (“IASB”) International Financial Reporting Standard 3, “Business Combinations”. The 
new standards replace the existing guidance on business combinations and consolidated financial statements. The objective of the new 
standards is to harmonize Canadian accounting for business combinations with the international and U.S. accounting standards. The 
new standards are to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of 
the first annual reporting period beginning on or after January 1, 2011, with earlier application permitted. Assets and liabilities that 
arose from business combinations whose acquisition dates preceded the application of the new standards shall not be adjusted upon 
application of these new standards. Section 1602 should be applied retrospectively except for certain items. The Company has not 
adopted  these  new  standards  but  continues  to  evaluate  the  attributes  and  effect  of  early  adoption  of  these  standards  if  a  business 
combination were to occur. 
 
Section 3855 – Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement 
On  April  29,  2009,  the  CICA  amended  Section  3855,  “Financial  Instruments  –  Recognition  and  Measurement”,  adding/amending 
paragraphs regarding the application of effective interest method to previously impaired financial assets and embedded prepayment 
options.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  interim  and  annual  financial  statements  relating  to  fiscal  years  beginning  on  or  after 
January 1, 2011 with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s 
financial statements. 
 
IFRS Assessment and Conversion Plan 
In February 2008, the CICA announced that Canadian generally accepted accounting principles for publicly accountable enterprises will 
be replaced by International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. Companies 
will be required to provide IFRS comparative information for the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, the conversion from Canadian GAAP 
to  IFRS  will  be  applicable  to  the  Company’s  reporting  for  the  first  quarter  of  2012  year  end  for  which  the  current  and  comparative 
information will be prepared under IFRS. The Company is required to apply all of those IFRS standards which are effective for fiscal year 
ending April 30, 2012 and apply them to its opening May 1, 2010 balance sheet. 
 
The Company’s IFRS implementation project consists of three primary phases which will be completed by a combination of in-house 
resources and external consultants.
•
•
•
Initial diagnostic phase (“Phase I”) – Involves preparing a preliminary impact assessment to identify key areas that may be 
impacted by the transition to IFRS. Each potential impact identified during this phase is ranked as having a high, moderate or 
low impact on our financial reporting and the overall difficulty of the conversion effort. 
Impact analysis, evaluation and solution development phase (“Phase II”) – Involves the selection of IFRS accounting policies 
by senior management and the review by the audit committee, the quantification of the impact of changes on our existing 
accounting policies on the opening IFRS balance sheet and the development of draft IFRS financial statements. 
Implementation and review phase (“Phase III”) – Involves training key finance and other personnel and implementation of 
the  required  changes  to  our  information  systems  and  business  policies  and  procedures.  It  will  enable  the  Corporation  to

collect the financial information necessary to prepare IFRS financial statements and obtain audit committee approval of IFRS 
financial statements.
Transitional Impact on Financial statement presentation and classification
IFRS 1 Transitional policy choices and exceptions for retrospective application
Financial reporting expertise and communication to stakeholders 
The  Company’s  senior  finance  staff  has  obtained  sufficient  knowledge  of  IFRS  to  implement  conversion  without  any  external 
assistance.  The  Company  has  also  provided  Audit  Committee  members  with  detailed  project  scoping,  timelines  and  deliverables.  
Based  on  matters  brought  to  their  attention  the  Audit  Committee  members  will  review  the  Audit  Committee  Charter  and  make 
changes to reflect the requirements for IFRS financial expertise if deemed to be necessary. The Audit Committee will continue to 
receive periodic presentations and project status updates from management. 
 
The Company has completed the preliminary diagnostic phase and will continue to update its disclosures throughout 2010 to reflect 
specific actions taken to facilitate adoption of IFRS effective May 1, 2011. The Company will also continue to review and update its 
preliminary  conclusions  from  the  diagnostic  phase  during  2010  and  2011  as  new  facts  emerge.  The  differences  that  have  been 
identified in the diagnostic phase are summarized below. 
 
a) 
The Company’s financial statements will have a different format upon transition to IFRS.  
 
The  components  of  a  complete  set  of  IFRS  financial  statements  are:  statement  of  financial  position  (balance  sheet),  statement  of 
comprehensive  income,  statement  of  changes  in  equity,  statement  of  cash  flows,  and  notes  including  accounting  policies.  Income 
statement will be presented as a component of the statement of comprehensive income. Balance sheet may be presented in ascending 
or descending order of liquidity. Income statement is classified by each major functional area – marketing, distribution, etc.  
 
The Company will reformat the financial statements in compliance with IAS 1. 
 
b) 
IFRS 1 contains the following policy choices with respect to first-time adoption that are applicable to the Company. 
 
Property, plant & equipment: 
IFRS 1 provides a choice between measuring property, plant and equipment at its fair value at the date of transition and using those 
amounts as deemed cost or using the historical cost basis under Canadian GAAP.   
 
The Company will elect to use the historical cost carrying values as determined under Canadian GAAP as for transitional purposes. 
 
c) 
 
Mineral resource properties and deferred exploration costs 
Upon  adoption  of  IFRS  the  Company  will  have  a  choice  between  retaining  its  existing  policy  of  capitalizing  all  pre  feasibility 
evaluation and exploration (“E&E”) expenditures and electing to change its policy retrospectively to expense all pre feasibility E&E 
costs.  
 
The Company will make a final determination of its policy in this area during Phase II.  
 
Investment in Rise and Shine Joint Venture  
The Company accounts for its interests in the joint venture using the proportionate consolidation method.  
 
In terms of IFRS, IAS 31 requires either the equity method or the proportionate consolidation method to be applied to interests in 
jointly controlled entities.  
 
In terms of Canadian GAAP, section 3055 of the CICA Handbook requires the proportionate consolidation method. It does not permit 
the equity method for interests in joint ventures.  
 
The Company will make a final determination of its policy in this area during Phase II.
Mandatorily applicable standards with retrospective application (i.e., not specifically exempt under IFRS 1)
www.canalaska.com
CanAlaska Uranium Ltd. – MD&A April 30, 2010
Page 28 of 33
Property, plant and equipment - cost 
In terms of IFRS, IAS 16 contains more extensive guidance with respect to components within PP&E.  When an item of property, 
plant  and  equipment  comprises  individual  components  for  which  different  depreciation  methods  or  rates  are  appropriate,  each 
component is accounted for separately (component accounting). 
 
In terms of Canadian GAAP, section 3061 essentially contains similar guidance but is less extensive.  
 
The Company does not expect any transitional impact.  
 
Future income taxes recognized in connection with Flow-through shares 
In terms of IFRS, there is no specific standard under IFRS that directly addresses flow-through shares.  
 
In Terms of Canadian GAAP, The Company reduces the net proceeds of the flow through share issuance by the future tax liability of 
the Company resulting from the renunciation of the exploration and development expenditures in favour of the flow though share 
subscribers.  
 
During Phase II the Company will review (i) the general principles in IAS 12, (ii) additional guidance from the CICA Accounting 
Standards Board and (iii) the FASB model that has been endorsed by the SEC through the SEC International Practices Task Force in 
determining the adjustments that might be required as at May 1, 2010 and for the annual and interim periods ended April 30, 2011. 
 
Provision for environmental rehabilitation 
In terms of IFRS, IFRS 37 applies to a constructive obligation, where the event creates valid expectations that the entity will discharge 
the obligation, as well as a legal obligation. The amount recognized should be the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the balance sheet date. Present value should be used where the effect of the time value of money is material. The 
discount rate (or rates) utilized should be a pre-tax rate (or rates) that reflect(s) current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability. Provisions should be reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best 
estimate.  
 
In terms of Canadian GAAP, CICA Section 3110 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived 
asset. Such an obligation is to be initially measured at fair value in the period in which the obligation is incurred, unless it cannot be 
reliably measured at that date.  
 
During Phase II the Company will recalculate the ARO liability to determine whether there is a material impact upon transition. The 
Company does not expect a material transitional impact. 
 
Functional currency 
The  Company  uses  the  Canadian  dollar  as  both  its  functional  and  reporting  currency.  IAS  21  contains  a  more  comprehensive 
framework for the determination of functional currency. 
 
During Phase II the Company will review the IAS 21 criteria to determine whether there is a material impact upon transition at May 1, 
2010 or at April 30, 2011 and for the interim periods and the year then ended. At the present time the Company does expect a material 
impact.

Share based compensation 
The Company accounts for all stock-based payments granted to employees and non-employees using the fair value based method as 
per the amendment by the CICA Accounting Standards Boards to the CICA Handbook Section 3870, “Stock-Based Compensation and 
Other Stock-Based Payments” which requires entities to account for employee stock options using the fair value based method. 
 
In terms of IFRS, under IFRS 2, graded vesting awards must be accounted for as though each instalment is a separate award.  IFRS 
does not provide for an election to treat the instruments as a pool and recognize expense on a straight line basis.  
 
In terms of Canadian GAAP, Straight line basis is permissible under Canadian GAAP.  
 
The Company has recognized option expense on a straight line basis as permitted by Canadian GAAP. During Phase II the Company 
will review the IFRS 2 amortization methodology to determine transitional impact. For new graded vesting grants during 2010 the 
Company will calculate the aggregate fair value as though each instalment is a separate award and will amortize the value on a graded 
basis. 
 
Investment in Canada-Korea Uranium Limited Partnership (CKULP) 
Under  GAAP,  the  Company  accounted  for  its  interest  in  CKULP  as  a  variable  interest  entity  with  the  Company  as  the  primary 
beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company consolidated 100% of CKULP and previously reported a non-controlling interest. IFRS does 
not  include  the  concept  of  a  variable  interest  entity.  IFRS  requires  the  Company  to consolidate  entities  including  Special  Purpose 
Entities only where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from 
its activities. On application of IFRS, the Company has determined that it has joint control of CKULP and can elect to use either the 
equity method or proportionate consolidation method to account for its interest.  
 
The Company will make a final determination during Phase II. 
 
Impact on the Company’s systems and processes 
Based on findings from the diagnostic phase of the project the Company does not expect that adoption of International Accounting 
Standards  will  have  a  pervasive  impact  on  its  present  systems  and  processes.  The  Company  expects  to  implement  certain  minor 
changes  to  the  general  ledger  account  descriptions  as  well  as  the  calculation  methodologies  currently  in  use  for  certain  specific 
financial statement areas such as asset impairment, share based compensation etc. As the accounting policies are selected, appropriate 
changes to ensure the integrity of disclosure controls and procedures will be made. For example, any changes in accounting policies 
could result in additional controls or procedures being required to address reporting of first time adoption as well as ongoing IFRS 
reporting requirements. At this point, the Company has not determined its final accounting policy choices. The certifying officers plan 
to complete the design, and initially evaluate the effectiveness of, any significant changes to controls in the third quarter of 2010 to 
prepare for certification under IFRS in 2011. 
 
7.7 
The Company is engaged in the exploration of mineral properties, an inherently risky business. There is no assurance that funds spent 
on  the  exploration  and  development  of  a  mineral  deposit  will  result  in  the  discovery  of  an  economic  ore  body.  Most  exploration 
projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits.  
 
7.7.1  Commodity Prices 
The  profitability  of  the  Company’s  operations  will  be  dependent  upon  the  market  price  of  mineral  commodities.  Mineral  prices 
fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the Company. The prices of mineral commodities have 
fluctuated  widely  in  recent  years.  Current  and  future  price  declines  could  cause  commercial  production  to  be  impracticable.  The 
Company’s future revenues and earnings also could be affected by the prices of other commodities such as fuel and other consumable 
items, although to a lesser extent than by the price of mineral commodities. 
 
7.7.2  Competition 
The mining industry is intensely competitive in all of its phases, and the Company competes with many companies possessing greater 
financial resources and technical facilities than itself with respect to the discovery and acquisition of interests in mineral properties, 
the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and other persons to carry out its mineral exploration activities. Competition in 
the mining industry could adversely affect the Company’s prospects for mineral exploration in the future.
Risk Factors
www.canalaska.com
CanAlaska Uranium Ltd. – MD&A April 30, 2010
Page 30 of 33
Foreign Political Risk
7.7.3 
The  Company’s  material  property  interests  are  currently  located  in  Canada  and  New  Zealand.  An  insignificant  portion  of  the 
Company’s  interests  are  exposed  to  various  degrees  of  political,  economic  and  other  risks  and  uncertainties.  The  Company’s 
operations and investments may be affected by local political and economic developments, including expropriation, nationalization, 
invalidation of government orders, permits or agreements pertaining to property rights, political unrest, labour disputes, limitations on 
repatriation of earnings, limitations on mineral exports, limitations on foreign ownership, inability to obtain or delays in obtaining 
necessary  mining  permits,  opposition  to  mining  from  local,  environmental  or  other  non-governmental  organizations,  government 
participation,  royalties,  duties,  rates  of  exchange,  high  rates  of  inflation,  price  controls,  exchange  controls,  currency  fluctuations, 
taxation and changes in laws, regulations or policies as well as by laws and policies of Canada affecting foreign trade, investment and 
taxation. 
 
7.7.4  Government Laws, Regulation and Permitting 
Mining  and  exploration  activities  of  the  Company  are  subject  to  both  domestic  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations  governing 
prospecting, development, production, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, mine safety, waste disposal, toxic substances, the 
environment and other matters. Although the Company believes that all exploration activities are currently carried out in accordance 
with all applicable rules and regulations, no assurance can be given that new rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing 
rules and regulations will not be applied in a manner which could limit or curtail production or development. Amendments to current 
laws and regulations governing the operations and activities of the Company or more stringent implementation thereof could have a 
substantial adverse impact on the Company. 
 
The operations of the Company will require licenses and permits from various governmental authorities to carry out exploration and 
development at its projects. In Canada, the issuance of governmental licenses and permits are increasingly being influenced by land 
use consultations between the government and local First Nations communities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be 
able to obtain the necessary licences and permits on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. Any failure to comply with permits 
and applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption or closure of operations or material fines, 
penalties or other liabilities. 
 
7.7.5 
Acquisition  of  rights  to  the  mineral  properties  is  a  very  detailed  and  time-consuming  process.  Title  to,  and  the  area  of,  mineral 
properties may be disputed. Although the Company has investigated the title to all of the properties for which it holds concessions or 
other mineral leases or licenses or in respect of which it has a right to earn an interest, the Company cannot give an assurance that title 
to such properties will not be challenged or impugned. 
 
The  Company  has  the right  to  earn  an  increased  economic  interest  in  certain  of  its  properties.  To  earn  this  increased  interest,  the 
Company is required to make certain exploration expenditures and payments of cash and/or Company shares. If the Company fails to 
make these expenditures and payments, the Company may lose its right to such properties and forfeit any funds expended up to such 
time. 
 
7.7.6 
The mineral resource estimates used by the Company are estimates only and no assurance can be given that any particular level of 
recovery of minerals will in fact be realized or that an identified resource will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) 
deposit which can be legally or commercially exploited. In addition, the grade of mineralization ultimately mined may differ from that 
indicated by drilling results and such differences could be material. 
 
7.7.7  Cash Flows and Additional Funding Requirements 
The Company has limited financial resources, no sources of operating cash flows and no assurances that sufficient funding, including 
adequate financing, will be available. If the Company’s exploration programs are successful, additional funds will be required in order 
to  complete  the  development  of  its  projects.  The  sources  of  funds  currently  available  to  the  Company  are  the  sale  of  marketable 
securities, raising of equity capital or the offering of an ownership interest in its projects to a third party. There is no assurance that the 
Company will be successful in raising sufficient funds to conduct further exploration and development of its projects or to fulfill its 
obligations under the terms of any option or joint venture agreements, in which case the Company may have to delay or indefinitely 
postpone further exploration and development, or forfeit its interest in its projects or prospects.

Page 31 of 33
7.7.8  Key Management 
The success of the Company will be largely dependent upon the performance of its key officers, consultants and employees. Locating 
mineral deposits depends on a number of factors, not the least of which is the technical skill of the exploration personnel involved. 
The success of the Company is largely dependent on the performance of its key individuals. Failure to retain key individuals or to 
attract or retain additional key individuals with necessary skills could have a materially adverse impact upon the Company’s success. 
 
7.7.9  Volatility of Share Price 
Market prices for shares of early stage companies are often volatile. Factors such as announcements of mineral discoveries, financial 
results, and other factors could have a significant effect on the price of the Company’s shares and the amount of financing that can be 
raised by the Company. 
 
7.7.10  Foreign Currency Exchange 
A  small  portion  of  the  Company’s  expenses  are  now,  and  are  expected  to  continue  to  be  incurred  in  foreign  currencies.  The 
Company’s business will be subject to risks typical of an international business including, but not limited to, differing tax structures, 
regulations and restrictions and general foreign exchange rate volatility. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar 
and such other currencies may have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations and 
could  result  in  downward  price  pressure  for  the  Company’s  products  or  losses  from  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  The 
Company does not actively hedge against foreign currency fluctuations. 
 
7.7.11  Conflict of Interest 
Some of the Company’s directors and officers are directors and officers of other natural resource or mining-related companies. These 
associations  may  give  rise  from  time  to  time  to  conflicts  of  interest.  As  a  result  of  such  conflict,  the  Company  may  miss  the 
opportunity to participate in certain transactions.

CANALASKA URANIUM LTD.
APPENDIX (F)
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POLICY
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVES 
 
The objective of this corporate governance policy is to set out an effective, transparent system of guidelines 
establishing the accountability for the supervising and managing of the affairs of CanAlaska Uranium Ltd. 
(the “Company”).  These guidelines have been implemented to insure that adequate information is made 
available so that management decisions can be independently monitored and reviewed.  
 
It is management’s belief that through the implementation of these practices, the overall stewardship of the 
Company will be affected in a positive way, by strengthening the effectiveness of its Board of Directors 
and by empowering the independent action of its special committees. 
 
Within the framework of ongoing development and implementation of these policy’s and procedures, the 
Company will realize a more comprehensive system of communicating and reporting which in turn will 
insure a high level of confidence from all of its shareholders and business partners.  
 
 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES 
 
Corporate Governance Committee 
 
A Corporate Governance Committee (CGC) has been established for the Company.  The Committee is to 
consist of the lead director and two independent directors.  The Chairperson will be the lead director.  The 
term for the members of the CGC will be for one year at which time they may be re-nominated. 
 
The duties of the committee are to oversee all key issues relating to the Company’s corporate governance 
including:
Identify suitable corporate governance policies
• 
•  Regulate board organization and other committee structures 
•  Assess potential candidates for nomination to the Board 
•  Review the performance of the Board 
•  Oversee selection and appointment of the CEO 
•  Develop suitable policies for management succession 
•  Specify Board composition and qualifications
Code of Ethics 
 
The CGC shall have the responsibility to develop and maintain a Code of Ethics for the Company to be 
used as principle guidelines of conduct for all of its directors, officers, contractors, consultants, advisors 
and  employees.    The  code  will  be  included  in  the  orientation  of  all  new  employees,  directors,  officers, 
contractors, consultants, advisors and committee members.   
 
These guidelines shall include accountability to adherence to the code and a system for the reporting of 
unethical conduct.  This Code of Ethics will be reviewed and amended by the CGC at a minimum of an 
annual basis.
1
Board Mandate 
 
The CGC will have the responsibility to see that the board adopts a written mandate which outlines and 
acknowledges  the  responsibility  of  the  members.    This  mandate  will  include,  among  other  things, 
establishing a culture of integrity throughout the organization, strategic planning, succession planning, the 
handling of any conflicts of interest and disclosure policies.  This mandate must include a process where 
any breach of the directives of this mandate can effectively be reported and dealt with. 
 
Board Composition 
 
The Board is currently comprised of 6 members.  This is considered to be the optimal size at this time.  The 
Board will reconsider its actual size from time to time. 
 
The Board believes that the majority of its members should be independent.  On an annual basis the Board 
will determine which of its directors is independent based on the rules of applicable securities regulators 
and will publish its determination in the management proxy circular for the Company’s annual meeting of 
shareholders.  
 
Director Expectations     
 
The CGC shall be responsible to develop a comprehensive list of expectations of its directors.  The CGC 
members  have  the  responsibility  to  insure  that  the  existing  directors  have  an  orientation  including  an 
overview of the roll of the board of directors.  Any new incoming directors shall be made familiar with 
these expectations and understand that they must be willing to comply with the duties and responsibilities 
of the directorship.  The directors will receive a copy, read, and be familiar with the Company’s Code of 
Ethics and Disclosure Policy  The CGC will review these guidelines at least on an annual basis for any 
changing requirements of its board. 
 
Advisory Board Guidelines 
 
The CGC has developed set of guidelines for the members of its advisory board.  Each of the Company’s 
advisors  will  receive  a  copy  of  the  guidelines  along  with  a  copy  of  the Code of  Ethics  and Disclosure 
Policy.   The guidelines will be reviewed and amended as required on an annual basis. 
 
Nomination Committee 
 
The CGC will also act as the Company’s Nominating Committee and as such will have the responsibility of 
identifying individuals qualified to become members of the board, or to sit on any of its committees.  The 
CGC will recommend changes in the composition of the board or any of its committees when deficiencies 
have  been  identified,  and  will  carry  out  a  complete  assessment  of  the  performance  of  the  board  on  an 
annual basis. 
 
Compensation Committee 
 
The  Company’s  compensation  committee  is  comprised  of  three  independent  members  of  the  audit 
committee.  This committee must review the compensation of senior management on an annual basis and 
assist in the administration of the Company’s employee stock option plan. 
 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for ensuring that the remuneration and incentive packages of 
Executive Management are fair and suitable to attract, motivate and retain personnel of the right calibre to 
meet  the  organizations  needs.    The  Compensation  Committee  should  establish  a  framework  for  all 
remuneration packages within the Company. 
 
Compensation policies established by the committee should be in line with the Company’s overall strategic 
goals  and  objectives  and  should  be  linked  to  the  achievement  of  these  goals.    The  policies  should  be
2
constructed to avoid creating conflict of interest situations thereby ensuring that the executive management 
and other employees are encouraged to always act in the best interest of the Company. 
 
The committee should consider the issues of compensation differentials within the organization to ensure 
that  there  is  parity  between  the  compensation  of  executives  and  the  value  of  their  contribution  to  the 
organization.  There should be particular consideration given to CEO remuneration levels to ensure that 
performance and reward are linked in accordance with usual practice within that industry, relative values at 
other similar organizations and previous awards given in prior years. 
 
Audit Committee 
 
The CGC has the responsible to see that the Company is in compliance with the requirement to appoint the 
audit  committee  after  each  annual  shareholders  meeting.    The  audit  committee  is  to  be  comprised  of  3 
independent directors. 
 
The  audit  committee  is  among  other  things  charged  with  the  responsibility  of  establishing  auditor 
independence, to access the effectiveness of internal control system and for reviewing and approving the 
annual  financial  statements  of  the  Company  before  they  are  forwarded  for  full board  approval  and then 
distributed to the public.  The audit committee also reviews and approves the interim financial statements 
before they are distributed to the public. 
 
The CGC will review and approve the Audit Committee Charter on an annual basis. 
  
Public Disclosure of Corporate Governance 
 
The Company will disclose on its website the current version of these guidelines, the Code of Ethics, Audit 
Committee Charter, Disclosure Policy and any other policies that are developed in the future.
