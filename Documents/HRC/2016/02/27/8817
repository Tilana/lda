Thirteenth session</b>

<b>Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, 
social and cultural rights, including the right to development 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the independent expert on minority issues, 
Gay McDougall</b>* 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present report provides a summary of activities undertaken by the independent 
expert on minority issues since the submission of her previous annual report. Over the last 
12 months, the independent expert has undertaken two official country missions, to 
Kazakhstan and to Canada, to consult on minority issues and consider national legislation, 
policy and practice relating to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert has conducted extensive consultations in regard to all 
elements of her mandate. She has attended expert seminars and conferences, convened 
consultations, held bilateral and multilateral discussions, including with Member States of 
the United Nations, engaged with agencies of the United Nations system and regional 
intergovernmental organizations, and consulted widely with civil society and directly with 
minority communities. She has prioritized gender issues related to her mandate and has 
held dedicated forums for minority women during her country missions. She has conducted 
focused consultations and research on the topic of &#8220;Minorities and Effective Political 
Participation&#8221;, which formed the thematic focus of the second session of the Forum on 
Minority Issues, held on 12 and 13 November 2009. 
</p>
<p> The right to effective participation is a fundamental human right affirmed in a 
number of key international legal instruments. Effective participation underpins the 
realization of all human rights of women and men belonging to ethnic or national, religious 
and linguistic minorities. It is through effective participation that a person expresses and 
protects her or his identity, ensuring the survival and dignity of the minority. The right to 
effective participation recognizes the fact that the participation of minorities in various 
areas of life is essential for the development of a truly inclusive and just society. 
 Effective participation should give minorities a stake in society. Measures taken 
with a view to ensuring the effective participation of minorities contribute to the alleviation

</p>
<p>of tensions, and thus serve the purpose of conflict prevention. Therefore, in addition to 
being a legal obligation, creating conditions for the effective participation of minorities 
should be considered by States to be an integral part of good governance. 
</p>
<p> Effective participation in decision-making processes, particularly those which have 
an impact on minorities, is a precondition for the full and equal enjoyment of the human 
rights of persons belonging to minorities. There are at least two key lessons to be learned. 
The first is the truly essential nature of the right to effective participation: the fulfilment of 
so many other fundamental human rights is both dependent on and a prerequisite for its 
fulfilment. The second is that the effectiveness of the political participation of minorities 
must constantly be measured at all levels of society, in order to ensure that it is real and 
meaningful.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert is pleased to submit to the Human Rights Council her fifth 
annual report pursuant to Council resolution 7/6 of 27 March 2008. This report provides an 
overview of her activities undertaken since her previous report, submitted in January 2009.1 
In addition, it provides a thematic background paper on &#8220;Minorities and Effective Political 
Participation&#8221;, which was the thematic focus of the second session of the Forum on 
Minority Issues, held on 12 and 13 November 2009. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the independent expert on minority issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. The independent expert visited Kazakhstan from 6 to 15 July 2009. The visit 
provided an opportunity to consult widely on legislation, policy and practice relating to 
minority communities and issues relevant to diverse communities. She visited Astana and 
Almaty, and held consultations with senior government representatives with responsibilities 
in the field of minority rights, culture and language, anti-discrimination and equality. She 
also held numerous meetings with ethnic and cultural associations, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), members of minority communities and journalists and hosted a 
forum for minority women. She took particular interest in the Assembly of the People, 
which is a constitutionally recognized institution to provide representation of minority 
communities at the national level. The visit allowed a unique opportunity for dialogue on 
implementation by Kazakhstan of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to 
National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities (1992 Declaration on Minorities). 
The visit report is available as document A/HRC/13/23/Add.1. 
</p>
<p>3. From 13 to 23 October 2009, the independent expert also visited Canada, including 
the provinces of Ontario, British Colombia and Quebec. She focused her visit on issues 
relating to African and Caribbean Canadians, Muslim Canadians and Asian Canadians. 
Persons belonging to minorities generally described Canada as a society open to and 
accepting of cultural, religious and linguistic differences. She noted the leadership of 
Canada in fashioning a State policy of multiculturalism and its impressive constitutional 
and legislative framework to guarantee non-discrimination. The visit report is available as 
document A/HRC/13/23/Add.2. 
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert thanks the Governments of Kazakhstan and of Canada for 
their exemplary cooperation during the preparation and conduct of her visits. In addition, 
she welcomes an invitation to visit Colombia between 1 and 12 February 2010. She looks 
forward to receiving replies to her requests for visits to Bangladesh, Burundi, Cambodia, 
China, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Nepal, Nicaragua, 
Nigeria, Panama, Rwanda, Surinam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey and Viet Nam.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>5. The independent expert receives information from diverse sources regarding 
challenges to implementation of the 1992 Declaration on Minorities and alleged violations 
of the rights of persons belonging to minorities. She consults with Governments by sending

<p>communications in the form of letters of allegation, urgent appeals and thematic 
communications. The independent expert has consequently sent communications in relation 
to numerous situations involving minorities. Communications have been sent jointly with 
other relevant thematic mandate holders and details are reflected in the summary reports of 
cases transmitted to Governments and replies received of those mandates.2 
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert participated in the Durban Review Conference of the World 
Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, 
held in Geneva between 20 and 24 April 2009. She was one of a panel which included the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. St&#233;phane Hessel (a drafter of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights) and Ms. Berthe Kayitesi (a Rwandan genocide survivor), 
who spoke during an opening event entitled &#8220;United against Racism&#8221;. The independent 
expert was a panellist and moderator in side events on social exclusion in South Asia and 
on minorities and policing in multi-ethnic societies. She presented a statement to the 
plenary session regarding the global situation of minorities facing racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and called for greater attention by all 
States to the plight of minorities experiencing inequality, poverty and violence. 
</p>
<p>7. The independent expert also moderated the daily side event entitled &#8220;Voices&#8221; during 
the Durban Review Conference. &#8220;Voices&#8221; provided a platform for 16 women and men from 
diverse geographical and cultural backgrounds to share their experiences and provide a 
human face to issues addressed by the Conference. Participants related personal and 
community experiences of racially motivated violence, exclusion and poverty caused by 
discrimination and racism. 
</p>
<p>8. The independent expert fully supports the outcomes of the Durban Review 
Conference and urges States to fulfil their obligations and commitments in the area of anti-
racism, non-discrimination and equality. She has encouraged and supported new and 
emerging initiatives to combat long-standing and entrenched manifestations of 
discrimination in all regions; for example, the independent expert welcomes and urges 
further discussions on the draft United Nations principles and guidelines for the effective 
elimination of discrimination based on work and descent as an important contribution to the 
global struggle to combat discrimination on the grounds of work and descent which often 
affects members of minority groups.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>9. The independent expert places a high priority on the issues of minority women 
throughout her work. Women belonging to minorities experience unique challenges and 
multiple or intersectional discrimination emanating from their status as members of 
minorities and as women or girls. The independent expert has continued the practice of 
holding dedicated forums for minority women during her country visits in 2009 in order to 
seek their views and concerns and to inform her country-specific and thematic 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>10. The independent expert, in collaboration with Minority Rights Group International, 
held a panel discussion entitled &#8220;Minority Women and Effective Political Participation&#8221;, 
during the second session of the Forum on Minority Issues, in complement to discussions in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 During the period under review, the independent expert joined communications to: Afghanistan, 
</p>
<p>Bulgaria, China, the Dominican Republic, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Serbia, Slovakia and the 
Syrian Arab Republic. Details of these communications are included in the summary reports of cases 
transmitted to Governments of the mandates including: the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression; the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief; the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing; the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders; and the Special Rapporteur on the right to education. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10198 
</p>
<p>the Forum. A panel of experts outlined obstacles to minority women&#8217;s political 
participation in different regions. Discussions focused on overcoming obstacles and how 
minority women, their communities, NGOs, Governments and the United Nations can 
collaborate to ensure that the right of minority women to effective political participation is 
realized. 
</p>
<p>11. The independent expert was a keynote speaker at an expert round table on &#8220;Racism 
in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Region: Old Issues, 
New Challenges&#8221;, held in Vienna on 20 March 2009 to mark the International Day for the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The event aimed to develop recommendations for 
future work and discussed key aspects of the work of the Office for Democratic Institutions 
and Human Rights: developing tools for use by practitioners, and initiating dialogue and 
sharing expertise to better respond to challenges. The independent expert&#8217;s speech focused 
on &#8220;Emerging Trends, New Forms and Manifestations of Racism and Xenophobia.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>12. The independent expert served on the jury of the annual Max van der Stoel Award of 
the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities. The award is presented to a person, 
group or institution for extraordinary and outstanding achievements in improving the 
position of national minorities in OSCE States. In 2009, the award went to the Integration 
and Development Centre for Information and Research from Crimea, Ukraine. 
</p>
<p>13. On 16 April 2009, the independent expert participated in a United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) consultation on challenges facing indigenous and minority 
children. Held in New York, 60 participants aimed to: reach a common understanding about 
the engagement of UNICEF with indigenous and minority communities; identify a policy 
framework that would support and guide UNICEF work and advocacy at country, regional 
and global levels; and discuss ways to strengthen programme guidance and shed light on 
commonalities and differences in programmatic interventions, systematize experience 
sharing/knowledge management within UNICEF and with partners, and contribute to and 
benefit from international mechanisms and other partners.3 
</p>
<p>14. In relation to minorities and minority issues, UNICEF highlights that the 
consultation: led to an increased understanding of international human rights and policy 
frameworks and opportunities and challenges in influencing policies; took note of 
experiences and lessons learned in UNICEF programmes; presented the experience of 
UNICEF in forging partnerships and collaborations; provided perspective and clarity for 
improving the performance of UNICEF; and led to the development of specific 
recommendations and strategies in areas such as education, heath, discrimination, violence, 
participation, and monitoring and data collection, as well as a road map and action 
proposals on indigenous peoples&#8217; and minorities&#8217; issues. 
</p>
<p>15. On 9 December 2009, the independent expert participated in a meeting organized by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights entitled 
&#8220;Enhancing cooperation between regional and international mechanisms for the promotion 
and protection of human rights&#8221; in Washington, D.C. She participated as a panellist in the 
session on &#8220;Coordination on thematic issues between the international and Inter-American 
system of human rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>16. The independent expert delivered a speech at an event organized by the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, New York, on the occasion of Human Rights Day, 
with the theme &#8220;Race, Poverty and Power: The impact of racial discrimination on 
development.&#8221; She underlined that discrimination on the basis of an individual&#8217;s ethnic, 
religious or linguistic identity is a potent causal factor in the disproportionate poverty

<p>experienced by many minority groups and a key impediment preventing minorities from 
benefiting from mainstream poverty reduction strategies. 
</p>
<p>17. On 22 December 2009, the independent expert issued a public statement calling for 
China to permit a comprehensive and independent assessment of the ethnic tensions and 
grievances in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region where ethnic violence erupted in July 
2009 between ethnic Han and ethnic Uyghur communities. The independent expert urged 
the Government to grant her an invitation to visit China and allow her access to the region 
in order to consult with government representatives and members of both communities. The 
independent expert noted that her mandate to promote implementation of the 1992 
Declaration on Minorities would prove valuable to such an assessment and positive efforts 
towards reconciliation of Han and Uyghur communities. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Forum on Minority Issues 
</b></p>
<p>18. In its resolution 6/15 of 28 September 2007, the Human Rights Council established a 
Forum on Minority Issues (&#8220;the Forum&#8221;), inter alia to provide a platform for promoting 
dialogue and cooperation on issues pertaining to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 
minorities, as well as thematic contributions and expertise to the work of the independent 
expert on minority issues. The independent expert is required to guide the work of the 
Forum and prepare its annual meetings. The inaugural session took place on 15 and 16 
December 2008 in Geneva with a thematic focus on &#8220;Minorities and the Right to 
Education&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Follow-up to first session of the Forum on Minority Issues 
</b></p>
<p>19. As part of her ongoing engagement with the treaty bodies in relation to the Forum, 
the independent expert held her first official dialogue with the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women during its forty-fifth session in New York on 
5 August 2009. She was invited to discuss the Forum on Minorities and education and its 
recommendations, as well as preparations for the second annual Forum. The Committee 
welcomed the opportunity for collaboration and agreed that collaboration would continue 
and an expert member would attend the second session. 
</p>
<p>20. The independent expert met officially with the chairs of the treaty bodies during 
their annual meeting in June 2009. She briefed them further on the outcomes and 
recommendations of the Forum and solicited views on how Forum recommendations could 
benefit their work. The independent expert is encouraged that the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination has made reference to the Forum recommendations on 
minorities and the right to education in its consideration of State reports during its 2009 
sessions. 
</p>
<p>21. In September 2009, the independent expert participated in a conference held in Cali, 
Colombia, as a regional follow-up activity to the first session of the Forum, which had 
focused on minorities and the right to education. The conference was organized by the 
Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Justice and Human Rights, in collaboration with 
the Cornell Law School&#8217;s International Human Rights Clinic and the International Human 
Rights Law Clinic of the University of Virginia. In an effort to continue dialogue, remain 
accountable to local communities and promote grass-roots advocacy, the conference 
publicly launched the report entitled &#8220;Right to Education of Afro-descendant and 
Indigenous Communities in the Americas&#8221; that it had previously presented at the Forum<i>.

</p>
<p>without discrimination within the Americas, focusing on Colombia, Guatemala and the 
Dominican Republic. 
</p>
<p>22. The independent expert contributed an article to <i>The State of the World&#8217;s Minorities 
and Indigenous Peoples 2009: Education Special</i>, produced by Minority Rights Group 
International in association with UNICEF. The publication presented the recommendations 
of the Forum and provided case studies, thematic essays on the problems faced by 
minorities with respect to education and an analysis of those issues region-wide. In the 
report, it is highlighted that, globally, 101 million children are out of school: between 50 
and 70 per cent are from minorities or indigenous peoples. The publication is widely 
circulated to all regions and stakeholders including Governments and decision makers, 
NGOs and a targeted audience in the field of minority rights and education. It has also been 
provided to all UNICEF regional and country offices. 
</p>
<p>23. The independent expert led an electronic global discussion organized by UNICEF to 
highlight the issues in the special education edition of the <i>State of the World&#8217;s Minorities 
and Indigenous Peoples 2009 </i>and the Forum on Minority Issues, with a view to 
highlighting the issues around minority girls&#8217; right to education. Specifically, the e-
discussion examined the multiple barriers faced by minority girls in accessing education, 
evaluated the legal and policy responses to the above question, discussed good practices 
from the regional and country level and developed recommendations in line with the 
educational needs and priorities of minority and indigenous girls. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Second session of the Forum on Minority Issues 
</b></p>
<p>24. The second session of the Forum on Minority Issues was held in Geneva on 12 and 
13 November 2009 on the thematic subject of &#8220;Minorities and Effective Political 
Participation.&#8221; The Forum&#8217;s recommendations will be presented to the Human Rights 
Council at its current session (A/HRC/13/25). The Forum was honoured to have as 
Chairperson United States Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Chairperson of the Congressional 
Black Caucus. 
</p>
<p>25. The Forum achieved exceptional participation, which included Member States, 
United Nations mechanisms, bodies and specialized agencies, intergovernmental 
organizations, regional organizations and mechanisms in the field of human rights, 
academics and experts on minority issues, and NGOs. Over 500 individuals were accredited 
to participate, including delegates from over 45 States. Over 100 NGOs were represented. 
The views of participants from minority communities were given a high priority and 
minority political actors from all regions attended. 
</p>
<p>26. Human Rights Council resolution 6/15 invites the independent expert to include in 
her annual report recommendations for thematic subjects to be examined at future sessions 
of the Forum on Minority Issues. To date, the independent expert has received the 
following suggestions: minorities and poverty; access to justice; minorities and the media; 
and the situation of minority children.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Minorities and effective political participation: a survey of 
law and national practices 
</b></p>
<p>27. The following sections of this report summarize the relevant basic international legal 
principles, the preconditions for ensuring effective political participation by minorities, and </p>


<p>GE.10-10198 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>some of the models and conceptual tools that States are using in order to meet their 
international obligations in this domain.4 
</p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>28. The right to effective participation is a fundamental human right, affirmed in a 
number of key international legal instruments. Effective participation underpins the 
realization of all human rights of women and men belonging to ethnic or national, religious 
and linguistic minorities. It is through effective participation that a person expresses and 
protects her or his identity, ensuring the survival and dignity of the minority. The right to 
effective participation recognizes the fact that the participation of minorities in various 
areas of life is essential for the development of a truly inclusive and just society. 
</p><p>29. Effective participation should give minorities a stake in society. Measures taken 
towards ensuring the effective participation of minorities contribute to the alleviation of 
tensions, and thus serve the purpose of conflict prevention. Therefore, in addition to being a 
legal obligation, creating the conditions for the effective participation of minorities should 
be considered by States to be an integral aspect of good governance. 
</p>
<p>30. It is for these reasons that the independent expert on minority issues chose effective 
political participation as the theme of the second session of the Forum on Minority Issues, 
held in Geneva on 12 and 13 November 2009. It should be underscored from the outset that 
the right of minorities to effective political participation does not encompass separatist 
movements. Rather, the intent is to ensure the inclusion of all persons belonging to 
minorities in a just and fair society. This background document summarizes the relevant 
basic international legal principles, the preconditions for ensuring effective political 
participation, and some of the models and conceptual tools that States are using in order to 
meet their international obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The right of minorities to effective participation 
</b></p>
<p>31. The right to effective participation of persons belonging to minorities is far-reaching 
and encompasses many aspects of what constitutes a just society. The right to effective 
participation includes participation in political decision-making at both the local and 
national levels. In addition, persons belonging to minorities should be given the means to 
participate effectively in the cultural, religious, social and economic spheres of their 
societies. 
</p>
<p>32. Public participation is a broad concept. It comprises the right to take part in the 
conduct of public affairs, the right to vote and to be elected, and to have access to public 
services. Moreover, it entails participation in governmental bodies, the judiciary and other 
agencies of the criminal justice system, decentralized and local forms of government, 
consultation mechanisms, as well as through cultural or territorial autonomy arrangements. 
</p>
<p>33. Participation in economic and social life encompasses participation in development 
projects, as well as proper access to employment, land and property, housing, health care, 
social welfare and pensions, among others. Participation in social and cultural life covers 
areas such as proper access to education, media and the protection of cultural identity. In all 
of these areas, effective participation entails meaningful consultation, programmes designed

 This revised thematic paper was previously made available to the second annual session of the Forum

<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10198 
</p>
<p>to address the particular needs and circumstances of minorities, as well as the full and equal 
access to necessary services. 
</p>
<p>34. The human rights principle of non-discrimination is crucial. The exclusion of 
minorities from fully participating in political processes is primarily grounded in 
discrimination. Affirmative measures, time-bound and specifically designed to address 
systematic, historic and institutionalized discrimination, must be employed to enable 
minorities to participate effectively, especially if this would otherwise remain out of their 
reach. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The right to effective participation in international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>35. The right to effective participation, the prohibition of discrimination and special 
measures are firmly rooted in international human rights law. The right of all persons to 
take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, 
as well as to vote and be elected in genuine periodic elections is affirmed in article 25 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This provision is an elaboration of 
article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states: &#8220;Everyone has the 
right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen 
representatives.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>36. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has interpreted the conduct of public 
affairs broadly as the exercise of power in the legislative, executive and administrative 
branches.5 In the view of the Committee, the provision covers all aspects of public 
administration, including the formulation and implementation of policy at international, 
national, regional and local levels. Furthermore, citizens may participate in the conduct of 
public affairs directly or indirectly. Once a mode of participation is established, no 
distinction should be made between citizens as regards their participation on such grounds 
as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, birth or other status, and no unreasonable restrictions should be imposed.6 
</p>
<p>37. The right of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 
minorities to participate effectively in cultural, religious, social, economic and public life is 
further affirmed in the 1992 Declaration on Minorities (&#8220;the Declaration&#8221;).7 
</p><p>38. Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights places explicit 
emphasis on non-discrimination in the exercise of the rights contained therein, as they are 
to be enjoyed &#8220;without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 [of the Covenant]&#8221;. 
Article 2 secures the respect for the rights recognized in the Covenant without distinction of 
any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth or other status. This basic principle of prohibition of discrimination is 
repeated elsewhere in the Covenant and articulated in a number of instruments.8 
</p>
<p>39. Furthermore, all forms of racial discrimination are explicitly prohibited and equality 
in the enjoyment of political rights is guaranteed by the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (art. 5). The Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women creates an obligation on States

and public life of the country (art. 7). 
</p><p>40. The right to effective participation has more recently been strengthened with regard 
to groups strongly at risk of marginalization. Article 41 of the International Convention on 
the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families 
protects the rights of documented and regular migrant workers and their families to 
participate in the public affairs of their State of origin and to be elected through elections of 
that State. Perhaps more importantly, article 42 requires the States of employment to 
facilitate the consultation or participation of migrant workers and members of their families 
in decisions concerning the life and administration of local communities; States of 
employment may, moreover, grant migrant workers the enjoyment of political rights. 
41. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires that States 
ensure that &#8220;persons with disabilities can effectively and fully participate in political and 
public life on an equal basis with others, directly or through freely chosen representatives, 
including the right and opportunity for persons with disabilities to vote and be elected&#8221; (art. 
29). 
42. The right to effective participation is further upheld in provisions within existing 
regional human rights treaties. These include the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights,9 the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of 
Women in Africa,10 the American Convention on Human Rights11 and the Inter-American 
Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women.12 
The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European 
Convention on Human Rights) protects the right to free elections through its Protocol No. 1 
(art. 3) and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities creates an 
obligation for States to ensure the effective participation of persons belonging to national 
minorities (art. 15). Comparable provisions on the prohibition of discrimination are also 
contained in the regional human rights treaties.13 
</p>
<p>43. To eliminate discrimination and achieve full equality, not only in law but also 
effectively in practice, the Human Rights Committee has held that States parties are 
sometimes required to &#8220;take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions 
which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination prohibited by the Covenant&#8221;, and that 
&#8220;[s]uch action may involve granting for a time to the part of the population concerned

<p>certain preferential treatment in specific matters as compared with the rest of the population 
&#8230; as long as such action is needed to correct discrimination in fact&#8221;.14 
</p>
<p>44. This principle has been articulated in several legal instruments which allow for the 
adoption of special measures. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination permits the implementation of special measures &#8220;for the sole purpose of 
securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or individuals requiring 
such protection as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal 
enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221; (art. 1, para. 4). The 
Convention goes on (art. 2, para. 2) to refer to special and concrete measures taken by 
States parties in the social, economic, cultural and other fields, the purpose of which is to 
guarantee the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women also allows 
for &#8220;temporary special measures&#8221; which accelerate the de facto equality between men and 
women (art. 4, para. 1). At the regional level, the same approach is taken in the Framework 
Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, which allows States parties to &#8220;adopt, 
where necessary, adequate measures in order to promote, in all areas of economic, social, 
political and cultural life, full and effective equality between persons belonging to a 
national minority and those belonging to the majority&#8221; (art. 4, para. 2). Special measures do 
not constitute discrimination and therefore should not be considered such.15 
</p>
<p>45. The international legal framework has repeatedly recognized the need for special 
and concrete measures to protect certain groups with the purpose of guaranteeing them full 
and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The use of special 
measures is in fact a fundamental component of the realization of the right to non-
discrimination. Special measures are not merely permissible under the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination but also, in certain circumstances, a 
requirement. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has emphasized 
that &#8220;the adoption of special measures by States parties when the circumstances so warrant, 
such as in the case of persistent disparities, is an obligation&#8221;.16 
</p>
<p>46. The concept of special measures is relevant for the effective political participation of 
women and men belonging to minorities as it can facilitate the implementation of 
minorities&#8217; rights to vote and to stand for office. It has been endorsed by the United Nations 
human rights bodies and by regional human rights institutions. With regard to the right to 
vote, the Human Rights Committee recognized that &#8220;[p]ositive measures should be taken to 
overcome specific difficulties, such as illiteracy, language barriers, poverty, or impediments 
to freedom of movement which prevent persons entitled to vote from exercising their rights 
effectively. Information and materials about voting should be available in minority 
languages&#8221;.17 
</p>
<p>47. Arguments for special measures which could ensure the participation of minorities 
in public bodies are based on the fact that because of their smaller number, minorities can

<p>hardly ever determine the outcome of decisions in a majoritarian democracy.18 In practice, 
minorities tend to be outvoted, unable to secure representation proportionate with their 
numbers, thus denying them an effective voice in the public and political life of States. The 
rationale for special measures is not, as is frequently perceived, to create a privileged 
position for minorities, but rather to level the playing field, placing minorities in the same 
position as majorities. Being involved in national political and social processes, 
contributing to policymaking and participating in (and benefiting from) public services 
should help to counter marginalization and alienation. States that welcome the participation 
and integration of minorities tend not only to be more stable, but also more prosperous.19 
</p>
<p>48. Human rights treaty bodies and courts have dealt with a range of cases involving the 
right to effective participation of minorities and the related prohibition of discrimination. 
As regards requiring proficiency in an official language, the Human Rights Committee has 
held that a Government&#8217;s failure to introduce legislation to permit the use of other 
languages disproportionately affected certain minority communities, since it denied them 
the use of their mother tongue in administration, justice, education, public life and 
Government, thus constituting a violation of article 26 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. The Committee concluded that the State was under an obligation 
to provide the community with an effective remedy, namely by allowing its officials to 
respond in languages other than the official one in a non-discriminatory manner.20 In 
another case, barring a member of a minority from standing in local elections on the 
grounds that her proficiency in the official language was not adequate, when such an 
assessment was conducted in a deficient and arbitrary way and when in fact the person 
already held a language certificate, was deemed by the Committee to be a violation of 
articles 2 and 25 of the Covenant.21 On the same issue of barring a member of a minority 
from standing in elections because of allegedly inadequate proficiency in the official 
language, the European Court of Human Rights has found that this can constitute a 
violation of article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention. In the particular case, 
the Court held that it had grave doubts as to the legal basis for subjecting candidates 
holding language certificates to further tests. The Court also considered that the testing 
lacked objectivity and procedural fairness.22 
</p><p>49. In a number of cases, the European Court assessed situations in which States 
prevented persons belonging to minorities from establishing associations aimed at 
furthering the cultural and political interests of the groups. The Court found that such 
interference constituted a violation of article 11 of the European Convention, which 
safeguards the freedom of assembly and association.23

<p>50. The Court has long asserted that minority protection justifies the application of a 
different electoral system within the State in order to ensure better minority representation 
in the legislature.24 Nevertheless, it has established that, &#8220;any electoral system must be 
assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned&#8221;, and, as a result, 
&#8220;features that would be unacceptable in the context of one system may accordingly be 
justified in the context of another&#8221;.25 
</p><p>51. Concerning a national legal requirement for a political party to adopt a structure 
which was alien to indigenous peoples&#8217; customs if it was to be allowed to participate in 
elections, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held that such imposition constituted 
a discriminatory impediment to equal participation in elections. The Court, moreover, 
determined that the universal rights of equality and political participation give rise to an 
obligation on the State to adopt affirmative and targeted measures to guarantee equal 
participation of indigenous groups.26 
</p>
<p><b> D. Preconditions for and obstacles to effective political participation 
</b></p>
<p>52. A continuing and substantive dialogue is required in order to ensure the effective 
participation of women and men belonging to minorities in their society. This dialogue 
should be multidirectional: it must involve persons belonging to minorities as well as 
majority populations, and it also must be between persons belonging to minorities and the 
authorities. Such dialogue can be achieved only if effective channels of communication are 
in place.27 Such channels must take into account the specific needs of minority women, as 
well as other marginalized segments of minority communities exposed to intersectional 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>53. A central issue in relation to the political participation of minorities is how to 
determine that the quality of participation is truly &#8220;effective&#8221;.28 When considering whether 
participation of persons belonging to minorities is effective, two of the most important 
aspects of participation must be examined. The first relates to the means which promote full 
and effective equality of persons belonging to minorities. The second assesses the impact of 
these means on the situation of the persons concerned and on the society as a whole. This 
impact may be viewed differently by different actors, depending on their engagement in the 
processes. It is not sufficient for States to ensure formal participation of persons belonging 
to minorities; States must also ensure that the participation of minority representatives has a 
substantial influence on decisions which are taken, so that there is, as far as possible, a 
shared ownership of the decisions taken.29

<p>54. Mere political participation, therefore, is not sufficient to constitute &#8220;effective&#8221; 
participation, and a number of considerations arise in this regard. One relates to the 
legitimacy of minority political representatives. It must be kept in mind that minority 
communities are heterogeneous and this diversity must be reflected in pluralist 
representation. Moreover, the political representatives can alienate themselves from their 
core constituencies, thus failing to fulfil the function of being genuine and effective 
spokespersons. And if minority representatives are not empowered to make substantial and 
influential decisions on issues of relevance for their communities, their participation will be 
tantamount to tokenism and not &#8220;effective participation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>55. It is therefore paramount that the participation mechanisms be continuously re-
examined and evaluated to ensure that they allow for effective participation. As 
circumstances and realities change over time, the participation mechanisms should be 
reviewed and, if necessary, adjusted. This, however, should not result in the curtailing of 
the acquired rights. 
</p>
<p>56. Discrimination is a key cause of the widespread marginalization of minorities in 
societies worldwide. It is also an obstacle to the effective participation of minorities. 
Discrimination can take different forms. Certain segments of minority populations are 
exposed to multiple forms of discrimination; in addition to being discriminated against on 
account of their belonging to a national or ethnic, religious or linguistic minority, they are 
discriminated against because of their gender, age, disability, sexual orientation or other 
grounds. 
</p>
<p>57. Discrimination which inhibits the political participation of minorities may manifest 
itself in, among others: a type of electoral system which negatively affects minority 
representation; political parties which are adverse to minority issues and minority 
membership; widespread prejudice among the electorate which punishes parties willing to 
include minority candidates or voice minority issues; media which are hostile to minority 
concerns and participation. Given the centrality of the issue of discrimination to the right to 
effective participation, Governments should consider instituting independent monitoring 
and individual complaints mechanisms, such as the ombudsperson&#8217;s function adopted in a 
number of countries. 
</p>
<p>58. The right to effective participation is meaningless unless a group has the ability and 
the resources to exercise it. An important precondition for the political participation of 
minorities is the capacity to participate. The capacity of minority communities to participate 
in the public life encompasses a broad range of issues. It hinges on the ability of persons 
belonging to minorities to exercise the full gamut of cultural, economic and social rights, 
among them language rights, the right to education, the right to work, the right to health, 
the right to food, the right to housing, and others. In the view of the Human Rights 
Committee, States should take positive measures to overcome specific difficulties.30 
</p>
<p>59. Legal, cultural or linguistic biases may also hinder effective minority participation in 
public life. High electoral thresholds usually have an adverse effect on the ability of 
minority communities to secure political representation and can constitute indirect 
discrimination. Requirements for the registration of political parties can restrict in an 
unreasonable and disproportionate way the ability of persons belonging to minorities to 
exercise their freedom of assembly and association. The delineation of electoral districts 
may distort the distribution of voters, thus having a discriminatory effect on a particular 
group or resulting in gerrymandering. Constitutional provisions on minority participation 
are alone insufficient to guarantee effective participation. Specific laws and policies

<p> 
</p>
<p>30
 See paragraph 19 above<i>. </i>Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 25 (1996), para. 12. </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-10198 
</p>
<p>enabling the implementation of such constitutional principles are necessary. The 
implementation of the latter must, in turn, be monitored and minority participation in their 
articulation, implementation and monitoring must be secured. 
</p>
<p>60. Linking political participation exclusively with ethnic identity by requiring that 
candidates standing for election be members of certain ethnic groups and that voters 
belonging to certain ethnic groups be allowed to vote only for candidates from their 
respective groups can be detrimental to the effective political participation of minorities. As 
previously noted, language proficiency requirements imposed on candidates can also 
negatively impact the effective participation of persons belonging to minorities and in 
certain cases have been deemed illegal by human rights bodies and courts. 
</p>
<p>61. The collection of data disaggregated by ethnicity, age, gender, geographical 
distribution and other relevant categories is an important precondition for the development 
of adequate and efficient models of participation of persons belonging to minorities. Such 
data make it possible to monitor the participation of minorities and ascertain whether fair 
and representative participation mechanisms have been put in place. The collection of 
disaggregated data must take place in accordance with international standards on personal 
data protection, as well as respecting the right of persons belonging to minorities to choose 
freely to be treated or not as minorities. Representatives of minorities should be involved in 
the process of data collection, and the data collection methods should be designed in close 
cooperation with them. 
</p>
<p>62. Accurate voters&#8217; registers are another important precondition for enabling the 
effective political participation of minorities. Voter registration must be implemented in a 
non-discriminatory way, taking into account the special needs of minorities as they may 
arise in the areas of language, cultural appropriateness and accessibility of registration 
processes. 
</p>
<p>63. Recognition of minorities is essential to secure the rights of minority groups in a 
State, including the right to effective participation. Since non-recognition hinders the 
enjoyment of internationally established rights, it ultimately leads to the marginalization of 
minorities and their exclusion from political processes. Recognition based on self-
identification is the first step in the process of securing minority rights and safeguarding the 
position of members of minorities as equal members of the society. 
</p>
<p>64. Although article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
guarantees the exercise of the right to public participation to citizens, it has come to be 
widely recognized that citizenship requirements can hamper effective participation in 
certain fields of public affairs. While it remains accepted for States to impose certain 
restrictions on non-citizens concerning the right to vote and to be elected, such restrictions 
should not be applied more widely than necessary. Denial of citizenship has been used by 
States to exclude minorities from the enjoyment of their rights. States should consider 
allowing non-citizens belonging to minorities to vote, stand as candidates in local elections 
and be members of the governing boards of self-governing bodies, while making sure that 
access to citizenship is regulated in a non-discriminatory manner.31 Positive examples of 
this kind exist in a number of States. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Existing forms and mechanisms for effective political participation 
</b></p>
<p>65. While no single, one-size-fits-all solution exists to ensure proper implementation of 
the right to effective participation, a number of features of participation models and

<p>31

</b></p>
<p>mechanisms can be identified. As regards the choice of a particular electoral system, 
international law does not impose any specific solution either. The Human Rights 
Committee has held that &#8220;the system must be compatible with the rights protected by article 
25 (of the Covenant) and must guarantee and give effect to the free expression of the will of 
the electors&#8221;.32 
</p>
<p>66. A range of legal and political mechanisms have been used around the world to 
increase the political participation of minorities at the local, regional and national levels in 
legislative, executive and administrative bodies. While minority representation is in itself 
important, consideration must also be given to the mechanisms needed to ensure that 
minority issues are addressed effectively in the governmental process. 
</p>
<p>67. Political participation of minorities encompasses a broad range of decision- and 
policymaking processes and mechanisms in the legislative, executive, self-governance and 
traditional spheres. Moreover, participation takes place at the local, regional (i.e. 
subnational), national as well as international levels. 
</p><p>68. Legislative representation is a key mechanism for minority participation, enabling 
access for minorities to all levels of legislative representation in national parliaments, 
regional legislatures and local, municipal assemblies. 
</p>
<p>69. Access to membership in viable political parties is important for the effective 
mobilization of minorities in the political process, both in elections and in the conduct of 
the business of the legislature and administrative bodies. In some countries ethnicity-based 
or faith-based political parties are prohibited by law or greatly discouraged. In other 
countries, minorities or religious groups may either have their own political parties, or their 
interests may be represented by mainstream parties. The nature of the electoral system may 
impact on the nature of political parties and the way in which minority interests are, or are 
not, addressed. Both types of parties have advantages and disadvantages for minorities: 
minority-focused parties may address minority issues but they will risk having fewer 
resources and less political influence and may, if narrowly focused, increase the public 
perception of minorities and minority issues as marginal. Of course, political party 
platforms that are racist in content violate international law whether adopted by minority or 
majority parties. 
</p><p>70. Unless the minority population constitutes a majority in an electoral district, the 
election of representatives of minority-based parties is more likely to be successful under 
proportional representation systems, where the cumulative votes of minorities are taken into 
account.33 Reducing the registration requirements for political parties may facilitate the 
creation of new minority-focused parties. 
</p>
<p>71. Minorities also face challenges when participating in majority parties. Even if they 
do address minority issues, majority parties may not prioritize in their broader agendas, or 
may lose sight of, those issues important to minority communities. Certain types of 
electoral systems or political structures may make it advantageous or necessary for political 
parties to obtain the support of a broad spectrum of voters; this can create incentives for 
mainstream parties to address minority interests and/or select minority candidates to 
broaden their appeal. Mainstream political parties may also have internal diversity 
programmes, including training and mentoring, in order to encourage an increase in the 
number of minority politicians and activists. Where the electoral system requires parties to 
present a list of candidates for election, as opposed to single-candidate constituencies, there 
may be a legal or policy requirement that the list be ethnically mixed or have a minimum

</p>
<p>number of minority candidates. Other special measures may be applied, especially to 
facilitate the election of women candidates.34 
</p>
<p>72. Ultimately, political participation through political parties may entail working 
through a combination of minority-focused and mainstream parties. Minority 
representatives may, for example, enter into coalitions with other parties, whether minority 
or mainstream. The configuration of the other parties may give them greater influence, for 
example, if they hold the balance with respect to the other parties. Even where numbers 
might not so warrant, the governing party may decide on a voluntary basis to include 
minority representatives in the Cabinet. 
</p>
<p>73. Some types of electoral systems may be more conducive than others to the election 
of minority representatives, and mechanisms specifically designed to enhance minority 
representation may also be incorporated into the electoral system. The electoral system 
prescribes how votes are translated into seats and different systems can lead to different 
outcomes on the same number of votes. The Human Rights Committee has stressed that 
&#8220;[t]he principle of one person, one vote, must apply, and within the framework of each 
State&#8217;s electoral system, the vote of one elector should be equal to the vote of another&#8221;.35 
As a matter of general principle, therefore, each voter has one vote. However, in certain 
circumstances, in particular where the minority is small and as a special measure to 
improve the integration of a minority into the political system, members of minorities may 
have the right to vote for both a minority representative with a reserved seat and a general 
non-minority representative.36

<p>74. A common mechanism used to facilitate minority representation is the allocation of 
special seats in the legislature to representatives of certain minorities (reserved seats). This 
is usually done under majority electoral systems which otherwise cannot guarantee minority 
representation, but is sometimes also used in proportional representation or mixed systems. 
Usually, members of the minority group, who have to register as such for this purpose, elect 
these representatives. The number of reserved seats generally seeks to reflect the proportion 
of the minority in the overall population, so it is likely to be small. If there are a number of 
very small minorities, they may be assigned a combined seat, although it may not be easy 
for one representative to represent genuinely the interests of all such groups. Mainstream 
parties may have an interest in mobilizing the reserved seats. 
</p>
<p>75. Where the electoral system requires parties to present a list of candidates for 
election, the electoral law may require that the list be ethnically mixed or have a minimum 
number of minority candidates.37 In &#8220;closed list&#8221; systems, where the party, rather than the 
voter, determines the order of priority of the candidates, the party may place the minority 
candidate high on the list to ensure that she or he gains a seat, regardless of voters&#8217; actual

<p>preferences.38 Of course, such lists can be a barrier to effective minority representation if 
mainstream political parties place minority candidates low on their lists. 
</p>
<p>76. There are electoral systems where voters can vote for more than one candidate from 
different parties, ranking them in order of choice, and the lower-order preferences are taken 
into account if no candidate reaches a threshold number of votes on the first-preference 
votes. This system may facilitate minority representation and is also thought to promote 
inter-group cooperation as parties seek second-preference votes from other parties&#8217; 
supporters. It may also encourage mainstream parties to take up minority issues. 
</p>
<p>77. Electoral systems often have a threshold percentage of votes which parties must 
obtain in order to have a representative in parliament. This may be modified either 
generally or in the area where a minority is concentrated, in order to permit the creation of 
parties that represent small minorities.39 Conversely, high thresholds will inhibit minority 
representation as minority parties will often be unable to gain sufficient votes. 
</p>
<p>78. The demarcation of boundaries of electoral districts may also be carried out in such 
a way as to facilitate representation of minorities if the minority is territorially 
concentrated, even though there is no reserved seat for the minority as such. The number of 
minority seats may also be increased by creating smaller electoral districts and thereby 
increasing their number. To ensure that boundaries do not unfairly prejudice any group, an 
official demarcation body independent of Government and with a fully representative 
membership should be set up. 
</p>
<p>79. Minority participation in Government (the executive or administrative branch) is 
another crucial form of minority participation, that is, as members of the Cabinet and other 
such bodies. Measures which may increase minority participation in Government include 
the allocation to minorities of membership in key committees, advisory bodies or other 
high-level organs; the creation of high-level bodies to address issues of relevance to 
minorities, preferably run by members of minorities; and the institutionalization of active 
consideration of minority issues across relevant ministries through, for example, personnel 
or a division appointed to address minority concerns within each relevant ministry, the 
issuance of standing directives, and the creation of inter-ministerial working groups to 
facilitate coordination. A careful balance between mainstreaming and targeting should be 
achieved in this regard to make minority participation most effective and to avoid having 
minority issues marginalized in a single, possibly disempowered, department. 
</p>
<p>80. The participation of minorities in administration, the judiciary, public bodies and 
public companies is another important aspect of the realization of the minority right to 
effective participation. Minority participation in decision-making is facilitated if members 
of minorities work as civil servants in a broad range of bodies, and are not confined 
exclusively to bodies dealing with minority issues. In some cases, there may be legal or 
constitutional requirements for proportional representation in the public administration 
bodies. Certain types of quotas have been deemed illegal in some States; however, the 
benefits of such special measures are evident. 
</p>
<p>81. One system of power-sharing which is frequently regarded as enabling minority 
participation in Government is consociationalism, whereby all larger minorities are entitled

<p>to participate in Government and to a proportion of positions in the public service. Under 
consociationalism, ethnic groups are recognized as political entities and, as such, are 
entitled to a large degree of self-government in matters deemed to be internal to them, and 
to a share in power when matters of common interest are being resolved at the national 
level. It is also possible to base power-sharing not explicitly on ethnicity but on political 
parties; such arrangements tend to encourage the political integration of ethnic groups. A 
major criticism of consociationalism is that it risks excluding and disempowering smaller 
minorities who are not included in such arrangements. 
</p>
<p>82. Consultative mechanisms can provide useful opportunities for minority participation 
as supplements when equal participation in elected bodies is insufficient because the 
minority community is too small to impact an election. Such consultative bodies can be ad 
hoc, set up to address a particular issue, or they can be formalized structures at the national, 
regional and local levels. They may be general, such as minority round tables, or related to 
specific matters, such as housing, land, education, language or culture. They may be part of 
the institutional structure of Government and there may be a legal requirement that they be 
consulted on particular matters. For such mechanisms to be effective, it is important that 
consultative bodies have a clear legal status, that the obligation to consult them is 
established in law and that their involvement in decision-making processes is of a regular, 
meaningful and permanent nature. Such bodies should be properly resourced and attention 
should be paid to the representativeness of their members, who should be chosen by the 
minority community through transparent procedures. It is important that the members 
appointed have the requisite qualifications to carry out the work and that they be truly 
representative, including of minority women. Finally, these structures must be 
commensurate with the needs of minority communities. 
</p>
<p>83. In some States, there is a strong demand from communities to have their traditional 
governance structures respected. Such structures may include systems whereby elders are 
consulted by community members and decide on important matters, whether they involve 
individual members or the community collectively. Communities may also have recognized 
customary laws or a code of behaviour, and these may or may not be written. Whether 
written or unwritten, it is critically important that such traditional governance structures 
include women and other marginalized groups in decision-making positions and apply 
international human rights principles fully in all aspects of their activities. With this 
proviso, initiatives whereby traditionally recognized community leaders are incorporated 
into formal government structures and legislatures are welcome and contribute to a better 
realization of the right to effective participation. Moreover, elders may play a role in 
conflict management, for instance by acting as arbiters in disputes between community 
members. 
</p>
<p>84. The minority right to effective participation can be advanced through forms of self-
governance. In many cases, this entails some degree of group autonomy, which is non-
territorial and gives the minority the right to administer and even legislate in certain fields, 
such as education, cultural affairs, application of personal laws and the preservation of 
customary law or practices, usually with exclusive jurisdiction. 
</p><p>85. Limited territorial autonomy allows minorities to exercise a wide range of 
participatory rights within a specific region in which the minority is concentrated. Since it 
is based on the spatial principle, the advantage of territorial autonomy is that it enables 
problems to be resolved without necessarily entrenching societal divisions. Indeed, 
territorial autonomy has been used to accommodate the demands of linguistic or cultural 
minorities. Territorial autonomy can enable the fair representation of minorities in regional 
legislatures and in the executive. Such arrangements should provide for the protection of 
minority languages, their use in public life, as well as education about and preservation of 
minority cultures, thus accommodating the demands of linguistic and cultural rights. The </p>


<p>GE.10-10198 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>link with the central Government can be strengthened by regional representation at the 
centre. There are successful examples of how territorial autonomy has defused tensions, 
actually strengthened the sense of inclusion and provided the basis for the preservation of 
minority communities. However, if not carefully designed, autonomous arrangements may 
lead to a further fragmentation of the State. Moreover, arrangements should be made to 
ensure the rights of smaller &#8220;minorities within minorities&#8221;, through power-sharing, cultural 
autonomy and devolution to local authorities. 
</p>
<p>86. Minorities may be given special procedural rights or vetoes in relation to decisions 
on matters of particular concern to the minority. For example, a minority may be able to 
veto proposed new legislation in specific areas, or a special majority may be required to 
pass it. Such special procedures may be confined to particular regions where the minority is 
concentrated. Where matters are of sufficient importance that stalemate cannot be 
permitted, there may be special arbitration procedures.40 
</p>
<p>87. Finally, at the international level, in addition to being involved in the 
implementation of bilateral treaties, it is crucial that persons belonging to minorities also be 
involved at all stages of the monitoring and implementation of international human rights 
instruments, and in particular those relevant for the protection of minority rights. It is also 
important that minority communities be consulted on and involved in supranational 
integration processes. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>88. Effective participation in decision-making processes, particularly in those which 
have an impact on minorities, is a precondition for the full and equal enjoyment of the 
human rights of persons belonging to them. There are at least two key lessons to be drawn. 
The first is the truly essential nature of the right to effective participation: the fulfilment of 
so many other fundamental human rights is both dependent on and a prerequisite for its 
fulfilment. The second lesson is that the effectiveness of the political participation of 
minorities must constantly be evaluated and at all levels of society, in order to ensure that it 
is real and meaningful. A full set of recommendations can be found in document 
A/HRC/13/25.
