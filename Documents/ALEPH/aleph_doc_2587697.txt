PROSPECTUS SUMMARY
Our Company
We are a Marshall Islands corporation with our principal executive offices in Athens, Greece and
were incorporated in September 2004.  We are an international provider of ocean transportation
services for drybulk and petroleum cargoes through our ownership and operation of drybulk
carrier vessels and oil tankers and offshore drilling services through the ownership and operation
by our majority-owned subsidiary, Ocean Rig UDW, of ultra-deepwater drilling units.  Our
common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market where it trades under they symbol
"DRYS."
 
As of August 19, 2013, we owned a fleet of (i) 42 drybulk carriers (including newbuildings),
comprised of 12 Capesize, 28 Panamax and 2 Supramax vessels, which have a combined
deadweight tonnage of approximately 4.4 million dwt and an average age of approximately 8.9
years; (ii) 10 drilling units (including newbuildings), comprised of two modern, fifth generation,
advanced capability ultra-deepwater semisubmersible offshore drilling rigs, four sixth generation,
advanced capability ultra-deepwater drillships and four seventh generation, advanced capability
ultra-deepwater drillships; and (iii) ten oil tankers, comprised of six Aframax and four Suezmax
tankers with a combined deadweight tonnage of over 1.3 million.
 
Our drybulk carriers, drilling units and oil tankers operate worldwide within the trading limits
imposed by our insurance terms and do not operate in areas where United States, European
Union or United Nations sanctions have been imposed.
 
Ocean Rig UDW comprises our entire offshore drilling segment, which represented
approximately 70.6% of our total assets and approximately 77.2% of our total revenues for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2013. As we have done in the past, we may, in the future, sell a
minority voting and economic interest in Ocean Rig UDW in a public offering or distribute, or spin
off, a minority voting and economic interest in Ocean Rig UDW to holders of our voting stock.
There can be no assurance, however, that we will complete any such transaction, which, among
other things, will be subject to market conditions.
 
In addition, we may sell a minority voting and economic interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary,
Olympian Heracles Holding, the indirect owner and operator of our oil tankers, in a public offering
sometime in the future. Alternatively, we may distribute, or spin off, a minority voting and
economic interest in Olympian Heracles Holding to holders of our voting stock (including holders
of our preferred shares), or complete some combination of a public offering and distribution to
holders of our voting stock. Olympian Heracles Holding owns our operating tankers. There can
be no assurance, however, that we will complete any such transaction, which, among other
things, will be subject to market conditions.

Our Drybulk Operations
 
Management of our Drybulk Vessels
We do not employ personnel to run our vessel operating and chartering business on a day-to-day
basis. Prior to January 1, 2011, Cardiff Marine Inc., or Cardiff, a company affiliated with our
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. George Economou, served as our technical
and commercial manager pursuant to separate management agreements with each of our
drybulk vessel-owning subsidiaries. Effective January 1, 2011, we entered into new management
agreements with TMS Bulkers, a related party entity, that replaced our management agreements
with Cardiff, on the same terms as our management agreements with Cardiff, as a result of an
internal restructuring of Cardiff for the purpose of enhancing Cardiff's efficiency and the quality of
its ship-management services. For a description of the terms of our management agreements
with TMS Bulkers.
We believe that TMS Bulkers, as a successor to Cardiff, which was in the business of providing
commercial and technical management for over 22 years, has established a reputation in the
international shipping industry for operating and maintaining a fleet with high standards of
performance, reliability and safety.
 
TMS Bulkers utilizes the same experienced personnel utilized by Cardiff in providing us with
comprehensive ship management services, including technical supervision, such as repairs,
maintenance and inspections, safety and quality, crewing and training as well as supply
provisioning. TMS Bulkers' commercial management services include operations, chartering,
sale and purchase, post-fixture administration, accounting, freight invoicing and insurance.
 
TMS Bulkers' completed implementation of the ISM Code, in 2010. TMS Bulkers has obtained
documents of compliance for its office and safety management certificates for its vessels as
required by the ISM Code and is ISO 14001 certified in recognition of its commitment to overall
quality.
TMS Bulkers is beneficially owned by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr.
George Economou.  Mr. Economou under the guidance of our board of directors, manages our
business as a holding company, including our own administrative functions, and we monitor TMS
Bulkers' performance under the management agreements.
Chartering of our Drybulk Vessels
 
We actively manage the deployment of our drybulk fleet between long-term time charters and
short-term time charters or spot charters, which generally last from several weeks to several days,
and long-term time charters and bareboat charters, which can last up to several years.
 
As of August 19, 2013, 19 of our drybulk vessels were employed under time charters and 19 of
our drybulk vessels were employed in the spot market.
Our Tanker Operations
 
Management of our Tankers
 
Since January 1, 2011, TMS Tankers, a company controlled by our Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer, Mr. George Economou, has provided the commercial and technical
management functions of our tankers, including while our tankers were under construction,
pursuant to separate management agreements entered into with TMS Tankers for each of our
tankers.
 
TMS Tankers is beneficially owned by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr.
George Economou. Mr. Economou, under the guidance of our board of directors, manages our
business as a holding company, including our own administrative functions, and we monitor TMS
Tankers' performance under the management agreements. We believe that TMS Tankers, as a
successor to Cardiff, which was in the business of providing commercial and technical
management for over 22 years, has established a reputation in the international shipping industry
for operating and maintaining a fleet with high standards of performance, reliability and safety.
 
2
Employment of our Tankers
 
We operate our tankers in the spot market. As of August 19, 2013, one Aframax tanker operates
in the Sigma tanker pool. In the past, three of our other Aframax tankers operated in the Sigma
tanker pool and three of our Suezmax tankers operated in the Blue Fin tanker pool.
 
TMS Tankers may seek to hedge our spot exposure through the use of freight forward
agreements or other financial instruments. In addition, we may employ our tankers on fixed-rate
time charters in the future. Accordingly, we actively monitor macroeconomic trends and
governmental rules and regulations that may affect tanker rates in an attempt to optimize the
deployment of our fleet.
Our Offshore Drilling Operations
 
Management of Our Offshore Drilling Operations
 
Management Agreements
 
Ocean Rig's wholly-owned subsidiary, Ocean Rig AS, provides supervisory management
services including onshore management, to our operating drilling rigs and drillships pursuant to
separate management agreements entered into with each of the drilling unit-owning subsidiaries.
In addition, Ocean Rig AS provides supervisory management services for our seventh generation
drillships under construction.
 
Under the terms of these management agreements, Ocean Rig AS, through its affiliates, is
responsible for, among other things, (i) assisting in construction contract technical negotiations,
(ii) securing contracts for the future employment of the drilling units, and (iii) providing
commercial, technical and operational management for the drillships.
 
Effective December 21, 2010, we terminated our management agreements with Cardiff, pursuant
to which Cardiff provided supervisory services in connection with the construction of the Ocean
Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Olympia These agreements were replaced with the Global
Services Agreement described below under "Services Agreements."
 
Services Agreements
 
On December 1, 2010, DryShips Inc. entered into the Global Services Agreement with Cardiff,
effective December 21, 2010, pursuant to which we engaged Cardiff to act as consultant on
matters of chartering and sale and purchase transactions for our offshore drilling units. Effective
January 1, 2013, the Global Services Agreement was terminated by mutual agreement of the
parties.  Also effective January 1, 2013, Ocean Rig Management Inc., or Ocean Rig
Management, our majority-owned subsidiary and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocean Rig UDW,
entered into a new services agreement with an affiliate of Cardiff.
 
On September 1, 2010, DryShips Inc. entered into a consultancy agreement, or the DryShips
Consultancy Agreement, with Vivid Finance Ltd., or Vivid Finance, a company controlled by our
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. George Economou, pursuant to which Vivid
Finance provides consulting services relating to (i) the identification, sourcing, negotiation and
arrangement of new loan and credit facilities, interest swap agreements, foreign currency
contracts and forward exchange contracts; (ii) the raising of equity or debt in the public capital
markets; and (iii) the renegotiation of existing loan facilities and other debt instruments. Effective
January 1, 2013, Ocean Rig Management entered into a separate consultancy agreement, or the
Ocean Rig Consultancy Agreement, with Vivid Finance, on the same terms and conditions as the
DryShips Consultancy Agreement.

Recent Developments
 
Vessel Acquisitions and Sales
In March 2013 and April 2013, the Company sold its newbuilding Capesize bulk carriers Hull
1241 and 1242, to an unaffiliated third party and novated the contracts for the construction of its
newbuilding Very Large Ore Carriers Hulls 1239 and 1240, in favor of an entity related to Mr.
George Economou. These four vessels had remaining yard installments of approximately $178
million against which the Company had no committed debt. Under the terms of the sale
agreements, the Company made payments of only $29 million, thus eliminating approximately
$149 million in capital expenditures.
On July 10, 2013, Ocean Rig entered into a drilling contract with Total E&P Angola for a five-well
program or a minimum of 275 days for its ultra deepwater drillship Ocean Rig Skyros for drilling
offshore West Africa. The Ocean Rig Skyros is expected to commence this contract upon delivery
from the shipyard, in November 2013.
On July 19, 2013, Ocean Rig received a Letter of Award for its ultra deepwater drillship Ocean
Rig Skyros, from a major oil company. The Letter of Award is for a six-year contract for drilling
offshore West Africa. The contract is expected to commence in direct continuation of the previous
contract of the Ocean Rig Skyros with Total E&P Angola before the first quarter of 2015.
On July 30, 2013, Ocean Rig signed definitive documentation with Total E&P Congo, following
the previously announced Letter of Award, for its ultra deepwater drillship Ocean Rig Apollo. The
contract is for a three-year drilling campaign offshore West Africa and is expected to commence
in the first quarter of 2015.
On August 19, 2013, Ocean Rig took delivery of the Ocean Rig Mylos and on August 20, 2013
drew down an amount of $450.0 million under its $1.35 billion credit facility dated February 28,
2013.
 
Credit Agreements and Term Loans
 
On July 12, 2013, Ocean Rig, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Drillships Financing
Holding Inc. ("DFHI"), and Drillships Projects Inc., entered into a $1.8 billion senior secured term
loan facility, comprised of tranche B-1 term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to
$975.0 million and tranche B-2 term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to $825.0
million, with respective maturity dates in the first quarter of 2021, subject to adjustment to the third
quarter of 2020 in certain circumstances, and the third quarter of 2016.
On July 26, 2013, Ocean Rig, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, DFHI, and Drillships
Projects Inc. entered into an incremental amendment to the $1.8 billion senior term loan facility
dated July 12, 2013, for additional tranche B-1 term loans in a principal amount of $100.0 million.
On August 1, 2013, the Company entered into two supplemental agreements related to two term
bank loans dated October 5, 2007 and March 13, 2008, respectively, to amend certain terms and
cure a shortfall in the security cover ratio, and pledged an aggregate of 5,450,000 of its shares of
Ocean Rig as additional security under the loans. The share pledge expires on December 31,
2013.

and negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows or our ability
to pay dividends, if any, in the future, or the trading price of our common stock.
Risk Factors Relating to the Drybulk Shipping Industry
 
Charterhire rates for drybulk carriers are volatile and remain significantly below their high in
2008, which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and
profitability and our ability to comply with our loan covenants.
 
The degree of charterhire rate volatility among different types of drybulk vessels has varied
widely; however, the prolonged downturn in the drybulk charter market has severely affected the
entire drybulk shipping industry and charterhire rates for drybulk vessels have declined
significantly from historically high levels. The Baltic Dry Index, or the BDI, an index published
daily by the Baltic Exchange Limited, a London-based membership organization that provides
daily shipping market information to the global investing community, is a daily average of charter
rates for key drybulk routes, which has long been viewed as the main benchmark to monitor the
movements of the drybulk vessel charter market and the performance of the overall drybulk
shipping market. The BDI declined 94% in 2008 from a peak of 11,793 in May 2008 to a low of
663 in December 2008 and has remained volatile since then.  The BDI recorded a 25-year record
low of 647 in 2012. While the BDI increased to 1,115 as of August 19 2013, there can be no
assurance that the drybulk charter market will increase further, and the market could decline.
 
The decline and volatility in charter rates has been due to various factors, including the over-
supply of drybulk vessels, the lack of trade financing for purchases of commodities carried by
sea, which resulted in a significant decline in cargo shipments. The decline and volatility in
charter rates in the drybulk market also affects the value of our drybulk vessels, which follows the
trends of drybulk charter rates, and earnings on our charters, and similarly, affects our cash flows,
liquidity and compliance with the covenants contained in our loan agreements.  If low charter
rates in the drybulk market continue or decline further for any significant period, this could have
an adverse effect on our vessel values and our ability to continue as a going concern and comply
with the financial covenants in our loan agreements. In such a situation, unless our lenders were
willing to provide waivers of covenant compliance or modifications to our covenants, our lenders
could accelerate our debt and we could face the loss of our vessels. In addition, the decline in the
drybulk carrier charter market has had and may continue to have additional adverse
consequences for the drybulk shipping industry, including an absence of financing for vessels,
no active secondhand market for the sale of vessels, charterers seeking to renegotiate the rates
for existing time charters, and widespread loan covenant defaults in the drybulk shipping
industry. Accordingly, the value of our common shares could be substantially reduced or
eliminated.
 
Because we currently employ 19 of our vessels in the spot market and pursuant to short-term
time charters, we are exposed to changes in spot market and short-term charter rates for drybulk
carriers and such changes may affect our earnings and the value of our drybulk carriers at any
given time. In addition, we have five vessels scheduled to come off of their current charters in
2013 for which we will be seeking new employment. We may not be able to successfully charter
our vessels in the future or renew existing charters at rates sufficient to allow us to meet our
obligations. Fluctuations in charter rates result from changes in the supply of and demand for
vessel capacity and changes in the supply and demand for the major commodities carried by
water internationally. Because the factors affecting the supply of and demand for vessels are
outside of our control and are unpredictable, the nature, timing, direction and degree of changes
in industry conditions are also unpredictable.
9
Factors that influence demand for vessel capacity include:
·supply and demand for energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer
and industrial products;
·changes in the exploration or production of energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and
finished consumer and industrial products;
·the location of regional and global exploration, production and manufacturing facilities;
·the location of consuming regions for energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and
finished consumer and industrial products;
·the globalization of production and manufacturing;
·global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist
activities, embargoes and strikes;
·natural disasters and other disruptions in international trade;
·developments in international trade;
·changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including the distance cargo is
transported by sea;
·environmental and other regulatory developments;
·currency exchange rates; and
·weather.
 
The factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include:
·the number of newbuilding deliveries;
·port and canal congestion;
·the scrapping rate of older vessels;
·vessel casualties; and
·the number of vessels that are out of service.
 
In addition to the prevailing and anticipated freight rates, factors that affect the rate of
newbuilding, scrapping and laying-up include newbuilding prices, secondhand vessel values in
relation to scrap prices, costs of bunkers and other operating costs, costs associated with
classification society surveys, normal maintenance and insurance coverage, the efficiency and
age profile of the existing drybulk fleet in the market and government and industry regulation of
maritime transportation practices, particularly environmental protection laws and regulations.
These factors influencing the supply of and demand for shipping capacity are outside of our
control, and we may not be able to correctly assess the nature, timing and degree of changes in
industry conditions.
 
We anticipate that the future demand for our drybulk carriers will be dependent upon continued
economic growth in the world's economies, including China and India, seasonal and regional
changes in demand, changes in the capacity of the global drybulk carrier fleet and the sources
and supply of drybulk cargoes to be transported by sea. Given the large number of new drybulk
carriers currently on order with shipyards, the capacity of the global drybulk carrier fleet seems
likely to increase and economic growth may not continue. Adverse economic, political, social or
other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
10
An over-supply of drybulk carrier capacity may prolong or further depress the current low charter
rates and, in turn, adversely affect our profitability.
 
The market supply of drybulk carriers has been increasing as a result of the delivery of numerous
newbuilding orders over the last few years. Newbuildings have been delivered in significant
numbers since the beginning of 2006 and, as of August 1, 2013, newbuilding orders had been
placed for an aggregate of more than 17.8% of the existing global drybulk fleet, with deliveries
expected during the next three years. Due to lack of financing many analysts expect significant
cancellations and/or slippage of newbuilding orders. While vessel supply will continue to be
affected by the delivery of new vessels and the removal of vessels from the global fleet, either
through scrapping or accidental losses, an over-supply of dry bulk carrier capacity could
exacerbate the recent decrease in charter rates or prolong the period during which low charter
rates prevail. Currently, some of our spot market-related time charterers are at times unprofitable
due the volatility associated with dry cargo freight rates. If market conditions persist or worsen,
upon the expiration or termination of our vessels' current non-spot charters, we may only be able
to re-charter our vessels at reduced or unprofitable rates, or we may not be able to charter these
vessels at all. The occurrence of these events could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends.
Currently, five of the charters for our drybulk vessels are scheduled to expire 2013.
 
The market values of our vessels may decrease, which could limit the amount of funds that we
can borrow or cause us to breach certain covenants in our credit facilities and we may incur a
loss if we sell vessels following a decline in their market value.
 
The fair market values of our vessels are related to prevailing freight charter rates. However,
while the fair market values of vessels and the freight charter market have a very close
relationship as the charter market moves from trough to peak, the time lag between the effect of
charter rates on market values of ships can vary.
 
The fair market values of our vessels have generally experienced high volatility, and you should
expect the market values of our vessels to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including:
·prevailing level of charter rates;
·general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry;
·types and sizes of vessels;
·supply of and demand for vessels;
·other modes of transportation;
·cost of newbuildings;
·governmental and other regulations; and
·technological advances.
 
In addition, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. If the market values of our
vessels, which are at relatively low levels, decrease further, we may not be in compliance with
certain covenants in our credit facilities secured by mortgages on our drybulk vessels, and our
lenders could accelerate our indebtedness or require us to pay down our indebtedness to a level
where we are again in compliance with our loan covenants. If our indebtedness is accelerated,
we may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing.
11
In addition, if we sell one or more of our vessels at a time when vessel prices have fallen and
before we have recorded an impairment adjustment to our consolidated financial statements, the
sale proceeds may be less than the vessel's carrying value on our consolidated financial
statements, resulting in a loss and a reduction in earnings. Furthermore, if vessel values persist
at their current levels or decline further, we may have to record an impairment adjustment in our
financial statements which could adversely affect our financial results. Due to our decision to sell
certain vessels subsequent to the balance sheet dates and based on the agreed-upon sales
price, an impairment charge of $3.6 million, $144.7 million and $0 million, for each of the years
ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, was recognized. In addition, for the six-
month period ended June 30, 2013, we incurred an impairment loss of $43.5 million due to our
decision to sell four of our newbuildings.
 
A further economic slowdown or changes in the economic and political environment in the Asia
Pacific region could exacerbate the effect of recent slowdowns in the economies of the European
Union and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
 
We anticipate a significant number of the port calls made by our vessels will continue to involve
the loading or discharging of drybulk commodities in ports in the Asia Pacific region. As a result,
any negative changes in economic conditions in any Asia Pacific country, particularly in China,
may exacerbate the effect of recent slowdowns in the economies of the European Union and may
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as
well as our future prospects. Before the global economic financial crisis that began in 2008,
China had one of the world's fastest growing economies in terms of gross domestic product, or
GDP, which had a significant impact on shipping demand. The quarterly year-over-year growth
rate of China's GDP decreased to approximately 7.5% for the quarter ended June 30, 2013, as
compared to approximately 7.6% for the year ended June 30, 2012, and continues to remain
below pre-2008 levels. .
We cannot assure you that the Chinese economy will not experience a significant contraction in
the future.  Although state-owned enterprises still account for a substantial portion of the Chinese
industrial output, in general, the Chinese government is reducing the level of direct control that it
exercises over the economy through state plans and other measures. There is an increasing
level of freedom and autonomy in areas such as allocation of resources, production, pricing and
management and a gradual shift in emphasis to a "market economy" and enterprise reform.
Limited price reforms were undertaken with the result that prices for certain commodities are
principally determined by market forces. Many of the reforms are unprecedented or experimental
and may be subject to revision, change or abolition based upon the outcome of such
experiments. If the Chinese government does not continue to pursue a policy of economic reform,
the level of imports to and exports from China could be adversely affected by changes to these
economic reforms by the Chinese government, as well as by changes in political, economic and
social conditions or other relevant policies of the Chinese government, such as changes in laws,
regulations or export and import restrictions. Notwithstanding economic reform, the Chinese
government may adopt policies that favor domestic drybulk shipping companies and may hinder
our ability to compete with them effectively. Moreover, the current economic slowdown in the
economies of the European Union and other Asian countries may further adversely affect
economic growth in China and elsewhere. In addition, concerns regarding the possibility of
sovereign debt defaults by European Union member countries, including Greece, have disrupted
financial markets throughout the world, may lead to weaker consumer demand in the European
Union, the United States, and other parts of the world. The possibility of sovereign debt defaults
by European Union member countries, including Greece, and the possibility of market reforms to
float the Chinese renminbi, either of which development could weaken the Euro against the
Chinese renminbi, could adversely affect consumer demand in the European Union. Moreover,
the revaluation of the renminbi may negatively impact the United States' demand for imported
goods, many of which are shipped from China. Such weak economic conditions could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our
ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Our business, financial condition, results of
operations, ability to pay dividends as well as our future prospects, will likely be materially and
adversely affected by a further economic downturn in any of these countries.
 
If economic conditions throughout the world do not improve, this will impede our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 
Negative trends in the global economy that emerged in 2008 continue to adversely affect global
economic conditions. In addition, the world economy is currently facing a number of new
challenges, including uncertainty related to the continuing discussions in the United States
regarding the federal debt ceiling and recent turmoil and hostilities in the Middle East, North
Africa and other geographic areas and countries. The deterioration in the global economy has
caused, and may continue to cause, a decrease in worldwide demand for certain goods and,
thus, shipping.
12
The United States, the European Union and other parts of the world have recently been or are
currently in a recession and continue to exhibit weak economic trends. The current sovereign
debt crisis in certain Eurozone countries, and concerns over debt levels of certain other
European Union member states and in other countries around the world, as well as concerns
about international banks, have led to increased volatility in global credit and equity markets. The
credit markets in the United States and Europe have experienced significant contraction,
deleveraging and reduced liquidity, and the United States federal and state governments and
European authorities have implemented a broad variety of governmental action and/or new
regulation of the financial markets and may implement additional regulations in the
future.  Securities and futures markets and the credit markets are subject to comprehensive
statutes, regulations and other requirements. The United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, other regulators, self-regulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to
take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies, and may effect changes in law or
interpretations of existing laws. Global financial markets and economic conditions have been,
and continue to be, severely disrupted and volatile. Credit markets and the debt and equity
capital markets have been exceedingly distressed and the uncertainty surrounding the future of
the credit markets in the United States and the rest of the world has resulted in reduced access to
credit worldwide.
 
We face risks attendant to changes in economic environments, changes in interest rates, and
instability in the banking and securities markets around the world, among other factors. Major
market disruptions and the current adverse changes in market conditions and regulatory climate
in the United States and worldwide may adversely affect our business or impair our ability to
borrow amounts under our credit facilities or any future financial arrangements. We cannot
predict how long the current market conditions will last. However, these recent and developing
economic and governmental factors, together with the concurrent decline in charter rates and
vessel values, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition
or cash flows, and the trading price of our common shares. In the absence of available financing,
we also may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive
pressures.
 
In addition, as a result of the ongoing economic turmoil in Greece resulting from the sovereign
debt crisis and the related austerity measures implemented by the Greek government, our
operations in Greece may be subjected to new regulations that may require us to incur new or
additional compliance or other administrative costs and may require that we pay to the Greek
government new taxes or other fees. We also face the risk that strikes, work stoppages, civil
unrest and violence within Greece may disrupt our shoreside operations and those of our
managers located in Greece.
The current state of global financial markets and current economic conditions may adversely
impact our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms which may hinder or prevent
us from expanding our business.
 
Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile.
Recently, the debt and equity capital markets have been severely distressed. These issues,
along with significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk and the
current weak economic conditions, have made, and will likely continue to make, it difficult to
obtain additional financing. The current state of global financial markets and current economic
conditions might adversely impact our ability to issue additional equity at prices which will not be
dilutive to our existing shareholders or preclude us from issuing equity at all.
 
Also, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of
counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as
many lenders have increased margins or interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards,
refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt and reduced, and in
some cases ceased, to provide funding to borrowers. Furthermore, certain banks that have
historically been significant lenders to the shipping industry have reduced or ceased lending to
the shipping industry. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that additional financing will be
available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If additional
financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be
unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to enhance our existing
business, complete additional drilling unit acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business
opportunities as they arise.
13
The instability of the euro or the inability of Eurozone countries to refinance their debts could
have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and financial position.
 
As a result of the credit crisis in Europe, in particular in Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain,
the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility, or the EFSF, and
the European Financial Stability Mechanism, or the EFSM, to provide funding to Eurozone
countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. In March 2011, the European Council
agreed on the need for Eurozone countries to establish a permanent stability mechanism, the
European Stability Mechanism, or the ESM, which will be activated by mutual agreement, to
assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to
Eurozone countries after June 2013. Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the
debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations
and the overall stability of the euro. An extended period of adverse development in the outlook for
European countries could reduce the overall demand for drybulk cargoes and oil and gas and for
our services. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related
issues, could affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.
 
 Charterers have been placed under significant financial pressure, thereby increasing our charter
counterparty risk.
 
The continuing weakness in demand for drybulk shipping services and any future declines in
such demand could result in financial challenges faced by our charterers and may increase the
likelihood of one or more of our charterers being unable or unwilling to pay us contracted charter
rates. We expect to generate most of our revenues from these charters and if our charterers fail to
meet their obligations to us, we will sustain significant losses which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on
our business.
 
Acts of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the world such
as the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean, off the coast of West Africa and in the Gulf of Aden off
the coast of Somalia. In February 2009, the drybulk vessel Saldanha, which is owned by our
subsidiary, Team-Up Owning Company Limited, was seized by pirates while transporting coal
through the Gulf of Aden. Although the frequency of sea piracy worldwide decreased during 2012
to its lowest level since 2009, sea piracy incidents continue to occur, particularly in the Gulf of
Aden off the coast of Somalia and increasingly in the Gulf of Guinea, with drybulk vessels and
tankers particularly vulnerable to such attacks. If these piracy attacks result in regions in which
our vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as "war risk" zones, or Joint War
Committee "war and strikes" listed areas, premiums payable for such coverage could increase
significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. In addition, crew costs,
due to employing onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. Furthermore,
while we believe the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by
pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charterhire until the vessel is released. A
charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not "on-hire" for a certain number of
days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim that we would dispute. We
may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material
adverse effect on us. In addition, detention hijacking, involving the hostile detention of a vessel,
as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability of
insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, results of operations.
The U.S. government recently imposed legislation concerning the deteriorating situation in
Somalia, including acts of piracy offshore Somalia. On April 13, 2010, the President of the United
States issued an Executive Order, which we refer to as the Order, prohibiting, among other
things, the payment of monies to or for the benefit of individuals and entities on the list of
Specially Designated Nationals, or SDNs, published by U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office
of Foreign Assets Control. Certain individuals associated with piracy offshore Somalia are
currently designated persons under the SDN list. The Order is applicable only to payments by
U.S. persons and not by foreign entities, such as us. Notwithstanding this fact, it is possible that
the Order, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may affect foreign private issuers to the
extent that such foreign private issuers provide monies, such as ransom payments to secure the
release of crews and ships in the event of detention hijackings, to any SDN for which they seek
reimbursement from a U.S. insurance carrier. While additional regulations relating to the Order
may be promulgated by the U.S. government in the future, we cannot predict what effect these
regulations may have on our operations.
14
Political instability, terrorist attacks and international hostilities can affect the seaborne
transportation industry, which could adversely affect our business.
 
We conduct most of our operations outside of the United States, and our business, results of
operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future may
be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the
countries and regions where our vessels are employed or registered. Moreover, we operate in a
sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political conflicts,
including the current political instability in the Middle East, North Africa and other geographic
countries and areas, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. Terrorist attacks
such as those in New York on September 11, 2001, in London on July 7, 2005, and in Mumbai
on November 26, 2008, and the continuing response of the United States and others to these
attacks, as well as the threat of future terrorist attacks around the world, continues to cause
uncertainty in the world's financial markets and may affect our business, operating results and
financial condition. Continuing conflicts and recent developments in the Middle East and North
Africa, and the presence of U.S. or other armed forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and various other
regions, may lead to additional acts of terrorism and armed conflict around the world, which may
contribute to further economic instability in the global financial markets. These uncertainties
could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or
at all. In the past, political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on vessels, such as the attack on
the MT Limburg, a vessel unaffiliated with us, in October 2002, mining of waterways and other
efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. Acts of terrorism
and piracy have also affected vessels trading in regions such as the South China Sea and the
Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia.  Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse
impact on our operating results, revenues and costs.
 
Our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could affect our operating results and
our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future.
 
We operate our drybulk vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in
demand and, as a result, in charterhire rates. This seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter
volatility in our operating results, which could affect our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the
future from quarter to quarter. The drybulk carrier market is typically stronger in the fall and winter
months in anticipation of increased consumption of coal and other raw materials in the northern
hemisphere during the winter months. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these
months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities. As a result, our
revenues have historically been weaker during the fiscal quarters ended June 30 and September
30, and, conversely, our revenues have historically been stronger in fiscal quarters ended
December 31 and March 31. This seasonality may adversely affect our operating results and our
ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future.
 
Rising fuel prices may adversely affect our profits.
 
While we do not directly bear the cost of fuel or bunkers under our time charters, fuel is a
significant factor in negotiating charter rates.  Fuel is also a significant, if not the largest, expense
in our shipping operations when vessels are under spot or voyage charter. As a result, an
increase in the price of fuel beyond our expectations may adversely affect our profitability at the
time of charter negotiation. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on
events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and
gas, actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and
gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production
patterns and environmental concerns. Further, fuel may become much more expensive in the
future, which may reduce the profitability and competitiveness of our business versus other forms
of transportation, such as truck or rail.
We are subject to international safety regulations and the failure to comply with these regulations
may subject us to increased liability, may adversely affect our insurance coverage and may result
in our vessels being denied access to, or detained in, certain ports.
 
Our business and the operation of our drybulk vessels and tankers are materially affected by
government regulation in the form of international conventions, national, state and local laws and
regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which the vessels operate, as well as in the country or
countries of their registration. Because such conventions, laws, and regulations are often revised,
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with such conventions, laws and regulations or
the impact thereof on the resale prices or useful lives of our vessels. Additional conventions, laws
and regulations may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost
of our doing business and which may materially adversely affect our operations. We are required
by various governmental and quasi governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses,
certificates, and financial assurances with respect to our operations.
15
In addition, vessel classification societies also impose significant safety and other requirements
on our vessels. In complying with current and future environmental requirements, vessel-owners
and operators may also incur significant additional costs in meeting new maintenance and
inspection requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in
obtaining insurance coverage. Government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of
safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become stricter in the future and
require us to incur significant capital expenditures on our vessels to keep them in compliance.
 
The operation of our vessels is affected by the requirements set forth in the United Nations'
International Maritime Organization's International Management Code for the Safe Operation of
Ships and Pollution Prevention, or the ISM Code. The ISM Code requires ship owners, ship
managers and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive "Safety Management
System" that includes the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth
instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with
emergencies. Currently, all of our vessels are ISM Code-certified and we expect that any vessels
that we acquire in the future will be ISM Code-certified when delivered to us. The failure of a
shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject it to increased liability,
may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected
vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. If we are subject to
increased liability for non-compliance or if our insurance coverage is adversely impacted as a
result of non-compliance, it may negatively affect our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future.
If any of our vessels are denied access to, or are detained in, certain ports, this may decrease our
revenues.
 
We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations that can
adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.
 
Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the form of international
conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and national and international regulations
in force in the jurisdictions in which our drybulk and tanker vessels operate or are registered,
which can significantly affect the ownership and operation of those vessels. These requirements
include, but are not limited to, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
Ships, or MARPOL, the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966, the International
Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, generally referred to as CLC, the
International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, or Bunker
Convention, the ISM Code, the International Convention for the Control and Management of
Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments, or the BWM Convention, the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990,
or OPA, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or
CERCLA, the U.S. Clean Water Act, the U.S. Clean Air Act, the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf
Lands Act, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, or the MTSA, and European
Union regulations. Compliance with such laws, regulations and standards, where applicable,
may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes and may affect the resale
value or useful lives of our vessels. We may also incur additional costs in order to comply with
other existing and future regulatory obligations, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air
emissions, the management of ballast waters, maintenance and inspection, elimination of tin-
based paint, development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance
coverage or other financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents. These costs
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and
financial condition. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in
administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our
operations. Environmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases
of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we
were negligent or at fault. Under OPA, for example, owners, operators and bareboat charterers
are jointly and severally strictly liable for the discharge of oil within the 200-mile exclusive
economic zone around the United States. An oil spill could result in significant liability, including
fines, penalties and criminal liability and remediation costs for natural resource damages under
other federal, state and local laws, as well as third-party damages. The April 2010 Deepwater
Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may also result in additional laws or regulatory initiatives,
including the raising of liability caps under OPA, that may affect our operations or require us to
incur additional expenses to comply with such regulatory initiatives. We are required to satisfy
insurance and financial responsibility requirements for potential oil (including marine fuel) spills
and other pollution incidents.

TMS Bulkers Ltd., or TMS Bulkers, managers of the vessel Oliva, one of our Panamax drybulk
carriers, reported that on March 16, 2011, the vessel ran aground at Nightingale Island, which is
part of the "Tristan Da Cunha" group of islands in the South Atlantic Ocean. At the time of the
incident the vessel was on its way from Santos, Brazil to China, loaded with 65,266 metric tons of
soya beans. The following day the vessel broke in two. Both the vessel and the cargo are lost
and are considered to be actual total losses for insurance purposes. In addition, bunkers leaked
from the damaged hull, which has affected the local birdlife and marine environment. There were
no injuries to the 22 crew members on board.
 
TMS Bulkers activated its Emergency Response Plan and has deployed all appropriate
resources in close cooperation with the local authorities to mitigate the damage arising from this
accident. That response has included the attendance of a large local vessel, which was joined a
few days later by a salvage tug with appropriate equipment for bird rehabilitation and oil clean-up
operations, as well as salvage operations. A second tug and a small general cargo vessel also
have been chartered to deliver additional equipment and a team of specialists from The Southern
African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds, or the SANCCOB. Oil pollution experts
International Tanker Operators Pollution Federation, or ITOPF, have been coordinating the
response to the casualty, in conjunction with TMS Bulkers and the vessel's Protection &
Indemnity liability insurers (Gard). The vessel's hull was fully insured and the Hull & Machinery
insurers were notified of the loss. The hull and machinery claims, cargo claims as a result of
pollution and any liability claims as a result of the grounding have been settled.
 
Increased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and
disrupt our business.
 
International shipping is subject to various security and customs inspections and related
procedures in countries of origin, destination and trans-shipment points. Inspection procedures
may result in the seizure of the contents of our vessels, delays in the loading, offloading or
delivery of our vessels and the levying of customs duties, fines or other penalties against us.
 
It is possible that changes to inspection procedures could impose additional financial and legal
obligations on us. Changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and
obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of
cargo uneconomical or impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Maritime claimants could arrest one or more of our vessels, which could interrupt our cash flow.
 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties
may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In
many jurisdictions, a claimant may seek to obtain security for its claim by arresting a vessel
through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could
interrupt our cash flow and require us to pay large sums of money to have the arrest or
attachment lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the "sister ship"
theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimant's
maritime lien and any "associated" vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same
owner. Claimants could attempt to assert "sister ship" liability against a vessel in our fleet for
claims relating to another of our vessels.
 
Governments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency, resulting in a
loss of earnings.
 
A government could requisition one or more of our vessels for title or for hire. Requisition for title
occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes her owner, while requisition
for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes her
charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during periods of war or
emergency, although governments may elect to requisition vessels in other circumstances.
Although we would be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of our
vessels, the amount and timing of payment would be uncertain. Government requisition of one or
more of our vessels may negatively impact our revenues and reduce the amount of dividends, if
any, in the future.
17
In the highly competitive international shipping industry, we may not be able to compete for
charters with new entrants or established companies with greater resources and, as a result, we
may be unable to employ our vessels profitably.
 
We employ our vessels in a highly competitive market that is capital intensive and highly
fragmented. Competition arises primarily from other vessel owners, some of whom have
substantially greater resources than we do. Competition for the transportation of drybulk cargo by
sea is intense and depends on price, location, size, age, condition and the acceptability of the
vessel and its operators to the charterers. Due in part to the highly fragmented market,
competitors with greater resources could enter the drybulk shipping industry and operate larger
fleets through consolidations or acquisitions and may be able to offer lower charter rates and
higher quality vessels than we are able to offer. If we are unable to successfully compete with
other drybulk shipping companies, this would have an adverse impact on our results of
operations.
 
Risks associated with operating ocean-going vessels could affect our business and reputation,
which could adversely affect our revenues and stock price.
 
The operation of ocean-going vessels carries inherent risks. These risks include the possibility
of:
·marine disaster;
·environmental accidents;
·cargo and property losses or damage;
·business interruptions caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, political action
in various countries, labor strikes or adverse weather conditions; and
·piracy.
 
The involvement of our vessels in an environmental disaster may harm our reputation as a safe
and reliable vessel owner and operator. Any of these circumstances or events could increase our
costs or lower our revenues.
 
The shipping industry has inherent operational risks that may not be adequately covered by our
insurance.
 
We procure insurance for our fleet against risks commonly insured against by vessel owners and
operators. Our current insurance includes hull and machinery insurance, war risks insurance and
protection and indemnity insurance (which includes environmental damage and pollution
insurance). We may not be adequately insured against all risks or our insurers may not pay a
particular claim. Even if our insurance coverage is adequate to cover our losses, we may not be
able to timely obtain a replacement vessel in the event of a loss. Furthermore, in the future, we
may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates for our fleet. We may
also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on our own claim records but
also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through
which we receive indemnity insurance coverage for tort liability. Our insurance policies also
contain deductibles, limitations and exclusions which, although we believe are standard in the
shipping industry, may nevertheless increase our costs.
 
The operation of drybulk carriers has certain unique operational risks.
 
The operation of certain ship types, such as drybulk carriers, has certain unique risks. With a
drybulk carrier, the cargo itself and its interaction with the ship can be a risk factor. By their
nature, drybulk cargoes are often heavy, dense, easily shifted, and react badly to water exposure.
In addition, drybulk carriers are often subjected to battering treatment during unloading
operations with grabs, jackhammers (to pry encrusted cargoes out of the hold), and small
bulldozers. This treatment may cause damage to the vessel. Vessels damaged due to treatment
during unloading procedures may be more susceptible to breach to the sea. Furthermore, any
defects or flaws in the design of a drybulk carrier may contribute to vessel damage. Hull breaches
in drybulk carriers may lead to the flooding of the vessels holds. If a drybulk carrier suffers
flooding in its forward holds, the bulk cargo may become so dense and waterlogged that its
pressure may buckle the vessel's bulkheads, leading to the loss of a vessel. If we are unable to
adequately maintain our vessels we may be unable to prevent these events. Any of these
circumstances or events could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of
operations and our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future. In addition, the loss of any of our
vessels could harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel owner and operator.

Risk Factors Relating to the Offshore Drilling Industry
 
Our business in the offshore drilling sector depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and
gas industry, which is significantly affected by, among other things, volatile oil and gas prices and
may be materially and adversely affected by a decline in the offshore oil and gas industry.
 
The offshore contract drilling industry is cyclical and volatile. Our business in the offshore drilling
sector depends on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in
offshore areas worldwide. The availability of quality drilling prospects, exploration success,
relative production costs, the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory
environments affect customers' drilling programs. Oil and gas prices and market expectations of
potential changes in these prices also significantly affect this level of activity and demand for
drilling units.
Oil  and  gas  prices  are  extremely  volatile  and  are  affected  by  numerous  factors  beyond  our
control, including the following:
·worldwide production and demand for oil and gas and any geographical dislocations in supply
and demand;
·the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and gas;
·expectations regarding future energy prices;
·advances in exploration, development and production technology;
·the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to set and maintain
levels and pricing;
·the level of production in non-OPEC countries;
·government regulations;
·local and international political, economic and weather conditions;
·domestic and foreign tax policies;
·development and exploitation of alternative fuels;
·the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas
reserves; and
·the worldwide military and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting
from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities, insurrection or other crises in the
Middle East or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States, or
elsewhere.
19
Declines in oil and gas prices for an extended period of time, or market expectations of potential
decreases in  these  prices,  could  negatively  affect  our  business  in  the  offshore  drilling  sector.
Crude  oil  inventories  remain  at  high  levels  compared  to  historical  levels,  which  may  place
downward pressure on the price of crude oil and demand for offshore drilling units. Sustained
periods of low oil prices typically result in reduced exploration and drilling because oil and gas
companies'  capital  expenditure  budgets  are  subject  to  cash  flow  from  such  activities  and  are
therefore sensitive to changes in energy prices. These changes in commodity prices can have a
dramatic  effect  on  rig  demand,  and  periods  of  low  demand  can  cause  excess  rig  supply  and
intensify  the  competition  in  the  industry  which  often  results  in  drilling  units,  particularly  lower
specification drilling units, being idle for long periods of time. We cannot predict the future level of
demand  for  our  services  or  future  conditions  of  the  oil  and  gas  industry.  Any  decrease  in
exploration, development or production expenditures by oil and gas companies could reduce our
revenues and materially harm our business and results of operations.
 
In addition to oil and gas prices, the offshore drilling industry is influenced by additional factors,
including:
·the availability of competing offshore drilling vessels and the level of newbuilding activity for
drilling vessels;
·the level of costs for associated offshore oilfield and construction services;
·oil and gas transportation costs;
·the discovery of new oil and gas reserves;
·the cost of non-conventional hydrocarbons, such as the exploitation of oil sands; and
·regulatory restrictions on offshore drilling.
 
Any of these factors could reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our business and
results of operations.
 
The offshore drilling industry is highly competitive with intense price competition and, as a result,
we may be unable to compete successfully with other providers of contract drilling services that
have greater resources than we have.
 
The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with several industry participants,
none of which has a dominant market share, and is characterized by high capital and
maintenance requirements. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid
basis. Price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is
awarded the drilling contract, although drilling unit availability, location and suitability, the quality
and technical capability of service and equipment, reputation and industry standing are key
factors which are considered. Mergers among oil and natural gas exploration and production
companies have reduced, and may from time to time further reduce, the number of available
customers, which would increase the ability of potential customers to achieve pricing terms
favorable to them.
 
Many of our competitors in the offshore drilling industry are significantly larger than we are and
have more diverse drilling assets and significantly greater financial and other resources than we
have. In addition, because of our relatively small offshore drilling fleet, we may be unable to take
advantage of economies of scale to the same extent as some of our larger competitors. Given the
high capital requirements that are inherent in the offshore drilling industry, we may also be
unable to invest in new technologies or expand in the future as may be necessary for us to
succeed in this industry, while our larger competitors with superior financial resources, and in
many cases less leverage than we have, may be able to respond more rapidly to changing
market demands and compete more efficiently on price for drillship and drilling rig employment.
We may not be able to maintain our competitive position, and we believe that competition for
contracts will continue to be intense in the future. Our inability to compete successfully in the
offshore drilling industry may reduce our revenues and profitability.
20
An over-supply of drilling units may lead to a reduction in dayrates and therefore may materially
impact our profitability.
 
During  the  recent  period  of  high  utilization  and  high  dayrates,  industry  participants  have
increased  the  supply  of  drilling  units  by  ordering  the  construction  of  new  drilling  units.
Historically, this has resulted in an over-supply of drilling units and has caused a subsequent
decline  in  utilization  and  dayrates  when  the  drilling  units  enter  the  market,  sometimes  for
extended periods of time until the units have been absorbed into the active fleet. According to
industry sources, the worldwide fleet of ultra-deepwater drilling units as of August 2013 consisted
of 129 units, comprised of 60 semi-submersible rigs and 69 drillships. An additional 16 semi-
submersible rigs and 71 drillships were under construction or on order as of August 2013, which
would bring the total fleet to 216 drilling units by the end of 2020. A relatively large number of the
drilling  units  currently  under  construction  have  been  contracted  for  future  work,  which  may
intensify  price  competition  as  scheduled  delivery  dates  occur.  The  entry  into  service  of  these
new, upgraded or reactivated drilling units will increase supply and has already led to a reduction
in dayrates as drilling units are absorbed into the active fleet. In addition, the new construction of
high-specification drilling units, as well as changes in our competitors' drilling unit fleets, could
require us to make material additional capital investments to keep our fleet competitive. Lower
utilization and dayrates could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Prolonged periods
of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on our
drilling units if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at
the time, indicate that the carrying value of these drilling units may not be recoverable.
 
Consolidation of suppliers may increase the cost of obtaining supplies, which may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
We rely on certain third parties to provide supplies and services necessary for our offshore
drilling operations, including, but not limited to, drilling equipment suppliers and catering and
machinery suppliers. Recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting
in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. Such consolidation, combined with a high volume
of drilling units under construction, may result in a shortage of supplies and services thereby
increasing the cost of supplies and/or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on
time, or at all. These cost increases, delays or unavailability could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations and result in drilling unit downtime, and delays in the repair and
maintenance of our drilling units.
 
Our international operations in the offshore drilling sector involve additional risks, including
piracy, which could adversely affect our business.
 
Our drilling rigs and drillships, which we refer to collectively as our drilling units, operate in
various regions throughout the world. Our drilling rig, the Leiv Eiriksson commenced drilling
operations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, our drilling rig, the Eirik Raude, is mobilizing
from offshore Ireland to offshore West Africa, where it is expected to commence drilling
operations, our drillships, the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Mykonos, are operating
offshore Brazil and our drillships, the Ocean Rig Olympia and the Ocean Rig Poseidon, are
operating offshore West Africa and Angola, respectively.
In the past, the Eirik Raude has operated in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Canada, Norway, the
United Kingdom, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, while the Leiv Eiriksson has operated offshore
Greenland, West Africa, Turkey, Ireland, west of the Shetland Islands, the Falkland Islands and in
the North Sea, and the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Olympia have operated
offshore Greenland and West Africa, respectively. As a result of our international operations, we
may be exposed to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:
·terrorist and environmental activist acts, armed hostilities, war and civil disturbances;
·acts of piracy, which have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the
world such as the South China Sea and in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia and which
have generally increased significantly in frequency since 2008, particularly in the Gulf of Aden
and off the west coast of Africa;
·significant governmental influence over many aspects of local economies;
·seizure, nationalization or expropriation of property or equipment;
21
·limitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage, in certain areas;
·political unrest;
·foreign and U.S. monetary policy, government debt downgrades and potential defaults and
foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations;
·the inability to repatriate income or capital;
·complications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations;
·import-export quotas, wage and price controls, imposition of trade barriers;
·regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;
·changing taxation policies, including confiscatory taxation;
·other forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control; and
·governmental corruption.
·repudiation, nullification, modification or renegotiation of contracts;
 
In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in
countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to:
·the equipping and operation of drilling units;
·repatriation of foreign earnings;
·oil and gas exploration and development;
·taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and
·prevailing level of charter rates;
 
Some foreign governments favor or effectively require (i) the awarding of drilling contracts to local
contractors or to drilling rigs owned by their own citizens, (ii) the use of a local agent or (iii)
foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.
These practices may adversely affect our ability to compete in those regions. It is difficult to
predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect
the international drilling industry. The actions of foreign governments, including initiatives by
OPEC, may adversely affect our ability to compete. Failure to comply with applicable laws and
regulations, including those relating to sanctions and export restrictions, may subject us to
criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions or
seizures of assets.
 
Our business and operations involve numerous operating hazards.
 
Our offshore drilling operations are subject to hazards inherent in the drilling industry, such as
blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings,
equipment defects, punch throughs, craterings, fires, explosions and pollution, including spills
similar to the events on April 20, 2010 related to the Deepwater Horizon, in which we were not
involved. Contract drilling and well servicing require the use of heavy equipment and exposure to
hazardous conditions, which may subject us to liability claims by employees, customers and third
parties. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction
of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, claims by third parties or
customers and suspension of operations. Our offshore fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in
marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking,
grounding, collision, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations. Operations may
also be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, personnel
shortages or failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services.
22
Damage to the environment could also result from our operations, particularly through spillage of
fuel, lubricants or other chemicals and substances used in drilling operations, leaks and
blowouts or extensive uncontrolled fires. We may also be subject to property, environmental and
other damage claims by oil and gas companies. Our insurance policies and contractual
indemnity rights with our customers may not adequately cover losses, and we do not have
insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all the risks to which we are exposed. Consistent
with standard industry practice, our customers generally assume, and indemnify us against, well
control and subsurface risks under dayrate drilling contracts, including pollution damage in
connection with reservoir fluids stemming from operations under the contract, damage to the well
or reservoir, loss of subsurface oil and gas and the cost of bringing the well under control. We
generally indemnify our customers against pollution from substances in our control that originate
from the drilling unit (e.g., diesel used onboard the unit or other fluids stored onboard the unit and
above the water surface). However, our drilling contracts are individually negotiated, and the
degree of indemnification we receive from the customer against the liabilities discussed above
can vary from contract to contract, based on market conditions and customer requirements
existing when the contract was negotiated. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a
customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us
or will otherwise honor their contractual indemnity obligations. We maintain insurance coverage
for property damage, occupational injury and illness, and general and marine third-party
liabilities. However, pollution and environmental risks generally are not totally insurable.
Furthermore, we have no insurance coverage for named storms in the Gulf of Mexico and while
trading within war risks excluded areas.
 
Our insurance coverage relating to our offshore drilling operations may not adequately protect us
from certain operational risks inherent in the drilling industry.
 
Our insurance relating to our offshore drilling operations is intended to cover normal risks in our
current operations, including insurance against property damage, occupational injury and illness,
loss of hire, certain war risks and third-party liability, including pollution liability. For example, the
amount of risk we are subject to might increase regarding occupational injuries because on
January 12, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
could cover occupational injuries.
 
Insurance coverage may not, under certain circumstances, be available, and if available, may not
provide sufficient funds to protect us from all losses and liabilities that could result from our
operations. We have also obtained loss of hire insurance which becomes effective after 45 days
of downtime with coverage that extends for approximately one year. This loss of hire insurance is
recoverable only if there is physical damage to the rig or equipment which is caused by a peril
against which we are insured. The principal risks which may not be insurable are various
environmental liabilities and liabilities resulting from reservoir damage caused by our gross
negligence. Moreover, our insurance provides for premium adjustments based on claims and is
subject to deductibles and aggregate recovery limits. In the case of pollution liabilities, our
deductible is $10,000 per event and $250,000 for protection and indemnity claims brought before
any U.S. jurisdiction. The deductible for collision liability claims is $10,000. Our aggregate
recovery limit is $500.0 million for all claims arising out of any event covered by our protection
and indemnity insurance. Our deductible is $1.5 million per hull and machinery insurance claim.
In addition, insurance policies covering physical damage claims due to a named windstorm in
the Gulf of Mexico generally impose strict recovery limits. Our insurance coverage may not
protect fully against losses resulting from a required cessation of drilling unit operations for
environmental or other reasons. Insurance may not be available to us at all or on terms
acceptable to us, we may not maintain insurance or, if we are so insured, our policy may not be
adequate to cover our loss or liability in all cases. The occurrence of a casualty, loss or liability
against, which we may not be fully insured against, could significantly reduce our revenues,
make it financially impossible for us to obtain a replacement drilling unit or to repair a damaged
drilling unit, cause us to pay fines or damages which are generally not insurable and that may
have priority over the payment obligations under our indebtedness or otherwise impair our ability
to meet our obligations under our indebtedness and to operate profitably.
 
 
23
Governmental laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, may add to
our costs or limit our drilling activity.
 
Our business in the offshore drilling industry is affected by laws and regulations relating to the
energy industry and the environment in the geographic areas where we operate. The offshore
drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration and
production industry, and, accordingly, we are directly affected by the adoption of laws and
regulations that, for economic, environmental or other policy reasons, curtail exploration and
development drilling for oil and gas. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures
to comply with governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and
regulations may, in the future, add significantly to our operating costs or significantly limit drilling
activity. Our ability to compete in international contract drilling markets may be limited by foreign
governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or by
regulations requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a
particular jurisdiction. Governments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and
controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas, and other aspects of the
oil and gas industries. Offshore drilling in certain areas has been curtailed and, in certain cases,
prohibited because of concerns over protection of the environment. Operations in less developed
countries can be subject to legal systems that are not as mature or predictable as those in more
developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings.
 
To the extent new laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or
restrict offshore drilling or impose additional environmental protection requirements that result in
increased costs to the oil and gas industry, in general, or the offshore drilling industry, in
particular, our business or prospects could be materially adversely affected. The operation of our
drilling units will require certain governmental approvals, the number and prerequisites of which
cannot be determined until we identify the jurisdictions in which we will operate on securing
contracts for the drilling units. Depending on the jurisdiction, these governmental approvals may
involve public hearings and conditions that result in costly undertakings on our part. We may not
obtain such approvals or such approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner. If we fail to
timely secure the necessary approvals or permits, our customers may have the right to terminate
or seek to renegotiate their drilling contracts to our detriment. The amendment or modification of
existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations curtailing or further
regulating exploratory or development drilling and production of oil and gas could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Future earnings
may be negatively affected by compliance with any such new legislation or regulations.
 
We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations
that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.
 
Our offshore drilling operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the form of
international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and national and
international regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate or are
registered, which can significantly affect the ownership and operation of our drilling units. These
requirements include, but are not limited to, the International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution from Ships, or MARPOL, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution
Damage of 1969, generally referred to as CLC, the International Convention on Civil Liability for
Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, or Bunker Convention, the International Convention for the Safety
of Life at Sea of 1974, or SOLAS, the International Safety Management Code for the Safe
Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention, or ISM Code, the International Convention for
the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments in February 2004, or the
BWM Convention, the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, the U.S. Clean Water Act, the U.S.
Clean Air Act, the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the U.S. Maritime Transportation
Security Act of 2002, or the MTSA, European Union Regulations, and Brazil's National
Environmental Policy Law (6938/81), Environmental Crimes Law (9605/98) and Law (9966/2000)
relating to pollution in Brazilian waters.
 
Compliance with such laws, regulations and standards, where applicable, may require
installation of costly equipment or operational changes and may affect the resale value or useful
lives of our vessels. Moreover, the manner in which these laws are enforced and interpreted is
constantly evolving. We may also incur additional costs in order to comply with other existing and
future regulatory obligations, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air emissions, including
greenhouse gases, the management of ballast waters, maintenance and inspection,
development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance coverage or other
financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents. These costs could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil
penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations.
24
Environmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and
hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were
negligent or at fault. Under OPA, for example, owners, operators and bareboat charterers are
jointly and severally strictly liable for the discharge of oil in U.S. waters, including the 200-
nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the United States. An oil spill could result in
significant liability, including fines, penalties and criminal liability and remediation costs for
natural resource damages under other international and U.S. federal, state and local laws, as
well as third-party damages. We are required to satisfy insurance and financial responsibility
requirements for potential oil (including marine fuel) spills and other pollution incidents and our
insurance may not be sufficient to cover all such risks. As a result, claims against us could result
in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.
 
Although our drilling units are separately owned by our subsidiaries, under certain circumstances
a parent company and all of the ship-owning affiliates in a group under common control engaged
in a joint venture could be held liable for damages or debts owed by one of the affiliates,
including liabilities for oil spills under OPA or other environmental laws. Therefore, it is possible
that we could be subject to liability upon a judgment against us or any one of our subsidiaries.
 
Our drilling units could cause the release of oil or hazardous substances, especially as our
drilling units age. Any releases may be large in quantity, above our permitted limits or occur in
protected or sensitive areas where public interest groups or governmental authorities have
special interests. Any releases of oil or hazardous substances could result in fines and other
costs to us, such as costs to upgrade our drilling rigs, clean up the releases, and comply with
more stringent requirements in our discharge permits. Moreover, these releases may result in our
customers or governmental authorities suspending or terminating our operations in the affected
area, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and
financial condition.
 
If we are able to obtain from our customers some degree of contractual indemnification against
pollution and environmental damages in our contracts, such indemnification may not be
enforceable in all instances or the customer may not be financially able to comply with its
indemnity obligations in all cases. In addition, we may not be able to obtain such indemnification
agreements in the future.
 
Our insurance coverage may not be available in the future or we may not obtain certain
insurance coverage. If it is available and we have the coverage, it may not be adequate to cover
our liabilities. Any of these scenarios could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results and financial condition.
Regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our
business.
 
Currently, emissions of greenhouse gases from ships involved in international transport are not
subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to
implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As of January 1, 2013, all
ships (including rigs and drillships) must comply with mandatory requirements adopted by the
MEPC in July 2011 relating to greenhouse gas emissions. All ships are required to follow the
Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans. Now the minimum energy efficiency levels per
capacity mile, outlined in the Energy Efficiency Design Index, applies to all new ships. These
requirements could cause us to incur additional compliance costs. The IMO is planning to
implement market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships at an
upcoming MEPC session. The European Union has indicated that it intends to propose an
expansion of the existing European Union emissions trading scheme to include emissions of
greenhouse gases from marine vessels, and in January 2012 the European Commission
launched a public consultation on possible measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from
ships. In the United States, the EPA has issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the
public health and safety and has adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from
certain mobile sources and large stationary sources. Although the mobile source emissions
regulations do not apply to greenhouse gas emissions from vessels, such regulation of vessels is
foreseeable, and the EPA has in recent years received petitions from the California Attorney
General and various environmental groups seeking such regulation. Any passage of climate
control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, European Union, the U.S. or other
countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto
Protocol, that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant
financial expenditures which we cannot predict with certainty at this time.
25
Because our offshore drilling business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas
industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to
greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use
alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws,
regulations, treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and gas. In
addition, such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements could result in increased
compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have a negative impact on our
business.
 
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may result in more stringent laws and
regulations governing deepwater drilling, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results or financial condition.
 
On April 20, 2010, there was an explosion and a related fire on the Deepwater Horizon, an ultra-
deepwater semi-submersible drilling unit that is not connected to us, while it was servicing the
Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico. This catastrophic event resulted in the death of 11 workers
and the total loss of that drilling unit, as well as the release of large amounts of oil into the Gulf of
Mexico, severely impacting the environment and the region's key industries. This event is being
investigated by several federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, and by the
U.S. Congress, and is also the subject of numerous lawsuits. On January 11, 2011, the National
Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released its final report,
with recommendations for new regulations.
We do not currently operate our drilling units in these regions, but we may do so in the future. In
any event, changes to leasing and drilling activity requirements as a result of the Deepwater
Horizon incident could have a substantial impact on the offshore oil and gas industry worldwide.
All drilling activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico must be in compliance with enhanced safety
requirements contained in Notices to Lessees 2010-N05 and 2010 N-06. Effective October 22,
2012, all drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico must also comply with the Final Drilling Safety Rule
as adopted on August 15, 2012, which enhances safety measures for energy development on the
outer continental shelf. All drilling must also comply with the Workplace Safety Rule on Safety
and Environmental Management Systems. We continue to evaluate these requirements to
ensure that our rigs and equipment are in full compliance, where applicable. Additional
requirements could be forthcoming based on further recommendations by regulatory agencies
investigating the Macondo well incident.
 
We are not able to predict the extent of future leasing plans or the likelihood, nature or extent of
additional rulemaking. Nor are we able to predict when the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management (BOEM) will enter into leases with our customers or when the Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) will issue drilling permits to our customers. We are not able
to predict the future impact of these events on our operations. The current and future regulatory
environment in the Gulf of Mexico could impact the demand for drilling units in the Gulf of Mexico
in terms of overall number of rigs in operations and the technical specification required for
offshore rigs to operate in the Gulf of Mexico. It is possible that short-term potential migration of
rigs from the Gulf of Mexico could adversely impact dayrates levels and fleet utilization in other
regions. In addition, insurance costs across the industry have increased as a result of the
Macondo well incident and certain insurance coverage has become more costly, less available,
and not available at all from certain insurance companies.
Hurricanes may impact our ability to operate our drilling units in the Gulf of Mexico or other U.S.
coastal waters, which could reduce our revenues and profitability.
 
Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike caused damage to a number of drilling units
unaffiliated with us in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Drilling units that moved off their locations during
the hurricanes damaged platforms, pipelines, wellheads and other drilling units. BOEM and the
BSEE, the U.S. organizations that issue a significant number of relevant guidelines for the drilling
units' activities, have in place until November 1, 2014 guidelines for tie-downs on drilling units
and permanent equipment and facilities attached to outer continental shelf production platforms,
and moored drilling unit fitness. These guidelines effectively impose requirements on the
offshore oil and natural gas industry in an attempt to increase the likelihood of survival of offshore
drilling units during a hurricane. The guidelines also provide for enhanced information and data
requirements from oil and natural gas companies that operate properties in the Gulf of Mexico
region of the Outer Continental Shelf. BOEM and BSEE may issue similar guidelines for future
hurricane seasons and may take other steps that could increase the cost of operations or reduce
the area of operations for our ultra-deepwater drilling units, thereby reducing their marketability.
Implementation of new guidelines or regulations that may apply to ultra-deepwater drilling units
may subject us to increased costs and limit the operational capabilities of our drilling units. Our
drilling units do not currently operate in the Gulf of Mexico or other U.S. coastal waters but may
do so in the future.
26
Risk Factors Relating to the Tanker Industry
 
If the tanker industry, which historically has been cyclical and volatile, continues to be depressed
or declines further in the future, our revenues, earnings and available cash flow may be
adversely affected
 
Historically, the tanker industry has been highly cyclical, with volatility in profitability, charter rates
and asset values resulting from changes in the supply of, and demand for, tanker capacity. After
reaching highs during the summer of 2008, charter rates for crude oil carriers fell dramatically in
connection with the commencement of the global financial crisis and current rates continue to
remain at relatively low levels compared to the rates achieved in the years preceding the global
financial crisis. Fluctuations in charter rates and tanker values result from changes in the supply
of and demand for tanker capacity and changes in the supply of and demand for oil and oil
products.
 
The factors that influence demand for tanker capacity include:
·supply of and demand for oil and oil products;
·global and regional economic and political conditions, including developments in international
trade, national oil reserves policies, fluctuations in industrial and agricultural production and
armed conflicts, which, among other things, could impact the supply of oil as well as trading
patterns and the demand for various types of vessels;
·regional availability of refining capacity;
·environmental and other legal and regulatory developments;
·the distance oil and oil products are to be moved by sea;
·changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances over
which tanker cargoes are transported by sea;
·increases in the production of oil in areas linked by pipelines to consuming areas, the extension
of existing, or the development of new, pipeline systems in markets we may serve, or the
conversion of existing non-oil pipelines to oil pipelines in those markets;
·currency exchange rates;
·weather and acts of God and natural disasters;
·competition from alternative sources of energy and from other shipping companies and other
modes of transport;
·international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions, nationalizations, piracy and
wars; and
·regulatory changes including regulations adopted by supranational authorities and/or industry
bodies, such as safety and environmental regulations and requirements by major oil companies.
The factors that influence the supply of tanker capacity include:
·current and expected purchase orders for tankers;
27
·the number of tanker newbuilding deliveries;
·any potential delays in the delivery of newbuilding vessels and/or cancellations of newbuilding
orders;
·the scrapping rate of older tankers;
·the successful implementation of the phase-out of single-hull tankers;
·technological advances in tanker design and capacity;
·tanker freight rates, which are affected by factors that may effect the rate of newbuilding,
swapping and laying up of tankers;
·port and canal congestion;
·price of steel and vessel equipment;
·conversion of tankers to other uses or conversion of other vessels to tankers;
·the number of tankers that are out of service; and
·changes in environmental and other regulations that may limit the useful lives of tankers.
The factors affecting the supply of and demand for tankers have been volatile and are outside of
our control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are
unpredictable, including those discussed above. The current global economic downturn may
reduce demand for transportation of oil over longer distances and increase supply of tankers to
carry that oil, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, and cash flows.
 
If the number of new ships delivered exceeds the number of tankers being scrapped and lost,
tanker capacity will increase. In addition the total newbuilding order books for Suezmax and
Aframax vessels scheduled to enter the fleet through 2013 currently stand at 5.0% and 1.6%
respectively, and there can be no assurance that the order books will not increase further in
proportion to the existing fleets. If the supply of tanker capacity increases and the demand for
tanker capacity does not increase correspondingly, charter rates could materially decline and the
value of our vessels could be adversely affected.
 
The market value of our vessels may fluctuate significantly, and we may incur losses when we
sell vessels following a decline in their market value.
 
The fair market value of our tanker vessels may have declined recently, and may decrease
further depending on a number of factors including:
·general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry;
·competition from other shipping companies;
·supply of and demand for tankers and the types and sizes of tankers we own;
·alternative modes of transportation;
·ages of vessels;
·cost of newbuildings;
·governmental or other regulations;
28
·prevailing level of charter rates; and
·technological advances.
 
Declines in charter rates and other market deterioration could cause the market value of our
vessels to decrease significantly. We evaluate the carrying amounts of our vessels to determine if
events have occurred that would require an impairment of their carrying amounts. The
recoverable amount of vessels is reviewed based on events and changes in circumstances that
would indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recovered. The review for
potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is
complex and requires us to make various estimates including future freight rates, earnings from
the vessels and discount rates.  All of these items have been historically volatile.
 
We evaluate the recoverable amount as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in
use.  If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount of the vessel, the vessel is
deemed impaired.  The carrying values of our vessels may not represent their fair market value at
any point in time because the new market prices of secondhand vessels tend to fluctuate with
changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings.  Any impairment charges incurred as a
result of further declines in charter rates could negatively affect our business, financial condition
or operating results.
 
Due to the cyclical nature of the tanker market, the market value of one or more of our vessels
may at various times be lower than their book value, and sales of those vessels during those
times would result in losses.  If we determine at any time that a vessel's future limited useful life
and earnings require us to impair its value on our financial statements, that could result in a
charge against our earnings and the reduction of our shareholders' equity.  If for any reason we
sell vessels at a time when vessel prices have fallen, the sale proceeds may be at less than the
vessel's carrying amount on our financial statements, with the result that we would also incur a
loss and a reduction in earnings.
 
Declining tanker values could affect our ability to raise cash by limiting our ability to refinance
vessels and thereby adversely impact our liquidity.  In addition, declining vessel values could
result in the reduction in lending commitments, the pledging of unencumbered vessels as
additional collateral, the requirement to repay outstanding amounts or a breach of loan
covenants, which could give rise to an event of default under our credit facilities.
 
Changes in the crude oil and petroleum products markets could result in decreased demand for
our vessels and services.
 
Demand for our vessels and services in transporting crude oil and petroleum products will
depend upon world and regional crude oil and petroleum products markets. Any decrease in
shipments of crude oil or petroleum products in those markets could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Historically, those markets
have been volatile as a result of the many conditions and events that affect the price, production
and transport of crude oil and petroleum products, including competition from alternative energy
sources. In the long-term it is possible that crude oil and petroleum products demand may be
reduced by an increased reliance on alternative energy sources, by a drive for increased
efficiency in the use of crude oil and petroleum products as a result of environmental concerns, or
by high oil prices. The recent recession affecting the U.S. and world economies may result in
protracted reduced consumption of crude oil and petroleum products and a decreased demand
for our vessels and lower charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends.
 
An over-supply of tanker capacity may prolong currently low charter rates and vessel values or
lead to further reductions in charter rates, vessel values, and profitability.
 
The market supply of tankers is affected by a number of factors such as demand for energy
resources, oil, and petroleum products, as well as strong overall economic growth in parts of the
world economy including Asia. If the capacity of new ships delivered exceeds the capacity of
tankers being scrapped and lost, tanker capacity will increase. In addition, the tanker
newbuilding order book, which extends to 2016, equaled approximately 9.8% of the existing
world oil tanker fleet as of August 1,  2013, according to industry sources and the order book may
increase further in proportion to the existing fleet. If the supply of tanker capacity increases and if
the demand for tanker capacity does not increase correspondingly, charter rates could materially
decline. A reduction in charter rates and the value of our vessels may have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and available cash once we take delivery of our newbuilding
tankers.
29
The tanker sector is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully for
charters with new entrants or established companies with greater resources.
 
The tanker industry is highly competitive, capital intensive and highly fragmented. Competition
arises primarily from other vessel owners, some of whom have substantially greater resources
than we do. Competition for the transportation of petroleum products and oil can be intense and
depends on price, location, size, age, condition and the acceptability of the vessel and its
operators to the charterers. Due in part to the highly fragmented market, competitors with greater
resources than we have could operate larger fleets than our tanker fleet and, thus, may be able to
offer lower charter rates and higher quality vessels than we are able to offer. If this were to occur,
we may be unable to attract new customers, which could adversely affect our business and
operations.
 
Our operating results may be adversely affected by seasonal fluctuations in the tanker industry.
 
The tanker sector has historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and, as a result, in
charter rates. This seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results.
The tanker sector is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased
consumption of oil and petroleum products in the northern hemisphere during the winter months.
As a result, our revenues from our tankers may be weaker during the fiscal quarters ended June
30 and September 30, and, conversely, revenues may be stronger in fiscal quarters ended
December 31 and March 31. This seasonality could materially affect our operating results and
cash available for dividends in the future.
 
Company Specific Risk Factors
 
We are not in compliance with certain financial and other covenants contained in our credit
facilities relating to our shipping segments, which could adversely affect our business.
 
Our credit facilities require us to satisfy certain financial covenants. In general, these financial
covenants require us, as Dryships, on a consolidated level, to maintain (i) minimum liquidity; (ii) a
minimum market adjusted equity ratio; (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio; (iv) a minimum
market adjusted net worth; (v) a minimum debt service coverage ratio and (vi) a minimum working
capital level.  In addition, certain of our facilities require us to satisfy certain financial covenants at
a certain subsidiary level. In addition, our credit facilities, which are secured by mortgages on our
vessels and drillships, require us to maintain specified financial ratios, mainly to ensure that the
market value of the mortgaged vessels and drillships under the applicable credit facility,
determined in accordance with the terms of that facility, does not fall below a certain percentage
of the outstanding amount of the loan, which we refer to as a value maintenance clause or a loan-
to-value ratio.  Events beyond our control, including changes in the economic and business
conditions in the international drybulk, tanker or offshore drilling markets in which we operate,
may affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants and loan-to-value ratios required by
our credit facilities. Our ability to maintain compliance also depends substantially on the value of
our assets, our charterhire and dayrates, our ability to obtain charters and drilling contracts, our
success at keeping our costs low and our ability to successfully implement our overall business
strategy.
 
A violation of any of the financial covenants in our credit facilities, absent a waiver of the breach
from our lenders, or a violation of the loan-to-value ratios in our credit facilities, if not waived by
our lenders or cured by providing additional collateral or prepaying the amount of outstanding
indebtedness required to eliminate the shortfall, could result in an event of default under our
credit facilities that would allow all amounts outstanding thereunder to be declared immediately
due and payable. In addition, all of our credit facilities relating to our drybulk and tanker fleet
contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions that may be triggered by a default under
one of our other credit facilities relating to our drybulk and tanker fleet. Furthermore, our debt
agreements relating to our offshore drilling fleet also contain cross-default or cross-acceleration
provisions that may be triggered by a default under one of our other debt agreements relating to
our offshore drilling fleet.  If the amounts outstanding under our indebtedness relating to our
drybulk and tanker fleet or our offshore drilling fleet were to be become accelerated or were to
become the subject of foreclosure actions, we cannot assure you that our assets would be
sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders.
30
As of June 30, 2013, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained our debt
agreements relating to our offshore drilling segment, but we were in breach of certain financial
covenants, mainly the interest coverage ratio, contained in our loan agreements relating to our
shipping segments, under which a total of $804.8 million was outstanding as of June 30, 2013.
Even though as of the date of registration statement, none of the lenders had declared an event
of default under the relevant loan agreements for which we were not in compliance as of June 30,
2013, these breaches constitute potential events of default that may result in the lenders requiring
immediate repayment of the loans. As a result of the aforementioned non-compliance and due to
the cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions contained in our credit facilities relating to our
drybulk and tanker fleet, all of our outstanding indebtedness relating to our drybulk and tanker
fleet, amounting to approximately $1,058.1 million as of June 30, 2013, has been classified as
current.  As a result, we reported a working capital deficit of $679.2 million at June 30, 2013.
 
In addition, as of June 30, 2013, we were not in compliance with the loan-to-value ratios
contained in certain of our credit facilities relating to our drybulk fleet, under which a total of $59.0
million was outstanding as of that date, out of our total consolidated outstanding indebtedness
relating to our drybulk and tanker fleet of approximately $1,058.1 million.  As discussed above,
these violations of the loan-to-value covenants do not constitute events of default that would
automatically trigger the full repayment of the loans. Under the terms of the credit facilities, loan-
to-value shortfalls may be remedied by us by providing additional collateral or repaying the
amount of the shortfall.  On August 1, 2013, we have agreed with our lenders under two of our
credit facilities, under which a total of $87.2 million was outstanding as of June 30, 2013, to
waive the breach of the loan-to-value ratios under the facilities to December 31, 2013, in
exchange for, among other things, the pledge of 5,450,000 shares of Ocean Rig UDW Inc., or
Ocean Rig UDW, our majority-owned subsidiary, as additional collateral securing the loans.  As
a result of our breaches of the loan-to-value ratios in certain of our credit facilities, we may be
required to prepay indebtedness or provide additional collateral to our lenders in the form of cash
or other property in the total amount of $19.7 million in order to comply with the relevant loan-to-
value ratios. In addition, on September 27, 2012, we entered into supplemental agreements
under two of our credit facilities, under which a total of $245.7 million was outstanding as of June
30, 2013, to provide additional security to cure shortfalls in the loan-to-value ratio required to be
maintained under the facilities and pledged 7,800,000 common shares of Ocean Rig UDW, our
majority-owned subsidiary, that we own as additional collateral under the facilities. The term of
the share pledge expires on September 16, 2013.  Furthermore, we have entered into an
amendment to one of our credit facilities to reduce the loan-to-value ratio required to be
maintained under the facility until 2016. There can be no assurance that we will be in compliance
with the loan-to-value ratios contained in these credit facilities when the share pledge expires or
the original covenant comes back into effect or that the relevant lenders would permit further
amendments to the collateral arrangements with respect to future breaches of the loan-to-value
ratios.
 
We are currently in negotiations with our lenders to obtain waivers of our covenant breaches and
extend existing waivers of covenant breaches, or to restructure the affected debt. We cannot
guarantee that we will be able to obtain our lenders' waiver or consent, or extensions of existing
waivers, with respect to the aforementioned noncompliance under our credit facilities relating to
our drybulk and tanker fleet, or any non-compliance with specified financial ratios or financial
covenants under future financial obligations we may enter into, or that we will be able to
refinance or restructure any such indebtedness.  If we fail to remedy, or obtain a waiver of, the
breaches of the covenants discussed above, our lenders may accelerate our indebtedness under
the relevant credit facilities, which could trigger the cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions
contained in our other credit facilities relating to our drybulk and tanker fleet, under which a total
of $1,058.1 million was outstanding as of June 30, 2013. If our indebtedness is accelerated, it will
be very difficult in the current financing environment for us to refinance our debt or obtain
additional financing and we could lose our vessels if our lenders foreclose their liens, which
would impair our ability to conduct our business and continue as a going concern. Further, as
discussed below, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued its opinion with
an explanatory paragraph in connection with our audited financial statements included in this
report that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In
addition, if the value of our vessels deteriorates significantly from their currently depressed levels,
we may have to record an impairment adjustment to our financial statements, which would
adversely affect our financial results and further hinder our ability to raise capital.
31
Moreover, in connection with any additional amendments to our credit facilities, or waivers or
extensions of waivers of covenant breaches, that we obtain, or if we enter into any future credit
agreements or debt instruments, our lenders may impose additional operating and financial
restrictions on us. These restrictions may further restrict our ability to, among other things, fund
our operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities,
which in turn may adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, our lenders may require the
payment of additional fees, require prepayment of a portion of our indebtedness to them,
accelerate the amortization schedule for our indebtedness and increase the margin and lending
rates they charge us on our outstanding indebtedness.
We expect that our lenders will not demand payment of the loans relating to our drybulk and
tanker fleet under which we are in breach of certain financial and loan-to-value ratio covenants
before their maturity, provided that we pay scheduled loan installments and accumulated or
accrued interest as they fall due under the existing credit facilities. We plan to settle the loan
interest and scheduled loan repayments with cash expected to be generated from operations and
firm financing agreements that are currently in place.   We do not expect that cash on hand and
cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to repay our loans relating to our
drybulk and tanker fleet with cross-default provisions which amounted to approximately $1,058.1
million in the aggregate as of June 30, 2013, if such debt is accelerated by our lenders, as
discussed above. In such a scenario, we would have to seek to access the capital markets to
fund the mandatory payments.
 
Our inability to comply with certain financial and other covenants under our loan agreements
relating to our shipping segments and our working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
As of June 30, 2013, we were in breach of certain financial and other covenants contained in our
loan agreements relating to our shipping segments and our lenders may choose to accelerate
our indebtedness relating to such segments. As a result, we reported a working capital deficit of
$679.2 million at June 30, 2013. Therefore, our ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent on management's ability to successfully generate revenue and enter into firm
financing agreements to meet our scheduled obligations as they become due and the continued
support of our lenders. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued its opinion
with an explanatory paragraph in connection with our financial statements included in our Annual
Report for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was filed with the Commission on March
22, 2013 that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may
result from the outcome of our inability to continue as a going concern except for the shipping
segments' bank debt and the restricted cash classification under current liabilities and current
assets, respectively. These conditions raise significant doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern and, therefore, we may be unable to realize our assets and discharge our
liabilities in the normal course of business.
 
Our credit facilities impose operating and financial restrictions on us, and if we receive additional
waivers of covenant breaches and/or further amend our loan agreements in the future, our
lenders may impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us and/or modify the terms
of our existing credit facilities.
In addition to the loan-to-value ratio requirements and financial covenants relating to our financial
position, operating performance and liquidity contained in our credit facilities, our credit facilities
also contain restrictions on our ability to, among other things:
·enter into other financing arrangements;
·incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;
·create or permit liens on our assets;
·consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of our all or substantially all of our assets or the
shares of our subsidiaries;
·make investments;
32
·change the general nature of our business;
·pay dividends, redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness or make other restricted
payments;
·incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting the restricted subsidiaries under the
indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes (as defined below);
·change the management and/or ownership of our vessels and drilling units;
·enter into transactions with affiliates;
·transfer or sell assets;
·amend, modify or change our organizational documents;
·make capital expenditures;
·change the flag, class or management of our vessels or drilling units;
·drop below certain minimum cash deposits, as defined in our credit facilities; and
·compete effectively to the extent our competitors are subject to less onerous restrictions.
 
Therefore, we will need to seek permission from our lenders in order to engage in certain
corporate and commercial actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business,
and a denial of permission may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business
strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Our lenders'
interests may be different from our interests, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to
obtain our lenders' permission when needed. In addition to the above restrictions, our lenders
may require the payment of additional fees, require prepayment of a portion of our indebtedness
to them, accelerate the amortization schedule for our indebtedness and increase the interest
rates they charge us on our outstanding indebtedness. These potential restrictions and
requirements may limit our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future to you, finance our future
operations, make acquisitions or pursue business opportunities.
 
Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit facilities may be
affected by economic, financial and industry conditions and other factors beyond our control. Any
default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our credit
facilities, that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of
such indebtedness, could prevent us from paying dividends in the future. If we are unable to
repay indebtedness, the lenders under our credit facilities could proceed against the collateral
securing that indebtedness. In any such case, we may be unable to repay the amounts due under
our credit facilities. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results
of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent. Our ability to comply with
these covenants in future periods will also depend substantially on the value of our assets, our
charter rates and dayrates, our ability to obtain charters and drilling contracts, our success at
keeping our costs low and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy.
Any future credit agreement or amendment or debt instrument may contain similar or more
restrictive covenants.
 
We  have  substantial  indebtedness,  and  expect  to  incur  substantial  additional  indebtedness,
which could adversely affect our financial health.
 
As of June 30, 2013, on a consolidated basis, we had $4.6 billion in aggregate principal amount
of indebtedness outstanding and $1.35 billion in additional credit available to us under our credit
facilities. In July 2013, we entered into a $1.9 billion senior secured term loan facility and repaid
in full amounts outstanding under Ocean Rig's $800.0 million secured term loan agreement and
the two $495.0 million senior secured credit facilities. In addition, we expect to incur substantial
additional indebtedness in order to fund the estimated remaining unfinanced contractual
obligations, excluding financing costs, amounting to $511.5 million in the aggregate for one of
our newbuilding drillships and 4 newbuilding drybulk vessels as of August  19, 2013 and any
further growth of our fleet.
33
This substantial level of debt and other obligations could have significant adverse consequences
on our business and future prospects, including the following:
 
 ·we may not be able to satisfy our financial obligations under our indebtedness and our
contractual and commercial commitments, which may result in possible defaults on and
acceleration of such indebtedness;
·we may not be able to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes;
·we may not be able to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must
dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service the debt;
·we could become more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions,
including increases in interest rates, particularly given our substantial indebtedness, some of
which bears interest at variable rates;
·our ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase;
·less leveraged competitors could have a competitive advantage because they have lower debt
service requirements and, as a result, we may not be better positioned to withstand economic
downturns; and
·we may be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to
changes in market or industry conditions than our competitors and our management's discretion
in operating our business may be limited.
Each of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and
viability. Our ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial
and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and
financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our
operating income is not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced
to take actions such as reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or
capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional
equity capital. Any or all of these actions may be insufficient to allow us to service our debt
obligations. Further, we may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms, or
at all. In addition, a lack of liquidity in the debt and equity markets could hinder our ability to
refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on favorable terms in the future.
 
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and other
obligations due to events beyond our control.
 
Our ability to make scheduled payments on our outstanding indebtedness will depend on our
ability to generate cash from operations in the future. Our future financial and operating
performance will be affected by a range of economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, business
and other factors that we cannot control, such as general economic and financial conditions in
the drybulk and tanker shipping and offshore drilling industries or the economy generally. In
particular, our ability to generate steady cash flow will depend on our ability to secure time
charters and drilling contracts at acceptable rates. Our ability to renew our existing time charters
and drilling contracts or obtain new time charters and drilling contracts at acceptable charterhire
and dayrates or at all will depend on the prevailing economic and competitive conditions.
 
Furthermore, our financial and operating performance, and our ability to service our
indebtedness, is also dependent on our subsidiaries' ability to make distributions to us, whether
in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. The timing and amount of such distributions will
depend on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, fleet renewal
and expansion, restrictions in our various debt agreements, the provisions of Marshall Islands
law affecting the payment of dividends and other factors.
34
If our operating cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and to fund our other liquidity
needs, we may be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures,
selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, seeking additional capital, or any
combination of the foregoing. We cannot assure you that any of these actions could be effected
on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that they would yield sufficient funds to make required payments
on our outstanding indebtedness and to fund our other liquidity needs. Also, the terms of existing
or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these actions. Furthermore,
reducing or delaying capital expenditures or selling assets could impair future cash flows and our
ability to service our debt in the future.
 
If for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be
in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness, which would allow
creditors at that time to declare all such indebtedness then outstanding to be due and payable.
This would likely in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights among certain of our
other debt agreements. Under these circumstances, lenders could compel us to apply all of our
available cash to repay borrowings or they could prevent us from making payments on the notes.
If the amounts outstanding under our existing and future debt agreements were to be accelerated,
or were the subject of foreclosure actions, we cannot assure you that our assets would be
sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders.
 
The failure of our counterparties to meet their obligations under our time charter agreements
could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business.
 
As of August 19, 2013, 19 of our drybulk vessels were employed under time charters and 19
vessels were operating in the spot market. The ability and willingness of each of our
counterparties to perform its obligations under a time charter agreement with us will depend on a
number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general
economic conditions, the condition of the drybulk shipping industry and the overall financial
condition of the counterparties. In addition, in challenging market conditions, there have been
reports of charterers, including some of our charterers, renegotiating their charters or defaulting
on their obligations under charters and our customers may fail to pay charterhire or attempt to
renegotiate charter rates.
 
Three of our drybulk vessels, the Capri, Samatan and Capitola are currently on short term (spot)
charters to Korea Line Corp., or KLC, a South Korean shipping company that announced on
January 25, 2011 it had filed a petition for the rehabilitation proceeding for court receivership in
the Seoul Central District Court, and the court had issued a preservation order. We were entitled
to a rate of $61,000, $39,500 and $39,500 per day under our charters with KLC for the vessels
Capri, Samatan and Capitola, respectively, which were scheduled to expire between May 2013
and June 2018. On February 15, 2011, KLC's application was approved by the Seoul Court, and
Joint Receivers of KLC were appointed. Upon and with effect from March 14, 2011, the
shipowning companies' original charter agreements with KLC were terminated by the Joint
Receivers, and the shipowning companies entered into new short term charter agreements with
the Joint Receivers at reduced rates of hire and others terms, with the approval of the Seoul
Court. On April 1, 2011, the shipowning companies filed claims in the corporate rehabilitation of
KLC for (i) outstanding hire due under the original charter agreements, and (ii) damages and loss
caused by the early termination of the original charter agreements. During 2012, the new
charterparties, were terminated on agreed terms.
 
Eleven of the vessels in our fleet provide for charter rates that are significantly above current
market rates. Should any of our counterparties under these charters fail to honor its obligations
under our charter agreements, it may be difficult to secure substitute employment for such
vessels, and any new charter arrangements we secure in the spot market or on time charters
could be at lower rates given currently decreased charter rate levels, particularly in the drybulk
carrier market. If our charterers fail to meet their obligations to us or attempt to renegotiate our
charter agreements, we could sustain significant losses which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our
ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future, and comply with covenants in our credit facilities.
 
 
35
Some of our offshore drilling contracts may be terminated early due to certain events.
 
Some of our customers under our drilling contracts have the right to terminate our drilling
contracts upon the payment of an early termination or cancellation fee. However, such payments
may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. In addition, our contracts permit our
customers to terminate the contracts early without the payment of any termination fees under
certain circumstances, including as a result of major non-performance, longer periods of
downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or sustained
periods of downtime due to piracy or force majeure events beyond our control.
 
In addition, during periods of challenging market conditions, our customers may no longer need a
drilling unit that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable drilling unit at a
lower dayrate. As a result, we may be subject to an increased risk of our clients seeking to
renegotiate the terms of their existing contracts or repudiate their contracts, including through
claims of non-performance. Our customers' ability to perform their obligations under their drilling
contracts with us may also be negatively impacted by the prevailing uncertainty surrounding the
development of the world economy and the credit markets. If our customers cancel some of our
contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially
similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our
contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
Our future contracted revenue for our fleet of drilling units may not be ultimately realized.
 
As of August 19, 2013, the future contracted revenue for our fleet of drilling units, or our drilling
contract backlog, was approximately $4.7 billion under firm commitments. We may not be able to
perform under our drilling contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may
seek to cancel or renegotiate our drilling contracts for various reasons, including adverse
conditions, resulting in lower daily rates. For example, effective March 3, 2013, one of our
customers, European Hydrocarbons Limited, or European Hydrocarbons, unilaterally cancelled
our drilling contract for the Eirik Raude for drilling offshore West Africa prior to the scheduled
termination date. Our inability, or the inability of our customers, to perform under the respective
contractual obligations may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.
 
Most of our offshore drilling contracts may be terminated early due to certain events.
 
Under most of our current drilling contracts, our customers have the right to terminate the drilling
contract upon the payment of an early termination or cancellation fee. However, such payments
may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. For example, European Hydrocarbons,
our customer under our drilling contract for the Eirik Raude for drilling operations offshore West
Africa, unilaterally cancelled the contract effective March 3, 2013, approximately 23 days prior to
the contract's scheduled termination date.  In connection with the cancellation of the contract, we
are entitled to an early termination fee of $13.7 million.  As a result of the cancellation, we will not
receive approximately $14.1 million in estimated contract revenues, after giving effect to the early
termination payment.
 
In addition, our drilling contracts permit our customers to terminate the contracts early without the
payment of any termination fees under certain circumstances, including as a result of major non-
performance, longer periods of downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or
operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to piracy or force majeure events
beyond our control.
 
In addition, during periods of challenging market conditions, our customers may no longer need a
drilling unit that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable drilling unit at a
lower dayrate. As a result, we may be subject to an increased risk of our clients seeking to
renegotiate the terms of their existing contracts or repudiate their contracts, including through
claims of non-performance. Our customers' ability to perform their obligations under their drilling
contracts with us may also be negatively impacted by the prevailing uncertainty surrounding the
development of the world economy and the credit markets. If our customers cancel some of our
contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially
similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our
contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
36
We  are  dependent  on  spot  charters  and  any  decrease  in  spot  charter  rates  in  the  future  may
adversely affect our earnings.
 
We currently operate a fleet of 38 drybulk vessels, of which 19 vessels are employed in the spot
market, exposing us to fluctuations in spot market charter rates. In addition, we currently employ
nine of our tankers in the spot market and one in the pool market. We have also agreed to
acquire 4 newbuilding drybulk vessels, which are expected to be delivered to us between April
2014 and August 2014, some of which may be employed in the spot market upon their delivery to
us. In addition, we may employ in the spot market any additional vessels that we may acquire in
the future or existing vessels upon the expiration of related time charters.
 
Although the number of vessels in our fleet that participate in the spot market will vary from time
to time, we anticipate that a significant portion of our fleet will participate in this market. As a
result, our financial performance will be significantly affected by conditions in the drybulk and oil
tanker spot market and only our vessels that operate under fixed-rate time charters may, during
the period such vessels operate under such time charters, provide a fixed source of revenue to
us.
 
Historically, the drybulk and tanker markets have been volatile as a result of the many conditions
and factors that can affect the price, supply of and demand for drybulk and tanker capacity. The
recent global economic crisis may further reduce demand for transportation of drybulk cargoes
and oil over longer distances and supply of drybulk vessels and tankers to carry such drybulk
cargoes and oil, respectively, which may materially affect our revenues, profitability and cash
flows. The spot charter market may fluctuate significantly based upon supply of and demand of
vessels and cargoes. The successful operation of our vessels in the competitive spot charter
market depends upon, among other things, obtaining profitable spot charters and minimizing, to
the extent possible, time spent waiting for charters and time spent traveling unladen to pick up
cargo. The spot market is very volatile, and, in the past, there have been periods when spot rates
have declined below the operating cost of vessels. If future spot charter rates decline, then we
may be unable to operate our vessels trading in the spot market profitably, meet our obligations,
including payments on indebtedness, or to pay dividends in the future. Furthermore, as charter
rates for spot charters are fixed for a single voyage, which may last up to several weeks, during
periods in which spot charter rates are rising, we will generally experience delays in realizing the
benefits from such increases.
 
Our ability to renew the charters on our vessels upon the expiration or termination of our current
charters, seven of which are scheduled to expire in 2013, or on vessels that we may acquire in
the future, the charter rates payable under any replacement charters and vessel values will
depend upon, among other things, economic conditions in the sectors in which our vessels
operate at that time, changes in the supply and demand for vessel capacity and changes in the
supply and demand for the seaborne transportation of energy resources.
 
A drop in spot charter rates may provide an incentive for some charterers to default on their
charters
 
When we enter into a time charter, charter rates under that charter are fixed for the term of the
charter. If the spot charter rates or short-term time charter rates in the drybulk shipping industry
remain significantly lower than the time charter equivalent rates that some of our charterers are
obligated to pay us under our existing charters, the charterers may have incentive to default
under that charter or attempt to renegotiate the charter. If our charterers fail to pay their
obligations, we would have to attempt to re-charter our vessels at lower charter rates, which
would affect our ability to operate our vessels profitably and may affect our ability to comply with
covenants contained in any loan agreements we may enter into in the future.
 
We depend upon the spot market in our tanker segment and any decrease in spot charter rates
may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
We currently employ all of our tankers in the spot market, including one Aframax tanker which
operates in Sigma tankers pools. As a result, our results of operations in our tanker segment will
be significantly affected by conditions in the oil tanker spot market. The spot market is highly
volatile and fluctuates based on tanker and oil supply and demand. The successful operation of
our tankers in the spot market depends on, among other things, our commercial and technical
manager's ability to obtain profitable charters and minimizing, to the extent possible, time spent
waiting for charters and traveling unladen to pick up cargo. In the past, there have been periods
when spot rates have declined below operating costs of vessels. Future spot rates may decline
significantly and may not be sufficient for us to operate our tankers profitably, which would have
an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
37
The tanker sector is currently at depressed levels and conditions in the tanker market could have
an adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.
 
In November 2010, we expanded into the oil tanker sector with our entry into construction
contracts for six Aframax and six Suezmax high specification tankers. We have taken delivery of
all six of the newbuilding Aframax tankers and four of the newbuilding Suezmax tankers and
have novated the construction contracts for the remaining two Suezmax tankers to an unaffiliated
third party in order to release ourselves from our obligations under the construction contracts for
these two tankers and reduce the amount of our outstanding capital expenditures. The charter
markets for crude oil carriers and product tankers have deteriorated significantly since summer
2008 and are currently at depressed levels. These markets may be further depressed through
2014 given the significant number of newbuilding vessels scheduled to be delivered. Attractive
investment opportunities in these sectors may reflect these depressed conditions, however, the
return on any such investment is highly uncertain in this extremely challenging operating
environment.
 
The tanker sector, which is intensely competitive, has unique operational risks and is highly
dependent on the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products as well as
being significantly impacted by the availability of modern tanker capacity and the scrapping,
conversion or loss of older vessels. An inability to successfully execute an expansion into the
tanker sector could be costly, distract us from our drybulk and offshore drilling business and
divert management resources, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business,
results of operation and financial condition.
 
Our ability to establish oil tanker industry relationships and a reputation for customer service and
safety, as well as to acquire and renew charters, will depend on a number of factors, including
our ability to man our vessels with experienced oil tanker crews and the ability to manage such
risks. There is no assurance that we will be able to address the variety of vessel management
risks in the oil tanker sector or to develop and maintain commercial relationships with leading
charter companies, which could adversely affect our expansion into the oil tanker sector.
 
Declines in charter rates and other market deterioration could cause us to incur impairment
charges.
 
The Company reviews for impairment long-lived assets and intangible long-lived assets held and
used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable. When the estimate of undiscounted cash flows, excluding
interest charges, expected to be generated by the use of the asset is less than its carrying
amount, the Company evaluates the asset for impairment loss. The impairment loss is
determined by the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the fair value of the
asset. In developing estimates of future undiscounted cash flows, the Company makes
assumptions and estimates about the vessels', rigs' and drillships' future performance, with the
significant assumptions being related to charter and drilling rates, fleet utilization, operating
expenses, capital expenditures, residual value and the estimated remaining useful life of each
vessel, rig and drillship. The assumptions used to develop estimates of future undiscounted cash
flows are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. The projected net operating
cash flows are determined by considering the charter revenues and drilling revenues from
existing time charters and drilling contracts for the fixed fleet days and an estimated daily time
charter equivalent for the unfixed days. In making estimates concerning the daily time charter
equivalent for the unfixed days, the Company utilizes the most recent ten year historical average
for similar vessels and other available market data over the remaining estimated life of the
vessel, assumed to be 25 years from the delivery of the vessel from the shipyard.
 
As a result of the impairment review, the Company determined that the carrying amounts of its
assets held for use were recoverable, and therefore, concluded that no impairment loss was
necessary for 2010, 2011 and 2012. However, due to the Company's decision to sell certain
vessels during the years and or subsequent to the balance sheet dates and based on the agreed-
upon sales price, an impairment charge of $3.6 million, $144.7 million and $0 million, for each of
the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, was recognized. In addition,
during the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, the Company incurred impairment losses of
$43.5 million due to the decision to sell certain newbuildings.
38
Although the Company believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are
reasonable  and  appropriate,  such  assumptions  are  highly  subjective.  Set  forth  below  is  an
analysis that shows the impact on the Company's impairment analysis of its shipping segment, if
the Company were to utilize the most recent five year, three year or one year historical average
rates for similar vessels for purposes of estimating future cash flows for unfixed days over the
remaining life of the vessel.

Any impairment charges incurred as a result of declines in charter rates and other market
deterioration could negatively affect our business, financial condition or operating results or the
trading price of our common shares.
 
We will need to procure significant additional financing, which may be difficult to obtain on
acceptable terms, in order to complete the construction of our drillships, tankers and drybulk
carriers under construction.
 
We, through our majority-owned subsidiary, Ocean Rig UDW, have entered into contracts with
Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., or Samsung, for the construction of four seventh generation
drillships that are scheduled to be delivered to us in August 2013, November 2013, December
2013 and January 2015, respectively. The estimated total project cost for our four seventh
generation drillships, excluding financing costs, is approximately $2.7 billion, of which an
aggregate of approximately $1.6 billion was outstanding as of June 30, 2013. In order to
complete the construction of our seventh generation drillships, we will need to procure additional
financing. On February 28, 2013, we entered into a $1.35 billion syndicated secured term loan
facility to partially finance the construction costs of our seventh generation drillships, the Ocean
Rig Mylos, delivered in August 2013, and the Ocean Rig Skyros and the Ocean Rig Athena,
scheduled for delivery in November 2013 and December 2013, respectively. On July 15, 2013,
we paid an installment amounting to $83.0 million for the Ocean Rig Apollo, our seventh
generation drillship scheduled for delivery in January 2015. On August 19, 2013, we took
delivery of the Ocean Rig Mylos and on August 20, 2013 drew down an amount of $450.0 million
under the above facility. We expect to finance the remaining delivery payments for our seventh
generation drillships with cash on hand, operating cash flow, equity financing and additional
bank debt.
 
Furthermore, we have entered into contracts for the construction of four Panamax Ice Class 1A
drybulk vessels, scheduled for delivery in 2014. As of August 19, 2013, we had remaining
construction costs of $124.4 million in the aggregate with respect to our four newbuilding
Panamax Ice Class 1A drybulk vessels. We have not secured financing for the remaining
construction costs for these vessels.
 
We cannot be certain that additional financing to complete the construction of our newbuilding
drillships and drybulk carriers will be available on acceptable terms or at all.  If additional bank
financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be
unable to take delivery of one or more of our newbuilding drillships or drybulk vessels, in which
case we would be prevented from realizing potential revenues from the applicable drillship or
drybulk vessel and we could lose our deposit money, which amounted to $890.9 million in the
aggregate, as of June 30, 2013. We may also incur additional costs and liability to the shipyards,
which may pursue claims against us under our newbuilding construction contracts and retain and
sell our newbuilding drillships and drybulk vessels to third parties to the extent completed.
Construction of vessels and drilling units is subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns,
which could have an adverse impact on our available cash resources and results of operations.
 
As August 19, 2013, we had entered into contracts for the construction of (i) four Panamax Ice
Class 1A drybulk vessels, scheduled for delivery in 2014; and (ii) three seventh generation
drillships, scheduled for delivery in November 2013, December 2013 and January 2015,
respectively. Currently, each of our newbuilding vessels is expected to be delivered to us on
time.
39
From time to time in the future, we may also undertake new construction projects and conversion
projects. In addition, we may make significant upgrade, refurbishment, conversion and repair
expenditures for our fleet from time to time, particularly as our vessels and drilling units become
older. Some of these expenditures are unplanned. These projects together with our existing
construction projects and other efforts of this type are subject to risks of cost overruns or delays
inherent in any large construction project as a result of numerous factors, including the following:
·shipyard unavailability;
·shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor for completion of repairs or upgrades to our
equipment;
·unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment or shipyard
construction;
·financial or operating difficulties experienced by equipment vendors or the shipyard;
·unanticipated actual or purported change orders;
·local customs strikes or related work slowdowns that could delay importation of equipment or
materials;
·engineering problems, including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed
equipment;
·design or engineering changes;
·latent damages or deterioration to the hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering
estimates and assumptions;
·work stoppages;
·client acceptance delays;
·weather interference, storm damage or other events of force majeure;
·disputes with shipyards and suppliers;
·shipyard failures and difficulties;
·failure or delay of third-party equipment vendors or service providers;
·unanticipated cost increases; and
·difficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals or in meeting permit or approval
conditions.
These factors may contribute to cost variations and delays in the delivery of our newbuilding
vessels and drillships. Delays in the delivery of these newbuilding vessels or drillships or the
inability to complete construction in accordance with their design specifications may, in some
circumstances, result in a delay in contract commencement, resulting in a loss of revenue to us,
and may also cause customers to renegotiate, terminate or shorten the term of a charter
agreement or drilling contract, pursuant to applicable late delivery clauses. In the event of
termination of one of these contracts, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as
favorable terms. Additionally, capital expenditures for vessel or drilling unit upgrades,
refurbishment and construction projects could materially exceed our planned capital
expenditures. Moreover, our vessels and drilling units that may undergo upgrade, refurbishment
and repair may not earn a dayrate or charterhire, respectively, during the periods they are out of
service. In addition, in the event of a shipyard failure or other difficulty, we may be unable to
enforce certain provisions under our newbuilding contracts such as our refund guarantee, to
recover amounts paid as installments under such contracts. The occurrence of any of these
events may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or
cash flows.
 
 
40
In the event our counterparties do not perform under their agreements with us for the construction
of our newbuilding vessels and drillships and we are unable to enforce certain refund
guarantees, we may lose all or part of our investment, which would have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 
As of August 19 , 2013, we had paid an aggregate of $720.0 million to Samsung in connection
with our seventh generation drillships currently scheduled for delivery in November 2013,
December 2013 and January 2015.
 
In addition, as of August 19, 2013, we had entered into contracts for the construction of  four
Panamax Ice Class 1A drybulk vessels, scheduled for delivery in 2014. As of August 19, 2013,
we had made total yard payments in the amount of approximately $11.6 million for these vessels
in the aggregate.
 
In the event our counterparties under the construction contracts discussed above do not perform
under their agreements with us and we are unable to enforce certain refund guarantees with third
party banks due to an outbreak of war, bankruptcy or otherwise, we may lose all or part of our
investment, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows.
 
Currently, our revenues in the offshore drilling segment depend on two ultra-deepwater drilling
rigs and five drillships, which are designed to operate in harsh environments. The damage or
loss of any of our drilling units could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
and financial condition.
 
Our revenues are dependent on the drilling rig Leiv Eiriksson, which commences drilling
operations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, the drilling rig Eirik Raude, which is currently
mobilizing from offshore Ireland to offshore West Africa, where the rig is expected to commence
drilling operations, and the drillships Ocean Rig Corcovado and Ocean Rig Mykonos, which are
currently operating offshore Brazil, Ocean Rig Olympia, which is currently operating offshore
West Africa, Ocean Rig Poseidon, which is currently operating offshore Angola and the Ocean
Rig Mylos which was delivered on August 19, 2013. Our drilling units may be exposed to risks
inherent in deepwater drilling and operating in harsh environments that may cause damage or
loss. The drilling of oil and gas wells, particularly exploratory wells where little is known of the
subsurface formations involves risks, such as extreme pressure and temperature, blowouts,
reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment
defects, punch throughs, craterings, fires, explosions, pollution and natural disasters such as
hurricanes and tropical storms.
 
In addition, offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations, either
while on-site or during mobilization, including capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, marine life
infestations, and loss or damage from severe weather. The replacement or repair of a rig or
drillship could take a significant amount of time, and we may not have any right to compensation
for lost revenues during that time. As long as we have only seven drilling units in operation, loss
of or serious damage to one of the drilling units could materially reduce our revenues for the time
that drilling unit is out of operation. In view of the sophisticated design of the drilling units, we
may be unable to obtain a replacement unit that could perform under the conditions that our
drilling units are expected to operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.
 
Purchasing and operating secondhand vessels may result in increased operating costs and
reduced fleet utilization.
 
While we have the right to inspect previously owned vessels prior to our purchase of them and
we intend to inspect all secondhand vessels that we acquire in the future, such an inspection
does not provide us with the same knowledge about their condition that we would have if these
vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. A secondhand vessel may have
conditions or defects that we were not aware of when we bought the vessel and which may
require us to incur costly repairs to the vessel. These repairs may require us to put a vessel into
drydock which would reduce our fleet utilization. Furthermore, we usually do not receive the
benefit of warranties on secondhand vessels.
41
We may have difficulty managing our planned growth properly.
 
We intend to continue to grow our fleet. Our future growth will primarily depend on our ability to:
·locate and acquire suitable vessels and drilling units;
·identify and consummate acquisitions or joint ventures;
·enhance our customer base;
·manage our expansion; and
·obtain required financing on acceptable terms.
 
Growing  any  business  by  acquisition  presents  numerous  risks,  such  as  undisclosed  liabilities
and  obligations,  the  possibility  that  indemnification  agreements  will  be  unenforceable  or
insufficient to cover potential losses and difficulties associated with imposing common standards,
controls,  procedures  and  policies,  obtaining  additional  qualified  personnel,  managing
relationships with customers and integrating newly acquired assets and operations into existing
infrastructure.  We  may  be  unable  to  successfully  execute  our  growth  plans  or  we  may  incur
significant  expenses  and  losses  in  connection  with  our  future  growth  which  would  have  an
adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
If any of our vessels or drilling units fail to maintain their class certification and/or fail any annual
survey, intermediate survey, drydocking or special survey, that vessel or unit would be unable to
carry cargo or operate, thereby reducing our revenues and profitability and violating certain
covenants under our credit facilities.
The hull and machinery of every commercial drybulk vessel, tanker and drilling unit must be
classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society
certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and
regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and SOLAS. All of our drybulk vessels are
certified as being "in class" by all the major Classification Societies (e.g., American Bureau of
Shipping, Lloyd's Register of Shipping). Each of our operating drillships is certified as being "in
class" by American Bureau of Shipping. The Leiv Eiriksson was credited with completing its last
Special Periodical Survey in April 2011 and the Eirik Raude completed the same in 2012. Our
five operating drillships are due for their first Special Periodical Surveys in 2016 and 2018. Our
seventh generation drillships under construction are due for their first Special Periodical Surveys
in 2018 and 2020.
A vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys, drydockings and special surveys.
In lieu of a special survey, a vessel's machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under
which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Every vessel is also
required to be drydocked every two to three years for inspection of the underwater parts of such
vessel.
 
If any vessel or drilling unit does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey,
intermediate survey, drydocking or special survey, the vessel will be unable to carry cargo
between ports, or operate, and will be unemployable and uninsurable which could cause us to
be in violation of certain covenants in our credit facilities. Any such inability to carry cargo or be
employed, or operate, or any such violation of covenants, could have a material adverse impact
on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
The aging of our drybulk carrier fleet may result in increased operating costs or loss of hire in the
future, which could adversely affect our earnings.
 
In general, the cost of maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increases with the age of
the vessel. As of August 2013, the 42 vessels in our drybulk carrier fleet had an average age of
8.9 years. As our fleet ages we will incur increased costs. Older vessels are typically less fuel
efficient and more costly to maintain than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements
in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making older
vessels less desirable to charterers. Governmental regulations and safety or other equipment
standards related to the age of vessels may also require expenditures for alterations or the
addition of new equipment to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which our
vessels may engage. As our vessels age, market conditions may not justify those expenditures or
enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives.
42
In addition, charterers actively discriminate against hiring older vessels. For example, Rightship,
the ship vetting service founded by Rio Tinto and BHP-Billiton which has become the major
vetting service in the drybulk shipping industry, ranks the suitability of vessels based on a scale
of one to five stars. Most major carriers will not charter a vessel that Rightship has vetted with
fewer than three stars. Rightship automatically downgrades any vessel over 18 years of age to
two stars, which significantly decreases its chances of entering into a charter. Therefore, as our
vessels approach and exceed 18 years of age, we may not be able to operate these vessels
profitably during the remainder of their useful lives.
 
Our vessels and drilling units may suffer damage and we may face unexpected drydocking costs,
which could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition.
 
If our drybulk vessels or tankers suffer damage, they may need to be repaired at a drydocking
facility. The costs of drydock repairs are unpredictable and can be substantial. The loss of
earnings while our vessels are being repaired and repositioned, as well as the actual cost of
these repairs, would decrease our earnings and reduce the amount of dividends, if any, in the
future. We may not have insurance that is sufficient to cover all or any of these costs or losses
and may have to pay drydocking costs not covered by our insurance.
 
If our drilling units suffer damage, they may need to be repaired at a yard facility. The costs of
discontinued operations due to repairs are unpredictable and can be substantial. The loss of
earnings while our drilling units are being repaired and repositioned, as well as the actual cost of
these repairs, would decrease our earnings and reduce the amount of dividends, if any, in the
future. We may not have insurance that is sufficient to cover all or any of these costs or losses
and may have to pay repair costs not covered by our insurance.
 
We may not be able to maintain or replace our drilling units as they age.
 
The capital associated with the repair and maintenance of our fleet increases with age. We may
not be able to maintain our existing drilling units to compete effectively in the market, and our
financial resources may not be sufficient to enable us to make expenditures necessary for these
purposes or to acquire or build replacement drilling units.
 
Our board of directors has determined to suspend the payment of cash dividends as a result of
market conditions in the international shipping industry, and until such market conditions
improve, it is unlikely that we will reinstate the payment of dividends.
 
In light of a lower freight rate environment and a highly challenged financing environment, our
board of directors, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2008, has suspended our common share
dividend. Our dividend policy will be assessed by the board of directors from time to time. The
suspension allows us to preserve capital and use the preserved capital to capitalize on market
opportunities as they may arise. Until market conditions improve, it is unlikely that we will
reinstate the payment of dividends. In addition, other external factors, such as our lenders
imposing restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under the terms of our loan agreements, may
limit our ability to pay dividends. Further, we may not be permitted to pay dividends if we are in
breach of the covenants contained in our loan agreements and any waivers of non-compliance
with the covenants in our loan agreements that we have received or may receive in the future
from our lenders may prohibit us from paying dividends.
 
We are a holding company, and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to
us in order to satisfy our financial obligations or pay dividends, if any, in the future.
We are a holding company and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our
operating assets. We have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our
subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make dividend payments, if any, in the future depends on
our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. Furthermore, certain of our subsidiaries
are obligated to use their surplus cash to prepay the balance on their long-term loans. If we are
unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, our board of directors may not exercise its discretion
to pay dividends in the future. We do not intend to obtain funds from other sources to pay
dividends, if any, in the future. In addition, the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, in the
future will depend on the provisions of Marshall Islands law affecting the payment of dividends.
Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the payment of dividends if the company is insolvent or
would be rendered insolvent upon payment of such dividend and dividends may be declared and
paid out of our operating surplus; but in this case, there is no such surplus. Dividends may be
declared or paid out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and for the
preceding fiscal year. Our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future will also be subject to our
satisfaction of certain financial covenants contained in our credit facilities and certain waivers
related thereto.
43
Investment in derivative instruments such as freight forward agreements could result in losses.
 
From time to time, we may take positions in derivative instruments including freight forward
agreements, or FFAs. FFAs and other derivative instruments may be used to hedge a vessel
owner's exposure to the charter market by providing for the sale of a contracted charter rate along
a specified route and period of time. Upon settlement, if the contracted charter rate is less than
the average of the rates, as reported by an identified index, for the specified route and period, the
seller of the FFA is required to pay the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the
contracted rate and the settlement rate, multiplied by the number of days in the specified period.
Conversely, if the contracted rate is greater than the settlement rate, the buyer is required to pay
the seller the settlement sum. If we take positions in FFAs or other derivative instruments and do
not correctly anticipate charter rate movements over the specified route and time period, we could
suffer losses in the settling or termination of the FFA. This could adversely affect our results of
operations and cash flows.
 
The derivative contracts we have entered into to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates could result in higher than market interest rates and charges against our income.
 
As of June 30, 2013, we had entered into 37 interest rate swaps for purposes of managing our
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates applicable to indebtedness under our credit facilities,
which were advanced at a floating rate based on LIBOR. Our hedging strategies, however, may
not be effective and we may incur substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently
from our expectations. Our existing interest rate swaps as of June 30, 2013 did not, and our future
derivative contracts may not, qualify for treatment as hedges for accounting purposes. We
recognized fluctuations in the fair value of these contracts in our statement of operations. At June
30, 2013, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $ 77.1 million.
 
Our financial condition could be materially adversely affected to the extent we do not hedge our
exposure to interest rate fluctuations under our financing arrangements, under which loans have
been advanced at a floating rate based on LIBOR and for which we have not entered into an
interest rate swap or other hedging arrangement. Any hedging activities we engage in may not
effectively  manage  our  interest  rate  exposure  or  have  the  desired  impact  on  our  financial
conditions or results of operations.
Because we generate most of our revenues in U.S. Dollars, but incur a significant portion of our
employee salary and administrative and other expenses in other currencies, exchange rate
fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
 
Our principal currency for our operations and financing is the U.S. Dollar. A substantial portion of
the operating dayrates for the drilling units, our principal source of revenues, are quoted and
received in U.S. Dollars; however, a portion of our revenue under our contracts with Petrуleo
Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras Brazil, for the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Mykonos is,
and a portion of our revenue under our contract with Repsol Sinopec Brasil S.A., or Repsol, for
the Ocean Rig Mylos, our seventh generation drillship which was delivered in August 2013,  will
be receivable in Brazilian Real. The principal currency for operating expenses is also the U.S.
Dollar; however, a significant portion of employee salaries and administration expenses, as well
as parts of the consumables and repair and maintenance expenses for the drilling rigs, may be
paid in Norwegian Kroner, Great British Pounds, Canadian dollars, Euros or other currencies
depending in part on the location of our drilling operations. For the six months ended June 30,
2013, approximately 70% of our expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S.
Dollars. This exposure to foreign currency could lead to fluctuations in net income and net
revenue due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the other currencies. Revenues
paid in foreign currencies against which the U.S. Dollar rises in value can decrease, resulting in
lower U.S. Dollar denominated revenues. Expenses incurred in foreign currencies against which
the U.S. Dollar falls in value can increase, resulting in higher U.S. Dollar denominated expenses.
We have employed derivative instruments in order to economically hedge our currency exposure;
however, we may not be successful in hedging our future currency exposure and our U.S. Dollar
denominated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected upon exchange
rate fluctuations determined by events outside of our control.
44
If the recent volatility in LIBOR continues, it could affect our profitability, earnings and cash flow.
 
LIBOR has recently been volatile, with the spread between LIBOR and the prime lending rate
widening significantly at times. These conditions are the result of the recent disruptions in the
international credit markets. Because the interest rates borne by our outstanding indebtedness
fluctuate with changes in LIBOR, if this volatility were to continue, it would affect the amount of
interest payable on our debt, which in turn, could have an adverse effect on our profitability,
earnings and cash flow.
Furthermore, interest in most loan agreements in our industry has been based on published
LIBOR rates. Recently, however, lenders have insisted on provisions that entitle the lenders, in
their discretion, to replace published LIBOR as the base for the interest calculation with their
cost-of-funds rate. If we are required to agree to such a provision in future loan agreements, our
lending costs could increase significantly, which would have an adverse effect on our
profitability, earnings and cash flow.
 
An increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness and could
reduce our profitability.
 
Our debt under certain of our credit facilities bears interest at variable rates. We may also incur
indebtedness in the future with variable interest rates. As a result, an increase in market interest
rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness and could materially reduce our
profitability and cash flows. The impact of such an increase would be more significant for us than
it would be for some other companies because of our substantial indebtedness.
 
We depend entirely on TMS Bulkers and TMS Tankers to manage and charter our drybulk fleet
and our tankers under construction, respectively.
 
With respect to our operations in the drybulk and tanker shipping sectors, we currently have 19
employees, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and
our Senior Vice President Head of Accounting and Reporting. Since January 1, 2011, we have
subcontracted the commercial and technical management of our drybulk and tanker vessels,
including crewing, maintenance and repair, to TMS Bulkers Ltd., or TMS Bulkers, and TMS
Tankers Ltd., or TMS Tankers, respectively. TMS Bulkers and TMS Tankers are beneficially
wholly-owned by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. George Economou.
The loss of the services or TMS Bulkers or TMS Tankers or their failure to perform their
obligations to us could materially and adversely affect the results of our operations. Although we
may have rights against TMS Bulkers and TMS Tankers if they default on their obligations to us,
you will have no recourse against either of them. Further, we are required to seek approval from
our lenders to change our manager.
 
Under our management agreements with TMS Bulkers and TMS Tankers, TMS Bulkers and
TMS Tankers shall not be liable to us for any losses or damages arising in the course of its
performance under the agreement unless such loss or damage is proved to have resulted from
the negligence, gross negligence or willful default by TMS Bulkers and TMS Tankers, its
employees or agents and in such case TMS Bulkers' and TMS Tankers' liability per incident or
series of incidents is limited to a total of ten times the annual management fee payable under the
relevant agreement. The management agreements further provide that TMS Bulkers and TMS
Tankers shall not be liable for any of the actions of the crew, even if such actions are negligent,
grossly negligent or willful, except to the extent that they are shown to have resulted from a failure
by TMS Bulkers and TMS Tankers to perform their obligations with respect to management of the
crew. Except to the extent of the liability cap described above, we have agreed to indemnify TMS
Bulkers and TMS Tankers and their employees and agents against any losses incurred in the
course of the performance of the agreement.
45
TMS  Bulkers  and  TMS  Tankers  are  privately  held  company  and  there  is  little  or  no  publicly
available information about them.
 
The ability of TMS Bulkers and TMS Tankers to continue providing services for our benefit will
depend in part on their own financial strength. Circumstances beyond our control could impair
TMS Bulkers' and TMS Tankers' financial strength, and because it is privately held it is unlikely
that information about its financial strength would become public unless TMS Bulkers or TMS
Tankers began to default on their obligations. As a result, an investor in our shares might have
little advance warning of problems affecting TMS Bulkers and TMS Tankers, even though these
problems could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
We may be unable to attract and retain qualified, skilled employees or crew necessary to operate
our business.
 
Our success will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of TMS Bulkers and TMS
Tankers to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. In crewing our vessels, we
require technically skilled employees with specialized training who can perform physically
demanding work. Competition to attract and retain qualified crew members is intense. If we are
not able to increase our rates to compensate for any crew cost increases, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Any
inability we, or TMS Bulkers or TMS Tankers, experience in the future to hire, train and retain a
sufficient number of qualified employees could impair our ability to manage, maintain and grow
our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.
 
We are dependent upon key management personnel, particularly our Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer Mr. George Economou.
 
Our continued operations depend to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of our
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. George Economou. The loss of Mr.
Economou's services to our Company could adversely affect our discussions with our lenders
and management of our fleet during this difficult economic period and, therefore, could adversely
affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We do not currently,
nor do we intend to, maintain "key man" life insurance on any of our personnel, including Mr.
Economou.
 
Our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer has affiliations with TMS Bulkers and TMS Tankers which
could create conflicts of interest.
 
Our major shareholder is controlled by Mr. George Economou, who controls four entities that, in
the aggregate, were deemed to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, approximately 14.8% of
our outstanding common shares as of August 19, 2013. Mr. Economou controls TMS Bulkers and
TMS Tankers. Mr. Economou is also our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and a director of our
Company. These responsibilities and relationships could create conflicts of interest between us,
on the one hand, and TMS Bulkers and TMS Tankers, on the other hand. These conflicts may
arise in connection with the chartering, purchase, sale and operations of the vessels in our fleet
versus drybulk carriers and tankers managed by TMS Bunkers and TMS Tankers, respectively,
and/ or other companies affiliated with TMS Bulkers or TMS Tankers and Mr. Economou.
 
In particular, TMS Bulkers or TMS Tankers may give preferential treatment to vessels that are
beneficially owned by related parties because Mr. Economou and members of his family may
receive greater economic benefits.
 
Failure to attract or retain key personnel, labor disruptions or an increase in labor costs could
adversely affect our operations in the offshore drilling sector.
 
We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our
business in the offshore drilling sector worldwide. As of December 31, 2012, through the
subsidiaries of Ocean Rig UDW, we employed 1,374 employees, the majority of whom are full-
time crew employed on our drilling units. Under certain of our employment contracts, we are
required to have a minimum number of local crew members of our drillships. We will need to
recruit additional qualified personnel as we take delivery of our newbuilding drillships.
Competition for the labor required for drilling operations has intensified as the number of drilling
units activated, added to worldwide fleets or under construction has increased, leading to
shortages of qualified personnel in the industry and creating upward pressure on wages and
higher turnover. If turnover increases, we could see a reduction in the experience level of our
personnel, which could lead to higher downtime, more operating incidents and personal injury
and other claims, which in turn could decrease revenues and increase costs. In response to
these labor market conditions, we are increasing efforts in our recruitment, training, development
and retention programs as required to meet our anticipated personnel needs. If these labor trends
continue, we may experience further increases in costs or limits on our offshore drilling
operations.
46
Currently, none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the future,
some of our employees or contracted labor may be covered by collective bargaining agreements
in certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, Nigeria, Norway and the United Kingdom. As part of the
legal obligations in some of these agreements, we may be required to contribute certain amounts
to retirement funds and pension plans and have restricted ability to dismiss employees. In
addition, many of these represented individuals could be working under agreements that are
subject to salary negotiation. These negotiations could result in higher personnel costs, other
increased costs or increased operating restrictions that could adversely affect our financial
performance. Labor disruptions could hinder our operations from being carried out normally and if
not resolved in a timely cost-effective manner, could have a material impact on our business. If
we choose to cease operations in one of those countries or if the market conditions reduce the
demand for our drilling services in such a country, we would incur costs, which may be material,
associated with workforce reductions.
As we expand our business, we may need to improve our operating and financial systems and
will need to recruit suitable employees and crew for our vessels.
 
Our current operating and financial systems may not be adequate as we expand the size of our
fleet and our attempts to improve those systems may be ineffective. In addition, as we expand our
fleet, we will need to recruit suitable additional seafarers and shoreside administrative and
management personnel. We may be unable to hire suitable employees as we expand our fleet. If
we or our crewing agent encounters business or financial difficulties, we may not be able to
adequately staff our vessels. If we are unable to grow our financial and operating systems or to
recruit suitable employees as we expand our fleet, our financial performance and our ability to
pay dividends, if any, in the future may be adversely affected.
 
U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a "passive foreign investment company," which could have
adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders.
 
A foreign corporation will be treated as a "passive foreign investment company," or a PFIC, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year
consists of certain types of "passive income" or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the
corporation's assets produce or are held for the production of those types of "passive income."
For purposes of these tests, "passive income" includes dividends, interest, and gains from the
sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties
which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or
business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services does not
constitute "passive income." U.S. shareholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S.
federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they
receive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their
shares in the PFIC.
 
Based on our method of operation, we do not believe that we are, have been or will be a PFIC
with respect to any taxable year. In this regard, we intend to treat the gross income we derive or
are deemed to derive from our time and voyage chartering activities as services income, rather
than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that our income from our time and voyage chartering
activities does not constitute passive income, and the assets that we own and operate in
connection with the production of that income do not constitute assets that produce or are held for
production of passive income.
 
There is substantial legal authority supporting this position consisting of case law and U.S.
Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, pronouncements concerning the characterization of
income derived from time charters and voyage charters as services income for other tax
purposes. However, it should be noted that there is also authority which characterizes time
charter income as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes. Accordingly,
in the absence of any authorkity directly under the PFIC rules, no assurance can be given that
the IRS or a court of law will accept this position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law
could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we would not
constitute a PFIC for any future taxable year if the nature and extent of our operations changed.
47
If the IRS were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any taxable year, our U.S.
shareholders will face adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and information reporting
obligations. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders make an election available under
the Code (which election could itself have adverse tax consequences for such shareholders),
such shareholders would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the then prevailing income tax
rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions and upon any gain from the
disposition of our common shares, as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized
ratably over the U.S. shareholder's holding period of our common shares. See "Item 10.
Additional Information—E. Taxation – U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders" in our
Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2012, incorporated herein by
reference, " for a more comprehensive discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences
to U.S. shareholders if we are treated as a PFIC.
 
We may have to pay tax on United States source shipping income, which would reduce our
earnings.
 
Under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or the Code, 50% of the gross
shipping income of a vessel-owning or -chartering corporation, such as ourselves and certain of
our subsidiaries, that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both
begin and end, in the United States may be subject to a 4% U.S. federal income tax without
allowance for any deductions, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under
Section 883 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
We expect that we and each of our vessel-owning subsidiaries qualify for this statutory tax
exemption and we have taken and intend to continue to take this position for U.S. federal income
tax return reporting purposes. However, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that
could cause us to lose the benefit of this tax exemption and thereby become subject to U.S.
federal income tax on our U.S. source shipping income. For example, we would no longer qualify
for exemption under Section 883 of the Code for a particular taxable year if shareholders with a
five percent or greater interest in our common shares owned, in the aggregate, 50% or more of
our outstanding common shares for more than half of the days during the taxable year. Due to the
factual nature of the issues involved, it is possible that our tax-exempt status or that of any of our
subsidiaries may change.
 
If we or our vessel-owning subsidiaries are not entitled to this exemption under Section 883 of
the Code for any taxable year, we or our subsidiaries could be subject for those years to an
effective 2% (i.e., 50% of 4%) U.S. federal income tax on our gross shipping income attributable
to transportation that begins or ends in the United States. The imposition of this taxation could
have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased earnings available for
distribution to our shareholders.
 
A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we
operate our drilling units could result in a high tax rate on our worldwide earnings, which could
result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations.
We conduct our worldwide drilling operations through various subsidiaries. Tax laws and
regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Consequently, we are subject to
changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate. Our
income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of tax laws in effect in various countries at
the time that the expense was incurred. A change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in
the interpretation thereof, or in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, could result in a materially
higher tax expense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings in our offshore drilling
segment, and such change could be significant to our financial results. If any tax authority
successfully challenges our operational structure, inter-company pricing policies or the taxable
presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries; or if the terms of certain income tax treaties
are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure; or if we lose a material tax dispute in
any country, particularly in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, or Norway, our
effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings from our offshore drilling operations could increase
substantially and our earnings and cash flows from these operations could be materially
adversely affected.
48
Our subsidiaries that provide services relating to drilling may be subject to taxation in the
jurisdictions in which such activities are conducted. Such taxation would result in decreased
earnings available to our shareholders.
 
Investors are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the overall tax
consequences of the ownership of our common shares arising in an investor's particular situation
under U.S. federal, state, local and foreign law.
 
A spin off of our offshore drilling or tanker segment may have adverse tax consequences to
shareholders.
 
We may again distribute, or spin off, a voting and economic interest in our majority-owned
subsidiary, Ocean Rig UDW, formerly known as Primelead Shareholders Inc., which owns and
operates our drilling units. We may spin off our wholly-owned subsidiary, Olympian Heracles
Holding Inc., or Olympian Heracles Holding, which owns our oil tankers. A spin off of Ocean Rig
UDW or Olympian Heracles Holding may be a taxable transaction to our shareholders
depending upon their country of residence. A shareholder may recognize taxable gain and be
subject to tax as a result of receiving shares of Ocean Rig UDW or Olympian Heracles Holding in
the spin off, notwithstanding that cash will not have been received. In addition, after the spin off,
Ocean Rig UDW or Olympian Heracles Holding may be treated as a PFIC, which would have
adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. shareholder of Ocean Rig UDW or
Olympian Heracles Holding. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders make an election
available under the Code (which election could itself have adverse consequences for such
shareholders), such U.S. shareholders would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the then
prevailing income tax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions and upon
any gain from the disposition of shares of Ocean Rig UDW or Olympian Heracles Holding, as if
the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder's holding period
in such shares. In the alternative, Ocean Rig UDW or Olympian Heracles Holding may issue
common shares in a public offering. If as a result of such issuance, our ownership of Ocean Rig
UDW or Olympian Heracles Holding was reduced to less than 25% (but more than 0%) of the
outstanding capital stock of such entity, our ownership of Ocean Rig UDW or Olympian Heracles
Holding common shares could be treated as a passive asset for purposes of determining whether
we are a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
Our vessels may call on ports located in, and our drilling units may operate in, countries that are
subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments, which could adversely affect
our reputation and the market for our common shares.
 
As of the date of this registration statement, none of our vessels has called on ports located in,
and none of our drilling units has operated in, countries subject to sanctions and embargoes
imposed by the U.S. government and other authorities or countries identified by the U.S.
government or other authorities as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Cuba, Iran, Sudan and
Syria; however our vessels and drilling units may call on ports or operate in these countries from
time to time in the future on our charterers' instructions. The U.S. sanctions and embargo laws
and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or
proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be
amended or strengthened over time. In 2010, the U.S. enacted the Comprehensive Iran
Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act, or CISADA, which amended the Iran Sanctions
Act. Among other things, CISADA introduced limits on the ability of companies and persons to do
business or trade with Iran when such activities relate to the investment, supply or export of
refined petroleum or petroleum products. In 2012, President Obama signed Executive Order
13608 which prohibits foreign persons from violating or attempting to violate, or causing a
violation of any sanctions in effect against Iran or facilitating any deceptive transactions for or on
behalf of any person subject to U.S. sanctions. Any persons found to be in violation of Executive
Order 13608 will be deemed a foreign sanctions evader and will be banned from all contacts with
the United States, including conducting business in U.S. dollars. Also in 2012, President Obama
signed into law the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, or the Iran Threat
Reduction Act, which created new sanctions and strengthened existing sanctions. Among other
things, the Iran Threat Reduction Act intensifies existing sanctions regarding the provision of
goods, services, infrastructure or technology to Iran's petroleum or petrochemical sector. The Iran
Threat Reduction Act also includes a provision requiring the President of the United States to
impose five or more sanctions from Section 6(a) of the Iran Sanctions Act, as amended, on a
person the President determines is a controlling beneficial owner of, or otherwise owns,
operates, or controls or insures a vessel that was used to transport crude oil from Iran to another
country and (1) if the person is a controlling beneficial owner of the vessel, the person had actual
knowledge the vessel was so used or (2) if the person otherwise owns, operates, or controls, or
insures the vessel, the person knew or should have known the vessel was so used. Such a
person could be subject to a variety of sanctions, including exclusion from U.S. capital markets,
exclusion from financial transactions subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and exclusion of that person's
vessels from U.S. ports for up to two years.
49
Although we believe that we have been in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo
laws and regulations, and intend to maintain such compliance, there can be no assurance that
we will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear
and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation could result in fines, penalties
or other sanctions that could severely impact our ability to access U.S. capital markets and
conduct our business, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest
their interest, or not to invest, in us. In addition, certain institutional investors may have
investment policies or restrictions that prevent them from holding securities of companies that
have contracts with countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism.
The determination by these investors not to invest in, or to divest from, our common shares may
adversely affect the price at which our common shares trade. Moreover, our charterers may
violate applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations as a result of actions that do not
involve us or our vessels, and those violations could in turn negatively affect our reputation.
Alternatively, in connection with the nature of chartering arrangements generally and despite our
objections, there is the possibility that from time to time in the future, our charterers may direct our
vessels or drilling units to call in ports or operate in locations violative of sanctions.  In addition,
our reputation and the market for our securities may be adversely affected if we engage in certain
other activities, such as entering into charters with individuals or entities in countries subject to
U.S. sanctions and embargo laws that are not controlled by the governments of those countries,
or engaging in operations associated with those countries pursuant to contracts with third parties
that are unrelated to those countries or entities controlled by their governments. Investor
perception of the value of our common shares may be adversely affected by the consequences of
war, the effects of terrorism, civil unrest and governmental actions in these and surrounding
countries.
 
We may be subject to premium payment calls because we obtain some of our insurance through
protection and indemnity associations.
 
For our drybulk vessels, we may be subject to increased premium payments, or calls, in amounts
based on our claim records as well as the claim records of other members of the protection and
indemnity associations in the International Group, which is comprised of 13 mutual protection
and indemnity associations and insures approximately 90% of the world's commercial tonnage
and through which we receive insurance coverage for tort liability, including pollution-related
liability, as well as actual claims. Although there is no cap to the amount of such supplemental
calls, historically, supplemental calls for our fleet have ranged from 0% to 40% of the annual
insurance premiums, and in no year were such amounts material to the results of our operations.
For the drilling units, we may be subject to increased premium payments, or calls, in amounts
based on our claim records.
 
 Our customers may be involved in the handling of environmentally hazardous substances and if
discharged  into  the  ocean  may  subject  us  to  pollution  liability  which  could  have  a  negative
impact on our cash flows, results of operations and ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future.
 
Our operations may involve the use or handling of materials that may be classified as
environmentally hazardous substances. Environmental laws and regulations applicable in the
countries in which we conduct operations have generally become more stringent. Such laws and
regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or for conditions caused by others, or for
our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such actions were taken.
 
During drilling operations in the past, the predecessor of Ocean Rig UDW, Ocean Rig ASA,
caused the release of oil, waste and other pollutants into the sea and into protected areas, such
as the Barents Sea where on April 12, 2005, Ocean Rig ASA discharged less than one cubic
meter of hydraulic oil. While we conduct maintenance on our drilling units in an effort to prevent
such releases, future releases could occur, especially as our rigs age. Such releases may be
large in quantity, above our permitted limits or in protected or other areas in which public interest
groups or governmental authorities have an interest. These releases could result in fines and
other costs to us, such as costs to upgrade our drilling units, costs to clean up the pollution, and
costs to comply with more stringent requirements in our discharge permits. Moreover, these
releases may result in our customers or governmental authorities suspending or terminating our
operations in the affected area, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operation and financial condition.
50
We expect that we will be able to obtain some degree of contractual indemnification from our
customers in most of our drilling contracts against pollution and environmental damages. But
such indemnification may not be enforceable in all instances, the customer may not be financially
capable in all cases of complying with its indemnity obligations or we may not be able to obtain
such indemnification agreements in the future.
 
Our operating and maintenance costs with respect to our offshore drilling units will not
necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues, which may have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 
Operating revenues may fluctuate as a function of changes in dayrates. However, costs for
operating a drilling unit are generally fixed regardless of the dayrate being earned. Therefore, our
operating and maintenance costs with respect to our offshore drilling units will not necessarily
fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues. In addition, should our drilling units
incur idle time between contracts, we typically will not de-man those drilling units but rather use
the crew to prepare the rig for its next contract. During times of reduced activity, reductions in
costs may not be immediate, as portions of the crew may be required to prepare rigs for stacking,
after which time the crew members are assigned to active rigs or dismissed. In addition, as our
drilling units are mobilized from one geographic location to another, labor and other operating
and maintenance costs can vary significantly. In general, labor costs increase primarily due to
higher salary levels and inflation. Equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon
the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment. Contract
preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and
the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are incurred. If we
experience increased operating costs without a corresponding increase in earnings, this may
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
We may be subject to litigation that, if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured
against, could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
We have been and may be, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters. These matters
may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims
or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims
for taxes or duties, and other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. Although
we intend to defend these matters vigorously, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or
effect of any claim or other litigation matter, and the ultimate outcome of any litigation or the
potential costs to resolve them may have a material adverse effect on us. Insurance may not be
applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not remain solvent which may have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition.
 
Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could result in fines, criminal
penalties, drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business.
 
We may operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to
have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance with
applicable anti-corruption laws and have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics which
is consistent and in full compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the
FCPA. We are subject, however, to the risk that we, our affiliated entities or our or their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of such
anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA. Any such violation could result in substantial fines,
sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and
might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual
or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Furthermore,
detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume
significant time and attention of our senior management.
51
Risks Relating to Our Common Shares
 
We are incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-
developed body of corporate law, and as a result, shareholders may have fewer rights and
protections under Marshall Islands law than under a typical jurisdiction in the United States.
 
Our corporate affairs are governed by our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and
Amended and Restated Bylaws and by the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act, or the
BCA. The provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of
states in the United States. However, there have been few judicial cases in the Republic of the
Marshall Islands interpreting the BCA. The rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under
the law of the Republic of the
 
Marshall Islands are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of
directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain United States jurisdictions.
Shareholder rights may differ as well. While the BCA does specifically incorporate the non-
statutory law, or judicial case law, of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially
similar legislative provisions, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their
interests in the face of actions by management, directors or controlling shareholders than would
shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a United States jurisdiction.
 
Because the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is not currently permitted to inspect
our independent accounting firm, you may not benefit from such inspections.
 
Auditors of U.S. public companies are required by law to undergo periodic Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, inspections that assess their compliance with U.S. law
and professional standards in connection with performance of audits of financial statements filed
with the SEC. Certain European Union countries, including Greece, do not currently permit the
PCAOB to conduct inspections of accounting firms established and operating in such European
Union countries, even if they are part of major international firms. Accordingly, unlike for most
U.S. public companies, the PCAOB is prevented from evaluating our auditor's performance of
audits and its quality control procedures, and, unlike shareholders of most U.S. public
companies, we and our shareholders are deprived of the possible benefits of such inspections.
 
We may be adversely affected by the introduction of new accounting rules for leasing.
 
International and U.S. accounting standard-setting boards (the International Accounting
Standards Board, or IASB, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB) have
proposed changes to the accounting for leases. If the proposals are adopted, they would be
expected generally to have the effect of bringing most off-balance sheet leases onto a lessee's
balance sheet which would also change the income and expense recognition patterns of those
items. Lessor accounting would also be affected. Financial statement metrics such as leverage
and capital ratios, as well as EBITDA, may also be affected, even when cash flow and business
activity have not changed. This may in turn affect covenant calculations under various contracts
(e.g., loan agreements) unless the affected contracts are modified. On May 16, 2013, the IASB
and the FASB issued, for public comment, exposure drafts on the proposed lease
accounting.  The Boards will set the effective date for the proposed requirements when they
consider interested parties' feedback on this exposure draft.  Accordingly, the timing and ultimate
effect of theose proposals on the Company are uncertain.
 
Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who may be deemed to beneficially own,
directly or indirectly, approximately 14.8% of our outstanding common shares, may have the
power to exert control over us, which may limit your ability to influence our actions.
 
As of August 19, 2013, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. George
Economou, may be deemed to have beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, approximately
14.8% of our outstanding common shares and therefore may have the power to exert
considerable influence over our actions. The interests of our Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer may be different from your interests.
Future sales of our common shares could cause the market price of our common shares to
decline.
 
The market price of our common shares could decline due to sales, or the announcements of
proposed sales, of a large number of common shares in the market, including sales of common
shares by our large shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or
the perception that these sales could occur, could also make it more difficult or impossible for us
to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate to raise funds
through future offerings of common shares.
52
Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to, among
other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into equity securities, without shareholder approval. We may issue such additional
equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital. The issuance of any additional shares
of common or preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to our
shareholders. Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, stock appreciation
rights, options or warrants to purchase our common shares in the future and those stock
appreciation rights, options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units vest, our
shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of shares of our common shares have no
preemptive rights that entitle such holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of
shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased
dilution to our shareholders.
 
There is no guarantee of a continuing public market for you to resell our common shares.
 
Our common shares commenced trading on the NASDAQ National Market, now the NASDAQ
Global Market, in February 2005. Our common shares now trade on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market. We cannot assure you that an active and liquid public market for our common shares will
continue. The price of our common shares may be volatile and may fluctuate due to factors such
as:
·actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public
companies in our industry;
·mergers and strategic alliances in the drybulk shipping industry;
·market conditions in the drybulk shipping industry and the general state of the securities
markets;
·changes in government regulation;
·shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecast by securities analysts; and
·announcements concerning us or our competitors.
 
The trading price of our common shares is below $5.00 and if it remains below that level, under
stock  exchange  rules,  our  stockholders  will  not  be  able  to  use  such  shares  as  collateral  for
borrowing in margin accounts. This inability to use our common shares as collateral may depress
demand  as  certain  institutional  investors  are  restricted  from  investing  in  shares  priced  below
$5.00 and lead to sales of such shares creating downward pressure on and increased volatility in
the market price of our common shares.
 
You may not be able to sell your shares of our common shares in the future at the price that you
paid for them or at all.
 
Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could make it difficult for our
stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or have the effect of
discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition, which could adversely affect the
market price of our common shares.
 
Several provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and
Restated Bylaws could make it difficult for our stockholders to change the composition of our
board of directors in any one year, preventing them from changing the composition of
management. In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or
acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable.
 
53
These provisions include:
 
 ·authorizing our board of directors to issue "blank check" preferred stock without stockholder
approval;
·providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;
·prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;
·authorizing the removal of directors only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common shares entitled to vote for the
directors;
·prohibiting stockholder action by written consent unless the written consent is signed by all
shareholders entitled to vote on the action;
·limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders;
·establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors
or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and
·restricting business combinations with interested shareholders.
 
In addition, we have entered into a stockholders rights agreement that will make it more difficult
for a third party to acquire us without the support of our board of directors.
 
The above anti-takeover provisions, including the provisions of our stockholders rights plan,
could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control
and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common shares and your ability to
realize any potential change of control premium.
The price of our shares of common stock after an offering may be volatile.
 
The price of our shares of common stock may fluctuate due to factors such as:
 
 ·actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public
companies in our industry
·mergers and strategic alliances in the drybulk and tanker industries;
·market conditions in the drybulk and tanker industries;
·changes in government regulation;
·the failure of securities analysts to publish research about us after this offering, or shortfalls in
our operating results from levels forecast by securities analysts;
·the general state of the securities market;
 
The seaborne transportation industry has been highly unpredictable and volatile. The market for
our shares of common stock in this industry may be equally volatile. Consequently, you may not
be able to sell the securities at prices equal to or greater than those paid by you in an offering.
54
Investors may experience significant dilution as a result of future offerings.
 
We may have to attempt to sell shares in the future in order to satisfy our capital needs; however
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we are able to sell shares in the future,
the prices at which we sell these future shares will vary, and these variations may be significant
and our existing shareholders may experience significant dilution if we sell these future shares to
other than existing shareholders pro rata at prices significantly below the price at which such
existing shareholders invested.
We may issue additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities without your
approval, which would dilute your ownership interests and may depress the market price of
shares of our common stock.
We may issue additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities of equal or senior
rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future vessel acquisitions, repayment of
outstanding indebtedness, or our equity incentive plan, without shareholder approval, in a
number of circumstances.
Our issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities of equal or
senior rank would have the following effects:
 
 ·our existing shareholders' proportionate ownership interst in us will decrease;
·the amount of cash available for dividends payable on our common shares may decrease;
·the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common share may be diminished;
and
·the market price of shares of our common stock may decline.
55
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
Matters discussed in this prospectus may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking
statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their
business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals,
strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements,
which are other than statements of historical facts or present facts or conditions.
 
We desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 and are including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe
harbor legislation. This prospectus and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our
behalf may include forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to
future events and financial performance. When used in this prospectus, the words "anticipate,"
"believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "forecast," "project," "plan," "potential," "may," "should,"
and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.
 
The forward-looking statements in this prospectus are based upon various assumptions, many of
which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management's
examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available
from third parties. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include,
among other things, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost and availability of
refined marine fuel from suppliers, pricing levels, the timing and cost of capital expenditures,
competitive conditions, and general economic conditions. These assumptions could prove
inaccurate. Although we believe that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because
these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are
difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will
achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections.
 
In addition to these assumptions and matters discussed elsewhere herein, important factors that,
in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-
looking statements include:
·our future operating or financial results;
·our future payment of dividends and the availability of cash for payment of dividends;
·our  ability  to  obtain  financing  to  fund  our  capital  expenditure  obligations  for  our  newbuilding
drillships;
·our ability to retain and attract senior management and other key employees;
·our ability to manage growth;
·our ability to maintain our business in light of our proposed business and location expansion;
·our ability to obtain double hull bunkering tankers given the scarcity of such vessels in general;
·the outcome of legal, tax or regulatory proceedings to which we may become a party;
·adverse conditions in the shipping or the marine fuel supply industries;
·our ability to retain our key suppliers and key customers;
·our contracts and licenses with governmental entities remaining in full force and effect;
·material disruptions in the availability or supply of crude oil or refined petroleum products;
·changes in the market price of petroleum, including the volatility of spot pricing;
·increased levels of competition;
56
·compliance  or  lack  of  compliance  with  various  environmental  and  other  applicable  laws  and
regulations;
·our ability to collect accounts receivable;
·changes in the political, economic or regulatory conditions in the markets in which we operate,
and the world in general;
·our future, pending or recent acquisitions, business strategy, areas of possible expansion, and
expected capital spending or operating expenses;
·our failure to hedge certain financial risks associated with our business;
·uninsured losses;
·our ability to maintain our current tax treatment;
·our failure to comply with restrictions in our credit agreements;
·increases in interest rates; and
·other important factors described from time to time in our filings with the SEC.

USE OF PROCEEDS
We intend to use net proceeds from the sale of the securities as set forth in the applicable
prospectus supplement. We will not receive any proceeds from sales of our securities by any
selling shareholder.
61
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
We or any selling shareholder may sell or distribute the securities included in this prospectus and
any selling shareholder may sell shares of our common stock through underwriters, through
agents, to dealers, in private transactions, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices
related to the prevailing market prices, or at negotiated prices.
 
In addition, we or any selling shareholder may sell some or all of our securities included in this
prospectus, through:
 
 ·a block trade in which a broker-dealer may resell a portion of the block, as principal, in order to
facilitate the transaction;
·purchases by a broker-dealer, as principal, and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;
 
 ·ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which a broker solicits purchasers; or
 
 ·trading plans entered into by the selling shareholder pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are in place at the time
of an offering pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus supplement hereto that provide for
periodic sales of their Common Shares on the basis of parameters described in such trading
plans.
In addition, we or any selling shareholder may enter into option or other types of transactions that
require us or them to deliver our securities to a broker-dealer, who will then resell or transfer the
securities under this prospectus. We or any selling shareholder may enter into hedging
transactions with respect to our securities. For example, we or any selling shareholder may:
·enter into transactions involving short sales of our shares of common stock by broker-dealers;
 
 ·sell common shares short themselves and deliver the shares to close out short positions;
 
 ·enter  into  option  or  other  types  of  transactions  that  require  us  or  the  selling  shareholder  to
deliver shares of common stock to a broker-dealer, who will then resell or transfer the shares of
common stock under this prospectus; or
 
 ·loan or pledge the common shares to a broker-dealer, who may sell the loaned shares or, in the
event of default, sell the pledged shares.
We or any selling shareholder may enter into derivative transactions with third parties, or sell
securities not covered by this prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. If the
applicable prospectus supplement indicates, in connection with those derivatives, the third
parties may sell securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement,
including in short sale transactions. If so, the third party may use securities pledged by us or any
selling shareholder or borrowed from us, any selling shareholder or others to settle those sales or
to close out any related open borrowings of stock, and may use securities received from us or
any selling shareholder in settlement of those derivatives to close out any related open
borrowings of stock. The third party in such sale transactions will be an underwriter and, if not
identified in this prospectus, will be identified in the applicable prospectus supplement (or a post-
effective amendment). In addition, we or any selling shareholder may otherwise loan or pledge
securities to a financial institution or other third party that in turn may sell the securities short
using this prospectus. Such financial institution or other third party may transfer its economic
short position to investors in our securities or in connection with a concurrent offering of other
securities.
 
The selling shareholders and any broker-dealers or other persons acting on our behalf or the
behalf of any selling shareholder that participates with us or any selling shareholder in the
distribution of the securities, may be deemed to be underwriters, and any commissions received
or profit realized by them on the resale of the securities, may be deemed to be underwriting
discounts and commissions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act.
As a result, we have or will inform the selling shareholders that Regulation M, promulgated under
the Exchange Act, may apply to sales by the selling shaholders in the market. The selling
shareholders may agree to indemnify any broker, dealer or agent that participates in transactions
involving the sale of our common shares against certain liabilities, including liabilites arising
under the Securities Act.
62
As of the date of this prospectus, we are not a party to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding between any broker or dealer and us with respect to the offer or sale of the
securities pursuant to this prospectus.
 
At the time that any particular offering of securities is made, to the extent required by the
Securities Act, a prospectus supplement will be distributed, setting forth the terms of the offering,
including the aggregate number of securities being offered, the purchase price of the securities,
the initial offering price of the securities, the names of any underwriters, dealers or agents, any
discounts, commissions and other items constituting compensation from us, and any discounts,
commissions or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers. Furthermore, we, our
executive officers, our directors and any selling shareholder may agree, subject to certain
exemptions, that for a certain period from the date of the prospectus supplement under which the
securities are offered, we and they will not, without the prior written consent of an underwriter,
offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of our common shares or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common shares. However, an underwriter, in
its sole discretion, may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any
time without notice. We expect an underwriter to exclude from these lock-up agreements,
securities exercised and/or sold pursuant to trading plans entered into by any selling shareholder
pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, that are in place at the time of an offering
pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus supplement hereto that provide for periodic sales
of their Common Shares on the basis of parameters described in such trading plans.
 
Underwriters or agents could make sales in privately negotiated transactions and/or any other
method permitted by law, including sales deemed to be an at-the-market offering as defined in
Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, which includes sales made directly on or through
the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the existing trading market for our shares of common stock,
or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange.
 
We will bear costs relating to all of the securities being registered under this registration
statement.
 
As a result of requirements of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, formerly the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the maximum commission or discount to be
received by any FINRA member or independent broker/dealer may not be greater than 8% of the
gross proceeds received by us or any selling shareholder for the sale of any securities being
registered pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act.
63
ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES
DryShips Inc. is a Marshall Islands company and our executive offices are located outside of the
United States in Athens, Greece. A majority of our directors, officers and the experts named in the
prospectus reside outside the United States. In addition, a substantial portion of our assets and
the assets of our directors, officers and experts are located outside of the United States. As a
result, you may have difficulty serving legal process within the United States upon us or any of
these persons. You may also have difficulty enforcing, both in and outside the United States,
judgments you may obtain in U.S. courts against us or these persons in any action, including
actions based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.
Furthermore, there is substantial doubt that the courts of the Marshall Islands or Greece would
enter judgments in original actions brought in those courts predicated on U.S. federal or state
securities laws.
64

For purposes of the description of the Company's capital stock below, references to "us," "we"
and "our" refer only to DryShips Inc. and not any of our subsidiaries.  Please see our amended

Authorized and Outstanding Capital Stock
Under our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, our authorized capital stock consists
of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which
424,762,244 shares (including treasury stock) are issued and outstanding as of August 19, 2013

Share History
In October 2004, we issued 15,400,000 shares of our common stock to the Entrepreneurial Spirit
Foundation, or the Foundation, as consideration for the contribution to us of all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of six of our subsidiaries. The Foundation is a foundation organized
under the laws of Lichtenstein and is controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mr.
George Economou. Subsequent to the issuance of the 15,400,000 shares discussed above,
2,772,000 shares of common stock were transferred from the Foundation to Advice Investments
S.A., a corporation organized under the Republic of Liberia, all the issued and outstanding
capital stock of which is owned by Ms. Elisavet Manola of Athens, Greece, the ex-wife of Mr.
Economou. The Foundation transferred 1,848,000 shares of common stock to Magic
Management Inc., all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of which is owned by Ms. Rika
Vosniadou of Athens, Greece, the ex-wife of Mr. Economou. In February 2005, we issued
14,950,000 shares of common stock in connection with our initial public offering. The net
proceeds of the initial public offering were $251.3 million. On February 14, 2006, the Foundation
transferred all of its shares to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Elios Investments.
On May 10, 2006, the Company filed its universal shelf registration statement and related
prospectus for the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of common stock. From May 2006 through
August 2006, 4,650,000 shares of common stock with a par value $0.01 were issued. The net
proceeds after underwriting commissions of 2.5% and other issuance fees were $56.5 million.
 
Our shareholders voted to adopt a resolution at our annual general shareholders' meeting on
July 11, 2006, which increased the aggregate number of shares of common stock that the
Company is authorized to issue from 45,000,000 registered shares with par value of $0.01 to
75,000,000 registered shares with par value $0.01.
 
On October 24, 2006, the Company's Board of Directors agreed to the request of the Company's
major shareholders (Elios Investments Inc., Advice Investments S.A. and Magic Management
Inc.) following the declaration of our $0.20 quarterly dividend per share in September 2006, to
receive their dividend payment in the form of our common stock in lieu of cash. One of these
shareholders, Elios Investments Inc., is controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Mr. George Economou. In addition, the Board of Directors also agreed on that date to the request
of a company related to Mr. Economou to accept repayment of the outstanding balance of a
seller's credit in respect of a vessel purchased by us (as discussed in Note 3(e) of our
consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2006) in shares of our common stock. As a result of the agreement, an
aggregate of $3,080,000 in dividends and the seller's credit together with interest amounting to
$3,327,000 were settled with 235,585 and 254,512 shares of our common stock, respectively.

average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market over the 8
trading days ended October 24, 2006, which was $13.07 per share.

(Registration No. 333-146540) for an undetermined amount of securities, including common
shares, preferred shares, debt securities, guarantees, warrants, purchase contracts and units.
The above registration statement expired on October 5, 2010. As a result, on September 3, 2010,
we filed a new automatic shelf registration statement, for an undetermined amount of securities,
including common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, guarantees, warrants, purchase
contracts and units. The registration of securities pursuant to the Form F-3ASR (Registration No.

Description of Common Stock
Each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted
to a vote of stockholders. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding
shares of preferred stock, holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive ratably all
dividends, if any, declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for dividends.
Holders of common stock do not have conversion, redemption or preemptive rights to subscribe
to any of our securities. All outstanding shares of common stock are, and the shares to be sold
pursuant to this registration statment when issued and paid for will be, fully paid and non-
assessable. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subject to the
rights of the holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and any shares of preferred
stock which we may issue in the future. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market under the symbol "DRYS."
Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
Our purpose, as stated in Section B of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, is to
engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may now or hereafter be organized
under the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act. Our Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws do not impose any limitations on the
ownership rights of our shareholders.
Directors
Our directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote in an
election. Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that cumulative voting
shall not be used to elect directors. Our board of directors must consist of at least three members.
The exact number of directors is fixed by a vote of at least 66 2/3% of the entire board. Our
Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for a staggered board of directors whereby directors
shall be divided into three classes: Class A, Class B and Class C which shall be as nearly equal
in number as possible. Shareholders, acting as at a duly constituted meeting, or by unanimous
written consent of all shareholders, initially designated directors as Class A, Class B or Class C.
The term of our directors designated Class A directors expires at our 2014 annual meeting of
shareholders. Class B directors serve for a term expiring at our 2015 annual meeting of
shareholders. Directors designated as Class C directors serve for a term expiring at our 2013
annual meeting of shareholders. At annual meetings for each initial term, directors to replace
those whose terms expire at such annual meetings will be elected to hold office until the third
succeeding annual meeting. Each director serves his respective term of office until his successor
has been elected and qualified, except in the event of his death, resignation, removal or the
earlier termination of his term of office. Our board of directors has the authority to fix the amounts
which shall be payable to the members of the board of directors for attendance at any meeting or
for services rendered to us.
Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws, no contract or transaction between the Company and
one or more of our directors or officers, or between the Company and any other corporation,
partnership, association or other organization of which one or more of our directors or officers are
directors or officers or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or
solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of our board of
directors or a committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because
his or her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (i) the material facts as to his or her or
their relationship or interest as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to our
board or directors or the applicable committee thereof and the board or directors or such
committee, as applicable, in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative
votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, or, if the votes of the disinterested directors are
insufficient to constitute an act of the board of directors as defined under the BCA, then by
unanimous vote of the disinterested directors; (ii) the material facts as to his or her or their
relationship or interest as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the
Company's shareholders, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by
vote of the shareholders; or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Company as of the time
it is authorized, approved or ratified by our board of directors, a committee thereof or our
shareholders.  Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a
quorum at a meeting of the board of directors or of a committee thereof that authorizes the
contract or transaction.
69
Shareholder Meetings
 
Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws, annual shareholders meetings will be held at a time
and place selected by our board of directors. The meetings may be held in or outside of the
Marshall Islands. Our board of directors may set a record date between 15 and 60 days before
the date of any meeting to determine the shareholders that will be eligible to receive notice and
vote at the meeting.
Dissenters' Rights of Appraisal and Payment
 
Under the BCA, our shareholders have the right to dissent from various corporate actions,
including any merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets not made in
the usual course of our business, and receive payment of the fair value of their shares. However,
the right of a dissenting shareholder to receive payment of the appraised fair value of his shares
is not available under the BCA for the shares of any class or series of stock, which shares or
depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the shareholders
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the meeting of the shareholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation, were either (i) listed on a securities exchange or admitted
for trading on an interdealer quotation system or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders. In
the event of any further amendment of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, a
shareholder also has the right to dissent and receive payment for the shareholder's shares if the
amendment alters certain rights in respect of those shares. The dissenting shareholder must
follow the procedures set forth in the BCA to receive payment. In the event that we and any
dissenting shareholder fail to agree on a price for the shares, the BCA procedures involve,
among other things, the institution of proceedings in any appropriate court in any jurisdiction in
which our shares are primarily traded on a local or national securities exchange.
Shareholders' Derivative Actions
 
Under the BCA, any of our shareholders may bring an action in our name to procure a judgment
in our favor, also known as a derivative action, provided that the shareholder bringing the action
is a holder of common stock both at the time the derivative action is commenced and at the time
of the transaction to which the action relates.
Indemnification of Officers and Directors
 
Our Amended and Restated Bylaws include a provision that entitles any director or officer of the
Company to be indemnified by the Company upon the same terms, under the same conditions
and to the same extent as authorized by the BCA if he acted in good faith and in a manner
reasonably believed to be in and not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct
was unlawful.
 
We are also authorized to carry directors' and officers' insurance as a protection against any
liability asserted against our directors and officers acting in their capacity as directors and officers
regardless of whether the Company would have the power to indemnify such director or officer
against such liability by law or under the provisions of our by laws. We believe that these
indemnification provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and
executive officers.
70
The indemnification provisions in our Amended and Restated Bylaws may discourage
shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These
provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against
directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and
our shareholders. There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of
our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought.
Anti-takeover Provisions of our Charter Documents
Several provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and
Restated Bylaws may have anti-takeover effects. These provisions are intended to avoid costly
takeover battles, lessen our vulnerability to a hostile change of control and enhance the ability of
our board of directors to maximize shareholder value in connection with any unsolicited offer to
acquire us. However, these anti-takeover provisions, which are summarized below, could also
discourage, delay or prevent (1) the merger or acquisition of our company by means of a tender
offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, that a shareholder may consider in its best interest and (2) the
removal of incumbent officers and directors.
 
Blank Check Preferred Stock
 
Under the terms of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, our board of directors
has authority, without any further vote or action by our shareholders, to issue up to 500,000,000
shares of blank check preferred stock, of which 100,000,000 of these shares have been
designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and 10,000,000 of these shares have been
designated as Series A Participating Preferred Stock as of August 19, 2013.  As of August 19,
2013, we had no shares of preferred stock outstanding.  Our board of directors may issue shares
of preferred stock on terms calculated to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our
company or the removal of our management.
 
Classified Board of Directors
 
Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provide for a board of directors serving
staggered, three-year terms. Approximately one-third of our board of directors will be elected
each year. The classified board provision could discourage a third party from making a tender
offer for our shares or attempting to obtain control of our Company. It could also delay
shareholders who do not agree with the policies of the board of directors from removing a
majority of the board of directors for two years.
Election and Removal of Directors
 
Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation prohibit cumulative voting in the election of
directors. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws require shareholders to give advance written
notice of nominations for the election of directors. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws also
provide that our directors may be removed only for cause and only upon affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting shares of the Company. These provisions
may discourage, delay or prevent the removal of incumbent officers and directors.
Limited Actions by Shareholders
Under the BCA and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be
taken by our shareholders must be effected at an annual or special meeting of shareholders or by
the unanimous written consent of our shareholders. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide
that, unless otherwise prescribed by law, only a majority of our board of directors, the chairman of
our board of directors or the President may call special meetings of our shareholders, and the
business transacted at the special meeting is limited to the purposes stated in the notice.
Accordingly, a shareholder may be prevented from calling a special meeting of shareholders for
shareholder consideration of a proposal over the opposition of our board of directors and
shareholder consideration of a proposal may be delayed until the next annual meeting of
shareholders.
71
Advance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations
 
Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that shareholders seeking to nominate candidates
for election as directors or to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders must
provide timely notice of their proposal in writing to the corporate secretary. Generally, to be
timely, a shareholder's notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than
150 days nor more than 180 days prior to the one year anniversary of the preceding year's
annual meeting of shareholders. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws also specify requirements
as to the form and content of a shareholder's notice. These provisions may impede shareholders'
ability to bring matters before an annual meeting of shareholders or make nominations for
directors at an annual meeting of shareholders.
Stockholders Rights Agreement
We entered into a Stockholders Rights Agreement with American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, as Rights Agent, as of January 18, 2008. Under this Agreement, we declared a
dividend payable of one preferred share purchase right, or Right, to purchase one one-
thousandth of a share of our Series A Participating Preferred Stock for each outstanding common
share. The Right will separate from the common shares and become exercisable after (1) the
10th business day after a person or group acquires ownership of 15% or more of our common
shares or (2) the 10th business day (or such later date as determined by the company's board of
directors) after a person or group announces a tender or exchange offer which would result in
that person or group holding 15% or more of our common shares, or collectively, the Distribution
Date. On the Distribution Date, each holder of a Right will be entitled to purchase for $250.00, or
the Exercise Price, a fraction (1/1000th) of one share of our Series A Participating Preferred
Stock, which has similar economic terms as one of our common shares. Subject to certain
exceptions, if a person acquires more than 15% of our common shares, referred to as an
Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right (except that Acquiring Person) will be entitled to buy at
the exercise price the number of our common shares stock having a market value of twice the
exercise price. In addition, any time after the date an Acquiring Person obtains more than 15% of
our common shares and before that Acquiring Person acquires more than 50% of our outstanding
common shares, we may exchange each right owned by all other Rights holders, in whole or in
part, for one of our common shares. We may also redeem the Rights at any time prior to a public
announcement that a person has acquired ownership of 15% or more of the Company's common
stock.
On July 9, 2009, the Stockholders Rights Agreement was amended for the sole purpose of
amending and restating the definition of Acquiring Person to exempt persons acquiring our
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and any of our common shares resulting from the
conversion of any such preferred stock from the definition of Acquiring Person, subject to certain
exceptions. On April 21, 2010, the Stockholders Rights Agreement was further amended for the
sole purpose of further amending and restating the definition of Acquiring Person to exempt from
the definition of Acquiring Persons any persons acting (i) as a broker, dealer, distributor or initial
purchaser or underwriter of our securities or as a market-maker with respect to such securities or
(ii) in connection with share lending agreements or similar agreements between us or any of our
affiliates and such person or any of such person's affiliates or associates, subject to certain
exceptions.
 
The Rights expire on the earliest of (1) February 4, 2018 or (2) the exchange or redemption of the
Rights as described above. The terms of the rights and the Stockholders Rights Agreement may
be amended without the consent of the Rights holders at any time on or prior to the Distribution
Date. After the Distribution Date, the terms of the Rights and the Stockholders Rights Agreement
may be amended to make changes, which do not adversely affect the rights of the Rights holders
(other than the Acquiring Person). The Rights do not have any voting rights. The Rights have the
benefit of certain customary anti-dilution protections. As of August 19, 2013, no exercise of any
Right had occurred.
Dividends
In light of a lower freight rate environment and a highly challenged financing environment, our
board of directors, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2008, has suspended our common share
dividend. Our dividend policy will be assessed by the board of directors from time to time. The
suspension allows us to preserve capital and use the preserved capital to capitalize on market
opportunities as they may arise. Until market conditions improve, it is unlikely we will reinstate
the payment of dividends. In addition, other external factors, such as our lenders imposing
restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under the terms of our loan agreements, may limit our
ability to pay dividends. Further, we may not be permitted to pay dividends if we are in breach of
the covenants contained in our loan agreements. In addition, the waivers of our non-compliance
with covenants in our loan agreements that we received from our lenders may prohibit us from
paying our dividends.
72
Because we are a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of our
subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future, will also depend on the earnings
and cash flow of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to us. If there is a substantial
decline in the drybulk, tanker or offshore drilling charter markets, our earnings would be
negatively affected thus limiting our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future. Marshall Islands
law generally prohibits the payment of dividends other than from surplus or while a company is
insolvent or would be rendered insolvent upon the payment of such dividend.
 
We believe that, under current U.S. law, any future dividend payments from our then current and
accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, would
constitute "qualified dividend income" and, as a consequence, non-corporate U.S. shareholders
would generally be subject to the same preferential U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to
long-term capital gains with respect to such dividend payments. Distributions in excess of our
earnings and profits, as so calculated, will be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the
extent of a U.S. stockholder's tax basis in its common shares on a dollar-for-dollar basis and
thereafter as capital gain.
73
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES
Under the terms of our articles of incorporation, our board of directors has authority, without any
further vote or action by our shareholders, to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of blank check
preferred stock.  As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have any shares of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock.
Our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock on terms calculated to discourage,
delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or the removal of our management.  The
material terms of any series of preferred shares that we offer through a prospectus supplement
will be described in that prospectus supplement.  Our board of directors is authorized to provide
for the issuance of preferred shares in one or more series with designations as may be stated in
the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such preferred shares. At the time that any
series of our preferred shares are authorized, our board of directors will fix the dividend rights,
any conversion rights, any voting rights, redemption provisions, liquidation preferences and any
other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of that series, as well as the number of
shares constituting that series and their designation.  Our board of directors could, without
shareholder approval, cause us to issue preferred stock which has voting, conversion and other
rights that could adversely affect the holders of our ordinary shares or make it more difficult to
effect a change in control.  Our preferred shares could be used to dilute the share ownership of
persons seeking to obtain control of us and thereby hinder a possible takeover attempt which, if
our shareholders were offered a premium over the market value of their shares, might be viewed
as being beneficial to our shareholders.  In addition, our preferred shares could be issued with
voting, conversion and other rights and preferences which would adversely affect the voting
power and other rights of holders of our ordinary shares.  The material terms of any series of
preferred shares that we offer through a prospectus supplement will be described in that
prospectus supplement.
Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that was outstanding until October 2011 accrued
cumulative dividends on a quarterly basis at an annual rate of 6.75% of the aggregate face value.
Dividends were payable in preferred stock or cash, if cash dividends have been declared on our
common shares. Such accrued dividends were payable in additional shares of preferred stock
immediately prior to any conversion.
 
Each share of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was mandatorily convertible into our
common shares proportionally, upon the contractual delivery of our drillships Ocean Rig
Corcovado, Ocean Rig Olympia, Ocean Rig Poseidon and Ocean Rig Mykonos, at a premium of
127.5% of the original purchase price. Furthermore, each share of the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock could have been converted into our common shares at any time at the option of
the holder at a conversion rate of 1.0:0.7.
 
Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock entitled the holder to one vote on all matters
submitted to a vote of our shareholders. Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Designations of Rights, Preferences and Privileges of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or
the Certificate of Designations, or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock and the holders of our common shares voted together as one class on all matters
submitted to a vote of the Company's shareholders. Except as required by law, holders of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock had no special voting rights and their consent was not be required
(except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of our common shares as described
above) for taking any corporate action.
The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ranked senior to all other series of our preferred stock
as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series
shall provided otherwise. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was not redeemable unless
upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, or sale of all or substantially all
of the Company's assets, in which case a one-to-one redemption takes place plus any accrued
and unpaid dividends.
 
In connection with the delivery of our newbuilding drillships the Ocean Rig Corcovado, Ocean
Rig Olympia, Ocean Rig Poseidon and Ocean Rig Mykonos¸ all of our outstanding shares of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common shares in accordance with the
terms of the Certificate of Designations.
74
DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS
We may issue warrants to purchase any of our debt or equity securities. Each series of warrants
will be issued under a separate warrant agreement to be entered into between us and a warrant
agent. The terms of any warrants to be issued and a description of the material provisions of the
applicable warrant agreement will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.
The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the following terms of any warrants in
respect of which this prospectus is being delivered:
 
 ·the title of such warrants;
 
 ·the aggregate number of such warrants;
 
 ·the price or prices at which such warrants will be issued;
 
 ·the number and type of our securities purchasable upon exercise of such warrants;
 
 ·the  price  at  which  our  securities  purchasable  upon  exercise  of  such  warrants  may  be
purchased;
·the date on which the right to exercise such warrants shall commence and the date on which
such right shall expire;
·if applicable, the minimum or maximum amount of such warrants which may be exercised at any
one time;
·if applicable, the designation and terms of the securities with which such warrants are issued
and the number of such warrants issued with each such security;
·if  applicable,  the  date  on  and  after  which  such  warrants  and  the  related  securities  will  be
separately transferable;
·information with respect to book-entry procedures, if any;
 
 ·if applicable, a discussion of any material United States federal income tax considerations; and
 
 ·any  other  terms  of  such  warrants,  including  terms,  procedures  and  limitations  relating  to  the
exchange and exercise of such warrants.
75
DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES
We may issue debt securities from time to time in one or more series, under one or more
indentures, each dated as of a date on or prior to the issuance of the debt securities to which it
relates.  We may issue senior debt securities and subordinated debt securities pursuant to
separate indentures, a senior indenture and a subordinated indenture, respectively, in each case
between us and the trustee named in the indenture.  We have filed forms of these documents as
exhibits to the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part.  The senior indenture
and the subordinated indenture, as amended or supplemented from time to time, are sometimes
referred to individually as an "indenture" and collectively as the "indentures."  Each indenture will
be subject to and governed by the Trust Indenture Act and will be construed in accordance with
and governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles thereof
relating to conflicts of law that would result in the application of the laws of any other
jurisdiction.  The aggregate principal amount of debt securities which may be issued under each
indenture will be unlimited and each indenture will contain the specific terms of any series of debt
securities or provide that those terms must be set forth in or determined pursuant to, an
authorizing resolution, as defined in the applicable prospectus supplement, and/or a
supplemental indenture, if any, relating to such series.  Our debt securities may be convertible or
exchangeable into any of our equity or other debt securities.
Certain of our subsidiaries may guarantee the debt securities we offer.  Those guarantees may or
may not be secured by liens, mortgages, and security interests in the assets of those
subsidiaries.  The terms and conditions of any such subsidiary guarantees, and a description of
any such liens, mortgages or security interests, will be set forth in the prospectus supplement that
will accompany this prospectus.
Our statements below relating to the debt securities and the indentures are summaries of their
anticipated provisions, are not complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by
reference to, all of the provisions of the applicable indenture and any applicable United States
federal income tax considerations as well as any applicable modifications of or additions to the
general terms described below in the applicable prospectus supplement or supplemental
indenture.  For a description of the terms of a particular issue of debt securities, reference must
be made to both the related prospectus supplement and to the following description.
 
General
 
Neither indenture limits the amount of debt securities which may be issued.  The debt securities
may be issued in one or more series.  The senior debt securities will be unsecured and will rank
on a parity with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.  Each series of
subordinated debt securities will be unsecured and subordinated to all present and future senior
indebtedness. Any such debt securities will be described in an accompanying prospectus
supplement.
You should read the applicable indenture and subsequent filings relating to the particular series
of debt securities for the following terms of the offered debt securities:

indenture, principal, premium and interest will be paid by checks mailed to the holders at their
registered addresses.
77
Unless otherwise indicated in subsequent filings with the SEC, the debt securities will be issued
only in fully registered form without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 or any integral multiple
thereof. No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of the debt securities, but
we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
payable in connection with these debt securities.
 
Some or all of the debt securities may be issued as discounted debt securities to be sold at a
substantial discount below the stated principal amount. United States federal income tax
consequences and other special considerations applicable to any discounted securities will be
described in subsequent filings with the SEC relating to those securities.
 
We refer you to applicable subsequent filings with respect to any deletions or additions or
modifications from the description contained in this prospectus.
 
Senior Debt
We may issue senior debt securities under the senior debt indenture. These senior debt
securities will rank on an equal basis with all our other unsecured debt except subordinated debt.
Subordinated Debt
We may issue subordinated debt securities under the subordinated debt indenture. Subordinated
debt will rank subordinate and junior in right of payment, to the extent set forth in the
subordinated debt indenture, to all our senior debt (both secured and unsecured).
In general, the holders of all senior debt are first entitled to receive payment of the full amount
unpaid on senior debt before the holders of any of the subordinated debt securities are entitled to
receive a payment on account of the principal or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the
subordinated debt securities in certain events.
If we default in the payment of any principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any senior debt
when it becomes due and payable after any applicable grace period, then, unless and until the
default is cured or waived or ceases to exist, we cannot make a payment on account of or
redeem or otherwise acquire the subordinated debt securities.
If there is any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or other similar proceeding relating to us or our
property, then all senior debt must be paid in full before any payment may be made to any
holders of subordinated debt securities.
Furthermore, if we default in the payment of the principal of and accrued interest on any
subordinated debt securities that is declared due and payable upon an event of default under the
subordinated debt indenture, holders of all our senior debt will first be entitled to receive payment
in full in cash before holders of such subordinated debt can receive any payments.
Senior debt means:
 
 ·the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other amounts owing in respect of our
indebtedness for money borrowed and indebtedness evidenced by securities, notes,
debentures, bonds or other similar instruments issued by us, including the senior debt securities
or letters of credit;
·all capitalized lease obligations;
 
 ·all hedging obligations;
 
 ·all obligations representing the deferred purchase price of property; and
 
 ·all deferrals, renewals, extensions and refundings of obligations of the type referred to above;

but senior debt does not include:
 
 ·subordinated debt securities; and
 
 ·any indebtedness that by its terms is subordinated to, or ranks on an equal basis with, our
subordinated debt securities.
Covenants
Under the terms of the indenture, we covenant, among other things:
 
 ·that we will duly and punctually pay the principal of and interest, if any, on the offered debt
securities in accordance with the terms of such debt securities and the applicable indenture;
·that so long as any offered debt securities are outstanding, we will (i) file with the SEC within the
time periods prescribed by its rules and regulations and (ii) furnish to the trustee and holders of
the offered debt securities all quarterly and annual financial information required to be furnished
or filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and with respect to
the annual consolidated financial statements only, a report thereon by our independent auditors;
·that we will deliver to the trustee after the end of each fiscal year a compliance certificate as to
whether we have kept, observed, performed and fulfilled our obligations and each and every
covenant contained under the applicable indenture;
·that we will deliver to the trustee written notice of any event of default, with the exception of any
payment default that has not given rise to a right of acceleration under the indenture;
·that we will not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the
benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, which may affect
the covenants or the performance of the indenture or the offered debt securities;
·that we will do or cause to be done everything necessary to preserve and keep in full force and
effect our corporate existence and the corporate, partnership or other existence of certain of our
subsidiaries whose preservation is determined to be desirable by our board of directors and
material to the holders;
·that we will, and we will cause each of our subsidiaries to, pay prior to delinquency all taxes,
assessments and governmental levies, except as contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings;
·that in the event we are required to pay additional interest to holders of our debt securities, we
will provide notice to the trustee, and where applicable, the paying agent, of our obligation to
pay such additional interest prior to the date on which any such additional interest is scheduled
to be paid; and
·that we will execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may be
reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of the indenture.
Any series of offered debt securities may have covenants in addition to or differing from those
included in any applicable indenture which will be described in subsequent filings prepared in
connection with the offering of such securities, limiting or restricting, among other things:
 
 ·the ability of us or our subsidiaries to incur either secured or unsecured debt, or both;
 
 ·the ability to make certain payments, dividends, redemptions or repurchases;
79
·our ability to create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting our subsidiaries;
 
 ·our ability to make investments;
 
 ·mergers and consolidations by us or our subsidiaries;
 
 ·sales of assets by us;
 
 ·our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates;
 
 ·our ability to incur liens; and
 
 ·sale and leaseback transactions.
 
Modification of the Indentures
 
Each indenture and the rights of the respective holders may be modified by us only with the
consent of holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
debt securities of all series under the respective indenture affected by the modification, taken
together as a class. But no modification that:
 
 ·changes the amount of securities whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or
waiver;
·reduces the rate of or changes the interest payment time on any security or alters its redemption
provisions (other than any alteration to any such section which would not materially adversely
affect the legal rights of any holder under the indenture) or the price at which we are required to
offer to purchase the securities;
·reduces the principal or changes the maturity of any security or reduces the amount of, or
postpones the date fixed for, the payment of any sinking fund or analogous obligation;
·waives a default or event of default in the payment of the principal of or interest, if any, on any
security (except a rescission of acceleration of the securities of any series by the holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding securities of that series and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
·makes the principal of or interest, if any, on any security payable in any currency other than that
stated in the security;
·makes any change with respect to holders' rights to receive principal and interest, certain
modifications affecting shareholders or certain currency-related issues; or
·waives a redemption payment with respect to any security or changes any of the provisions with
respect to the redemption of any securities will be effective against any holder without his
consent. In addition, other terms as specified in subsequent filings may be modified without the
consent of the holders.
Events of Default
 
Each indenture defines an event of default for the debt securities of any series as being any one
of the following events:
 
 ·default in any payment of interest when due which continues for 30 days;
80
·default in any payment of principal or premium at maturity;
 
 ·default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment when due;
 
 ·default in the performance of any covenant in the debt securities or the applicable indenture
which continues for 60 days after we receive notice of the default;
·default under a bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness for borrowed money by
us or our subsidiaries (to the extent we are directly responsible or liable therefor) having a
principal amount in excess of a minimum amount set forth in the applicable subsequent filing,
whether such indebtedness now exists or is hereafter created, which default shall have resulted
in such indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it
would otherwise have become due and payable, without such acceleration having been
rescinded or annulled or cured within 30 days after we receive notice of the default; and
·events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization.
 
An event of default of one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of
default with respect to any other series of debt securities.
 
There may be such other or different events of default as described in an applicable subsequent
filing with respect to any class or series of offered debt securities.
 
In case an event of default occurs and continues for the debt securities of any series, the
applicable trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt
securities then outstanding of that series may declare the principal and accrued but unpaid
interest of the debt securities of that series to be due and payable. Any event of default for the
debt securities of any series which has been cured may be waived by the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of that series then outstanding.
Each indenture requires us to file annually after debt securities are issued under that indenture
with the applicable trustee a written statement signed by two of our officers as to the absence of
material defaults under the terms of that indenture. Each indenture provides that the applicable
trustee may withhold notice to the holders of any default if it considers it in the interest of the
holders to do so, except notice of a default in payment of principal, premium or interest.
Subject to the duties of the trustee in case an event of default occurs and continues, each
indenture provides that the trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers
under that indenture at the request, order or direction of holders unless the holders have offered
to the trustee reasonable indemnity. Subject to these provisions for indemnification and the rights
of the trustee, each indenture provides that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
debt securities of any series then outstanding have the right to direct the time, method and place
of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or
power conferred on the trustee as long as the exercise of that right does not conflict with any law
or the indenture.
 
Defeasance and Discharge
 
The terms of each indenture provide us with the option to be discharged from any and all
obligations in respect of the debt securities issued thereunder upon the deposit with the trustee,
in trust, of money or United States government obligations, or both, which through the payment of
interest and principal in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient to
pay any installment of principal, premium and interest on, and any mandatory sinking fund
payments in respect of, the debt securities on the stated maturity of the payments in accordance
with the terms of the debt securities and the indenture governing the debt securities. This right
may only be exercised if, among other things, we have received from, or there has been
published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling to the effect that such a
discharge will not be deemed, or result in, a taxable event with respect to holders. This discharge
would not apply to our obligations to register the transfer or exchange of debt securities, to
replace stolen, lost or mutilated debt securities, to maintain paying agencies and hold moneys for
payment in trust.
81
Defeasance of Certain Covenants
 
The terms of the debt securities provide us with the right not to comply with specified covenants
and that specified events of default described in a subsequent filing will not apply. In order to
exercise this right, we will be required to deposit with the trustee money or U.S. government
obligations, or both, which through the payment of interest and principal will provide money in an
amount sufficient to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on, and any mandatory sinking
fund payments in respect of, the debt securities on the stated maturity of such payments in
accordance with the terms of the debt securities and the indenture governing such debt
securities. We will also be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that
the deposit and related covenant defeasance should not cause the holders of such series to
recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes.
 
A subsequent filing may further describe the provisions, if any, of any particular series of offered
debt securities permitting a discharge defeasance.
 
Subsidiary Guarantees
Certain of our subsidiaries may guarantee the debt securities we offer. In that case, the terms and
conditions of the subsidiary guarantees will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.
Unless we indicate differently in the applicable prospectus supplement, if any of our subsidiaries
guarantee any of our debt securities that are subordinated to any of our senior indebtedness,
then the subsidiary guarantees will be subordinated to the senior indebtedness of such
subsidiary to the same extent as our debt securities are subordinated to our senior indebtedness.
 
Global Securities
 
The debt securities of a series may be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more global
securities that will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a depository identified in an applicable
subsequent filing and registered in the name of the depository or a nominee for the depository. In
such a case, one or more global securities will be issued in a denomination or aggregate
denominations equal to the portion of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt
securities of the series to be represented by the global security or securities. Unless and until it is
exchanged in whole or in part for debt securities in definitive certificated form, a global security
may not be transferred except as a whole by the depository for the global security to a nominee of
the depository or by a nominee of the depository to the depository or another nominee of the
depository or by the depository or any nominee to a successor depository for that series or a
nominee of the successor depository and except in the circumstances described in an applicable
subsequent filing.
 
We expect that the following provisions will apply to depository arrangements for any portion of a
series of debt securities to be represented by a global security. Any additional or different terms
of the depository arrangement will be described in an applicable subsequent filing.
 
Upon the issuance of any global security, and the deposit of that global security with or on behalf
of the depository for the global security, the depository will credit, on its book-entry registration
and transfer system, the principal amounts of the debt securities represented by that global
security to the accounts of institutions that have accounts with the depository or its nominee. The
accounts to be credited will be designated by the underwriters or agents engaging in the
distribution of the debt securities or by us, if the debt securities are offered and sold directly by us.
Ownership of beneficial interests in a global security will be limited to participating institutions or
persons that may hold interests through such participating institutions. Ownership of beneficial
interests by participating institutions in the global security will be shown on, and the transfer of
the beneficial interests will be effected only through, records maintained by the depository for the
global security or by its nominee. Ownership of beneficial interests in the global security by
persons that hold through participating institutions will be shown on, and the transfer of the
beneficial interests within the participating institutions will be effected only through, records
maintained by those participating institutions. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that
purchasers of securities take physical delivery of the securities in certificated form. The foregoing
limitations and such laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in the global
securities.
82
So long as the depository for a global security, or its nominee, is the registered owner of that
global security, the depository or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole
owner or holder of the debt securities represented by the global security for all purposes under
the applicable indenture. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable subsequent filing and
except as specified below, owners of beneficial interests in the global security will not be entitled
to have debt securities of the series represented by the global security registered in their names,
will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of debt securities of the series in
certificated form and will not be considered the holders thereof for any purposes under the
indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in the global security must rely
on the procedures of the depository and, if such person is not a participating institution, on the
procedures of the participating institution through which the person owns its interest, to exercise
any rights of a holder under the indenture.
 
The depository may grant proxies and otherwise authorize participating institutions to give or take
any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action which a
holder is entitled to give or take under the applicable indenture. We understand that, under
existing industry practices, if we request any action of holders or any owner of a beneficial
interest in the global security desires to give any notice or take any action a holder is entitled to
give or take under the applicable indenture, the depository would authorize the participating
institutions to give the notice or take the action, and participating institutions would authorize
beneficial owners owning through such participating institutions to give the notice or take the
action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them.
 
Unless otherwise specified in applicable subsequent filings, payments of principal, premium and
interest on debt securities represented by a global security registered in the name of a depository
or its nominee will be made by us to the depository or its nominee, as the case may be, as the
registered owner of the global security.
 
We expect that the depository for any debt securities represented by a global security, upon
receipt of any payment of principal, premium or interest, will credit participating institutions'
accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the
principal amount of the global security as shown on the records of the depository. We also expect
that payments by participating institutions to owners of beneficial interests in the global security
held through those participating institutions will be governed by standing instructions and
customary practices, as is now the case with the securities held for the accounts of customers
registered in street name, and will be the responsibility of those participating institutions. None of
us, the trustees or any agent of ours or the trustees will have any responsibility or liability for any
aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial interests in a global
security, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to those beneficial
interests.
 
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subsequent filings, a global security of any series
will be exchangeable for certificated debt securities of the same series only if:
 
 ·the depository for such global securities notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
depository or such depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange
Act and, in either case, a successor depository is not appointed by us within 90 days after we
receive the notice or become aware of the ineligibility;
·we in our sole discretion determine that the global securities shall be exchangeable for
certificated debt securities; or
·there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default under the applicable indenture
with respect to the debt securities of that series.
Upon any exchange, owners of beneficial interests in the global security or securities will be
entitled to physical delivery of individual debt securities in certificated form of like tenor and terms
equal in principal amount to their beneficial interests, and to have the debt securities in
certificated form registered in the names of the beneficial owners, which names are expected to
be provided by the depository's relevant participating institutions to the applicable trustee.
83
In the event that the Depository Trust Company, or DTC, acts as depository for the global
securities of any series, the global securities will be issued as fully registered securities
registered in the name of Cede & Co., DTC's partnership nominee.
 
The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, a
limited-purpose trust company under New York State banking law and a registered clearing
agency with the SEC. Established in 1973, DTC was created to reduce costs and provide
clearing and settlement efficiencies by immobilizing securities and making "book-entry" changes
to ownership of the securities. DTC provides securities movements for the net settlements of the
National Securities Clearing Corporation's or NSCC, and settlement for institutional trades
(which typically involve money and securities transfers between custodian banks and
broker/dealers), as well as money market instruments.
 
DTC is a subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Company, or DTCC. DTCC is a holding
company established in 1999 to combine DTC and NSCC. DTCC, through its subsidiaries,
provides clearing, settlement and information services for equities, corporate and municipal
bonds, government and mortgage backed securities, money market instruments and over the-
counter derivatives. In addition, DTCC is a leading processor of mutual funds and insurance
transactions, linking funds and carriers with their distribution networks. DTCC's customer base
extends to thousands of companies within the global financial services industry. DTCC serves
brokers, dealers, institutional investors, banks, trust companies, mutual fund companies,
insurance carriers, hedge funds and other financial intermediaries – either directly or through
correspondent relationships.
DTCC is industry-owned by its customers who are members of the financial community, such as
banks, broker/dealers, mutual funds and other financial institutions. DTCC operates on an at-cost
basis, returning excess revenue from transaction fees to its member firms. All services provided
by DTC are regulated by the Commission.
 
 
The 2012 DTCC Board of Directors is composed of 19 directors serving one-year terms. Thirteen
directors are representatives of clearing agency participants, including international
broker/dealers, custodian and clearing banks, and investment institutions; of these, two directors
are designated by DTCC's preferred shareholders, which are NYSE Euronext and FINRA. Three
directors are from non-participants. The remaining three are the chairman and chief executive
officer, president, and chief operating officer of DTCC. All of the Board members except those
designated by the preferred shareholders are elected annually
 
To facilitate subsequent transfers, the debt securities may be registered in the name of DTC's
nominee, Cede & Co. The deposit of the debt securities with DTC and their registration in the
name of Cede & Co. will effect no change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the
actual beneficial owners of the debt securities. DTC's records reflect only the identity of the direct
participating institutions to whose accounts debt securities are credited, which may or may not be
the beneficial owners. The participating institutions remain responsible for keeping account of
their holdings on behalf of their customers.
 
Delivery of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participating institutions, by direct
participating institutions to indirect participating institutions, and by direct participating institutions
and indirect participating institutions to beneficial owners of debt securities are governed by
arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in
effect.
 
Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. consents or votes with respect to the debt securities. Under its
usual procedures, DTC mails a proxy to the issuer as soon as possible after the record date. The
proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those direct participating institution to
whose accounts the debt securities are credited on the record date.
 
If applicable, redemption notices shall be sent to Cede & Co. If less than all of the debt securities
of a series represented by global securities are being redeemed, DTC's practice is to determine
by lot the amount of the interest of each direct participating institution in that issue to be
redeemed.
84
To the extent that any debt securities provide for repayment or repurchase at the option of the
holders thereof, a beneficial owner shall give notice of any option to elect to have its interest in
the global security repaid by us, through its participating institution, to the applicable trustee, and
shall effect delivery of the interest in a global security by causing the direct participating
institution to transfer the direct participating institution's interest in the global security or securities
representing the interest, on DTC's records, to the applicable trustee. The requirement for
physical delivery of debt securities in connection with a demand for repayment or repurchase will
be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the global security or securities representing
the debt securities are transferred by direct participating institutions on DTC's records.
 
DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository for the debt securities at any
time. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor securities depository is not
appointed, debt security certificates are required to be printed and delivered as described above.
 
We may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through the securities
depository. In that event, debt security certificates will be printed and delivered as described
above.
 
The information in this section concerning DTC, DTCC and DTC's book-entry system has been
obtained  from  sources  that  we  believe  to  be  reliable,  but  we  take  no  responsibility  for  its
accuracy.
85
DESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS
We may issue purchase contracts for the purchase or sale of any of our debt or equity securities
issued by us.
 
Each purchase contract will entitle the holder thereof to purchase or sell, and obligate us to sell
or purchase, on specified dates, such securities at a specified purchase price, which may be
based on a formula, all as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. We may, however,
satisfy our obligations, if any, with respect to any purchase contract by delivering the cash value
of such purchase contract or the cash value of the securities otherwise deliverable as set forth in
the applicable prospectus supplement. The applicable prospectus supplement will also specify
the methods by which the holders may purchase or sell such securities and any acceleration,
cancellation or termination provisions or other provisions relating to the settlement of a purchase
contract.
The purchase contracts may require us to make periodic payments to the holders thereof or vice
versa, which payments may be deferred to the extent set forth in the applicable prospectus
supplement, and those payments may be unsecured or prefunded on some basis. The purchase
contracts may require the holders thereof to secure their obligations in a specified manner to be
described in the applicable prospectus supplement. Alternatively, purchase contracts may
require holders to satisfy their obligations thereunder when the purchase contracts are issued.
Our obligation to settle such pre-paid purchase contracts on the relevant settlement date may
constitute indebtedness. Accordingly, pre-paid purchase contracts will be issued under the
indenture.
 
The purchase contracts will be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
State of New York, without giving effect to any principles thereof relating to conflicts of law that
would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
86
DESCRIPTION OF RIGHTS
We may issue rights to purchase our equity securities. These rights may be issued independently
or together with any other security offered by this prospectus and may or may not be transferable
by the shareholder receiving the rights in the rights offering. In connection with any rights offering,
we may enter into a standby underwriting agreement with one or more underwriters pursuant to
which the underwriter will purchase any securities that remain unsubscribed for upon completion
of the rights offering.
 
The applicable prospectus supplement relating to any rights will describe the terms of the offered
rights, including, where applicable, the following:
· any other terms of the rights, including terms, procedures and limitations relating to the
· the exercise price for the rights;
· the number of rights issued to each shareholder;
· the extent to which the rights are transferable;
exchange and exercise of the rights;
· the date on which the right to exercise the rights will commence and the date on which the
right will expire;
· the amount of rights outstanding;
· the extent to which the rights include an over-subscription privilege with respect to
unsubscribed securities; and
· the material terms of any standby underwriting arrangement entered into by us in
connection with the rights offering.
The description in the applicable prospectus supplement of any rights we offer will not
necessarily be complete and will be qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable rights
certificate or rights agreement, which will be filed with the Commission if we offer rights. For more
information on how you can obtain copies of any rights certificate or rights agreement if we offer
rights, see "Where You Can Find Additional Information" of this prospectus. We urge you to read
the applicable rights certificate, the applicable rights agreement and any applicable prospectus
supplement in their entirety.
87
DESCRIPTION OF UNITS
As specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, we may issue units consisting of one or
more of our purchase contracts, warrants, debt securities, shares of preferred stock, shares of
common stock or any combination of such securities. The applicable prospectus supplement will
describe:
 
 ·the terms of the units and of the purchase contracts, warrants, debt securities, preferred stock
and common stock comprising the units, including whether and under what circumstances the
securities comprising the units may be traded separately;
·a description of the terms of any unit agreement governing the units;
 
 ·if applicable, a discussion of any material U.S. federal tax considerations; and
 
 ·a description of the provisions for the payment, settlement, transfer or exchange or the units.

Information provided by the Company
We will furnish holders of shares of our common stock with annual reports containing audited
financial statements and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm. The
audited financial statements will be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. As a "foreign private issuer," we are exempt from the rules under the
Exchange Act prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements to shareholders. While
we furnish proxy statements to shareholders in accordance with the rules of the NASDAQ Global
Select Market, those proxy statements do not conform to Schedule 14A of the proxy rules
promulgated under the Exchange Act. In addition, as a "foreign private issuer," our officers and
directors are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act relating to short swing profit reporting
and liability.
Commission Position on Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our
directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we
have been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
unenforceable.

PART II
INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN THE PROSPECTUS
Item 8. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
 
The Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Registrant provide as follows:
 
(1) Any person who is or was a director or officer of the Registrant, or is or was serving at the
request of the Registrant as a director or officer of another partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Registrant upon the same terms, under the
same conditions, and to the same extent as authorized by Section 60 of the Business
Corporation Act of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or BCA, if he acted in good faith and in a
manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Registrant,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe his
conduct was unlawful.
 
The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Registrant provide as follows:
 
(1) No director shall be personally liable to the Registrant or any of its shareholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from
liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the BCA as the same exists or may be
hereafter amended. If the BCA is amended hereafter to authorize the further elimination or
limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Registrant shall be
eliminated to the fullest extent authorized by the BCA, as so amended. Any repeal or modification
of this provision shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Registrant
existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior
to such repeal or modification.
 
Section 60 of the Associations Law of the Republic of the Marshall Islands provides as follows:
 
Indemnification of directors and officers.
 
(1) Actions not by or in right of the corporation. A corporation shall have the power to indemnify
any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a
director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of no contest, or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in
a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful.
 
(2) Actions by or in right of the corporation. A corporation shall have power to indemnify any
person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure judgment in its favor by
reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him or in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit
if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of
any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for
negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the corporation unless and only to the
extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application
that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such
person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall
deem proper.
II-1
(3) When director or officer is successful. To the extent that a director or officer of a corporation
has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding
referred to in subsections (1) or (2) of this section, or in the defense of a claim, issue or matter
therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
(4) Payment of expenses in advance. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action,
suit or proceeding may be paid in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding as authorized by the board of directors in the specific case upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this
section.
(5) Indemnification pursuant to other rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses
may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.
(6) Continuation of indemnification. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided
by, or granted pursuant to, this section shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 
(7) Insurance. A corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of any person who is or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the
request of the corporation as a director or officer against any liability asserted against him and
incurred by him in such capacity whether or not the corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this section.
Item 9. Exhibits
The exhibit index at the end of this registration statement identifies the exhibits which are
included in this registration statement and are incorporated herein by reference (the "Exhibit
Index").
Item 10. Undertakings.
(a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:
(1)To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment
to this registration statement:
(i)To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;
(ii)To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the
registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which,
individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in
the registration statement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume
of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which
was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering
range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if,
in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change
in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table
in the effective registration statement
II-2
(iii)To  include  any  material  information  with  respect  to  the  plan  of  distribution  not  previously
disclosed  in  the  registration  statement  or  any  material  change  to  such  information  in  the
registration statement;
Provided, however, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply if
the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is
contained in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the registrant pursuant to section 13 or
section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the
registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is
part of the registration statement.
(2)That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration
statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that
time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
(3)To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities
being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.
(4)To file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to include any financial
statements required by Item 8.A. of Form 20-F at the start of any delayed offering or
throughout a continuous offering.  Financial statements and information otherwise required by
Section 10(a)(3) of the Act need not be furnished, provided, that the registrant includes in the
prospectus, by means of a post-effective amendment, financial statements required pursuant
to this paragraph (a)(4) and other information necessary to ensure that all other information in
the prospectus is at least as current as the date of those financial
statements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to registration statements on Form F-
3, a post-effective amendment need not be filed to include financial statements and
information required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 or Rule 3-19 of
Regulation S-X if such financial statements and information are contained in periodic reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the Form F-3.
(5)That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:
(i)Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part
of  this  registration  statement  as  of  the  date  the  filed  prospectus  was  deemed  part  of  and
included in the registration statement; and
(ii)Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a
registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule
415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by section 10(a) of
the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration
statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness
or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus.
As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that
date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration
statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus
relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona
fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or
prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or
deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of
the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such
effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement
or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document
immediately prior to such effective date.
II-3
(6)That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933
to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant
undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this
registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the
purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the
following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will
be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:
(i)Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering
required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;
(ii)Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned
registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;
(iii)The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material
information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the
undersigned registrant; and
(iv)Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to
the purchaser.
(b)The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability
under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrant's annual report pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each
filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the
offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering
thereof.
(c) – (d)
Not applicable.
(e)The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to deliver or cause to be delivered with the
prospectus, to each person to whom the prospectus is sent or given, the latest annual report to
security holders that is incorporated by reference in the prospectus and furnished pursuant to
and meeting the requirements of Rule 14a-3 or Rule 14c-3 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934; and, where interim financial information required to be presented by Article 3 of
Regulation S-X is not set forth in the prospectus, to deliver, or cause to be delivered to each
person to whom the prospectus is sent or given, the latest quarterly report that is specifically
incorporated by reference in the prospectus to provide such interim financial information.
Not applicable.
(f) – (g)
 
(h)Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be
permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the
foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a
claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of
expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless
in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a
court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against
public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.
(i)
Not applicable.
(j)The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for the purpose of
determining the eligibility of the trustee to act under subsection (a) of Section 310 of the Trust
Indenture Act in accordance with the rules an regulations prescribed by the SEC under Section
305(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act.
