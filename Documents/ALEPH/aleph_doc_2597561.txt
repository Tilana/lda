Summary of Results
Net profit after tax
Adelaide Brighton Limited net profit after tax (NPAT) for the half year ended 30 June 2016 declined 6.7% to 
$77.1  million  due  to  lower  property  profits  compared  to  the  previous  corresponding  period.  Property 
transactions contributed $1.3 million to NPAT in the half year, compared with $12.3 million in 1H15.
Excluding property transactions NPAT was up 7.8% to $75.8 million, reflecting revenue and margin growth 
in the wholly owned business and a stronger contribution from joint operations.
Revenue
Revenue of $686.0 million was up 1.2% on 1H15. Improved prices and strong demand in the New South 
Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia partially offset slowing demand in Western Australia and 
the Northern Territory.
Earnings before interest and tax
Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) declined 5.1% to $110.8 million. Excluding property, EBIT was up 
6.6% to $110.6 million, representing an expansion in EBIT margin from 15.3% in 1H15 to 16.1% in 1H16.
Margins
Margins were assisted by price increases in all products and volume growth in concrete, aggregates and 
concrete  products.  Reduced  energy  costs  in  Western  Australia  and  improved  earnings  from  the  joint 
operations in the eastern states were also positive for the group margin compared to 1H15. Total Group 
energy costs (including electricity, gas, coal, diesel and alternative fuels) are expected to be $9 million less 
than pcp.
These offset the impact of reduced cement volume in Western Australia and Northern Territory and higher 
import costs due to a weaker Australian Dollar.
Operating cash flow and debt
Operating cash flow was a positive feature, increasing by $13.8 million to $97.6 million due to revenue and 
margin growth, partially offset by higher income tax paid. Net debt to equity gearing was 29.1% at 30 June 
2016.
Dividends
The  Board  declared  an  interim  ordinary  dividend  of  8.5  cents  per  share  and  a  special  dividend  of  
4.0 cents per share, both franked to 100%. This is a 0.5 cent increase in ordinary dividend and an unchanged 
special dividend compared to 1H15.
The  Record  Date  for  the  interim  ordinary  and  special  dividend  is  15  September  2016  with  payment  on  
12 October 2016.
The  special  dividend  takes  into  consideration  Adelaide  Brighton’s  strong  cash  flow,  low  gearing,  current 
capital expenditure outlook and availability of franking credits.

Interim results summary – half year ended 30 June 2016
Review of Operations
Demand Overview
Strong demand continued on the east coast of Australia, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney. Residential 
activity remained favourable in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and returned to growth in South 
Australia. However, non-residential building and infrastructure4 activity also made important contributions to 
demand and growth in these markets.
In New South Wales, strong residential activity was augmented by a number of significant non-residential 
building  and  transport  infrastructure  projects.  In  Victoria,  multi-residential  activity  led  demand  and  was 
supported by improved non-residential building activity.
South east Queensland demand continues to improve, particularly in the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast 
markets. South Australian demand was supported by the commencement of several infrastructure projects 
and stronger mining demand.
Cement demand declined in Western Australia given weak residential and non-residential activity and lower 
resource  project  volumes.  Western  Australian  lime  demand  declined  marginally.  Cement  demand  in  the 
Northern Territory declined due to softer resource sector activity, while lime demand was stable.
Cement and Clinker
Sales – Strong residential demand
Total cement and clinker sales volumes decreased marginally versus the first half of 2015.
Volumes in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South  Australia improved. This was offset by a 
sales volume decline in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
While selling prices showed encouraging increases in key markets, an increased proportion of sales to lower 
price east coast markets contributed to a slight decline in average realised cement and clinker prices for the 
Group. In addition, sales to Independent Cement and Lime (50% owned by Adelaide Brighton) in Victoria 
and New South Wales attracted a lower price under a “rise and fall” provision that follows production costs.
Operations – Focus on energy improvement opportunity
Cement and clinker margins were lower compared to 1H15, impacted by a reduced average selling price, 
slightly lower volumes, reduced import profitability and higher average costs for gas and electricity in South 
Australia.
Import  profitability  declined  by  approximately  $4  million  before  tax  compared  to  1H15  with  the  lower 
Australian  Dollar  increasing  the  cost  of  imported  product.  This  was  partially  offset  by  the  reduced  fuel 
component of freight costs for imported product of $1.5 million in 1H16.
Outside of freight costs on imported product there have been reductions in fuel costs in logistics operations 
in Australia. Improved efficiency in contractor and owned logistics operations also improved transport costs. 
Strategies for managing energy costs are discussed in more detail on page 7.
4   Non-residential building includes education, health, office, retail, hotels and factories, while infrastructure includes roads, bridges
and railways.

Interim results summary – half year ended 30 June 2016
Lime
Sales – Recovery in gold sector continued
Lime  sales  volumes  declined  marginally  compared  to  1H15.  Non-alumina  demand  continued  to  recover 
driven  by  the  gold  sector,  however,  alumina  sector  off  take  was  softer  after  customer  operational 
requirements delayed sales.
The average lime selling price increased in line with inflation. Some imports of lime have continued although 
the lower value of the Australian Dollar has reduced their competitiveness.
Operations – Margins assisted by further cost savings
Higher  average  selling  prices  and  lower  operating  costs  assisted  margins  significantly  in  lime  despite  a 
slight decline in  volume. Cost savings  were  achieved in energy, maintenance and transport,  with energy 
being  the  largest  contributor.  A  small  investment  in  loading  capability  delivered  benefits  through  more 
efficient use of rail transport. Maintenance and transport costs have also benefited from renegotiation of a 
number of contractor agreements given increased contractor availability.
Concrete and Aggregates
Sales – Robust demand across Adelaide Brighton’s markets
Concrete and aggregates volumes increased in all markets. Reflecting healthy demand, average concrete 
prices  increased  by  3.4%  in  1H16.  Aggregates  prices  increased  by  more  than  CPI  and,  as  has  been 
anticipated by Adelaide Brighton, were particularly strong in the Sydney market as supply tightened.
South Australian concrete and aggregates volumes enjoyed a return to growth. The outlook for demand in 
South Australia appears favourable given the pipeline of infrastructure projects.
Sales volumes were also strong in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.
Sydney  aggregates  markets  appear  to  be  developing  in  line  with  expectations  given  the  depletion  of 
traditional reserves and increasing reliance on product from further afield. The Company’s New South Wales 
quarry operations are competitively positioned to supply demand growth in Sydney and generate attractive 
returns for shareholders.
Operations – Improved margins
Margins improved for both concrete and aggregates as a result of the  higher  volumes,  increased selling 
prices and cost control. Delivery costs declined due to lower average diesel prices and operational focus on 
transportation efficiency. This has included improved management of the owned and contractor fleet.
Concrete Products
Sales – Demand improves
Concrete Products revenue grew 6.7% on 1H15 due to higher residential and commercial sales and selling 
price rises in line with CPI. Sales volume increased in all operating regions compared to 1H15.
Operations – Margin improvement
Concrete  Products  EBIT  increased  18.8%  on  1H15  to  $3.8  million.  EBIT  margins  were  higher  due  to 
improved volumes, prices and operational efficiency.
Adelaide Brighton continues to focus on efficiency in the masonry business with further benefits expected 
to  come  from  tolling  arrangements,  a  range  of  operational  improvements  and  transport  efficiencies.  In 
addition,  the  business  has  made  a  significant  investment  in  product  innovation  to  lift  the  presence  of 
masonry within the building products industry, which offers exciting revenue opportunities for the business 
in the medium term.
The concrete products business is also an important and growing customer for the cement, aggregates and 
sand business, which offers vertical integration benefits for the Company.

Joint Arrangements and Associates
Independent Cement and Lime Pty Ltd (ICL) (50%)
ICL is a specialist supplier of cement and cement blended products to a wide variety of industries and retail 
outlets throughout Victoria and New South Wales. Demand across Victoria and New South Wales remained 
strong,  stretching  supply  capabilities.  Margins  improved  due  to  price  increases,  strong  demand  in  New 
South Wales, and a decrease in input costs. ICL’s contribution increased 56.7% on pcp to $4.7 million.
Sunstate Cement Limited (Sunstate) (50%)
Sunstate is a joint venture with a cement milling, storage and distribution facility at Fisherman Islands, Port 
Brisbane.  Improved  volumes  and  price  increases,  despite  the  south  east  Queensland  market  remaining 
highly competitive, supported a 14% increase in net profit contribution from Sunstate to $5.0 million.
Mawson Group (Mawsons) (50%)
Mawsons  is  the  largest  premixed  concrete  and  quarry  operator  in  northern  regional  Victoria,  and  also 
operates  in  southern  regional  New  South  Wales.  Mawsons  is  a  significant  aggregates  producer  in  the 
region,  holding  number  one  and  number  two  positions  in  the  markets  it  serves.  Earnings  from  the  joint 
venture improved slightly due to higher margin sales of quarry products to infrastructure projects despite 
continued competitive pressures and generally softer demand in its regional markets.
Aalborg Portland Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (APM) (30%)
Aalborg  Portland  Malaysia  manufactures  and sells  white  cement  and  clinker  for  the  domestic  Malaysian 
markets and exports to Australia and markets throughout south east Asia. Equity accounted earnings for 
APM increased $1.3 million. Volumes and costs improved as a result of the resolution of issues following 
the commissioning of the plant upgrade and the investment is on a pathway to meet returns expectations, 
while also supplying Adelaide Brighton’s domestic cement operations.
Strategic Developments
Adelaide Brighton continues a successful long term strategy to grow shareholder returns through investment 
in three key areas:
1.  Cost reduction and operational improvement across the Company;
2.  Growth of the lime business to supply the resources sector in WA, SA and NT; and
3.  Focused and relevant vertical integration into downstream aggregates, concrete, logistics and masonry
businesses.
Operational  efficiency  remains  a  key  priority,  with  a  particular  focus  on  continuous  improvement  at  the 
already globally competitive lime operations in Western Australia and cement production assets in South 
Australia and Western Australia. The drive for greater energy efficiency has delivered significant benefits 
over the last decade and offers further opportunities to improve shareholder value through reducing energy 
consumption and diversifying energy supply.
Transportation costs are an important element of energy efficiency. Meaningful transport cost advantages 
that  underpin  long  term  shareholder  value  are  offered  by  the  unique  lime  resource  position  in  Western 
Australia, the unmatched distribution network in cement and clinker and the highly strategic locations of the 
Group’s aggregates operations.
The major acquisitions in downstream pre-mixed concrete and upstream aggregate businesses that were 
completed in 2014 and 2015 added highly strategic positions and scale to Adelaide Brighton’s operations. 
These acquisitions are now exceeding earnings expectations and their outlook appears positive. Adelaide 
Brighton  continues  to  pursue  downstream  integration  opportunities  where  it  adds  value  for  shareholders 
with a particular focus on strategic aggregate positions.

Adelaide Brighton Ltd 
Interim results summary – half year ended 30 June 2016
1  Cost reduction and operational improvement
Competitive import infrastructure
Adelaide Brighton is Australia’s largest importer of cementitious materials (cement, clinker and blast furnace 
slag) utilising more than two million tonnes of imported product per annum.
This  industry  leading  position  enhances  supply  chain  efficiency  in  procurement,  transport,  storage  and 
distribution. The use of imported materials allows the supply of competitively priced product into a range of 
markets  where  demand  exceeds  the  Company’s  manufacturing  capacity.  It  enables  Adelaide  Brighton’s 
domestic  production  assets  to  operate  at  full  utilisation,  which  underpins  its  competitive  position  and 
shareholder returns.
The  import  strategy  is  supported  by  long  term  agreements  with two  Japanese  suppliers  for  grey  clinker, 
Aalborg Portland Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. for white clinker and a major Japanese trading house for the supply 
of granulated blast furnace slag.
Energy efficiency opportunity
Adelaide Brighton has a proactive strategy designed to manage energy costs and operating risks through 
measures that include:





Reduced medium term energy consumption through operational improvement;
Growing the use of alternative fuels to reduce reliance on traditional sources;
Short term consumption management through operational adjustments;
A portfolio approach to energy supply and procurement benefits; and
Hedging and other financial strategies, where it adds value for shareholders.
The Company has in recent years foreshadowed the tightening of the South Australian gas market and the 
prospect of increasing gas prices. Gas costs have increased in this market, albeit not yet to the full extent 
originally anticipated.
The  outlook for  South  Australian gas  prices  is  uncertain  with the tightening  of  the  local  market  in recent 
years  contrasted  by  sharp  declines  in  international  and  some  interstate  gas  markets,  such  as  Western 
Australia. Adelaide Brighton has sought to maintain diversity and flexibility in gas supply arrangements to 
take advantage of the evolving landscape and emerging opportunities to improve energy costs.
Alternative fuels have been a key focus for reducing reliance on traditional  energy sources and lowering 
costs  over  the  last  decade.  An  upgrade  of  alternative  fuel  capacity  at  Birkenhead  is  now  complete  and 
ramping  up  with  the  potential  to  replace  up  to  30%  of  Adelaide  Brighton’s  South  Australian  energy 
requirement of 6 petajoules per annum.
South Australian electricity spike in July 2016
In July 2016, the market was severely impacted by a price spike related to a temporary reduction in supply 
capacity through the Victoria/South Australia Interconnector during a capacity upgrade that was completed 
in late July 2016.
The  upgrade  project,  strong  winter  demand,  inconsistent  renewable  production  and  high  gas  prices 
combined in July 2016 to create a temporary local electricity price spike in the electricity spot market.
The price spike added approximately $3 million to Adelaide Brighton’s costs, mainly at the Birkenhead plant, 
which grinds clinker5 into cement for local and interstate markets. Adelaide Brighton significantly upgraded 
grinding capacity in 2014 to allow it to replace imported cement and generate a greater share of the grinding 
margin in South Australia.
The full impact of the electricity price spike was mitigated by the management of South Australian grinding 
activity and a temporary switch to imported product in certain markets. This highlights the operating flexibility 
afforded by the complementary industry leading import position.

Progression of land sales to realise capital
Adelaide Brighton has  been actively engaged in selling and preparing for sale properties released by  its 
operational  rationalisation  and  improvement  program.  Since  the  beginning  of  2013,  proceeds  from  the 
property sale program have been $66 million.
In 1H16, property sales added $1.3 million to net profit after tax, most of which was the tax benefit on the 
recognition  of  capital  losses  ahead  of  an  expected  transaction  in  2H16.  For  the  full  year  2016  property 
transactions are expected to deliver cash proceeds of $20 million and NPAT of $7 million.
Including  these  2016  transactions,  the  portfolio  of  properties  targeted for  sale  could  realise  in  excess  of 
$140 million in proceeds over the next 10 years. The EBIT margin on these sales is anticipated to be circa 
85% with an effective tax rate of approximately 20%. Sale proceeds over the next two years could be in the 
range of $30 million to $40 million.
2  Lime growth
Efficient operations with strong competitive position
Adelaide Brighton’s Munster, Western Australia, lime business is underpinned by low cost mineral resources 
secured by a State Agreement Act and long term statutory approvals. In the long term, demand growth in 
lime is driven by the globally competitive Western Australian resources sector.
The two lime kilns are among the largest globally and are currently at 80% operating capacity. Through the 
Munster plant’s low cost position and reduction in the cost of energy in Western Australia, operating margins 
have improved significantly in 2016.
Lime volume has been held back in recent years by the non-alumina sector, which represents about 30% 
of Western Australian lime demand. The sector has improved in 2016, mainly due to increased production 
in the gold mining sector.
The Western Australian alumina sector remains among the lowest cost in the world, underpinning its long 
term growth. Given possible refinery expansions, there is medium term potential to add approximately 15% 
to alumina sector demand in Western Australia.
3  Downstream integration
Acquisitions delivering value
Industry  consolidation  remains  a  powerful  long  term  trend  influencing  returns  at  the  local,  national  and 
international  level.  This  trend  is  expected  to  continue  and  Adelaide  Brighton,  as  always,  will  look  to 
participate where it adds value for shareholders.
Value  adding acquisition  opportunities continue to be assessed,  with the Company  looking to add to the 
$178 million of investment over 2014 and 2015 in concrete and aggregate operations in South Australia and 
Queensland.
Demand and profitability in the acquired businesses is ahead of Adelaide Brighton’s estimates at the time 
of the acquisition and the outlook is positive.
These acquisitions provided access to strategically located assets across important markets for the Group, 
increasing  exposure  to  concrete  and  quarrying  operations.  Adelaide  Brighton  will  continue  to  pursue  its 
strategy of acquiring quality concrete and aggregate businesses that deliver shareholder value.

Adelaide Brighton Ltd 
Interim results summary – half year ended 30 June 2016
Financial Review
Cash flow and borrowings – strong cash flow and balance sheet
Cash flow from operations increased by $13.8 million on 1H15 to $97.6 million as a result of the improvement 
in earnings and net cash collections, partially offset by higher income tax payments.
Net  working  capital  increased  marginally,  as  higher  debtors  and  inventory  balances  were  offset  by  a 
reduction in accounts payable balances. Income tax payments increased over the pcp by $8.3 million due 
to higher earnings in 2015 compared to 2014 resulting in a higher final tax payment.
Capital  expenditure  of  $54.8  million  increased  $25.9  million  on  1H15.  Stay  in  business  capex  was  
$30  million.  Full  year  capital  expenditure  is  currently  expected  to  be  circa  $120  million,  which  includes 
approximately  $60  million  of  development  capex,  to  improve our  concrete  plant  footprint,  acquire  quarry 
reserves and expand production of innovative supplementary cementitious products.
Proceeds from the sale of assets of $1.9 million is down significantly from the pcp of $17.6 million, due to 
reduced property transactions. Dividend payments increased by $35.7 million over 1H15 as a result of the 
payment of higher ordinary and special dividends.
Despite the significant increase in dividends and capital expenditure, strong operating cash flow meant that 
net debt of $345.4 million was largely stable compared to 30 June 2015. This represents a net debt to equity 
gearing ratio of 29.1%, which is within the Board’s target range of 25% to 45%.
Funding facilities – financial flexibility
Adelaide Brighton has funding facilities with major lenders of $540 million, of which $150 million is unutilised. 
The  facilities  were  renewed  in  2014  to  expand  the  facility  limits,  reduce  borrowing  margins  and  extend 
maturity. The Company’s low gearing, strong cash flow and consistent returns provide it with considerable 
funding flexibility. Existing facilities have the following maturity:
Maturity
January 2018
January 2019
Limit
$330 million
$210 million
Finance cost and tax – lower effective tax rate
Net finance costs of $6.1 million were $0.4 million lower than the first half of 2015 as a result of low market 
interest rates and lower average net debt.
The effective tax rate increased from 25.1% to 26.4%, in part due to the reduced contribution from property, 
which brought down the average tax rate in 1H15. Utilisation of capital losses relating to land that is expected 
to be sold in 2H16 did however reduce the effective tax rate in 1H16. Adelaide Brighton continues to expect 
its effective tax rate to be in the range of 27% - 28%, although this will reduce in periods when capital losses 
related to property sales are recognised.

Adelaide Brighton Ltd 
Interim results summary – half year ended 30 June 2016
Dividends
The Board has declared an interim ordinary dividend of 8.5 cents per share (8.0 cents pcp) and a special 
dividend of 4.0 cents per share (4.0 cents pcp), both franked 100%. The ordinary dividend payout ratio is 
71.4%.
The special dividend is consistent with Adelaide Brighton’s long held strategy to distribute surplus capital to 
shareholders, where prudent to do so, while maintaining an efficient and resilient capital structure.
The payment of the special dividend reflects Adelaide Brighton’s strong cash flows, current capex plans and 
low balance sheet gearing compared to the target range.
The  record  date  for  the  interim  ordinary  and  special  dividend  is  15  September  2016  with  payment  on  
12 October 2016.
Outlook 
In 2016, Adelaide Brighton expects sales volume of cement and clinker to be less than 2015, primarily due 
to weakness in the Western Australian cement market.
Premixed concrete and aggregates sales volumes are anticipated to be significantly higher than 2015 as a 
result of stronger east coast and South Australian markets. Sales of concrete products are also expected 
to increase on 2015.
Lime sales volume is likely to be similar to 2015, although cost reductions are anticipated to be positive for 
margins.  The  weaker  Australian  Dollar  reduces  the  competitiveness  of  imports  relative  to  Adelaide 
Brighton’s low cost operations, but small scale lime imports in Western Australia and the Northern Territory 
remain a threat.
Price  increases  for  all  products  were  implemented  in  the  first  half  of  2016,  with  outcomes  in  line  with 
expectations.  A  number  of  factors  are  supportive  of  higher  prices  in  certain  markets,  including  strong 
demand and capacity utilisation. Further increases in cement prices are expected in 2H16.
Imports of cement, clinker and slag have been hedged through to December 2016.  At current  exchange 
rates it is estimated that import costs will increase by approximately $6 million in 2016.
Higher gas and electricity costs in South Australia have partially dampened the benefit of lower gas costs 
in  Western  Australia.  Nonetheless,  total  Group  energy  costs  (including  electricity,  gas,  coal,  diesel  and 
alternative fuels), are expected to be $9 million less than pcp.
Efficiency remains a key operational priority as part a rolling program of cost reduction to sustain leading 
margins and shareholder returns.
Property sale proceeds of about $20 million are expected in 2016, with a profit after tax of approximately  
$7 million.
To maximise shareholder returns, Adelaide Brighton seeks to ensure the balance sheet is efficiently utilised 
while  retaining  the  flexibility  to  fund  long  term  growth  as  opportunities  are  identified.  Prudent  capital 
management remains an important part of this approach.
Given the strength in cash flow and current capital expenditure plans, year end gearing is expected to be at 
the lower end of the preferred range of 25% – 45%.
Adelaide Brighton expects full year NPAT will be in the range of $190 million to $200 million. This range

Notes to the financial statements 
For the half year ended 30 June 2016
1  Basis of preparation of half year report 
This condensed consolidated interim financial report for the half year reporting period ended 30 June 2016 
has been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and 
the Corporations Act 2001.  
 
This condensed consolidated interim financial report does not include all the notes of the type normally 
included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual 
report for the year ended 31 December 2015 and any public announcements made by Adelaide Brighton 
Ltd during the interim reporting period in accordance with continuous disclosure requirements of the 
Corporations Act 2001.  
 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year and 
corresponding interim reporting period.
2  Segment reporting
(a)  Description of segments
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the CEO and 
Managing Director. These reports are evaluated regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and in 
assessing performance.
The two reportable segments have been identified as follows:
 

Cement, Lime, Concrete and Aggregates 
Concrete Products
The operating segments, Cement, Lime, Concrete and Aggregates individually meet the quantitative 
thresholds required by AASB 8 as well as meeting the aggregation criteria allowing them to be reported as 
one segment. Concrete Products meets the quantitative threshold and is therefore reported as a separate 
segment. Joint arrangements and associates related to the reportable segments form part of the above 
two reportable segments.
The major end use markets of Adelaide Brighton's products include residential and non-residential 
construction, engineering construction, alumina and steel production and mining.

Brighton Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the
audit of the annual financial report.
A review of a half-year ﬁnancial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
ﬁnancial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all signiﬁcant
matters that might be identiﬁed in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations
Act 2001.
Conclusion
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us
believe that the half-year ﬁnancial report of Adelaide Brighton Limited is not in accordance with the
Corporations Act 2001 including:
