GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS
We were formed by the amalgamation of Pan American Resources Inc. and Marvas Developments Ltd. 
on  January 16,  1996,  pursuant  to  the  Business  Corporations  Act  (Ontario).  On  March 12,  2002,  we  acquired 
OntZinc  Corporation,  a  private  Ontario  corporation,  through  a  reverse  takeover  and  changed  our  name  to 
ONTZINC Corporation.  On December 21, 2004, we acquired Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited 
((cid:147)HBMS(cid:148)) and changed our name to HudBay Minerals Inc.  In connection with the acquisition of HBMS, on 
December 21, 2004, we amended our articles to consolidate our common shares on a 30 to one basis.  On October 
25, 2005, the Company was continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act.
Our  registered  office  is  located  at  2200  -  201  Portage  Avenue,  Winnipeg,  Manitoba,  R3B  3K6.    Our
principal executive office is located at 1906 - 201 Portage Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3B 3K6. 
 
Three Year History 
 
Acquisition of Balmat
As  of  September 2003,  one  of  our  subsidiaries  acquired  the  Balmat  Mine  from  ZCA  Mines, Inc. 
((cid:147)ZCA(cid:148)) for US$20 million, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the (cid:147)Balmat Acquisition Agreement(cid:148)). The 
purchase  price  is  payable  wholly  out  of  30%  of  any  future  net  cash  flow  from  operations  after  allowing  for 
reasonable capital and exploration expenditures and a further US$5 million is payable if the price of zinc averages 
US$0.70  per  pound  for  a  consecutive  24 month  period  in  the  five  years  following  the  date  of  the  Balmat 
Acquisition  Agreement.  Pursuant  to  the  Balmat  Acquisition  Agreement,  we  assumed  certain  future  liabilities, 
including,  all  future  debts,  obligations,  commitments  and  liabilities  arising  out  of  or  directly  relating  to  the 
ownership and operation of the Balmat Mine and, in particular, any future liabilities relating to the reclamation of 
such mine.
In order to meet the anticipated financial requirements associated with maintaining and reactivating the 
Balmat  Mine,  we  completed  several  private placements of our securities. Proceeds of these private placements 
have also been used for working capital purposes.  On November 9, 2005, we announced our intention to reopen 
the Balmat Mine.  We expect that first ore will be produced from Balmat in the second quarter of 2006, building 
to  full  production  of  an  estimated  60,000  tons  of  zinc  in  concentrate  per  year  within  35  months.    We  plan  to 
process  zinc  concentrate  produced  at  the  Balmat  Mine  at  the  Canadian  Electrolytic  Refinery  in  Valleyfield, 
Quebec with an option to treat up to 40% of the total concentrate at our Zochem plant in Brampton, Ontario. 
 
Acquisition of HBMS
On  October 7,  2004,  we  entered  into  an  acquisition  agreement  to  acquire  from  Anglo  American 
International, S.A. all of the issued and outstanding shares of 152640 Canada Inc. (the (cid:147)Acquisition(cid:148)), which held 
all of the issued and outstanding shares of HBMS, for a purchase price of approximately $325 million, subject to 
adjustments on closing.  Effective December 13, 2004, the parties amended the Acquisition Agreement to provide 
that  the  net  purchase  price  would  be  paid  in  cash  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $303  million  and  as to $13 
million by the issuance to Anglo American of 5,777,777 common shares of the Company and 86,666,667 share 
purchase warrants (the (cid:147)Warrants(cid:148)).  Following the Acquisition, we consolidated our common shares on the basis 
of one new common share of the Company for every 30 old common shares (the (cid:147)Consolidation(cid:148)).  As a result of 
the  Consolidation,  every  30  Warrants  are  exercisable  for  one  common  share,  at  a  price  of  $3.15  per  common 
share, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on December 21, 2009.
- 4 -
To  fund  the  Acquisition,  we  completed  an  offering  (the  (cid:147)Subscription  Receipt  Offering(cid:148))  of 
1,917,510,000  subscription  receipts  (the  (cid:147)Subscription  Receipts(cid:148))  for  gross  proceeds  of  approximately  $143.8 
million and HBMS completed an offering (the (cid:147)Debt Financing(cid:148)) of 9-5/8% senior secured notes (the (cid:147)Notes(cid:148)) 
due January 15, 2012 for gross proceeds of US$175 million.  Upon closing of the Acquisition, each Subscription 
Receipt was exchanged for one pre-Consolidation Common Share and one-half of a Warrant. The Notes contain 
covenants  that,  among  other  things,  restrict  our  ability  in  certain  circumstances  to  declare  or  pay  dividends  or 
make other distributions on our Common Shares, incur additional debt, enter into sale or leaseback transactions, 
create liens, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, consolidate or merge into other entities or 
sell assets.
Pursuant  to  a  guarantee  ((cid:147)Parent Guarantee(cid:148)),  dated  as  of  March  24,  2005,  we  have  unconditionally 
guaranteed the debt obligations of HBMS under the Notes.  We have fully and unconditionally guaranteed all 
payments  on  the  Notes,  including  payments  of  principal,  premium  (if  any)  and  interest.    The  guarantee  is 
unsecured  and  ranks  subordinate  in  right  of  payment  to  all  senior  indebtedness  of  the  Company.    The 
guarantee will terminate on the date upon which we cease to hold a majority of the outstanding voting shares 
of HBMS.
Province of Manitoba Loan
In March 2005, we negotiated the continuation of our $17.5 million loan with the Province of Manitoba.  
The terms of the original agreement with the Province provided that the loan may be repayable in the event of a 
change of control of HBMS.  After our purchase of HBMS on December 21, 2004, new terms and conditions 
were negotiated with the Province to maintain the loan repayment schedule in accordance with the terms of the 
then existing agreement.  The loan will remain interest-free pending the satisfaction of certain conditions.  HBMS 
plans to fully retire the $15.5 million outstanding loan principal, which is supported by a letter of credit, by 2008.
In  2005,  we  raised  $10  million  through  issues  of  HudBay  common  shares  on  a  flow-through  basis.
Exploration Program 
 
 
During 2005, we used approximately $5.5 million of these funds to fund our exploration program. 
 
Collahuasi Agreement
For  the  mutual  benefit  of  both  parties,  the  evergreen  concentrate  agreement  (the  (cid:147)Collahuasi 
Agreement(cid:148)) between HBMS and Compania Minera Dona Ines de Collahuasi ((cid:147)Collahuasi(cid:148)), Chile, to purchase 
40,000  dmt  of  copper  concentrate  per  year  from  Collahuasi,  was  terminated  effective  June  30,  2005.    The 
termination of the Collahuasi Agreement, which would otherwise have expired in 2008, is not expected to impact 
our ability to supply copper concentrate to our Flin Flon smelter.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Konuto Lake Mine was closed, as planned, due to the completion
Closure of Konuto Lake Mine 
 
 
of mineral reserves at the mine. 
 
Agency Relationship with CMM 
 
 
As  at  January  1,  2006,  we  changed  our  contractual  relationship  with  Considar  Metal  Marketing  Inc. 
((cid:147)CMM(cid:148)),  our  50%  owned  subsidiary,  from  a  sales  relationship  to  an  agency  relationship  with  respect  to  the 
marketing of copper oxide and precious metals.  Pursuant to this agency relationship, as of December 31, 2005, 
we  own  100%  of  our  copper  and  precious  metal  inventory  until  its  sale  to  a  customer.    Previously,  HBMS 
recognized 100% of its sales when its product was shipped from the Flin Flon operations and sold to CMM.
- 5 -
Acquisition of White Pine Copper Refinery
In January 2006, through a U.S.-based wholly owned subsidiary of HBMS, we completed the purchase 
of White Pine Copper Refinery Inc., a Michigan-based copper refinery, for US$13 million, plus US$2.1 million in 
adjustments.    The  refinery  will  provide  us  with  a  dedicated  processing  facility  for  HBMS  copper  anodes  and 
reduce our processing costs for copper by approximately $0.02 per pound of copper. 
 
Revolving Credit Facility
In February 2006, we announced that HBMS had completed a $25 million revolving credit facility with 
The  Bank  of  Nova  Scotia (Scotia Capital).  The facility, subject to customary conditions, is guaranteed by the 
Company  and  our  subsidiary  Hudson  Bay  Exploration  and  Development  Company  Limited,  and is secured by 
inventory  and  receivables.    The  bank  may  consent  to  increasing  the  facility  to  $50  million  if  HBMS  satisfies 
certain conditions. 
 
Repayment of Notes
In February 2006, we announced that HBMS had repurchased, through the open market, US$19 million
of its Notes. 
 
Significant Acquisitions
We did not complete a significant acquisition during the financial year ended December 31, 2005.

(cid:149)
(cid:149)
(cid:149)
(cid:149)
(cid:149)
the 777 and Trout Lake zinc and copper mines near Flin Flon, Manitoba, the Chisel North Zinc 
Mine  near  Snow  Lake,  Manitoba,  the  Konuto  Lake  Mine  in  Saskatchewan  (closed  fall  2005) 
and the Balmat mine project in New York State (collectively, the (cid:147)HudBay Mines(cid:148)), which had, 
at January 1, 2006, aggregate estimated proven and probable mineral reserves of approximately 
21.4 million tonnes  of  ore,  grading  5.3%  zinc,  2.0%  copper,  1.8  grams per tonne of gold and 
21.1 grams per tonne of silver, and an additional estimated 4.9 million tonnes of inferred mineral 
resources, grading 7.45% zinc, 1.0% copper, 1.2 grams per tonne of gold and 19.1 grams per 
tonne of silver as at January 1, 2006;
a metallurgical complex located in Flin Flon, Manitoba and an ore concentrator near Snow Lake, 
Manitoba;  the  Flin  Flon  metallurgical  complex  is  comprised  of  an  ore  concentrator,  a  zinc 
pressure  leach  and  electro-winning  plant  and  a  copper  smelter,  with  an  annual  production 
capacity of 115,000 tonnes of cast zinc and 90,000 tonnes of anode copper, as well as gold and 
silver by-products;
a  zinc  oxide  plant  located  in  Brampton,  Ontario  with  annual  production  capacity  of 
45,000 tonnes of zinc oxide, which off-takes between 32,000 and 41,000 tonnes of our annual 
zinc metal production;
a copper refinery in White Pine, Michigan, with annual production capacity of 75,000 tonnes;
a seasoned exploration team with a proven track record of discovering new ore bodies, together 
with a land position of  more than 200,000 hectares in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and land 
holdings in Ontario, the Yukon, New York State and Chile offering potential for further mineral 
discoveries;
experienced mine and production management, and a stable work-force with an excellent health 
and safety record; and
a  50%  interest  in  an  established  marketing  joint  venture,  CMM,  which  markets  our  metals 
primarily on an agency basis and identifies and acquires additional zinc and copper concentrate 
for our metallurgical complex.
In 2004, we completed a $435 million capital expenditure program (the (cid:147)777 Project(cid:148)), that involved the 
construction and development of the 777 mine in Flin Flon and the Chisel North mine in Snow Lake, capacity 
expansion  of  the  Flin  Flon  concentrator,  expansion  of  the  Flin  Flon  zinc  plant,  including  construction  of  an 
electrolytic  cellhouse  and  other  infrastructure  upgrades.  The  777  Project  has  led  to  improvements  in  operating 
margins of the Manitoba and Saskatchewan mines, workplace productivity and workplace safety.
Total  2005  HBMS  production  was  approximately  115,000 tonnes  of  refined  zinc,  86,000 tonnes  of 
refined  copper,  102,000 ounces  of  gold  and  1,410,000 ounces  of  silver,  derived  from  228,000 tonnes  of  zinc 
concentrate and 318,000 tonnes of copper concentrate (including 112,000 tonnes of purchased concentrate).
We  also  own:  the  development  project  Gays  River  mine  in  the  Province  of  Nova  Scotia,  Canada; 
exploration lands in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and exploration properties in the Province of Ontario, Yukon 
and  Chile.    In  December  2005,  we  announced  that  we  had  entered  into  a  letter  of  intent  to  sell  the  shares  of
- 8 -
ScoZinc Limited, which owns the Gays River lead and zinc mineral property, to Acadian Gold Corporation for 
$7.5 million.  The potential sale transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. 
 
Our Competitive Strengths
We  believe  that  the  following  business  strengths  will  enable  us  to  increase  our  production  and
profitability.  
 
Modern, Upgraded Facilities
Between 1998 and 2004, we invested approximately $435 million to expand, modernize and improve our 
mines and plants in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  The 777 Project involved construction and development of the 
modern  777  and  Chisel  North  mines,  capacity  expansion  at  the  zinc  and  copper  concentrator  in  Flin  Flon  and 
expansion  of  our  zinc  plant,  including  the  installation  of  an  electrolytic  cellhouse  and  other  infrastructure 
upgrades.  The  design  of  our  Flin  Flon  zinc  plant  permits  a  further  low  cost  15%  capacity  expansion.  The 
777 Project improved our productivity through both the implementation of new technology and streamlining of 
our workforce. This has translated into operating efficiencies, cost reductions and the production of higher grades 
of ore.  
 
Land Position with Strategic Exploration Potential
We hold a land position of more than 200,000 hectares located primarily in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. 
Over the more than 75 year operating history of HBMS, we have brought into production over 25 ore bodies on 
HBMS  lands.  Currently,  we  operate  three  mines  on  this  land  (at  year  end).  Our  land  position  includes  select 
portions of the highly productive Flin Flon greenstone belt that we believe has excellent potential for further ore 
body discoveries. Since much of this property is within 100 kilometres of our two concentrators in this region, we 
anticipate that we will be able to economically exploit even small ore bodies that we discover.
We also own 51,276 acres of mineral rights in northern New York and lease an additional 4,774 acres of
mineral rights in the areas proximate to the Balmat mine.  
 
Vertically Integrated Operations
Our Flin Flon and Snow Lake operations are comprised of three operating mines, two concentrators, a 
90,000 tonne  per  year  copper  smelter,  a  115,000 tonne  per  year  zinc  plant  and  related  infrastructure.  These 
integrated operations limit our exposure to fluctuating third party treatment and refining charges. In addition, we 
have available capacity at our metallurgical plants, currently filled by purchased concentrates, which gives us the 
flexibility to develop ore bodies in the area of Flin Flon and Snow Lake that a mining company without proximate 
metallurgical plants could not develop profitably after payment of transportation and treatment charges. Our zinc 
oxide production facility, Zochem in Brampton, Ontario, receives and processes a significant amount of our zinc 
metal production. This off-take mitigates the impact on us of volume cycles in the zinc metal market. Through 
CMM,  our  marketing  joint  venture,  we  monitor  and  maintain  customer  relationships  that  have,  historically, 
supported demand and premium pricing for our zinc, zinc oxide and copper products.  Our White Pine copper 
refinery,  acquired  in  January  2006,  completes  our  copper  vertical  integration, reduces our unit cost to produce 
copper and provides assurance of access to a facility to process anode copper products from our Flin Flon smelter  
 
Experienced Management Team
Our  management  and  directors  have  considerable  experience  in  identifying,  acquiring  and  financing 
mining operations as well as managing public companies. We believe this experience provides a solid base on 
which to expand our operations.  Our management team also has a proven record of success in various aspects of 
the  mining  industry,  including  mining,  processing,  marketing  and  the  subsequent  reclamation  of  mines.  The
- 9 -
experience of management at HBMS was integral to the success of the 777 Project, which was completed ahead 
of schedule and on budget.  
 
Skilled and Stable Workforce and Strong Safety Record
The HBMS workforce is well trained, historically stable and has significant operational experience at all 
levels.  There  has  not  been  a  labour  work  stoppage  at  the  existing  HBMS  operations  in  over  30  years,  despite 
significant labour reductions since 1991. Moreover, HBMS has a labour stability agreement in place until 2012 
providing  a  framework  for  labour  relations  that  prohibits  strikes  or  lockouts  at  its  operations.  See  (cid:147)Our 
Business (cid:151) Operations (cid:151) Employees.(cid:148)
HBMS has established a strong safety record. In 2004, HBMS was recommended for registration of its 
Safety Management System under Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 18001 ((cid:147)OHSAS 18001(cid:148)). 
For the three years ended December 31, 2005, HBMS experienced an average annual rate of 0.75 lost time injury 
frequency per 200,000 hours worked.  We believe that improvements in the safety of the HBMS workforce assist 
in maintaining healthy labour relations between the HBMS management and workforce.  
 
Well-Developed Low-cost Infrastructure
We  have  a  well-developed,  low-cost  infrastructure  at  our  Manitoba  and  Saskatchewan  operations. 
Substantially all of our electrical power is supplied by Manitoba Hydro from both its and Saskatchewan Power 
Corporation's  power  grids,  which  are  fed  by  three  hydroelectric  generating  stations.  Historically,  the  price  of 
electricity from Manitoba Hydro has been among the lowest offered by major energy utilities in North America. 
The water supply for the Flin Flon metallurgical complex is pumped from nearby Trout Lake. Further, the Flin 
Flon properties have well developed access to rail, road and air transportation. Rail access allows concentrate and 
many other key consumables, such as propane and fuel oil, to be purchased in bulk. It also provides the lowest 
cost transport of our products.  
 
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage our proven operating assets, significant mineral reserves and mineral resources
and experienced workforce to:  
 
Identify Further Opportunities to Lower our Costs
Over the past decade, we have lowered our unit costs of production through infrastructure investments, a 
focus  on  workplace  safety,  targeted  workforce  reduction  and  an  increase  in production. For example, we have 
taken  advantage  of  an opportunity to reduce our costs of production by lowering our costs for copper refining 
through the purchase of the White Pine copper refinery. Increasing production of concentrate from the HudBay 
Mines or other of our properties proximate to or otherwise synergistic with our metallurgical facilities is our most 
significant opportunity to reduce our unit costs and improve our profitability.  
 
Investigate Opportunities for Mine Development and Mineral Reserve Exploration
We plan to exploit ore bodies and pursue expanded exploration programs. We believe that there remains 
significant potential to discover additional mineral reserves within the HudBay Mines, particularly at the Trout 
Lake and 777 mines. We also intend to focus our exploration program on the HBMS land position in Manitoba 
and Saskatchewan.  In November 2005, we announced our intention to re-open the Balmat Zinc Mine in New 
York State.  Using the experienced operations managers from HBMS and the marketing experience of CMM, we 
believe  that  we  can  reproduce  many  of  the  operational  efficiencies  of  HBMS  at  the  Balmat  mine.  We  will 
otherwise focus our development and exploration programs on our other existing projects or future projects to the 
extent they present attractive opportunities to expand our mineral reserves.

Pursue Growth Through Selective Acquisitions
We believe there is opportunity for future growth through selective acquisitions of operating assets and 
properties  at  an  advanced  state  of  exploration  and  development.  Leveraging  the  expertise  of  our  management 
team,  we  intend  to  pursue  a  selective  and  disciplined  acquisition  strategy  in  areas  of  political  stability,  with  a 
particular focus on properties in North America, Europe, Australia and South America.  
 
Maintain Strong Safety and Environmental Performance
One of our core values is protecting the health and welfare of our employees and the environment. We 
have achieved an excellent safety record in recent years and we are committed to continuous improvement of this 
record. We intend to continue to adhere to strict environmental compliance standards with a goal of continually 
improving our environmental performance. The Flin Flon, Snow Lake and Zochem operations have been certified 
to  the  ISO 14001:1996  Environmental  Management  System.  We  believe  that  our  ability  to  minimize  lost-time 
injuries and environmental regulatory violations is a significant factor in maintaining and realizing opportunities 
to improve overall operational efficiency.

Underground Mining Operations
As at December 31, 2005, our material properties were the HudBay Mines. The HudBay Mines consist 
of the 777, Trout Lake and Chisel North mines in northern Manitoba and the Balmat Mine in New York State.  
The  Konuto  Lake  mine  in  northern  Saskatchewan  was  closed  during  2005.    Each  of  the  HudBay  Mines  is  an 
underground mine. 
 
The HudBay Mines in Flin Flon/Snow Lake
Location
Other than the Chisel North mine, the HudBay Mines are within 24 kilometres of Flin Flon. The Chisel 
North  mine  is  approximately  215 kilometres  east  of  Flin Flon.  The  Town  of  Flin  Flon  is  approximately 
750 kilometres  north  of  Winnipeg,  the  capital  of  the  Province  of  Manitoba.  Flin  Flon  has  a  population  of 
approximately 7,000 people, with an additional 3,000 people living in the surrounding community, and has well 
developed access to road, rail and air transportation.
The water supply for Flin Flon is taken from Trout Lake. Electrical power is supplied from the Manitoba 
Hydro  and  Saskatchewan  Power  Corporation  power  grids,  which  are  fed  by  three  hydroelectric  generating 
stations.
Annual  rental  costs  for  the  mineral  rights  are  approximately  $280,000,  based  on  a  rate  of  $8.00  per
hectare.
The geographical area has cool summers and very cold winters with a mean annual temperature of -2.5o 
C. The predominant vegetation is closed stands of black spruce and jack pine with a shrub layer of ericaceous 
shrubs and ground cover of mosses and lichens.

Geology
The  HudBay  Mines  are  located  in  the  Canadian  Shield,  one  of  the  world's  largest  exposed  areas  of 
Precambrian  rocks.  Within  the  Canadian  Shield  are  large,  deformed  remnants  of  ancient  volcanic-sedimentary 
terrain ((cid:147)greenstone belts(cid:148)), which historically have been proven locations of base and precious metals.
The ore bodies of the Flin Flon greenstone belt occur in a highly prospective early Proterozoic island-arc 
assemblage that stretches for an exposed length of 250 kilometres east-west and 75 kilometres north-south. The 
deposits are precious metal rich and of the copper-zinc volcanic massive sulphide ((cid:147)VMS(cid:148)) type hosted in both 
felsic and mafic volcanic rocks with the felsic type hosting the largest deposits. VMS deposits are best classified 
into  just  two  major  groups,  copper-zinc  type  and  zinc-lead-copper  type,  respectively,  which  reflects  the 
associations of major ore metals and other geological characteristics. VMS deposits in the area range in size from 
less than 100,000 tonnes to the more than 100 million tonne Flin Flon/777/Callinan cluster of ore bodies.
History
HBMS has operated in the Flin Flon greenstone belt for more than 75 years. During this period, HBMS
has mined approximately 158 million tonnes of ore.
In the mid-1990s, a strategic review of the HBMS operations showed a company in decline; HBMS had 
declining reserves, lower ore grades, rising costs and a poor safety record. At this time, HBMS concluded that it 
had less than a ten-year mine life and planned closure of operations before 2005.
In connection with the closure plan, HBMS decided to continue exploration efforts until 1998, the latest 
time an ore body could be developed for production prior to the planned closure. In 1993, based on its drilling 
program, HBMS discovered the 777 deposit and by 1997 had defined this ore body. HBMS determined that the 
777 ore body had the potential to extend its operations for another 12 to 16 years, if a number of critical factors 
were first addressed. As a result, HBMS significantly lowered its overall unit operating cost, improved its safety 
performance and created a performance-oriented culture.
777 Mine
The 777 mine is located immediately adjacent to HBMS(cid:146) principal concentrator and metallurgical plant 
in Flin Flon and is part of a cluster of ore bodies. The 777 mine contains approximately 80.1% of the estimated 
HBMS mineral reserve tonnage as at January 1, 2006.
This  mine  was  first  indicated  in  1993  by  an  underground  exploration  hole  that  intersected  the 
mineralization at a depth of 1,000 metres. In 1995, a drilling program delineated the ore body. In 1999, HBMS 
commenced development of the 777 mine as part of the 777 Project and commercial production from the mine 
commenced in January, 2004.
The Flin Flon cluster of ore bodies, which encompasses the Flin Flon, Callinan and 777 ore bodies, is 
comprised of a sequence of volcanic flow and volcaniclastic rocks that are predominantly basaltic in nature. In the 
mine area, the mine horizon stratigraphic sequence lies on the west side of the Hidden Lake Syncline and strikes 
about 350 degrees true and dips 50 to 60 degrees to the east.
The mine has an internal ramp system to allow movement between working levels. The 777 shaft is a 
6.7 metre diameter vertical shaft to a depth of 1,530 metres. Ore and waste hoisting is with a double-drum hoist 
with  a  capacity  in  excess  of  1.35 million tonnes  per  year  using  16-tonne  skips.  A  separate  double  drum  hoist 
operates a cage and counterweight and a single drum hoist operates a small cage.
- 14 -
Mining is by a combination of mechanized cut and fill and longhole open stoping. Paste backfill is used 
to  fill  mined  stopes  and  is  delivered  from  the  Flin  Flon  concentrator  by  pumping  through  a  network  of  lined 
boreholes  and  pipes.  Pillars  are  left  as  regional  support  in  addition  to  the  backfill.  The  host  country  rock, 
particularly in the hanging wall, is competent.
Ventilation control is adequate and the main shaft is the primary fresh air intake.  Compressors supply 
compressed air. Pipes are installed to distribute the compressed air and water through the mine. The mine also has 
adequate electrical power for mining purposes.

The  Trout  Lake  mine is located approximately six kilometres northeast of Flin Flon.  The Trout Lake
mine contains approximately 12.7% of the estimated HBMS mineral reserve tonnage as at January 1, 2006.
The  Trout  Lake  mine  was  discovered  by  Granges  Exploration  in  the  1970s,  as  a  result  of  testing  by 
drilling an electromagnetic geophysical target located in an area beneath Trout Lake believed to be underlain by 
felsic volcanic rocks similar to those that host the Flin Flon ore bodies. Commercial production commenced at the 
Trout Lake mine in 1982.
The  Trout  Lake  ore  body  sub-crops  beneath  Trout  Lake  and  contains  more  than  30  lenses  in  several 
zones.  The  lenses  dip  approximately  60 degrees  and  the  average  lens  width  is  8 metres.  The  ore  body  is  a 
proximal volcanic massive sulphide deposit. Chalcopyrite and sphalerite are the main base metal sulphides and 
occur with pyrite in massive sulphide layers.
The main shaft has been sunk to a depth of 1,091 metres. The mine development includes a number of 
inclined  ramps  and  steeply  inclined  ventilation  shafts  and  ore  passes.  The  shaft  is  a  circular  two-compartment 
4.9 metre  diameter  vertical  shaft  operating  to  a  depth  of  1,091 metres.  The  ramp  extends  to  approximately 
1,100 metres  below  surface  at  an  inclination  of  15%  from  the  horizontal.  A  762 metre  long  inclined  conveyor 
delivers the ore from the underground crusher to the coarse ore bin adjacent to the shaft.

Mining is by longhole open stoping using trackless equipment. Crushed ore is trucked from the mine site
to the Flin Flon concentrator for processing and subsequent treatment in HBMS' zinc plant and copper smelter.

The Chisel North mine is 10 kilometres west of the Snow Lake concentrator and about six kilometres 
south of the Town of Snow Lake, which is approximately 215 kilometres from Flin Flon.  The Chisel North mine 
contains approximately 7.3% of the estimated HBMS mineral reserves, as at January 1, 2006.
In  1986,  an  exploration  program  was  initiated  to  systematically  explore  the  Chisel  basin.  Additional 
drilling was carried out between 1993 and 1997 to suitably define the ore body for a feasibility study. A total of 
77,632 metres in 130 holes and wedges were drilled by 1998. Commercial production commenced at the Chisel 
North mine in June, 2000.
The deposit consists of massive sulphides overlain by barren basalt volcanic flows. Sphalerite and minor 
amounts  of  chalcopyrite  are  the  main  base  metal  sulphides  and  occur  with  pyrite  in  massive  sulphide  layers 
conformable to stratigraphy. The ore resources are between 400 metre and 650 metre depths in four stacked zinc 
rich sulphide lenses.
The mine depth is to the 687 metre level. Mining is by room then pillar, post pillar cut and fill and blast 
hole stoping using trackless equipment. Ore is truck hauled to surface for crushing and subsequently trucked to 
the Snow Lake concentrator, by independent trucking contractors.

The Konuto Lake mine is situated in Saskatchewan, approximately 24 kilometres from HBMS(cid:146) principal 
concentrator and metallurgical plant in Flin Flon.  During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Konuto Lake mine was 
closed, as planned, due to the depletion of mineral reserves.
The Konuto Lake ore body was discovered by an airborne geophysical survey in 1994 with follow-up 
diamond drilling taking place the same year. The Konuto project capital development and construction started in 
1997 and production began in 1999. In 2001 a parallel, wide lens was discovered and is currently being mined. 
The mine produces approximately 300,000 ore tonnes per annum from near vertical multiple lenses between 40 
metres and 465 metres depths. Initial mining was by cut and fill using unconsolidated waste rockfill and since 
2003 includes longhole open stoping.
The  deposit  consists  of  volcanic  hosted  massive  sulphides  overlain  by  barren  basalt  volcanic  flows. 
Chalcopyrite and minor sphalerite are the main base metal sulphides and occur with pyrite in massive sulphide 
layers  conformable  to  stratigraphy.  The  horizon  that  hosts  the  deposit  has  been  repeated  by  north  trending 
isoclinal folding and may be the same horizon that hosted the Birch- Flexar ore bodies two kilometres east of the 
Konuto Lake deposit.
Mine access is by a ramp to a depth of 456 metres. Mining is by a combination of longhole open and cut 
and  fill  stoping.  The  ore  is  crushed  on  surface  under  a  contract  and  then  hauled  over  a  company  road  to  the 
concentrator at Flin Flon.

Note  that  Imperial  units  of  measurement  (i.e. tons,  acres,  etc.)  are  used  in  this  description  of  the
Balmat Mine.
The  Balmat  Mine  is  a  development  property  located  in  the  Balmat-Edwards  mining  district  in 
St. Lawrence County, New York State about 32 kilometres south of the St. Lawrence river. The area has been a 
mining district for over 90 years and all the infrastructure required for ongoing operations at the Balmat mine is 
available in the immediate area.
The  Balmat  property  comprises  several  reclaimed  zinc  mines,  the  Balmat  Mine  and  related  assets, 
including  a  5,000-ton  per  day  concentrator,  a  rail  siding  and  related  maintenance  facilities,  administration 
buildings and associated infrastructure. The mine was put on care and maintenance in October, 2001 due to low 
zinc prices.  In November 2005, we announced our intention to re-open the Balmat Mine.  We expect that the first 
ore will be produced in the second quarter of 2006.
We indirectly own 51,276 acres of mineral rights in St. Lawrence (51,175 acres) and Franklin (101 acres) 
counties in northern New York. We lease an additional 4,774 acres of mineral rights in the areas proximate to the 
Balmat mine.
The  four  main  ore  zones  that  comprise  the  Balmat  Mine  are  the  Mud Pond,  Mahler,  New Fold  and 
Northeast Fowler. Leased claims cover 38% of the Mud Pond ore body, 15% of the Mahler ore body, 33% of the 
New Fold ore body and 40% of the Northeast Fowler trend. The leased claims are subject to a 4% net smelter 
return royalty. With the exception of one ten-year lease that expires in 2014, the leases have an initial 20-year 
term, with the first set to expire in 2021, and are renewable for additional terms of 20 years.

History
Between 1915 and 2001, over 43 million tons of ore grading 9.4% zinc were mined from the four mines 
that  have  comprised  the  Balmat-Edwards  zinc  district.  Drilling  and  development  subsequent  to  1996  led  to  a  
ten-fold increase in Mud Pond mineral reserves. The Mahler orebody was discovered in 2000, while  high-grade 
mineralization was intersected in the New Fold and Northeast Fowler trends in 1997 and 2004, respectively. Prior 
to October 2001, when the mine was put on care and maintenance, over 9.4 million tons of ore grading 8% zinc 
was produced from the Balmat  mine.
Geology
The  Balmat-Edwards  district  occurs  in  the  Frontenac  Arch,  an  area  characterized  by  a  northwesterly 
trending window of Precambrian rocks overlain by and exposed beneath younger Paleozoic strata and Pleistocene 
glacial and lacustrine deposits.
The  Balmat-Edwards  zinc  deposits  occur  in  Proterozoic  metasedimentary  rocks  of  the  Grenville
Supergroup.
The  zinc  orebodies  occur  in  siliceous  dolomitic  and  evaporite-bearing  marbles  of  the  Upper  Marble 
Formation,  the  uppermost  of  four  metasedimentary  formations  mapped  in  the  district.  The  Upper  Marble  is 
exposed in the core of the Sylvia Lake syncline, a major recumbent, doubly plunging, isoclinal fold lying between 
the towns of Balmat and Edwards. The Balmat mine is located in the southwestern hinge area of the Sylvia Lake 
syncline.
Mineralization
The majority of the 14 ore zones in the Balmat Mine are arranged in three (cid:147)clusters(cid:148), containing three to
five ore zones each.
The  mineralization is dominantly zinc sulphide with lead sulphide and iron sulphide. The zinc to lead
ratio is approximately 35 to 1.
Stratiform  (cid:147)parent(cid:148)  and  stratabound  but  generally  crosscutting  (cid:147)daughter(cid:148) massive sulphide orebodies 
plunge gently (15 to 25 degrees) from north-northwest to northeast and generally range in size from 500,000 to 
10,000,000 tons. Ore occurs as both tabular and podiform bodies with complex cross-sectional configurations.
Sampling and Analysis
All assays are done at the mine site using appropriate quality-control, quality- assurance checks.
The  assay  laboratory/metallurgical  testing  facility  has  established,  documented  and  supervised 
procedures for sample preparation, assaying and metallurgical tests. In addition, there is a documented procedure 
for quality control assurance.
Historic  data  indicates  consistently  very  close  correlation  between  estimated  concentrate  head  grades
versus calculated concentrate head grades, concentrate grades and tailings losses.  
 
Concentrators
Flin Flon Concentrator
At the Flin Flon concentrator, we produce zinc and copper concentrates from ore mined at the 777, Trout 
Lake and Konuto Lake mines. As part of the 777 Project, the capacity of the Flin Flon concentrator was expanded
- 19 -
from 1.81 million tonnes of ore per year to 2.18 million tonnes of ore per year. The concentrator can handle ore 
from each mine separately and blending is done at the grinding stage.
The  Flin  Flon  concentrator  facility  includes  a  paste  backfill.  The  facility  also  includes  associated
infrastructure facilities such as maintenance shops and laboratories.
The ore is crushed in a two-staged process using cone crushers to (cid:150)19mm with a combination of screens 
and recycling of oversized material. The fine ore is stored in seven 725 tonne fine ore bins. The grinding circuit 
has two 3.8 metre by 4.9 metre rod mills and a 5.0 metre by 9.7 metre ball mill operating in closed circuit with six 
cyclones. The final product is 80% passing 70 microns at a rate of 300 tonnes per hour.
The copper circuit has six 40 m3 cells for roughing/scavenging and a bank of four 16 m3 and four 8 m3 
cells for closed circuit cleaning. On removal of the copper, the slurry is fed to the zinc circuit with nine 40m3 cells 
for roughing/scavenging and a three stage cleaning circuit. The system includes an on stream analyzer.
The  concentrates  are  dewatered  in  two  8 metre  diameter  high  rate  thickeners  and  five  2.6 metre  by 
6 metre vacuum disc filters. Both copper and zinc concentrate are transferred to the concentrator storage sheds 
prior  to  treatment  in  the  metallurgical  complex.  Tailings  from  the  concentrator  are  pumped  to  the  Flin  Flon 
tailings impoundment immediately adjacent to the concentrator. We plan to expand the tailings pond in 2006.
Snow Lake Concentrator
The Snow Lake concentrator is approximately 215 kilometres from the metallurgical plants in Flin Flon. 
The facility processes only the Chisel North mine ore and produces zinc concentrate that is processed at the zinc 
plant in Flin Flon. Concentrate is shipped by truck to Flin Flon.
After being shut down in 1998, we reopened the Snow Lake Concentrator in 2000 in connection with the 
commencement  of  production  at  the  Chisel  North  mine.  The  Snow  Lake  concentrator  has  a  capacity  of 
approximately 1.2 million tonnes of ore per year including crushing, grinding, flotation, thickening, filtering and 
drying capabilities. However, all of the circuits necessary to throughput rated capacity are not in operation at this 
time. Power, water, vacuum and other services are available to allow refurbishment to the full production rate.
The  ore  is  crushed  to (cid:150)19mm  material  by  a  single  crusher.  The  oversize  is  processed  through  a  cone 
crusher and delivered to a 750 tonne fine ore bin. The crushed ore is first ground in a rod mill and then in a ball 
mill.  The  zinc  flotation  is  by  a  set  of  four  zinc  rougher  cells,  three  scavenger  cells  and  a  three  stage  cleaning 
circuit. The concentrates are dewatered and held in a storage shed.
Tailings generated by the Snow Lake concentrator are deposited in Anderson Lake, which we believe 
mitigates environmental concerns. We expect that the tailings area will have sufficient volume for the projected 
mine life.
Balmat Concentrator
The  5,000 ton  per  day  Balmat  concentrator  was  commissioned  in  1971.  In  the  past,  the  Balmat 
concentrator has produced zinc concentrate that is coarse grained and free from substantial amounts of elements 
deletrious  to  the  smelting  and  refining  process.  The  Balmat  concentrator  has  not  been  in  operation  since 
October, 2001.

Our  zinc  plant  produces  special  high-grade  ((cid:147)SHG(cid:148))  zinc  metal  in  three  cast  shapes  from  zinc 
concentrate. Our plant is one of four primary zinc producers in North America. We produced 114,700 tonnes of 
refined  cast  zinc  in  2005.  As  part  of  the  777 Project,  the  capacity  of  the  zinc  plant  was  expanded  by  15%  to 
115,000 tonnes of cast zinc per year and approximately an additional 15% low cost expansion is possible.
Both domestic concentrate and purchased concentrate are processed at the plant. Approximately 2% of 
concentrate  treated  at  our  zinc  plant  in  2004  was  purchased  concentrate,  while  no  purchased  concentrate  was 
treated at the plant in 2005.  We expect that our need for purchased concentrate will increase, due to declining 
zinc production at our Flin Flon area mines. In the past, we have purchased zinc concentrate from a number of 
North  American  mines.  We  do  not  currently  have  any  contracts  to  purchase  zinc  concentrate.  However,  we 
anticipate that future concentrate requirements will be fully met from both North and South American sources.  
Further, a portion of the concentrate produced from our re-opened Balmat zinc mine will be railed to our zinc 
plant for treatment.
The plant incorporates a two-stage zinc pressure leaching. The zinc pressure leach plant uses Dynatec 
technology to extract zinc from zinc sulphide concentrate. The concentrate is treated in a low acid leach autoclave 
and a high acid leach autoclave that recovers most of the zinc. The zinc plant also includes a solution purification 
stage and a modern electro-winning cellhouse designed by Asturiana de Zinc, which uses the largest cathodes in 
operation. Included in the zinc plant are an oxygen plant, a concentrate handling, storage and regrinding facility, a 
zinc pressure leach plant, a solution purification plant, a cellhouse, a casting plant and a zinc storage area with the 
ability to load trucks or rail cars.
- 21 -
The zinc solutions from the pressure leach plant are treated in a four-stage purification process to remove 
impurities  such  as  copper  and  cadmium.  Following  purification,  the  solution  is  pumped  to  the  cell  house  for 
electro-winning to produce SHG zinc. The cathode zinc is then melted in an induction furnace at the casting plant. 
The casting plant can produce SHG zinc and zinc alloys in three sizes.
The zinc plant has a dedicated leach residue disposal facility. The bulk of the waste material is gypsum,
iron and elemental sulphur. Wastewater is treated and recycled through the zinc plant.
The zinc casting plant is certified to ISO 9001-2000 (quality management system).
Copper Smelter
At our copper smelter, copper concentrates are processed into anodes, which are then shipped by rail to
our White Pine copper refinery. There the anodes are refined into market standard copper cathodes.
The  copper  smelter  has  an  annual  capacity  of  90,000 tonnes  of  anode  copper.  In  2005,  we  produced
approximately 86,000 tonnes.
Both domestic concentrate and purchased concentrate are treated at the smelter. Approximately 35% and 
35%  of  concentrate  treated  at  our  copper  smelter  in  2004  and  2005,  respectively,  was  purchased  concentrate. 
Concentrate has previously been purchased from a number of North American mines, with the principal supplier 
being the Highland Valley Copper mine in British Columbia. A frame agreement with Highland Valley Copper is 
in  place  to  supply  the  principal  purchased  copper  concentrate  requirements  of  HudBay  through  2008.    In 
November 2005, HBMS entered into an agreement with Montana Resources LLP to purchase copper concentrate 
from the Butte Mine in Montana.  The purchase agreement provides that HBMS can purchase 10% of Montana 
Resources(cid:146) Butte mine concentrate production, or approximately 13,000 dry metric tones in 2006, and 20% of 
annual production, or approximately 26,000 dry metric tonnes each year thereafter.  This agreement runs to 2015, 
subject to certain termination rights effective after December 18, 2008.
Copper concentrate is delivered to the smelter by conveyor or rail. The copper smelter includes facilities 
for  concentrate  handling  and  storage,  flux  blending,  roasting,  calcine  handling,  smelting  in  a  reverberatory 
furnace, processing in converting furnaces, anode refining and casting and rail car loading of anodes.
The converter gas handling system at the smelter has reduced fugitive gas emissions at ground level by 
approximately 90% since 2000, and HBMS has reduced total particulate emission in compliance with regulations 
and the voluntary Accelerated Reduction and Elimination of Toxics ((cid:147)ARET(cid:148)) program.
The concentrate is roasted in one of five 6.6 metre by 9.1 metre roasters to remove approximately half of 
the sulphur. The calcine is then processed through a reverberatory furnace to produce copper matte. The matte is 
converted into blister copper in converters and then refined and cast into anode in a wheel mould.
The  smelter  has  procedures  to  handle  all  the  wastes  produced  by  the  process.  The  roaster  gases  are 
passed through an electrostatic precipitator to remove dust, which is recycled to the furnaces. The slag is dumped 
in a slag dumpsite and is used for tailings dam construction.  
 
Zochem
Zochem is the zinc oxide production facility of HBMS, located in Brampton, Ontario. Zochem is a stand-
alone  operation  that off-takes between 32,000 tonnes and 41,000 tonnes of our zinc metal production per year, 
buffering our production schedules and inventories against the impact of zinc market cyclicality. In 2005, Zochem 
was the third largest producer of zinc oxide in North America, accounting for approximately 20% of the North 
American market.
- 22 -
The Zochem facilities have a total capacity of 45,000 tonnes per year of zinc oxide. In 2005, Zochem 
produced approximately 43,000 tonnes of zinc oxide. The zinc oxide produced by Zochem is sold through CMM.
Zochem is registered to ISO 9001:2000 (quality), OHSAS 18001 (health and safety management system)
and ISO 14001:1996 (environmental management system).  
 
White Pine Copper Refinery
The  White  Pine  copper  refinery  processes  copper  anode  into  refined  copper  cathode.  The  White  Pine 
copper refinery is located in the western upper peninsula of Michigan. Pursuant to the exercise of an outstanding 
option, in January 2006, we completed the purchase of White Pine Copper Refinery Inc., the owner of the White 
Pine refinery, for US$13 million, subject to certain adjustments.
The  White  Pine  Copper  Refinery Inc.  is  the  beneficiary  of  an  agreement  with  the  State  of  Michigan 
pursuant  to  which  the  State  of  Michigan  has  covenanted  not  to  take  any  action  against  White  Pine  Copper 
Refinery Inc. for cleanup costs at the White Pine property in connection with contamination that existed at the 
time  it  acquired  the  property,  including  contamination  emanating  from,  or  attributable  to,  such  contamination, 
under certain sections of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (Michigan). Pursuant to this 
agreement,  White  Pine  Copper  Refinery Inc.  has  agreed  to  certain  conditions,  including  certain  remedial 
obligations.    Notwithstanding  our  acquisition  of  the  White  Pine  refinery,  this  covenant  has  continued  for  our 
benefit.  
 
Employees
We  have  approximately  1,426  permanent  employees  in  the  Flin  Flon  and  Snow Lake  areas,  of  whom 
approximately  1,152  are  unionized.  Unions  representing  steelworkers,  machinists  and  aerospace  workers, 
electrical workers, boilermakers, carpenters, painters and operating engineers are among the unions represented. 
In  1998,  HBMS  entered  into  an  amending  agreement  in  respect  of  certain  existing  collective  bargaining 
agreements,  establishing  a  framework  for  union/management  relations  to  2012,  subject  to  the  satisfaction  of 
certain  ongoing  conditions.  The  amending  agreement  prohibits  strikes  and  lockouts  and  provides  for  binding 
arbitration  in  the  event  that  negotiated  contract  settlements  are  not  achieved.  All  current  collective  bargaining 
agreements  are  for  three-year  terms.    The  parties  are  currently  negotiating  the  next  term  of  the  collective 
bargaining  agreement,  which  will  become  effective  as  of  January  1,  2006.  We  also  have  a  profit  sharing  plan 
whereby 10% of HBMS' after tax earnings for any given fiscal year will be distributed to all employees at the Flin 
Flon/Snow Lake operations, with the exception of executive officers and key management personnel.
Our Zochem division employs 42 people, 26 of whom are unionized. Zochem and the Communication, 
Energy,  and  Paperworkers  union  have  a  three-year  collective  agreement,  which  expires  in  July,  2006.  The 
Flin Flon amending agreement does not apply to the Zochem collective bargaining agreement.
In  addition,  we  have  approximately  100  employees  (including  contractors)  at  the  Balmat  Mine,  60
employees at the White Pine copper refinery and eight head office.
In connection with the Acquisition, HBMS agreed to pay approximately $1.89 million to approximately 
23  current  employees  to  cover  payments to be made under a retention plan, payable in two equal installments, 
both of which have been made. In addition, we have agreed to pay retention bonuses in the aggregate amount of 
$1 million to those HBMS employees appointed as our officers following the Acquisition, which payments have 
also been made.  See (cid:147)Our Directors and Officers(cid:148).
- 23 -
Health and Safety
The  safety  performance  at  our  HBMS  facilities  is  measured  by  a  variety  of  indices  and  has  markedly 
improved  in  all categories over the last ten years. Lost time accident (LTA) frequency rates per 200,000 hours 
worked have fallen from 16.2 accidents in 1994 to consistently in the 0.75 range over the last three years.
As a result of the significant reduction in the LTA and severity frequency rate per 200,000 hours worked, 
there  was  a  reduction  in  HBMS'  Worker's  Compensation  Board  assessments  from  approximately  $5 million  in 
1995 to approximately $1.77 million in 2005.  
 
Principal Products and Marketing
Our primary products are zinc metal, copper metal and zinc oxide. We also produce gold, silver and lead
as by-products.
We market our metals through CMM. We formed CMM as a joint venture company with Considar Inc. 
((cid:147)Considar(cid:148)).    HBMS  and  Considar  each  own  50% of the shares of Considar Metal Marketing S.A., which in 
turns owns CMM. CMM markets, predominantly in North America, all of our zinc metal, copper metal and zinc 
oxide production. We have an agency relationship with CMM with respect to our copper and precious minerals.  
CMM also assists us in identifying and acquiring additional zinc and copper concentrates to fill the capacity of the 
HBMS metallurgical complex.
Based  on  targeted  marketing,  quality  products  and  long-standing  customer  relationships,  we  have 
historically  received  a  market  gross  premium  on  zinc  and  copper  sales,  typically  in  the  range  of  US$0.025  to 
US$0.055  per  pound  of  zinc  and  US$0.01  to  US$0.04  per  pound  of  copper.  In  2005  and  2006,  we  have 
experienced periods when premiums were in excess of this range. Our continuing receipt of these premiums will 
depend  on  regional  supply  and  demand  within  the  North  American  market  and  the  continued  success  of  the 
marketing efforts of CMM.  
 
Suppliers and Raw Materials
We spend a significant percentage of our annual consolidated revenue to procure goods and services in 
support of our business activities. Principal goods and services include copper and zinc concentrate, maintenance 
and repair parts and services, electricity, fuel and lubricants, ground support materials, explosives, tires, chemical 
reagents  and  ventilation  supplies.  We  use  suppliers  or  independent  contractors  for  a  portion  of  our  equipment 
rebuilds  and  repairs  both  on  and  off-site,  as  well  as  for  construction  and  reclamation  activities  and  to  support 
computer systems.
In the past, we have purchased concentrate from a number of North American mines, with the principal
supplier being the Highland Valley Copper mine in British Columbia and the Montana Resources Butte mine.  
 
Competition
The  base  metals  mineral  exploration  and  mining  business  is  highly  competitive.  We  compete  with 
numerous other companies for the discovery and acquisition of mineral rich properties that can be developed and 
produced economically, the technical expertise to find, develop, and operate such properties, the labour to operate 
the  properties,  and  the  capital  for  the  purchase  of  such  properties.  Many  of  these  companies  are  substantially 
larger and have greater financial resources than we do. Our ability to acquire additional mineral reserves in the 
future will depend not only on our ability to develop and operate our current properties, but also on our ability to 
identify  and  acquire  suitable  producing  properties  or  prospects  for  base  metals  development  or  mineral 
exploration. We also compete with manufacturers of substitute materials or products for which zinc and copper 
are traditionally used. For example, steel treated with epoxy resins or paint may be used in place of zinc-based 
galvanized steel and aluminum based conductors may be used in place of copper-based conductors. However, due
- 24 -
to the metallic properties of zinc and copper, there are few, if any, substitutes of either that are of comparable 
quality.  
 
Environmental Liabilities
We have a dedicated team of seven engineers and technicians at HBMS who are charged with managing
our environmental activities and our environmental compliance with all applicable standards and regulations.  
 
Air Quality
During the past ten years, we have invested a significant amount to reduce emissions from our copper 
smelter, resulting in reductions of airborne emissions. We have participated in the Environment Canada ARET 
and Strategic Options Process ((cid:147)SOP(cid:148)) programs. We have substantially achieved the ARET reductions and 73% 
of the 2008 SOP reduction targets. By 2008, we expect to reduce our particulate emissions to 80% of 1988 levels 
but this may require capital expenditures.
On  September  25,  2004,  the  Canadian  federal  government  issued  a  proposed  notice  requiring  the 
preparation  and  implementation  of  pollution  prevention  plans  in  respect  of  specified  toxic  substances  released 
from base metal smelters and refineries and zinc plants. The proposed notice would set annual air release targets 
for sulphur dioxide, particulate matter and mercury as factors to be considered in the preparation of the pollution 
prevention plans utilizing best available techniques. The air release targets are divided into two phases, with the 
first reductions being set for December 31, 2008 with a subsequent reduction by December 31, 2015.
The  mercury  reduction  targets  in  the  proposed  notice  are  consistent  with  the  Canada-wide  Standard 
(CWS) for Mercury Emissions endorsed by the Manitoba provincial government. Recent studies have confirmed 
that our current mercury emissions are of a similar order as those reported in recent years.  These targets are below 
our current emissions levels for the specified substances and, if implemented in its proposed form, the costs of 
meeting these targets would be material.
In an effort to improve ambient air quality in the Flin Flon area close to the tailings deposition site, we 
have placed a slag cover over exposed tailings beaches. Further, we are currently changing our tailings deposit 
plan  to  minimize  dusting  potential.  In  early  2006,  we  approved  capital  expenditures  in  connection  with  the 
expansion of the Flin Flon tailings impoundment system, locating it farther away from the local community. 
 
Water Quality 
 
The operations of HBMS have a number of permitted effluent discharges for the various mines and 
 
process  facilities,  regulated  both  federally  and  provincially.  Tailings  impoundment  and  water  treatment 
systems at both Flin Flon and Snow Lake as well as mine water treatment facilities are operated to meet the 
regulated discharge limits for water quality. 
 
 
In  2005  there  were  two  minor  incidents  where  environmental  thresholds  were  exceeded.  HBMS(cid:146) 
environmental  management  systems  responded  appropriately  to  minimize  the  environmental  impact  of  these 
events, and the incidents did not result in any regulatory action. 
 
 
At the Balmat operation effluent treatment is less onerous due to the basic mineralogy of the ore, and 
during  normal  operations  State  permitted  effluent  levels  were  achieved  without  additional  water  treatment 
requirements.  However,  during  the  period  of  care  and  maintenance,  a  water  treatment  facility  had  to  be 
commissioned  to  achieve  the  necessary  effluent  discharge  water  quality  resulting  from  mine  dewatering 
activities during winter months. Effluent quality problems were encountered in the winter of 2005 during re-
commissioning due to a number of factors. While it is believed that these factors have now been appropriately 
addressed,  the  permitted  zinc  discharge  limit  was  exceeded  in  December  2005 and  continued  into  the  first 
quarter of 2006.  It is not known at this stage whether this will result in regulatory action.
- 25 -
Contaminated Soils and Facilities
The  concentrators,  metallurgical  facilities  and  mine  sites  reflect  the  impact  of  historic  and  current 
operations.  HBMS  has  undertaken  some  clean  up  of  the  plant  and  mine  areas  as  part  of  recent  plant  site 
improvements and waste management programs. Full cleanup and restoration will only be undertaken at closure. 
We believe that progressive reclamation of past operating sites has occurred with good results. We have estimated 
that  total  reclamation  costs  relating  to  the  closure  of  all  our  facilities  in  Manitoba  and  Saskatchewan  will  be 
approximately $53.6 million and the net present value of these costs is $28.3 million.  In November 2005, a major 
Canadian environmental engineering firm completed an evaluation of the closure and reclamation plans for the 
HBMS  operations.    Based  on  this  evaluation,  we  are  satisfied  that  current  financial  statement  provisions  for 
closure and environmental reclamation obligations in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and elsewhere are appropriate and 
adequate. 
 
The updated closure and reclamation plans are supported by financial assurance consisting of letters of 
credit  and  asset  pledges for the Flin Flon Metallurgical complex, at closure.  The 2005 combined value of the 
financial assurance provided to the Governments of Manitoba and Saskatchewan is more than $75.0 million.
See  (cid:147)Risk  Factors (cid:151)  Reclamation  and  mine  closure  costs  could  adversely  affect  our  cash  flow  from
operations(cid:148).
RISK FACTORS
An  investment  in  our  securities  is  speculative  and  involves  significant  risks  that  should  be  carefully 
considered  by  prospective  investors  before  purchasing  such  securities.  In  addition  to  the  risk  factors  described 
elsewhere in this AIF, the risk factors that should be taken into account in any investment decision include, but are 
not limited to, those set out below. Any one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the 
value of our securities and should be taken into account in assessing our activities. 
 
The market price of metals is volatile.
Our  earnings  and  financial  condition  depend  upon  the  market  prices  of  metals,  which  can  fluctuate 
widely. Metal prices ultimately depend on demand in the end markets for which metals are used. The principal 
end  markets  for  zinc  and  copper  are  the  steel  and  automotive  industries  and  the  electrical  and  electronics 
industries, respectively. These industries, as well as certain other industries that use zinc or copper, are cyclical in 
nature.  Demand  is  affected  by  numerous  factors  beyond  our  control,  including  the  general  level  of  industrial 
production,  interest  rates,  the  rate  of  inflation,  and  the  stability  of  exchange  rates,  any  of  which  can  cause 
significant  fluctuations  in  zinc  and  copper  prices.  Such  external  economic  factors  are  in  turn  influenced  by 
changes  in  international  investment  patterns,  monetary  systems  and  political  developments.  The  price  of  zinc, 
copper and other metals has fluctuated widely in recent years. Future price declines may materially reduce our 
profitability and could cause us to reduce output at our operations (including, possibly, closing one or more of our 
mines or plants), all of which could reduce our cash flow from operations.
Furthermore,  a  significant  decrease  in  commodity  prices  may  require  us  to  revise  our  mineral  reserve 
calculations  and  life-of-mine  plans,  which  could  result  in  material  write-downs  of  our  investment  in  mining 
properties  and  increased  amortization,  reclamation  and  closure  charges.  In  addition  to  adversely  affecting  our 
mineral  reserve  estimates  and  our  financial  condition,  declining  commodity  prices  can  affect  operations  by 
requiring  a  reassessment  of  the  feasibility  of  a  particular  project.  Such  a  reassessment  may  be  the  result  of  a 
management decision or may be required under financing arrangements related to a particular project. Even if the 
project is ultimately determined to be economically viable, the need to conduct such a reassessment may cause 
substantial delays or may interrupt operations until the reassessment can be completed.
We may engage in hedging activities, such as forward sales contracts and commodity put and call option 
contracts,  to  minimize  the  effect  of  declines  in  metal  prices  on  our  operating  results.  While  these  hedging
- 26 -
activities  may  protect  us,  to  some  extent,  against  low  metal prices, they also limit the price we can receive on 
hedged products. As a result, we may be prevented from realizing possible revenues in the event that the market 
price of a metal exceeds the price stated in a forward sale or call option contract, which could adversely affect our 
results of operations.  
 
Our operations are subject to currency fluctuations.
As  our  core  operations  are  located  in  Canada,  our  costs  are  incurred  primarily  in  Canadian  dollars. 
However,  our  revenue  is  tied  to  market  prices  for  zinc  and  copper,  which  are  denominated  in  United States 
dollars. If the Canadian dollar gains value against the United States dollar, our results of operations and financial 
condition could be materially adversely affected. Although we may use hedging strategies to limit our exposure to 
currency fluctuations, there can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be successful or that they will 
mitigate the risk of such fluctuations.  
 
We face significant environmental risks.
All phases of our operations are subject to environmental regulation in the various jurisdictions in which 
we operate. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement, 
increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects 
and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. For example, 
on September 25, 2004, the Canadian federal government issued a proposed notice requiring the preparation and 
implementation of pollution prevention plans in respect of specified toxic substances released from base metals 
smelters  and  refineries and zinc plants, including our metallurgical complex in Manitoba. The proposed notice 
would set target emissions for mercury, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter below our current emission levels. 
There  is  no  assurance  that  existing  or  future  environmental  regulation  will  not  materially  adversely  affect  our 
business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  There  is  contamination  on  properties  that  we  own  or 
owned  or  for  which  we  have  or  have  had  care,  management  or  control  that  may  result  in  a  requirement  to 
remediate  that  could  involve  material  costs.  In  addition,  environmental  hazards  may  exist  on  the  properties  on 
which  we  hold  interests  that  are  unknown  to  us  at  present  and  that  have  been  caused  by  previous  or  existing 
owners or operators of the properties. We may also acquire properties with environmental risks.
We  are  committed  to  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  permitting  requirements.  
However,  any  failure  to  comply  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  permitting  requirements  may  result  in 
enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be 
curtailed,  and  may  include  corrective  measures  requiring  capital  expenditures,  installation  of  additional 
equipment,  or  remedial  actions.  Parties  engaged  in  mining  operations,  including  us,  may  be  required  to 
compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines 
or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations.
Amendments  to  current  laws,  regulations  and  permits  governing  operations  and  activities  of  mining 
companies,  or  more  stringent  implementation  thereof,  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  us  and  cause 
increases in exploration expenses, remedial and reclamation obligations, capital expenditures or production costs, 
reduction  in  levels  of  production  at  producing  properties,  or  abandonment  or  delays  in  development  of  new 
mining properties.  
 
We are subject to substantial government regulation.
Our  mining,  processing,  development  and  mineral  exploration  activities  are  subject  to  various  laws 
governing  prospecting,  development,  production,  taxes,  labour  standards  and  occupational  health,  mine  safety, 
toxic  substances  and  other  matters.  Mining  and  exploration  activities  are  also  subject  to  various  laws  and 
regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Although we believe that our exploration activities are 
currently carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations, no assurance can be given that new 
rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing rules and regulations will not be applied in a manner that
- 27 -
could limit or curtail production or development of our properties. Amendments to current laws and regulations 
governing our operations and activities or more stringent implementation thereof could have a material adverse 
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
 
The costs of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Canada ratified the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
late 2002. The Kyoto Protocol came into effect in Canada in February 2005. Various levels of governments in 
Canada  are  developing  a  number  of  policy  measures  in  order  to  meet  Canada's  emission reduction obligations 
under  the  protocol.  While  the  impact  of  the protocol and these measures cannot be quantified at this time, the 
likely  effect  will  be  to  increase  costs  for  fossil  fuels,  electricity  and  transportation,  restrict  industrial  emission 
levels,  impose  added  costs  for  emissions  in  excess  of  permitted  levels  and  increase  costs  for  monitoring  and 
reporting. Compliance with these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  
 
Increased concentrate costs could adversely affect our operations.
We rely on the availability of reasonably priced copper and, to a lesser extent, zinc concentrate to operate 
the  HBMS metallurgical  complex  at  full  capacity.  Production  of  concentrate  from  the  HudBay  Mines  has  not 
been sufficient to operate the metallurgical plants at full capacity.  As a result, we purchase significant quantities 
of  copper  and,  to  a  lesser  degree,  zinc  concentrate  from  third  parties.  Our  purchases  of  copper  and  zinc 
concentrate  may  increase  significantly  in  the  future  as  a  result  of  declining  production  at  the  HudBay  Mines, 
which may adversely affect our profitability as processing purchased concentrate is less profitable than domestic 
concentrate.
The availability of concentrate may be influenced by a number of factors, many of which are not within 
our control, including operational difficulties at the concentrate suppliers' mines. Shortages of these concentrates 
have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. We do not have any purchased zinc concentrate contracts in 
place.  Although  we  have  such  contracts  for  copper  concentrate,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  agreed  upon 
quantities will be provided by the applicable supplier or that, if supplied, they will be sufficient for our purposes. 
The price we pay for concentrate is dependent upon (i) treatment and refining charges, which are set on the basis 
of  supply  and  demand  for  concentrate,  and  agreed  between  the  vendors  of  the  concentrate  and  HBMS,  and 
(ii) freight  costs  of  transporting  the  concentrate  to  HBMS'  Flin  Flon metallurgical complex, both of which can 
vary significantly. Accordingly, any price increase in, or reduced availability of, concentrate will adversely affect 
our profitability and the economic viability of our processing operations.  
 
Our exploration activities may not result in discoveries of commercial quantities of ore.
The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves significant risks. Few properties that 
are  explored  are  ultimately  developed  into  producing  mines.  Whether  a  mineral  deposit  will  be  commercially 
viable depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and 
proximity  to  infrastructure;  metal  prices,  which  are  highly  cyclical;  and  government  regulations,  including 
regulations  relating  to  prices,  taxes,  royalties,  land  tenure,  land  use,  importing  and  exporting  of  minerals  and 
environmental  protection.  Even  if  we  identify  and acquire an economically viable ore body, several years may 
elapse  from  the  initial  stages  of  development.  We  may  incur  major  expenses  to  locate  and  establish  mineral 
reserves,  to  develop  metallurgical  processes  and  to  construct  mining  and  processing  facilities.  As  a  result,  we 
cannot  assure  you  that  our  exploration  or  development  efforts  will  result  in  any  new  commercial  mining 
operations or yield new mineral reserves to replace or expand current mineral reserves.  
 
Estimates of mineral reserves, mineral resources, and projected cash flows may prove to be inaccurate.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral reserves and the future cash flows that 
might be derived from their production. Accordingly, the figures for mineral reserves and mineral resources and 
future  cash  flows  contained  in  this  AIF  are  estimates  only.  In  respect  of  mineral  reserve  and  mineral  resource
- 28 -
estimates, no assurance can be given that the anticipated tonnages and grades will be achieved, that the indicated 
level of recovery will be realized or that a mineral reserve can be mined or processed profitably. In addition, in 
respect of future cash flows, actual cash flows may differ materially from estimates. Estimates of mineral reserves 
and  mineral  resources,  and  future  cash  flows  to  be  derived  from  the  production  of  such  mineral  reserves  and 
mineral  resources,  necessarily  depend  upon  a  number  of  variable  factors  and  assumptions,  including,  among 
others, geological and mining conditions that may not be fully identified by available exploration data or that may 
differ from experience in current operations, historical production from the area compared with production from 
other producing areas, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and assumptions concerning 
metal  prices,  exchange  rates,  interest  rates,  inflation,  operating  costs,  development  and  maintenance  costs, 
reclamation costs, and the availability and cost of labour, equipment, raw materials and other services required to 
mine and refine the ore. In addition, there can be no assurance that mineral recoveries in small scale laboratory 
tests  will  be  duplicated  in  larger  scale  tests  under  on-site  conditions  or  during  production.  For  these  reasons, 
estimates  of  our  mineral  reserves  and  mineral  resources  in  this  AIF,  including  classifications  thereof  based  on 
probability  of  recovery,  and  any  estimates  of  future  cash  flows  expected  from  the  production  of  those  mineral 
reserves and mineral resources, prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may 
vary  substantially.  The  actual  volume  and  grade  of  mineral  reserves  mined  and  processed,  and  the  actual cash 
flows derived from that production, may not be as currently anticipated in such estimates. If our actual mineral 
reserves and mineral resources or cash flows are less than our estimates, our results of operations and financial 
condition may be materially impaired.  
 
Mining operations are inherently dangerous and subject to conditions or events beyond our control, which could 
have a material adverse effect on our business; Insurance may not cover these risks and hazards adequately or 
at all.
Mining operations, including the exploration and development of mineral deposits, generally involve a 
high  degree  of  risk.  Our  operations  are  subject  to  all  the  hazards  and  risks  normally  encountered  in  the 
exploration,  development  and  production  of  zinc  metal  and  copper  metal  including:  adverse  environmental 
conditions;  industrial  accidents;  metallurgical  and  other  processing  problems;  unusual  or  unexpected  rock 
formations; ground or slope failures; structural cave-ins or slides; flooding or fires; seismic activity; rock bursts; 
equipment failures; and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions.
These risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, mines and other producing facilities resulting in 
partial or complete shutdowns, personal injury or death, environmental or other damage to our properties or the 
properties of others, delays in mining, monetary losses and potential legal liability. Milling operations are subject 
to hazards such as equipment failure or failure of retaining dams around tailings disposal areas that may result in 
environmental pollution and consequential liabilities.
Our insurance will not cover all the potential risks associated with our operations. In addition, although 
certain risks are insurable, we may be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible 
premiums.  Moreover,  insurance  against  risks  such  as  environmental  pollution  or  other  hazards  as  a  result  of 
exploration  and  production  is  not  generally  available  to  us  or  to  other  companies  in  the  mining  industry  on 
acceptable terms. We might also become subject to liability for pollution or other hazards that may not be insured 
against or that we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons. Losses from these 
events  may  cause  us  to  incur  significant  costs  that  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  upon  our  financial 
performance and results of operations.  
 
Title to some of our mineral properties may be challenged or defective.
The  acquisition  of  title  to  mineral  properties  is  a  very  detailed  and  time-consuming  process.  Title  to 
mineral concessions may be disputed. Although we believe we have taken reasonable measures to ensure proper 
title to our properties, there is no guarantee that title to any of our properties will not be challenged or impaired. 
Third  parties  may  have  valid  claims  underlying  portions  of  our  interests,  including  prior  unregistered  liens, 
agreements,  transfers  or  claims,  including  aboriginal  land  claims,  and  title  may  be  affected  by,  among  other
- 29 -
things, undetected defects. As a result, we may be constrained in our ability to operate our properties or unable to 
enforce our rights with respect to our properties. An impairment to or defect in our title to our properties could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  
 
Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.
We have a significant amount of indebtedness comprised of the long-term portion of obligations under 
capital  leases,  senior  secured  notes,  and  a  government  loan.  As  at  December  31,  2005,  we  had  outstanding 
indebtedness of $204.5 million with a ratio of debt to equity of 0.78 to 1.  In addition, we have other obligations 
that include pension, employee future benefits and asset retirement obligations.
As of March 24, 2005, we have unconditionally guaranteed the debt obligations of HBMS under the 
Notes.    We  have  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed,  on  a  subordinated  basis,  all  payments  on  the  Notes, 
including principal, premium (if any) and interest.
This high degree of leverage could materially and adversely affect us in a number of ways including:
(cid:149)
(cid:149)
(cid:149)
(cid:149)
limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or market conditions;
limiting  our  ability  to  obtain  additional  financing  in  the  future  for  working  capital,  capital 
expenditures,  acquisitions  or  general  corporate  purposes,  and  in  particular for the exploration and 
development of our current properties and projects;
limiting  our  access  to  cash  available  from  operations  for  future  acquisitions  and  our  business  in 
general;
increasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions; and
(cid:149)    placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have a lower degree of leverage.
The terms of the indenture governing the Notes limit the ability of certain of our principal subsidiaries to,
In  addition,  we  may  not  be  able  to  generate  sufficient  cash  flows  from  operations  to  service  our 
indebtedness,  in  which  case,  we  may  be  required  to  sell  assets,  reduce  capital  expenditures,  refinance  all  or  a 
portion of our existing indebtedness or obtain additional financing, any of which could materially adversely affect 
our operations and ability to implement our business strategy.  
 
Restrictive  covenants  in  the  indenture  governing  the  Notes,  our  revolving  credit  facility  and  any  other  debt 
instrument  may  prevent  us  from  pursuing  business  activities  that  could  otherwise  improve  our  results  of 
operations. 
 
 
among other things:
(cid:149)    enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
(cid:149)
incur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations;
(cid:149)    make investments;
(cid:149)    grant liens;
(cid:149)    make capital expenditures;
(cid:149)    enter into transactions with affiliates;
- 30 -
(cid:149)    sell assets; and
(cid:149)    acquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies.
Pursuant  to  our  revolving  credit  facility  with  The  Bank  of  Nova  Scotia,  we  must  maintain  certain 
financial  ratios  and  satisfy  other  non-financial  maintenance  covenants.  Compliance  with  these  restrictive 
covenants and financial ratios, as well as those that may be contained in any future debt agreements, may impair 
our  ability  to  finance  our  future  operations  or  capital  needs  or  to  take  advantage  of  other  favourable  business 
opportunities.  Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants and financial ratios will depend on our future 
performance,  which  may  be  affected  by  events  beyond  our  control.  Our  failure  to  comply  with  any  of  these 
restrictive covenants or financial ratios will result in a default under the particular debt instrument, which could 
permit acceleration of the indebtedness under that instrument and, in some cases, the acceleration of indebtedness 
under other instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. In the event of a default, or a 
cross-default  or  cross-acceleration,  we  may  not  have  sufficient  funds  available  to  make  the  required  payments 
under  our  debt  agreements.  If  we  are  unable  to  repay  amounts  owed  under  the  terms  of  the  credit  agreement 
governing any credit facility that we may enter into in the future, those lenders may be entitled to take possession 
of the collateral securing that facility to the extent required to repay those borrowings. In such event, we may not 
be able to fully repay the notes, if at all.  
 
We may not be able to acquire desirable mining assets in the future.
One of our strategies is to grow our business by acquiring attractive, quality mining assets. We expect to 
selectively seek strategic acquisitions in the future. However, there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition 
opportunities will be identified. Further, restrictive covenants in our current or future debt instruments may restrict 
and  limit  our  ability  to  pursue  future  acquisitions.  Our  ability  to  consummate  and  to  integrate  effectively  any 
future  acquisitions  on  terms  that  are  favourable  to  us  may  be  limited  by  the  number  of  attractive  acquisition 
targets, internal demands on our resources, competition from other mining companies and, to the extent necessary, 
our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.  
 
Intense competition could reduce our market share or harm our financial performance.
The mining industry is intensely competitive and we compete with many companies possessing greater 
financial and technical resources than us. Since mines have a limited life, we must compete with others who seek 
mineral  reserves  through  the  acquisition  of  new  properties.  In  addition,  we  also  compete  for  the  technical 
expertise to find, develop, and operate such properties, the labour to operate the properties, and the capital for the 
purpose of funding such properties. Many competitors not only explore for and mine base metals, but conduct 
refining and marketing operations on a global basis. Such competition may result in us being unable to acquire 
desired  properties,  to  recruit  or  retain  qualified  employees  or  to  acquire  the  capital  necessary  to  fund  our 
operations and develop our properties. We also compete with manufacturers of substitute materials or products for 
which zinc and copper are typically used. Existing or future competition in the mining industry could materially 
adversely affect our prospects for mineral exploration and success in the future.  
 
Increased energy prices could adversely affect our operations.
Mining operations and facilities are intensive users of electricity and carbon based fuels. Energy prices 
can  be  affected  by  numerous  factors  beyond  our  control,  including  global  and  regional  supply  and  demand, 
political and economic conditions, and applicable regulatory regimes. The prices of various sources of energy may 
increase  significantly  from  current  levels.  An  increase  in  energy  prices  could  materially  adversely  affect  our 
results of operations and financial condition.
- 31 -
Our revenues will be dependent on our metal production; sustaining current production levels or increasing our 
mineral production depends on our ability to bring new mines into production and to expand mineral reserves at 
existing mines.
We  generate  revenues  primarily  through  the  production  and  sale  of  metals.  Subject  to  any  future 
expansion or other development, production from existing operations at the HudBay Mines and Balmat (once in 
production) is expected to decline over the life of mine. In addition, these production estimates and the life-of-
mine estimates included in this AIF may vary materially from the actual production from, or productive life of, the 
subject mines because the feasibility of mining a mineral deposit is largely dependent on market conditions, the 
regulatory environment, and available technology. As a result, our ability to maintain our current production or 
increase  our  annual  production  of  metals  and  generate  revenues  therefrom  will  depend  significantly  upon  our 
ability to discover or acquire and to successfully bring new mines into production and to expand mineral reserves 
at existing mines.  
 
Reclamation and mine closure costs could adversely affect our cash flow from operations.
In  view  of  the  uncertainties  concerning  future  removal  and  site  restoration  costs  on  our  properties 
including  those  held  by  HBMS,  the  ultimate  timing  of  and  costs  for  future  removal  and  site  restoration  could 
differ from current estimates. Our estimates for this future liability are subject to change based on amendments to 
applicable  laws  and  legislation,  the  nature  of  ongoing  operations  and  technological  innovations.  The  recent 
evaluation  of  closure  and  reclamation  costs  has  been  submitted  to  the  Governments  of  Manitoba  and 
Saskatchewan.    There  is  no  guarantee  that  either  or  both  governments  will  accept  this  evaluation.  Any future 
changes to our reclamation and mine closure costs (either in our estimates or in the actual costs) could have a 
material and adverse effect on our future operating results.
In addition, regulatory authorities in various jurisdictions require us to post financial assurances to secure 
in whole or in part future reclamation and restoration obligations in such jurisdictions. The amount and nature of 
the  financial  assurances  are  dependent  upon  a  number  of  factors,  including  our  financial  condition  and 
reclamation cost estimates. Changes to these amounts, as well as the nature of the collateral to be provided, could 
significantly  increase  our  costs,  making  the  maintenance  and  development  of  existing  and  new  mines  less 
economically  feasible.  Currently,  the  security  that  we  provide  to  the  governments  of  the  Provinces  of 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba consists of the equipment, buildings and fixtures located at the HBMS metallurgical 
complex.  We have also provided additional security in the form of letters of credit in the aggregate amount of 
$13 million.  However, the Provinces may require further financial assurances. To the extent that the value of the 
collateral provided to the Provinces is or becomes insufficient to cover the amount of financial assurance we are 
required to post, we would be required to replace or supplement the existing security with more expensive forms 
of  security,  which  might  include  cash  deposits,  which  would  reduce  our  cash  available  for  operations  and 
financing  activities.  There  can  be  no  guarantee  that  we  will  be  able  to  maintain  or  add  to  our  current  level  of 
financial assurance. We may not have sufficient capital resources to further supplement our existing security.
Although we accrue for future closure costs, we do not reserve cash in respect of these obligations or 
otherwise fund these obligations in advance. As a result, we will have significant cash costs when we are required 
to close and restore mine sites that may, among other things, affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under our 
indebtedness or other contractual commitments. Given the significance of these cash costs, we may not be able to 
fund them with cash from our operating activities or other available capital resources. We cannot assure you that 
we will be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms to fund these costs. If we are unable to fund the removal 
and  site  restoration  costs,  regulatory  authorities  may  foreclose  on  the  collateral  securing  those  obligations.  We 
may  not  have  sufficient  capital  resources  to  further  supplement  our  existing  security.  Additionally,  any  capital 
resources  that  we  do  utilize  for  this  purpose  will  reduce  the  resources  available  for  our  operations  and 
commitments, including satisfying our obligations on the Notes.
- 32 -
The temporary shutdown of any of our operations could expose us to significant costs and adversely affect our 
access to skilled labour.
From  time  to  time,  we  may  have  to  temporarily  shutdown  our  copper  smelting  and/or  zinc  refining 
operations or one or more of our mines if they are no longer considered commercially viable. There are a number 
of  factors  that  may  cause  our  operations  to  be  no  longer  commercially  viable,  many  of  which  are  beyond  our 
control. These factors include adverse changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates, decreases in the price 
of zinc or copper or the market rates for treatment and refining charges, increases in concentrate transportation 
costs, and increases in labour costs. During such temporary shutdowns, we will have to continue to expend capital 
to  maintain  the  plant  and  equipment.  We  may  also  incur  significant  labour  costs  as  a  result  of  a  temporary 
shutdown if we are required to give employees notice prior to any layoff or to pay severance for any extended 
layoff. Furthermore, temporary shutdowns may adversely affect our future access to skilled labour, as employees 
who are laid off may seek employment elsewhere. As well, if the copper smelting and/or zinc refining operations 
are shutdown for an extended period of time, we may be required to engage in environmental remediation of the 
plant sites, which would require us to incur additional costs. Given the costs involved in a temporary shutdown of 
our operations, we may instead choose to continue to operate those operations at a loss. This could have a material 
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.   
 
We are required to obtain government permits in order to conduct mining operations.
Government approvals and permits are currently required in connection with all of our operations and 
further approvals and permits may be required in the future. We must obtain and maintain a variety of licences 
and permits including air quality control, water, electrical and municipal licences. The duration and success of our 
efforts  to  obtain  permits  are  contingent  upon  many  variables  outside  of  our  control.  Obtaining  governmental 
permits  may  increase  costs  and  cause  delays  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  activity  to  be  permitted  and  the 
interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority. There can be no assurance that 
all necessary permits will be obtained and, if obtained, that the costs involved will not exceed our estimates or that 
we  will  be  able  to  maintain  such  permits.  To  the  extent  such  approvals  are  required  and  not  obtained  or 
maintained, our operations may be curtailed or we may be prohibited from proceeding with planned exploration, 
development, or operation of mineral properties.  
 
Disruption of transportation services or increased transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on 
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
At  the HudBay Mines, we are dependent upon a single railway and certain short-line rail networks to 
transport purchased concentrate to our Flin Flon metallurgical complex and to transport products from the Flin 
Flon metallurgical complex for further processing and to our customers. We may have similar dependencies at 
future  mining  and  processing  operations.  Disruption  of  these  transportation  services  due  to  weather-related 
problems,  strikes,  lock-outs  or  other  events  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  operations.  If 
transportation for our products becomes unavailable, our ability to market our products could suffer. In addition, 
increases  in  our  transportation  costs  relative  to  those  of  our  competitors  could  make  our  operations  less 
competitive and could affect our profitability.  
 
We are dependent upon key management personnel and executives.
We are dependent upon a number of key management personnel, including the services of certain key 
employees.  Our  ability  to  manage  activities,  and  hence  our  success, will depend in large part on the efforts of 
these individuals.  We face intense competition for qualified personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will 
be able to attract and retain such personnel. We do not maintain (cid:147)key person(cid:148) life insurance. Accordingly, the loss 
of the services of one or more of such key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.
- 33 -
Our business will depend on good relations with our employees.
Production at our mining operations depends on the efforts of our employees. Although certain HBMS 
unionized employees have agreed to (cid:147)no-strike(cid:148) clauses in their collective bargaining agreements, which run until 
2012,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  business  will  not  suffer  from work stoppages. Further, relations with 
employees may be affected by changes in the scheme of labour relations that may be introduced by the relevant 
governmental authorities in whose jurisdictions we carry on business. Changes in such legislation or otherwise in 
our relationship with our employees may result in strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages, any of which could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  
 
We  are  exposed  to  credit  risk  from  customers  of  our  copper and precious minerals, as well as through CMM 
customers,  by  providing  credit  in  the  normal  course  of  operations  and  in  connection  with  certain  derivative 
contracts.
We  provide  credit  to  purchasers  of  our  copper  and  precious  minerals and CMM provides credit to its 
customers in the normal course of its operations. Although both CMM and us mitigate credit risk by carrying out 
credit  evaluations  on  our  customers,  making  a  significant  portion  of  sales  on  a  cash  basis  and  maintaining 
insurance on accounts receivable, if customers default on the credit extended to them, results of operations could 
be materially adversely affected.  Further, we enter into derivative contracts for which we do not obtain collateral 
or other security. In the event of non-performance by counterparties in connection with such derivative contracts, 
we will be further exposed to credit risk.
INDUSTRY REGULATION
Land and Mineral Rights
Our  mining  interests  are  governed  by  the  laws  of  the  jurisdiction  in  which  the  mining  interests  are 
situated.  We  have  interests  in  mining  interests  that  are  held  as  freehold  titles,  mine  or  mineral  claims,  mineral 
leases,  mining  leases,  quarrying  dispositions,  quarry  mineral  leases,  quarry  permits,  sand  and  gravel  leases, 
surface  leases,  surface  permits,  Order-in-Council  leases,  leases  of  Crown  lands  or  minerals,  general  permits 
relating  to  Crown  lands  and  exploration  licences.  The  rights  applicable  to  such  interests  are  described, 
circumscribed, limited, restricted and qualified by the laws of the jurisdiction applicable to such interests, and by 
the terms of the grant of such interests. Royalty payments may be required to be paid on mineral leases.  
 
Manitoba
Manitoba mineral leases are granted, under The Mines and Minerals Act (Manitoba), generally for terms 
of 21 years. Upon application, a lessee is entitled to the renewal of the lease for further terms of 21 years if, at the 
time of the application for renewal, the lessee is in compliance with The Mines and Minerals Act and the terms 
and conditions of the mineral lease.
The  annual  lease  rental  rate  for  a  mineral  lease  in  production  is  currently  $8.00  per  hectare  per  year. 
There are no other charges required to maintain the leases. Prior to obtaining a mineral lease in Manitoba, the 
applicant must first obtain a mineral prospecting licence and a mineral exploration licence. The cost associated 
with a mineral prospecting licence, if issued to a corporation, is $200. The mineral exploration licence application 
fee is $300 with a deposit of $0.50 per hectare also required.
A mineral lease includes and is subject to a reserve, in favour of the Province, of royalties in respect of 
minerals that are produced under the lease. The royalty reserved to the Province in respect of a mineral must be 
calculated in accordance with the regulations. However, no royalties will be paid in respect of a mineral for which 
a royalty would otherwise be payable, if a tax is payable under The Mining Tax Act (Manitoba).
- 34 -
Saskatchewan
Saskatchewan  leases  for  provincial  mineral  lands  are  granted  under  The  Crown  Minerals  Act 
(Saskatchewan) and The Mineral Disposition Regulations, 1986 (Saskatchewan). The term of a lease is ten years, 
renewable for a further term of ten years if the holder has complied with The Crown Minerals Act (Saskatchewan) 
and associated regulations. Annual license fees of $25 per hectare are payable in each of the first ten years of the 
lease,  with  a  minimum  of  $400  per  lease;  $50 per hectare  in  years 11  through  20  of  a  renewed  lease,  with  a 
minimum  of  $800  per  lease;  and  $75 per hectare  thereafter,  with  a  minimum  of  $1,200  per  lease.  Prior  to 
obtaining  a  mineral  lease  in  Saskatchewan,  the  applicant  must  first  apply  for  a  permit  or  claim  to  explore 
provincial  mineral  lands.  The  costs  associated  with  a  permit  to  explore  provincial  mineral  lands  include:  a 
recording  fee  of  $0.15  per  hectare  with  a  minimum  of  $1,500  and  a  maximum  of  $7,500,  a  cash  deposit  of 
$15,000,  and  expenditure  requirements  of  $1.25 per hectare  in  the  first  permit  year  and  $4.00 per hectare  in 
subsequent permit years. The term of the permit is two years and may not be renewed. A permit may be converted 
into  a  claim.  The  costs  associated  with  a  claim  to  explore  provincial  mineral  lands include: a recording fee of 
$0.30 per hectare with a minimum of $10; expenditure requirements of $12 per hectare in claim years 2 through 
10, with a minimum of $192 per claim; and $25 per hectare for each claim year after year 10, with a minimum of 
$400 per claim. A claim may be converted into a lease.
Royalty payments are payable under a lease of provincial mineral land upon or in respect of all materials
produced, saved or recovered from, or allocated under a unitization agreement to any provincial mineral lands.  
 
Environmental Regulation
The mining industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, provincial and local authorities as to
(cid:149)    employee health and safety;
(cid:149)    air quality;
matters including, but not limited to:
(cid:149)    water quality and availability;
(cid:149)
(cid:149)
the protection and enhancement of the environment (including the protection of plants and wildlife);
the  generation,  handling,  use,  storage,  transportation,  release,  disposal  and  clean-up  of  regulated 
materials, including wastes; and
(cid:149)
the reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed.
Our mining operations are regulated primarily by provincial and state legislation, although we must also
comply with applicable federal legislation and local by-laws.
The jurisdictions in which we operate have stringent environmental legislation and requirements. These 
laws  require  regulatory  approval  of  many  aspects  of  our  mining  and  production  operations.  The  construction, 
development  and  operation  of  a  mine  entails  compliance  with  applicable  environmental  legislation  and  the 
obtaining  of  various  permits,  licences  and  approvals  from  various  governmental authorities, which can include 
costly  and  time  consuming  environmental  impact  assessments.  In  addition,  legislation  requires  that  sites  be 
abandoned  and  reclaimed  to  the  satisfaction  of  provincial  authorities.  A  breach  of  environmental  legislation 
(including permits, licences and approvals) may result in the imposition of fines, other penalties, clean-up orders 
or the interruption of our activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
- 35 -
Provincial Environmental Legislation
In  general,  Manitoba  and  Saskatchewan  have  similar  environmental  legislation.  Both  Manitoba  and 
Saskatchewan  have  requirements  for  environmental  impact  assessments  of  new  projects  or  major  expansions. 
These  assessments  typically  involve  extensive  stakeholder  consultation,  including  public  advertising  and  input. 
Each  province  also  has  its  own  legislation  with  respect  to  heritage  and  cultural  resources,  the  handling  and 
transportation of dangerous goods and site remediation and reclamation.
In Manitoba, air emissions from our metallurgical complex are governed by the Inco Limited and Hudson 
Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited Smelter Complex Regulation (the (cid:147)HBMS Regulation(cid:148)), made under The 
Environment  Act  (Manitoba)  (the  (cid:147)EA(cid:148)).  The  HBMS  Regulation  sets  maximum  levels  of  sulphur  dioxide 
emissions  and  particulate  emissions  that  HBMS  may  emit.  The  HBMS  Regulation  also  sets  requirements  for 
ambient air monitoring, stack sampling, and particulate emission monitoring and measurement.
Under The Mines and Minerals Act (Manitoba), before the holder of a mineral lease in Manitoba may 
commence mining, the holder must first submit a mine closure plan. A mine closure plan sets out a program for 
protection of the environment during the life of a project and for rehabilitation of the project site upon closing of 
the  project,  which  includes  the  provision  of  security  to  the  Province  for  performance  of  rehabilitation  work  in 
accordance with an approved mine closure plan.
In  Saskatchewan,  environmental  matters  relating  to  mining  operations  are  governed  primarily  by  The 
Environmental Management and Protection Act, 2002 (Saskatchewan) (the (cid:147)EMPA(cid:148)) and the Mineral Industry 
Environmental Protection Regulations, 1996 (Saskatchewan) (the (cid:147)MIEP(cid:148)) made under the EMPA. The EMPA 
and its regulations require permits and approvals for the operation of any facility that discharges a pollutant into 
the  environment.  Under  the  MIEP,  the  Saskatchewan  government  also  regulates  the  decommissioning, 
abandonment and reclamation of a mine or operation and requires that an assurance fund be established to ensure 
the  completion  of  the  decommissioning  and  reclamation  of  the  mining  site.  We  have  entered  into  security 
agreements in favour of the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, whereby we have pledged certain HBMS 
mining assets as collateral to cover decommissioning costs.
In  Ontario,  environmental  matters  related  to  the  Zochem  plant  are  primarily  governed  by  the 
Environmental Protection Act (Ontario) ((cid:147)EPA(cid:148)), Ontario Water Resources Act ((cid:147)OWRA(cid:148)) and the regulations 
thereunder.  The  EPA  regulates  discharges  to  the  natural  environment  including  air,  land,  noise,  odour  and 
vibration.  The  EPA  also  regulates  waste  handling,  storage,  disposal  and  transportation.  The  OWRA  regulates 
discharges to surface and ground water. Zochem may be required under either or both the EPA and the OWRA to 
obtain certain permits and certificates relating to, among other things, the storage of hazardous products, storm 
water management and water use. Both the EPA and the OWRA provide for penalties and clean-up orders to be 
levied in the event of non-compliant discharges.  
 
Federal Environmental Legislation
We  must  comply  with  the  Canadian  Environmental  Protection  Act,  1999  ((cid:147)CEPA(cid:148)), which regulates 
certain  restricted  and  prohibited  substances,  and  can  require  the  preparation  of  pollution  prevention  plans. 
Emissions  to  water  from  our  mining  operations  are  regulated  by  the  MMER.  On  September 25,  2004,  the 
Canadian federal government issued a proposed notice requiring the preparation and implementation of pollution 
prevention  plans  in  respect  of specified toxic substances released from base metals smelters and refineries and 
zinc  plants,  including  our  metallurgical  complex.  The  proposed  notice would set target emissions for mercury, 
sulphur dioxide and particulate matter below our current emission levels.
The federal Canadian Environmental Assessment Act ((cid:147)CEAA(cid:148)) requires that an environmental impact 
assessment  be  conducted  with  respect  to  certain  proposed  projects.  Projects  that  are  subject  to  CEAA  include 
projects requiring the disposition of federal lands and projects requiring federal approvals.
- 36 -
Zinc and copper mining frequently involves crossing, impounding, diverting and using surface waters. 
Such  activities  can  require  approval  under  federal  legislation,  such  as  the  Fisheries  Act  (Canada)  for  the 
construction  of  a  project  that  may  result  in  the  harmful  alteration  of  fish  habitat,  or  the  Navigable  Waters 
Protection Act (Canada) if the water course is navigable by watercraft.  
 
U.S. Legislation 
 
 
Our United States mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws 
and regulations governing the protection of the environment, waste disposal, use of toxic substances, mine and 
worker health and safety and other matters, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource 
Conservation  and  Recovery  Act,  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensation  and  Liability 
Act,  the  Emergency  Planning  and  Community  Right-to-Know  Act,  the  Endangered  Species Act, the Federal 
Land Policy and Management Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and related New York State laws.  
These  laws  and  regulations  are  complex,  continuously  evolving  and  have  tended  to  become  more  stringent 
over time, and typically require us to maintain various federal and state air, water quality and mine reclamation 
permits.  Failure to comply with applicable environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and permits 
can result in injunctions, damages, suspension or revocation of permits and the imposition of penalties. 
 
 
Regulatory  approval  of  a  detailed  plan  of  operations  and  a  comprehensive  environmental  impact 
assessment  is  required  prior  to  initiating  mining  or  processing  activities  or  for  any  substantive  change  to 
previously approved plans. In order to conduct mining operations, we will be required to obtain performance 
bonds  related  to  environmental  permit  compliance.  These  bonds  may  take  the  form  of  cash  deposits  or,  if 
available,  could  be  provided  by  outside  insurance  policies.    We  may  be  required  to  prepare  and  present  to 
federal, state, or local authorities with data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration or 
mining  activity  may  have upon the environment.  All requirements imposed by any such authorities may be 
costly  and  time-consuming  and  may  delay  commencement  or  continuation  of  exploration  or  production 
operations.  In addition, specific statutory and regulatory requirements and standards must be met throughout 
the  life  of  the  mining  or  processing  operations  in  regard  to  air  quality,  water  quality,  fisheries  and  wildlife 
protection,  archaeological  and  cultural  resources,  solid  and  hazardous  waste  management  and  disposal,  the 
management  and  transportation  of  hazardous  chemicals,  toxic  substances,  noise,  community  right-to-know, 
land  use,  and  reclamation.    We  are  currently  in  compliance  in  all  material  respects  with  all  applicable 
environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 
We  own  or  operate  properties,  or  have  previously  owned  or  operated  property,  used  for  industrial 
purposes.  Use  of  these  properties  may  subject  us  to  potential  material  liabilities relating to the investigation 
and cleanup of contaminants and claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposure 
to, or release of, hazardous substances. 
 
 
We are also required to comply with the safety and health standards of the New York Department of 
Labor  as  they  relate  to  mine  safety  and  training.    We  also  participate  in  the  Mine  Safety  and  Health 
Administration  program  in  an  effort  to  reduce  the  incidence  and  severity  of  lost  time  and  other  non-fatal 
injuries to our mine employees. 
 
Municipal By-laws
We are also subject to local laws, including by-laws passed by local municipalities relating to local land
use, rural road closures, storm run-off and sanitary discharges and nuisance situations.  
 
Kyoto Protocol
The  processing of zinc and copper results in the production of various combustion products including 
carbon  compounds.  Canada, as a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the 
(cid:147)Convention(cid:148))  and  the  subsequent  implementation  protocol  that  was  adopted  in  1997  (known  as  the  (cid:147)Kyoto
- 37 -
Protocol(cid:148)), has stated its intention to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to 94% of 1990 levels by no later 
than  2012.  One  of  the  greenhouse  gases  of  concern  is  carbon  dioxide,  which  results  from  zinc  and  copper 
production.  Many  other  countries  are  also  party  to  the  Convention  and  the  Kyoto  Protocol  and  have  similar 
intentions to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  The Kyoto Protocol came into effect in Canada in February, 2005.  
 
Environmental Management and Compliance
We  have  established  a  comprehensive  environmental  management  program  directed  at  environmental 
protection. The program consists of an environmental policy, codes of practice, regular audits, the integration of 
environmental procedures with operating procedures, employee training and emergency prevention and response 
procedures.
We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental legislation. We believe 
that  all  approvals  currently  required  to  conduct  our  current  mining  operations  have  been  obtained.  Given  the 
nature  of  the  extensive  and  comprehensive  regulatory  requirements,  violations  during  mining  operations 
inevitably occur from time to time. We have been cited for few environmental violations, none of which have had 
a material adverse effect on the environment, our ability to continue any operation or on our financial condition.
We may be required to prepare and present to federal, provincial or local authorities data relating to the 
impact  that  a  proposed  development  or  existing  zinc  and  copper  mine  may  have  on  the  environment.  Such 
requirements could prove costly and time-consuming and could delay commencing and continuing exploration or 
production operations.
Future legislation and administrative regulations may further emphasize the protection and enhancement 
of the environment and, as a consequence, our activities may be even more closely regulated. Such legislation and 
changes to legislation, as well as future interpretations of laws and increased enforcement, may result in increased 
capital and/or operating costs as well as delays, interruptions or a termination of operations, the extent of which 
cannot be predicted.  
 
Health and Safety and Labour Regulations
The  Act  Respecting  Hudson  Bay  Mining  and  Smelting  Co.,  Limited  (Canada)  was  enacted  in  1947, 
placing HBMS under federal jurisdiction. As a result, HBMS is governed by federal labour legislation and must 
report annually under the Employment Equity Act (Canada).
The Act Respecting Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited was amended to delegate safety and 
health matters to the Manitoba government and, as a result, the following pieces of Manitoba legislation apply to 
HBMS: The Workplace Safety and Health Act (Manitoba), The Manitoba Hydro Act (Manitoba), The Fires and 
Prevention and Emergency Response Act (Manitoba), The Gas and Oil Burner Act (Manitoba), The Elevator Act 
(Manitoba)  and  The  Steam  and  Pressure  Plants  Act  (Manitoba).  As  a  result,  generally,  labour  matters  are 
regulated federally and workplace safety and health is regulated provincially.  
 
Aboriginal Rights
Canadian courts have recognized that aboriginal peoples may continue to have unenforced rights at law 
in respect of land used or occupied by their ancestors where treaties have not been concluded to deal with those 
rights. These rights may vary from limited rights of use for traditional purposes to a right of aboriginal title and 
will depend upon, among other things, the nature and extent of prior aboriginal use and occupation. The courts 
have encouraged the federal and provincial governments and aboriginal peoples to resolve rights claims through 
negotiation  of  treaties.  In  Manitoba  and  Saskatchewan  there  are  many  treaties  in  place.  Aboriginal  rights  and 
claims are currently handled primarily under the terms of those treaties.
- 38 -
Electric Utility Industry
The  electric  utility  industry  is  subject  to  extensive  regulation  regarding  the  environmental  impact  of 
electricity  generation  activities. Future legislation changes could increase the price at which electrical power is 
available to us and, as a result, could increase our costs of zinc and copper production.
MINERAL POTENTIAL OF OUR MATERIAL PROPERTIES
Our  material  properties  are  the  HudBay  Mines  and  the  Balmat  mine.  At  this  time,  only  the  HudBay
Mines are producing.  We have announced our intention to reopen the Balmat mine.  
 
HudBay Mines 
 
Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources
The measured and indicated mineral resource estimates were prepared under the supervision of Kim Lau, 
BSc. P.Geo., who is employed by HBMS as Superintendent, Mining Technical Services and who is a Qualified 
Person  under  National  Instrument  43-101  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects  ((cid:147)NI  43-101(cid:148)).  The 
mineral reserve estimates as at January 1, 2006 have been prepared under the supervision of Gerald Beauchamp, 
B.Sc.,  P.Eng.,  who  is  employed  by  HBMS  as  Senior  Mines  Analyst  and  who  is  a  Qualified  Person  under  NI 
43-101.
The  categorization  of  mineral  resource  is  determined  in  a  twelve  step  process,  which  includes 
determination of the integrity and validation of the data collected, including confirmation of specific gravity, assay 
results and methods of data recording. The process also includes determining the appropriate geological model, 
selection  of  data  and  the  application  of  statistics  models  including  probability  plots  and  restrictive  kriging  to 
establish continuity and model validation. The resultant estimates of measured and indicated mineral resources are 
converted to proven and probable mineral reserves by the application of mining dilution and recovery, as well as 
the  determination  of  economic  viability  using  historical  operating  costs.  Other  factors  such  as  depletion  from 
production are applied as appropriate.

The zinc price used for mineral reserve estimation was US$0.52 per pound, the copper price was US$0.91 per pound, the gold price was 
US$400 per ounce and the silver price was US$6.00 per ounce.  
The estimate as at January 1, 2006 was prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute on Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum (cid:147)CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines(cid:148)
We  have  an  estimated  3.66 million tonnes  of  inferred  mineral  resources,  grading  5.2%  zinc  and  1.3%
copper.  Mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability.   
 
 
Cautionary note to U.S. investors concerning estimates of inferred mineral resources.  Above, we 
 
use the term (cid:147)inferred resources(cid:148).  We advise U.S. investors that while this term is recognized and required by 
Canadian regulations, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not recognize it.  (cid:147)Inferred resources(cid:148) 
have  a  great  amount  of  uncertainty  as  to  their  existence,  and  great  uncertainty  as  to  their  economic  and  legal 
feasibility.  It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a 
higher  category.    Under  Canadian  rules,  estimates  of  inferred  mineral  resources  may  not  form  the  basis  of 
feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases.  U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that part 
of all of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally minable.
DIVIDENDS
We have never paid a dividend on the Common Shares and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable 
future. The actual timing, payment and amount of any dividends paid by us will be determined by the board of 
directors  from  time  to  time  based  upon,  among  other  things, our cash flow, results of operations and financial 
condition, our need for funds to finance ongoing operations and such other business considerations as the board of 
directors considers relevant.
DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Common Shares
We  are  authorized  to  issue  an  unlimited  number  of  Common  Shares  of  which  there  were  85,631,503
issued and outstanding as of March 20, 2006.
Holders of Common Shares are entitled to receive notice of any meetings of our shareholders, to attend 
and to cast one vote per Common Share at all such meetings. Holders of Common Shares do not have cumulative 
voting  rights  with  respect  to  the  election  of  directors  and,  accordingly,  holders  of  a  majority  of  the  Common 
Shares  entitled  to  vote  in  any  election  of  directors  may  elect  all  directors  standing  for  election.  Holders  of 
Common Shares are entitled to receive on a pro-rata basis such dividends, if any, as and when declared by the 
Company's  board  of  directors  at  its  discretion  from  funds  legally  available  therefor  and  upon  our  liquidation, 
dissolution or winding up are entitled to receive on a pro-rata basis our net assets after payment of debts and other 
liabilities, in each case subject to the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to any other series or 
class of shares ranking senior in priority to or on a pro-rata basis with the holders of Common Shares with respect 
to  dividends  or  liquidation.  The  Common  Shares  do  not  carry  any  pre-emptive,  subscription,  redemption  or 
conversion rights, nor do they contain any sinking or purchase fund provisions.
Preference Shares
We are authorized to issue an unlimited number of Preference Shares, none of which were issued and
outstanding as of March 20, 2006.
Preference  Shares  may  from  time  to  time  be  issued  and  the  directors  may  fix  the  designation,  rights, 
privileges,  restrictions  and  conditions  attaching  to  any  series  of  Preference  Shares.   Preference Shares shall be 
entitled to preference over the Common Shares and over any other of our shares ranking junior to the Preference 
Shares with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets or return of capital in the event of 
our liquidation, dissolution or winding up or any other return of capital or distribution of our assets among our 
shareholders  for  the  purpose  of  winding  up  our  affairs.    Preference  Shares  may  be  convertible  into  Common
- 40 -
Shares  at  such  rate  and  upon  such  basis  as  the  directors  in  their  discretion  may  determine.    No  holder  of 
Preference Shares will be entitled to receive notice of, attend, be represented at or vote at any annual or special 
meeting,  unless  the  meeting  is  convened  to  consider  our  winding  up,  amalgamation  or  the  sale  of  all  or 
substantially  all  of  our  assets,  in  which  case  each  holder  of  Preference  Shares  will  be  entitled  to  one  vote  in 
respect of each Preference Share held.  Holders of Preference Shares will not be entitled to vote or have rights of 
dissent  in  respect  of  any  resolution  to,  among  other  things,  amend  our  articles  to  increase  or  decrease  the 
maximum number of authorized Preference Shares, increase or decrease the maximum number of any class of 
shares  having  rights  or  privileges  equal  or  superior  to  the  Preference  Shares,  exchange,  reclassify  or  cancel 
Preference Shares, or create a new class of shares equal to or superior to the Preference Shares.
Warrants
The Warrants were created and issued pursuant to a warrant indenture (the "Warrant Indenture") between 
 
us and Equity Transfer Services Inc., as warrant agent thereunder (the "Warrant Agent").  The following summary 
of certain provisions of the Warrant Indenture is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 
provisions of the Warrant Indenture.
Every 30 Warrants entitle the holder to purchase one Common Share at a price of $3.15. The exercise 
price  and  the  number  of  Common  Shares  issuable  upon  exercise  are  both  subject  to  standard  anti-dilution 
provisions. Warrants are exercisable at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on December 21, 2009, after 
which time the Warrants will expire and become null and void. Under the Warrant Indenture, we are entitled to 
purchase  in  the  market,  by  private  contract  or  otherwise,  all  or  any  of  the  Warrants  then  outstanding,  and  any 
Warrants so purchased will be cancelled.
No fractional Common Shares will be issuable upon the exercise of any Warrants, and no cash or other 
 
consideration will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Holders of Warrants will not have any voting or pre-emptive 
rights or any other rights that a holder of Common Shares would have.
As of March 20, 2006, we had an aggregate of 1,027,756,923 Warrants issued and outstanding, which 
 
were exercisable for approximately 34,258,544 Common Shares.  In addition to the Warrants, we have other share 
purchase  warrants  outstanding  that  are  not  listed  on  any  stock  exchange.    As  at  March  20,  2006,  we  had  an 
aggregate  of  46,433,234  share  purchase  warrants  outstanding,  which  were  exercisable  for  an  aggregate  of 
approximately 1,547,774 Common Shares (and a further 992 share purchase warrants) at prices ranging from 
$1.50 per Common Share to $6.00 per Common Share and with expiry dates ranging from March 31, 2006 to 
December 21, 2006.
Rights
The  fundamental  objectives  of  the  shareholder  rights  plan  (the  "Rights  Plan"),  implemented  under the 
terms of a shareholder rights plan agreement dated as of November 9, 2004, are to provide adequate time for our 
board of directors and shareholders to assess an unsolicited take-over bid for us, to provide the board of directors 
with  sufficient  time  to  explore  and  develop  alternatives  for  maximizing  shareholder  value  if  a  take-over  bid  is 
made, and to provide shareholders with an equal opportunity to participate in a take-over bid.
One Right has been issued by us in respect of each Common Share that is currently outstanding, and one 
 
Right will be issued in respect of each Common Share issued during the balance of the term of the Rights Plan 
(which term expires on November 9, 2007) prior to the Separation Time, as described below.
The  Rights  will  separate  from  the  Common  Shares  and  will  be  exercisable  ten  trading  days  (the 
"Separation Time") after a person has acquired, or commences a take-over bid to acquire, 20% or more of the 
Common  Shares,  other  than  by  an  acquisition  pursuant  to  a  take-over  bid  permitted  by  the  Rights  Plan  (a 
"Permitted Bid"). The acquisition by any person (an "Acquiring Person") of 20% or more of the Common Shares, 
other than by way of a Permitted Bid, is referred to as a "Flip-in Event". Any Rights held by an Acquiring Person 
will  become  void  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  Flip-in  Event.  Ten  trading  days  after  the  occurrence  of  the  Flip-in
- 41 -
Event,  each  Right  (other  than  those  held  by the Acquiring Person), will permit the purchase of $180 worth of 
Common Shares for $90.
For the purposes of the Rights Plan the requirements for a Permitted Bid include the following:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
the take-over bid must be made by way of a take-over bid circular;
the take-over bid must be made to all shareholders, other than the bidder;
the take-over bid must be outstanding for a minimum period of 60 days and Common Shares 
tendered  pursuant  to  the  take-over  bid  may  not  be  taken  up  prior  to  the  expiry  of  the  60 day 
period  and  only  if  at  such  time  more  than 50% of the Common Shares held by shareholders, 
other  than  the  bidder,  its  affiliates  and  persons  acting  jointly  or  in  concert  and  certain  other 
persons  (the  "Independent  Shareholders"),  have  been  tendered  to  the  take-over  bid  and  not 
withdrawn;
if more than 50% of the Common Shares held by Independent Shareholders are tendered to the 
take-over bid within the 60 day period, the bidder must make a public announcement of that fact 
and the take-over bid must remain open for deposits of Common Shares for an additional ten 
days from the date of such public announcement;
the  take-over  bid  must  permit  Common  Shares  to  be  deposited  pursuant  to  the take-over bid, 
unless such take-over bid is withdrawn, at any time prior to the date Common Shares are first 
taken up and paid for; and
the take-over bid must provide that any Common Shares deposited pursuant to the take-over bid 
may be withdrawn until taken up and paid for.
The Rights Plan also allows for a competing Permitted Bid (a "Competing Permitted Bid") to be made 
 
while a Permitted Bid is in existence. A Competing Permitted Bid must satisfy all the requirements of a Permitted 
Bid  except  that  it  may  expire  on  the  same  date  as  the  Permitted  Bid,  subject  to  the  requirement  that  it  be 
outstanding for a minimum period of 35 days.

CMM and a number of other defendants seeking damages in an unspecified amount and alleging that they had 
been injured as a result of an explosion that occurred at a pharmaceutical plant. The plaintiffs have alleged that 
Zochem and/or CMM designed, manufactured, sold and supplied chemicals used in the manufacture of a rubber 
compound  that  were  dangerous,  defective  and  susceptible  to  causing  explosions.  HBMS  has  retained  legal 
counsel  in  North  Carolina  and  at  this  stage  the  likelihood  of  success  and  the  materiality  of  this  claim  is  not 
reasonably determinable.
An action has been commenced against Hudson Bay Exploration and Development Company Limited, 
Anglo  American  Exploration  (Canada) Ltd.  and  certain  employees  thereof  claiming  a  breach  of  confidence 
relating  to  mining  claims  staked  by  the  defendants  in  Northern  QuØbec.  The  plaintiff  has  alleged  that  the 
defendants misused confidential information to its detriment. The plaintiff is seeking, among other things, to have 
the claims transferred to the plaintiff, along with unspecified damages.  Pursuant to an agreement dated December 
21, 2004, Anglo American Exploration (Canada) Ltd. has agreed to indemnify and save harmless Hudson Bay 
Exploration  and  Development  Company  Limited  from  and  against  all  losses,  damages,  costs  and  liabilities 
incurred under any judgment or settlement made in connection with this action.
In  1994,  HBMS  received  $18.5 million  pursuant  to  a  litigation  settlement  agreement.  The  Canada 
Revenue  Agency  questioned  HBMS'  treatment  of  the  receipt  of  these  funds  as  non-taxable  damages  and,  as  a 
result, HBMS conformed to the Canada Revenue Agency position and then filed a notice of objection. HBMS has 
had  discussions  with  the  Canada  Revenue  Agency  in  this  regard  and  has  considered  litigation  to  support  its 
position. 
 
HBMS has been named as a co-defendant in two actions alleging various wrongful actions committed in 
connection  with  the  use  and  operation  of  the  Whitesand  Dam  and  the  Island  Falls  Hydroelectric  station  (the 
(cid:147)Hydro Projects(cid:148)) in Saskatchewan. The plaintiffs have claimed for an aggregate of $1 billion in compensatory 
damages and in excess of $100 million in punitive damages. One of HBMS' former subsidiaries constructed and 
operated the dam until it was transferred to SaskPower in 1981. The plaintiffs in both actions claim that the lands 
on which the hydroelectric facilities were built are subject to aboriginal rights. No further steps have been taken 
by the plaintiffs to proceed with their claims since 1995.
SaskPower has been named as a defendant in two other actions, one filed in Manitoba in 1992 and one 
filed in Saskatchewan in 2004.  Both actions claim damages alleged as a result of the operation and use of the 
Hydro Projects.  HBMS has not been named in those actions.  However, it has recently come to our attention that 
SaskPower  intends  to  take  legal  action  against  Churchill  River  Power  Company  Limited  ((cid:147)CRP(cid:148)), formerly a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of HBMS, which was dissolved.  SaskPower has revived CRP for the purpose of taking 
action for alleged breaches by CRP of its obligation under a certain Purchase and Sale Agreement made in 1981.  
Although HBMS and CRP may be named as a party in one of the actions, to date no steps have been taken to add 
HBMS or CRP as a defendant or third party in either action.
A claim has been filed against HBMS in relation to the workplace death of an employee. We understand 
that such a claim is statute barred pursuant to the Workers Compensation Act. We believe that HBMS has a good 
defence  to  this  claim  and  that  HBMS  should  not  be  held  liable  in  respect  of  this  claim.  The  Chief  Medical 
Examiner of the Province of Manitoba has also commenced an inquest into this workplace death. The inquest is 
currently underway. In November 2004, the claim was denied by the Workers Compensation Board.
Except as noted above, we are not aware of any litigation outstanding, threatened or pending against us
as of the date hereof that would be material to our financial condition or results of operations.

Financial Assistance for the Balmat Acquisition
In  connection  with  our  purchase  of  the  Balmat  Mine,  St.  Lawrence  Zinc  Company LLP,  one  of  our 
subsidiaries  received  assistance  from  Frame  Mining  Company  ((cid:147)FMC(cid:148)),  a  company  controlled  by  our  former 
Chief Executive Officer and a former director. FMC advanced US$1 million to our subsidiary in order for it to 
assume an environmental bond. Further, FMC provided security on a proposed US$4 million project loan to our 
subsidiary.  As  security  for  these  debts,  we  pledged  a  51%  interest  in  our  subsidiary.  Under  the  terms  of  the 
agreement,  26%  of  the  ownership  interest  held  as  security  was  released  to  us  after  the  repayment  of  the 
US$1 million  advanced  by  FMC  and  an  additional  payment  of  US$200,000.  The  remaining  25%  ownership 
interest held as security was released in 2003 upon the final payment of US$800,000 to FMC.  
 
Settlement of Debt
In 2003, we settled $362,724 of related party debts through the issuance of 100,756 Common Shares.
Agreements with Frame Parties
Pursuant  to  an  agreement  dated  June 17,  2004  (the  (cid:147)June  Agreement(cid:148)),  Frame  Mining  Corporation, 
Curraghdale Inc. and Curraghdale Corp. (collectively the (cid:147)Frame Parties(cid:148)) sold to Gregory J. Peebles, who was 
then our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 666,666 Common Shares and 318,159 common share purchase 
warrants. The June Agreement provided for an aggregate purchase price of $3,600,000. Of this purchase price, 
$15,000 was paid on June 17, 2004, $180,000 was to be payable in twelve consecutive monthly instalments of 
$15,000 each with each instalment payable on the 20th day of each month, beginning on July 20, 2004 and ending 
on June 20, 2005 and the balance of $3,405,000 was to be payable on July 2, 2005. The outstanding balance of 
the  purchase  price  was  secured  by  a  pledge  of  the purchased securities and recourse of the Frame Parties was 
limited to the purchased securities.  If the purchased securities were sold prior to full payment therefor, for greater 
than the original $0.18 purchase price per share, or if on the day prior to the date the balance of the purchase price 
was to be payable, the trading price of the Common Shares exceeds $0.18 or $0.20 in the case of the warrants, the 
Frame  Parties  were  entitled  to  receive  from  Mr. Peebles  20%  of  the  excess  subject  to  an  aggregate  limit  of 
$5 million.  Mr. Peebles  disclosed  the  terms  of  this  agreement  to  certain  members  of  our  board  of  directors  on 
December 8, 2004.
On  December 8,  2004,  Mr. Peebles,  the  Frame  Parties  and  Mr. Clifford  Frame  entered  into  a  further 
agreement  (the  (cid:147)December  Agreement(cid:148)).  Mr. Peebles  also  signed  the  December  Agreement  on  behalf  of  us 
although  no  other  of  our  officers  or  directors  reviewed  the  December  Agreement  prior  to  its  execution  and, 
accordingly,  we  expressed  doubt  concerning  the  binding  nature  of  this  Agreement.  The  December  Agreement 
provided  that  Mr. Peebles  was  entitled  to  satisfy  the  unpaid  portion  of  the  purchase  price  under  the  June 
Agreement by paying $1,500,000 to the Frame Parties. Of this sum, $1,000,000 was paid upon the closing of the 
acquisition of HBMS and the balance of the amount was to be paid no later than January 17, 2005. In addition, the 
December Agreement provided that we were to pay on the closing of the Acquisition $120,000 to Frame Mining 
Corporation  and  Curraghdale Inc.  to  settle  claims  made  by  Curraghdale Inc.  for  compensation  for  services 
rendered by Mr. Clifford Frame from November 1, 2003 to April 21, 2004 in his then capacity as our Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer and with respect to a claim by Frame Mining Corporation for repayment of a $10,000 
loan.  The  December  Agreement  further  provided  that  we  were  to  make  available  to  the  Frame  Parties  for 
subscription on the Acquisition up to 20,000,000 Subscription Receipts at the offering price of $0.075 each.  We 
made the payments and issued and sold to the Frame Parties the securities as set out in the December Agreement.
- 50 -
Mr. Peebles joined us, as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, on April 21, 2004.  We entered into three 
arrangements with certain corporations owned or controlled by Mr. Peebles (the (cid:147)Peebles Affiliates(cid:148)), on April 
30, 2004, which provided that such Peebles Affiliates would provide various services to us and be paid various 
forms  of  compensation  in  connection  therewith  (the  (cid:147)Consulting  and  Services  Agreements(cid:148)).    Upon  a  further 
review  of  the  Consulting  and  Services  Agreements,  these  agreements  were  deemed  to  be  inappropriate,  and 
accordingly were terminated on November 9, 2004, but with effect as at April 30, 2004.  We did not make any 
payments under the Consulting and Services Agreement and the parties have mutually released each other from 
any and all claims and liabilities thereunder. 
 
September Private Placement
Mr. Peebles  and  Mr. Christopher  Irwin,  a  former  Corporate  Secretary  and  a  former  director  of  the 
Company, purchased 333,333 units and 6,666 units, respectively, pursuant to the private placement completed on 
September 30,  2004,  at  a  price  of  $1.50  per  unit.  In  the  course  of  reviewing  our  preliminary  prospectus  dated 
November  10,  2004,  the  Ontario  Securities Commission raised concerns that these transactions occurred when 
Mr. Peebles and Mr. Irwin may have had material undisclosed information concerning the acquisition of HBMS 
that  had  not  been  generally  disclosed.  In  response  to these concerns, but without admitting any impropriety or 
unlawful conduct, Mr. Peebles and Mr. Irwin have returned to us the securities acquired by them in the private 
placement, at the original subscription price of $1.50 per unit. We have cancelled these securities.  
 
Resignation of Gregory J. Peebles
On December 10, 2004, the mutual decision was made by us and Mr. Peebles that he should resign as our 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and a director. A severance agreement was entered into, pursuant to which we 
paid to Mr. Peebles the sum of $500,000 in severance and $166,666 in payment of owed employment income.

SCHEDULE (cid:147)A(cid:148)
GLOSSARY OF MINING TERMS
(cid:147)basalt(cid:148)
The following is a glossary of terms used in this annual information form.
A  general  term  for  dark-colored  mafic  igneous  rocks,  commonly  extrusive  but  locally 
intrusive  (e.g., as  dikes),  composed  chiefly  of  calcic  plagioclase  and  clinopyroxene;  the 
fine-grained  equivalent  of  gabbro.  Nepheline,  olivine,  orthopyroxene,  or  quartz  may  be 
present. Adj. basaltic.
(cid:147)CIM(cid:148)
(cid:147)concentrator(cid:148)
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum.
A plant where ore is separated into values (concentrates) and rejects (tails). An appliance 
in such a plant, e.g., flotation cell, jig, electromagnet, shaking table. Also called mill.
(cid:147)double-drum hoist(cid:148)  A hoist with two drums that can be driven separately or together by a clutch.
(cid:147)felsic(cid:148)
(cid:147)grade(cid:148)
(cid:147)hectare(cid:148)
(cid:147)mafic(cid:148)
A mnemonic adj. derived from (fe) for feldspar, (l) for lenad or feldspathoid, and (s) for 
silica, and applied to light-colored rocks containing an abundance of one or all of these 
constituents.  Also  applied  to  the  minerals  themselves,  the  chief  felsic  minerals  being 
quartz, feldspar, feldspathoid, and muscovite.
The  amount  of  valuable  metal  in  each  tonne  of  ore,  expressed  as  grams  per  tonne  for 
precious metals.
Cut-off grade (cid:151) is the minimum metal grade at which a tonne of rock can be processed 
on an economic basis.
One hectare equals 2.47 acres.
Pertaining to or composed dominantly of the ferromagnesian rock-forming silicates; said 
of some igneous rocks and their constituent minerals.
(cid:147)metallurgy(cid:148)
The  science  of  extracting  metals  from  ores  by  mechanical  and  chemical  processes  and 
preparing them for use.
(cid:147)mine(cid:148)
An excavation in the earth for the purpose of extracting minerals. The excavation may be 
an open pit on the surface or underground workings.
(cid:147)mineral reserves(cid:148)
That  part  of  a  measured  or  indicated  mineral  resource  which  could  be  economically 
mined,  demonstrated  by  at  least  a  preliminary  feasibility  study  that  includes  adequate 
information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A mineral 
reserve  includes  diluting  materials  and  allowances  for  losses  that  may  occur  when  the 
material is mined. Mineral reserves are those parts of mineral resources which, after the 
application of all mining factors, result in an estimated tonnage and grade which, in the 
opinion of the qualified person(s) making the estimates, is the basis of an economically 
viable  project  after  taking  account  of  all  relevant  processing,  metallurgical,  economic, 
marketing, legal, environment, socio-economic and government factors. Mineral reserves 
are  inclusive  of  diluting  material  that  will  be  mined  in  conjunction  with  the  mineral 
reserves  and  delivered  to  the  treatment  plant  or  equivalent  facility.  The  term  (cid:147)mineral 
reserve(cid:148) need not necessarily signify that extraction facilities are in place or operative or 
that  all  governmental  approvals  have  been  received.  It  does  signify  that  there  are
- 53 -
(cid:147)proven mineral
reserves(cid:148)
(cid:147)probable mineral
reserves(cid:148)
reasonable  expectations  of  such  approvals.  Mineral  reserves  are  subdivided  into  proven 
mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves. Mineral reserves fall under the following 
categories:
That  part  of  a  measured  mineral  resource  that  is  the  economically  mineable  part  of  a 
measured  mineral  resource,  demonstrated  by  at  least  a  preliminary  feasibility  study  that 
includes adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other 
relevant  factors  that  demonstrate,  at  the  time  of  reporting,  that  economic  extraction  is 
justified.
That part of an indicated and in some circumstances a measured mineral resource that is 
economically  mineable  demonstrated  by  at  least  a  preliminary  feasibility  study  that 
includes adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other 
relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be 
justified.
(cid:147)mineral resources(cid:148)  A concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic material in 
or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has 
reasonable  prospects  for  economic  extraction.  The  location,  quantity,  grade,  geological 
characteristics  and  continuity  of  a  mineral  resource  are  known,  estimated  or  interpreted 
from  specific  geological  evidence  and  knowledge.  Mineral  resources  fall  under  the 
following categories:
(cid:147)measured mineral
resource(cid:148)
(cid:147)indicated mineral
resource(cid:148)
That part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and 
physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence 
sufficient  to  allow  the  appropriate  application  of  technical  and  economic  parameters  to 
support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The 
estimate  is  based  on  detailed  and  reliable  exploration,  sampling  and testing information 
gathered  through  appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings  and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and 
grade continuity.
That  part  of  a  mineral  resource  for  which  quantity,  densities,  shape  and  physical 
characteristics  can  be  estimated  with  a  level  of  confidence  sufficient  to  allow  the 
appropriate  application  of  technical  and  economic  parameters  and  to  support  mine 
planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on 
detailed  and  reliable  exploration  and  testing  information  gathered  through  appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that 
are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.
(cid:147)inferred mineral
resource(cid:148)
That part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated 
on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not 
verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and

AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
I.
PURPOSE
The  Audit  Committee  is  a  committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors.    The  primary  function  of  the  Audit
Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by:




reviewing  the  financial  reports  and  other  financial  information  provided  by  the  Company  to  any 
governmental body or the public and other relevant documents;
