(a) A parking meter installed in respect of which the vehicle is parked displays an expired sign indicating that 

(i)     
No charge had been made for the use of the space; or 

(ii)    
The period for which a charge was paid has expired: ..."

The Prosecution Witnesses and Evidence

At the formal proof the Prosecution called 2 witnesses and relied on the evidence of the booking officer, Mr. Suliasi Ratudale who had given evidence in this Court on 26th May 2011 when the case was previously formally proofed. 

Apart from calling on the stand Mr. Sharan Dip Singh and Abhay Kumar, the Prosecution relied on the statements of the Booking officer, Suliasi Raudale, Sharan Dip Singh and Abhay Kumar and further tendered certification of the parking meters by the Trade Measurements and Standards Department, the LTA Report and the Daily Parking Meter Inspection Report. 

One of the prosecution witnesses, Sharan Dip Singh informed the Court that "am the manager traffic for STC. Report from LTA shows that accused is owner of taxi. Notice was served on the accused. Parking meter was operational. Defendant had raised later that parking meter was defective. Defendant's father who used the taxi that day was in Council office that day. He never raised it with us. CEO has given statement that Defendant was in Council that day and never raised issue that meter was defective. Accused has already paid $120. Seek costs. On the day in question the father of the accused, Kasi Prasad had come to Council to enquire about a mini-bus permit  which was declined. Parking meter was working. Accused had deliberately not paid." 

The prosecution sought $200/appearance cost totaling $600.00 for 3 appearances. 

Analysis

The Court has noted all the evidence that was tendered in this Court. The Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence given in Court and the documentary evidence tendered that the charge is proven against the accused. The prosecution has proven the elements of the offence of Parking Meter Offence, contrary to Regulation 85 (1) (a) and 87 of the Land Transport (Traffic) Regulations 2000. The accused was given chance to defend himself. He has not appeared and neither has his counsel. 

The Prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt that on 14th day of December 2010 at Sigatoka in the Western Division, the accused being the driver/owner of Vehicle Registration Number LT5324 on Queens Road caused the vehicle to be parked illegally at an expired parking meter number 32. The Prosecution further tendered evidence through its witness that the parking meter was operational at the time of the offence. 

The Court has further noted Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009 which allows the Court to proceed with hearing in absence of accused in certain cases. This Court proceeded in this case on the basis the offence was not punishable with a term exceeding 12 months imprisonment and/or a fine exceeding 10 penalty unit. 

The Court is mindful also of Section 172 of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009 on setting aside the conviction and this Court twice entertained the accused, firstly after it was initially formally proofed and later, while re-instating the case when the motion to set aside was struck out. The Court has noted laxity on certain parts and this Court, like any Court needs to be vigilante to parties/counsels who bide time and drag on cases without finality. 

The Court in this matter has noted the fine has been paid by the accused. The accused is now to pay cost of $150.00 to prosecution. 

28 days to appeal.
