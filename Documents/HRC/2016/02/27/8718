<p> <i>Summary</i> 
The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
</p>
<p>undertook an official visit to Japan from 12 to 17 July 2009. The purpose of the visit was to 
gather first-hand information on the phenomenon of human trafficking in the country and 
assess the impact of the measures taken by the Government and other stakeholders to 
prevent trafficking and protect the human rights of trafficked persons. 
</p>
<p>Japan is a destination country for many victims of human trafficking. The Government 
of Japan, in recognition of the seriousness of the problem, has taken measures to address it, 
in particular since 2004 with the adoption of the National Action Plan on Measures to 
Combat Trafficking in Persons and the introduction of the crime of trafficking into the 
Penal Code in 2005. However, many challenges still need to be addressed, in particular in 
relation to the protection of victims of trafficking and the adoption of a human rights-based 
approach to fighting trafficking. Among her recommendations, the Special Rapporteur 
urges the country to adopt a clearer definition of trafficking and spell out clear criteria and 
guidelines for the identification of victims. Also, a comprehensive legal and policy 
framework on the protection of victims of trafficking should be adopted and better 
assistance, including possibilities for rehabilitation (recovering), reintegration and redress, 
should be provided to victims, regardless of their location. Training of law enforcement 
officials on the identification of victims should be urgently pursued. Lastly, a permanent

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children, carried out an official visit to Japan from 12 to 17 July 2009. Her visit 
to the prefectures of Tokyo and Nagoya included meetings with government officials, 
representatives of intergovernmental and civil society organizations, lawyers and victims, 
as well as visits to shelters and a detention centre. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express her gratitude to the Government for the 
invitation to undertake this visit, its cooperation throughout and the opportunity to meet and 
engage with stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>3. The objective of the visit was to gather first-hand information on the phenomenon of 
human trafficking in the country and assess the impact of the measures taken to prevent 
trafficking and protect the human rights of trafficked persons. Since a comprehensive and 
holistic approach is imperative in order to combat this phenomenon, the Special Rapporteur 
particularly focused her attention on strategies for combating trafficking that rest on the 
following &#8220;5 P&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;3 R&#8217;s&#8221; &#8211; protection, prosecution, punishment, prevention, promotion 
(of international cooperation), redress, rehabilitation (recovery) and reintegration of victims 
to assume a constructive role in the society. 
</p>
<p>4. Japan, as a wealthy country, is a destination country for many victims of human 
trafficking. Although trafficking for prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation 
constitutes the vast majority of the recorded cases in Japan, the Special Rapporteur also 
focused on trafficking for labour exploitation, a phenomenon that has not received the 
required attention by Japanese authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>5. Japan, an island chain located in Eastern Asia, has a population of 127 million. 
Among the foreign population, which represents 1.74 per cent of the total population, 
Chinese nationals constitute the largest foreign community (655,377), followed by South 
and North Koreans (589,239), Brazilians (312,582), Filipinos (210,617) and Peruvians 
(59,723).1 
</p><p>6. Japan has a Parliamentary Government with a constitutional monarchy. While the 
emperor retains his throne as a symbol of national unity, elected politicians exercise the 
actual decision-making power. Administratively, Japan is divided into 47 prefectures, the 
country&#8217;s subnational jurisdictions, with local prefectural governments. 
7. The economy has experienced a major slowdown since the 1990s following three 
decades of unprecedented growth, but Japan still remains a major economic power, both in 
Asia and globally. It is therefore a country of destination for foreign workers.

<p><b> III. Main findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The institutional framework and its implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legislative and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Japan is party to a number of core international human rights treaties, in particular 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Japan 
has not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families or the Optional Protocols to the Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention against Torture and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>9. Of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur is that Japan has not ratified the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime (&#8220;Palermo Protocol&#8221;), despite it signing the Protocol in December 2002. In that 
regard, the Government indicated that it is committed to ratifying the Protocol in the near 
future and that domestic legislation had already been brought in line with the Protocol. 
</p>
<p>10. The legislative and policy efforts undertaken by Japan to combat human trafficking 
are framed around the National Action Plan on Measures to Combat Trafficking in 
Persons,2 adopted in December 2004 by the Inter-ministerial Liaison Committee headed by 
the Cabinet Secretariat. The plan is divided into five main sections with the following 
objectives: 
 (a) Ratification of the Palermo Protocol: this includes the ratification of the 
Protocol and the adoption of amendments to several laws to bring domestic legislation in 
line with the Palermo Protocol; 
</p>
<p> (b) Prevention of trafficking: this includes enforcement of immigration control; 
exchange of information with countries of origin; enhancement of reliability of travel 
documents; review of status of residence and visas for entertainers; counter-measures 
against false marriages; and measures to prevent illegal employment and prostitution; 
</p>
<p> (c) Eradication of trafficking: this includes criminalization of trafficking; 
thorough repressive actions; sharing of information on passports and visas; and 
coordination with investigating authorities of various countries; 
</p>
<p> (d) Protection of victims: this includes identification of victims and due 
consideration of their status with regard to potential criminalization; provision of shelters; 
counselling and consultation activities; interview and protection of victims; permitting an 
extension of period of stay or granting a special permission for residence (on a case-by-case 
basis); ensuring the safety of victims; and repatriation assistance to victims; 
 (e) Points of methodology: this includes cooperation with domestic, foreign and 
international institutions, in particular on investigations and on prevention; awareness-

</p>
<p>raising on trafficking and violence against women; and training for law enforcement 
officials. 
</p>
<p>11. To implement the action plan and bring domestic legislation into line with both the 
plan and the Palermo Protocol (yet to be ratified), Japan amended several laws. Firstly, the 
Law Concerning Partial Amendment to the Penal Code of 22 June 2005 established the 
crime of trafficking in persons. It criminalizes the buying and selling of persons and the 
transporting, transferring and harbouring victims of kidnapping, abduction, buying or 
selling. According to the revised article 226 of the Penal Code, kidnapping by force, threat, 
fraud or enticement for transportation to a foreign country shall be punished for no fewer 
than 2 years and no more than 20 years. The buying or selling of a person shall be punished 
with imprisonment for no fewer than three months and no more than five years (seven if it 
is a child), and if the purpose is for profit, indecency, marriage, or threat to the life or body, 
the penalty is imprisonment for no less than 1 year and no more than 10 years. The acts of 
transporting, transferring and harbouring victims of kidnapping, abduction or sale for these 
purposes are also punished with imprisonment for not fewer than six months and no more 
than seven years. 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the definition of trafficking, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that 
it is not as comprehensive as the definition contained in the Palermo Protocol, in particular 
because it does not include recruitment without kidnapping. In addition, the penalties seem 
inappropriate, in particular with regard to the minimum duration of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>13. The Law for Punishment of Organized Crime, Control of Crime Proceeds and Other 
Matters has been amended to designate trafficking in persons as an offence to be considered 
relevant for money-laundering. The Law on Control and Improvement of Amusement 
Businesses was also amended in October 2005 to prevent illicit work by requiring the 
owners of amusement and sex-related businesses to verify the immigration status of foreign 
employees at recruitment. 
</p>
<p>14. The Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act was amended in 2005 to 
stipulate that a residence permit can be given to a victim of trafficking for the purpose of 
protection or the prosecution of those responsible for procuring, providing or possessing a 
fraudulent Japanese passport. Also, the Ministerial Ordinance to provide for criteria 
pursuant to article 7, paragraph 1 (2), of this Act was amended to prevent the use of the 
entertainer residence permit for trafficking purposes.  
</p>
<p>15. Japan has also strengthened its border controls in order to prevent illegal entry. The 
Immigration Bureau attached to the Ministry of Justice is in charge of delivering eligibility 
certificates for migration to Japan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in charge of issuing 
visas. Furthermore, the Ministry of Justice is creating a new system based on fingerprints 
and pictures taken at airports that will allow information-sharing within the Ministry. 
</p>
<p>16. Concerning the protection of children, the Act on Punishment of Activities Relating 
to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and the Protection of Children,3 punishes the 
sexual exploitation of children under the age of 18. It criminalizes the solicitation of child 
prostitution, the provision of child pornography and other related activities, and the 
trafficking in children for the purpose of child prostitution or pornography. Internal 
trafficking for these purposes is punishable with imprisonment for no less than one year, or, 
if it is international, for no less than two years. However, the law does not punish the 
possession of pornography of children if it is not intended for sale, which is a serious gap 
and of particular concern. An amendment to the law in this regard is being discussed. 
</p>
<p>

 Japan, Act No. 52 of 26 May 1999, as revised by Act No. 106 of 2004. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13288 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>17. Lastly, in 2005 a draft bill on the protection of victims of trafficking and the 
prevention of trafficking was submitted to the House of Representatives, but was not 
adopted. Civil society organizations indicated that a revised version of this victim 
protection bill is being prepared for submission. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Implementation: general framework and areas of concern 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) National coordination mechanism on trafficking 
</i>18. The Cabinet Secretariat (which supports the Inter-ministerial Liaison Committee in 
charge of the action plan) indicated that it is quite satisfied with the plan&#8217;s implementation. 
According to the Cabinet Secretariat, five years after its adoption, the objectives have been 
mostly achieved, although this view is not necessarily supported by many organizations that 
are working on the ground for victims of trafficking in Japan. However, the Government 
has indicated its commitment to reviewing the plan by the end of December 2009.4 
</p>
<p>19. Concerning human resources dedicated to the plan&#8217;s implementation, there is no 
separate office on human trafficking or any officer in the Cabinet Secretariat that is solely 
dedicated to its implementation. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Entertainment visas 
</i>20. The entertainment visa was one of the major channels used by traffickers to 
introduce victims into Japan. Given that 85,000 visas for entertainers were issued in 2004 to 
Filipino nationals and that many of them ended up being trafficked for sexual exploitation, 
the Government of Japan decided to cancel the system of artist accreditation cards 
established between Japan and the Philippines, whereby the Government issued 
entertainment visas based on Philippine companies&#8217; certification that a person was indeed 
an artist. Following this amendment, Japan now requires two years of experience or training 
as an entertainer abroad to issue these visas. As a consequence, the number of 
entertainment visas fell from 139,000 in 2004 to 36,000 in 2008. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) False marriages 
</i>21. Since entertainment visas have been subjected to strict control, traffickers have used 
other channels, in particular false international marriages, to traffic victims into Japan. In 
many cases, women are not aware that the marriage proposal is false and that they will have 
to pay money back, while in other cases women are aware of it, but are still deceived about 
the real conditions of the &#8220;contract&#8221;. The realities they face upon arrival in Japan are often 
exploitive forced labour with extremely low salaries and limited freedom, and, in some 
cases, debt bondages ranging from US$ 30,000 to 60,000. It is difficult for the police to 
identify these victims, since &#8212; as &#8220;supposed spouses&#8221; of Japanese citizens &#8212; they have 
access to all types of work legally. 
</p>
<p>22. Women who are falsely married frequently become victims of domestic violence. A 
serious obstacle for these women to leaving the house is the terms of their visa. Even if 
these women have Japanese children, if they leave the marriage, they lose their visa. They 
can get a permanent visa only after five years of marriage. Therefore, many of them endure 
the violence for years in order not to be returned. Concerns were also expressed to the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 The Special Rapporteur received information according to which, in December 2009, the Government 
</p>
<p>revised the National Action Plan, taking into account some of the preliminary recommendations that 
she issued at the end of her mission. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that the 
Government has taken prompt action in this regard and looks forward to receiving more details 
thereon. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-13288 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur that the immigration law is being amended to stipulate that foreign 
women who divorce will lose their residence permit, even if they have a permanent visa. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in the Nagoya prefecture, victims of this 
form of trafficking are mostly women from the Philippines and Indonesia. Also, in some 
parts of Japan, adverts in community newspapers written in native languages of foreign 
residents invite trainees and technical interns to marry Japanese nationals. This makes 
trafficking even easier, since these foreign victims are already in Japan. 
</p>
<p>24. Finally, concerns were expressed that the residential permits granted to caregivers 
have also started to be used to traffic persons. In countries of origin, such as the Philippines, 
traffickers establish caregiver training centres and from there traffic persons to Japan. In 
some cases, sending Governments may acquiesce and omit to take action to combat 
trafficking (especially where the country receives a lot of money from remittances from 
victims) and some officials are directly corrupted by traffickers. 
</p><p>25. The Government indicated that it is aware of the trend of trafficking through false 
marriages and that it has taken measures to monitor this risk. For example, the Tokyo 
Metropolitan Women&#8217;s Counselling Office, a public shelter, referred to the case of a 
Filipino woman who, in 2008, had undergone a false marriage with a Japanese man. She 
was forced to work in a bar. She escaped and went to the police, and it took 11 days for her 
to be recognized as a victim of trafficking, since she was involved in a false marriage and 
had a false work contract; eventually she was assisted and returned to her country. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Industrial Training and Technical Internship Programme 
</i>26. The Industrial Training and Technical Internship Programme was established in 
order to develop human and industrial resources of developing countries, with the aim of 
securing the transfer of industrial technology, skills and/or knowledge. Many reported that 
this system is used by some companies as a conduit to bring in unskilled workers to Japan 
to work at very low wages, under conditions that may well amount to trafficking. There are 
around 200,000 trainees and interns in Japan, and the majority come from China (67.6 per 
cent in 2008). 
27. Under this programme, a foreign national can enter Japan as a &#8220;trainee&#8221; for one year 
and become a &#8220;technical intern&#8221; for another two years at the most. Thereafter, the technical 
intern is required to go back to his/her country. In 1991, the Japan International Training 
Cooperation Organization (JITCO) was established under the supervision of five ministries; 
JITCO today manages the vast majority of the programme and should have a role in 
monitoring abuses. It is composed of associations of companies that provide trainees to 
their member companies, relevant ministries and labour unions. 
</p>
<p>28. In their first year, trainees are not covered by labour law and are extremely 
vulnerable to employers&#8217; abuses. Trainees are not considered as workers but more as 
students; therefore they receive an allowance rather than a salary, cannot do repetitive work 
or overwork, and have to be trained. However, according to lawyers and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), trainees are in many cases used as cheap labourers and required to 
perform repetitive work that is unconnected with their field of work in their home country 
and what they were promised at the time of recruitment. They are taught technical skills 
only in a low percentage of cases and, in the majority of cases, are used as normal workers 
and obliged to do overtime, for which they are mostly unpaid. 
</p>
<p>29. A particular concern relates to the practice of some receiving organizations of 
confiscating trainees and interns&#8217; passports, in order to deter them from complaining or 
running away. Many trainees pay huge amounts of money as a &#8220;guarantee&#8221; prior to leaving 
their country and this money is only paid back if they complete the period of training and 
internship. They are also often requested to offer their house as an additional guarantee. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13288 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>They are therefore trapped: forced to continue to work and live under very harsh conditions 
and subject to practices similar to slavery and servitude. Such abuses continue to take place 
despite the administrative guidance issued by the Government in 2007 that prohibits the 
confiscation of passports, deduction of money and compulsory savings, and deposits in the 
country of origins. In 2008, the Ministry of Justice recognized that 452 employment 
agencies had engaged in some kind of related illegal behaviour. 
</p>
<p>30. Restrictions on the freedom of movement of trainees and interns have also been 
reported, such as prohibition of mobile phone possession, prohibition or restriction of 
making phone calls, going out, writing letters, going to Internet caf&#233;s or speaking with 
individuals other than staff of accepting organizations. Some are even timed and fined for 
every minute spent using the toilets. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur heard various testimonies of trainees who were housed in 
containers, without heating at 10 degrees, drinking dirty water or sleeping on the floor. She 
also heard testimonies of young women who were sexually harassed and abused. In one 
case, a young Chinese woman who was supposed to be a trainee in a farm to acquire 
agricultural skills was taken by the entrepreneur to work as a servant in her house and raped 
on a regular basis until she could escape. A case was filed in court. She succeeded in 
receiving monetary compensation through an out-of-court settlement. Generally, it is 
difficult to reach the end of a court case, since interns have to leave after three years and a 
court case usually lasts two years. 
</p>
<p>32. Attorneys representing trainees reported the case of a Chinese woman who was told 
she would be trained in making clothes but, once in Japan, was put to work as a cleaner. 
She worked for almost three years from 8.30 a.m. to 12.00 a.m. with very few days off. 
When, together with other colleagues, she asked for better working conditions, the 
employer forced her and her colleagues into a car and took them to the airport to be 
deported to China, with the assistance of the airport police. She subsequently escaped and 
went to a workers&#8217; union in Tokyo that has tried to sue the company in court. The Special 
Rapporteur heard several testimonies of Chinese men and women forcibly deported when 
they complained about their work and living conditions. 
</p>
<p>33. Despite the fact that, when trainees become technical interns, they are fully covered 
by Japanese labour laws, their labour rights continue to be violated by companies: they are 
often paid less than Japanese workers, do overtime and work during holidays without being 
compensated at higher rates, and do not take their paid holidays. 
</p>
<p>34. An additional concern is that companies in countries of origin send trainees without 
employment contracts. While it should be a training programme under which companies 
employing workers send them for training to Japan and &#8212; keeping their contractual 
relationship &#8212; reintegrate them when they come back, in reality sending companies do not 
have a contractual relationship with the trainees and do not take them back on when they go 
back. This system does not offer sufficient guarantees and seems to be more of a disguised 
recruitment system that opens corridors for trafficking. 
</p>
<p>35. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated that the programme is monitored by five 
ministries through JITCO. Measures to prevent or stop abuses include the careful selection 
of trainers, requests for copies of contracts, one or two missions per year dispatched to 
monitor how interns are using their skills back in their countries of origin and suspension of 
a company from the programme for three years when irregularities are identified. JITCO 
publishes annual evaluation reports, which note that the objectives of the programme have 
generally been met. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.10-13288 
</p>
<p>36. A revised immigration law was recently adopted,5 which extends the applicability of 
labour laws to trainees and therefore entitles them to be paid the minimum wage and have 
the same labour rights as any Japanese worker. However, the programme has not been 
improved and the rest of the concerns remain valid, mainly owing to lack of effective 
measures to guarantee the implementation of the law, in particular considering that the 
majority of these abuses remain unnoticed for lack of appropriate inspections and 
monitoring, especially by trained labour inspectors. 
</p>
<p><i> (e) Discrimination and violence against women 
</i>37. Women and girls, including Japanese nationals, fall into the vicious circle of 
trafficking and sexual exploitation and other forms of gender-based violence. In this regard, 
the high incidence of domestic violence against women and girls in Japan is of particular 
concern.6 
</p>
<p>38. According to the statistics provided by the Cabinet Office, 13.3 per cent of women 
living in Japan feared for their life in 2008 because of domestic violence. Also in 2008, 
68,196 cases of domestic violence were reported to relevant government bodies. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the assistance provided to victims of domestic 
violence by the spousal violence counselling and support centres and of women&#8217;s 
consultation offices (WCOs) in each prefecture since their establishment by the 
Government and local authorities. She regrets, however, that the hotline for domestic 
violence that was established in January 2009 is available in Japanese only. 
</p>
<p>39. Furthermore, it is practice for women victims of domestic violence to have to leave 
their home with their children to go to a WCO, while their husband can remain at home. 
This solution deeply frustrates women and increases their vulnerability to gender-based 
violence. 
</p>
<p>40. Moreover, according to the statistics provided by the Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare, women are still strongly discriminated against in the employment sphere in Japan 
in comparison with other major developed countries, including in relation to salaries (the 
average woman&#8217;s salary is 67.8 per cent of the average man&#8217;s salary; this percentage rises 
to 79.9 per cent in the United States of America), access to managerial posts (10.2 per cent 
are occupied by women, as opposed to 42.7 per cent in the United States) or access to 
services which facilitate those mothers who wish to continue working (70 per cent of 
women resign after the birth of their first child). These inequalities at work make women 
vulnerable in both public and private spheres. 
</p>
<p>41. Women victims of discrimination and domestic violence are at a higher risk of 
becoming victims of the deceptive recruitment methods of traffickers. Advertisements ask 
for models and actresses for videos and soap operas and promise high wages. However, the 
reality is different: women end up working as hostesses in the entertainment industry or for 
sex video shoots; commoditized and sexually and economically exploited. Thus, many 
victims find themselves trapped in a cycle of violence.

 The amendments to the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act were adopted by the 
</p>
<p>Japanese Parliament on 15 July 2009 and will take effect over the next one to three years. 
 
</p>
<p>6
 The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recently expressed its concerns 
</p>
<p>at the obstacles women victims of domestic and sexual violence face when bringing complaints and 
seeking protection in Japan, particularly with regard to immigrant women, minority women and 
women of vulnerable groups. See concluding observations on Japan (CEDAW/C/JPN/CO/6), 7 
August 2009. </p>

</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13288 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>42. This phenomenon is particularly alarming with respect to underage girls. They are 
less capable of protecting themselves and escaping from their abuser once they fall into 
such a circle. Some girls who respond to advertisements are forced to have sex during their 
first interview and are kept by the threat of compromising photos or videos being published 
on the Internet. Some are first employed in other sectors where they end up becoming 
heavily in debt and then start working in the sex industry in order to pay back their debts. 
Lastly, the <i>enjo kosai</i> compensated dating phenomenon, whereby relatively wealthy girls 
occasionally make dates with men and have sex with them for money, has not been 
eradicated. 
</p>
<p><i> (f) The situation of men 
</i>43. Concerning men and boys, the situation is particularly worrisome, since they are not 
considered as victims of trafficking and therefore not protected under the anti-trafficking 
strategy. Thus, there is no form of direct assistance such as shelters for trafficked men. 
Furthermore, there is no legal framework to protect victims of trafficking for labour 
exploitation, which often affects men. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>44. The action plan provides that the Government will engage in awareness-raising 
activities. The Government indicated that more than 1 million leaflets in nine languages 
have been distributed and posters are put up in airports and foreign consular offices. 
Awareness-raising activities have been implemented in cooperation with the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF). Embassies and consulates also play an important role 
in source countries, providing pre-departure briefings on potential risks and where to go to 
seek help. In 2008, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Tokyo launched 
an anti-trafficking campaign with the television channel MTV, called &#8220;EXIT campaign&#8221;, 
which was broadcasted in newspapers, on the television and on the Internet and widely 
disseminated among young people. 
</p>
<p>45. Civil society organizations reported that, while in 2004 and 2005 there was 
considerable media coverage about human trafficking, this has decreased and awareness-
raising efforts are at present minimal. In addition, there is no legislation that sets out clear 
obligations on the prevention of trafficking. Civil society organizations feel much more 
should be done to protect vulnerable persons and wish to work together with the 
Government on prevention and joint awareness-raising programmes. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Identification, protection and assistance to victims of trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Identification 
</b></p>
<p>46. Since 2005, the Police and the Immigration Bureau are the authorities in charge of 
officially identifying victims of trafficking. Following identification, victims are entitled to 
specific protection and assistance. Therefore, identification is a crucial step for the 
protection of victims. 
</p>
<p>47. The National Police Agency is in charge of coordinating action and formulating 
policies and standard operating procedures on action to be taken when encountering a 
trafficking case, while the Prefectural Police is in charge of taking action on the ground. 
The Agency indicated that general training on trafficking in persons is included in the 
Police Academy curriculum and career training, and that each prefecture has some officers 
dedicated to human trafficking who receive training every one or two years. However, 
when asked about written documentation on the subject, the Special Rapporteur was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-13288 
</p>
<p>informed that no specific standard procedure or written training material on human 
trafficking exists within the police. However, IOM Tokyo indicated that it has distributed 
the <i>IOM Handbook on Direct Assistance to Victims of Trafficking</i> to both central and 
prefectural police offices across the country.7 
</p>
<p>48. When asked about the scope of the definition of trafficking, the police explained that 
it has a broad interpretation, which includes deception and recruitment. However, police 
officers on the ground encounter difficulties in identifying victims. They felt the definition 
needs to be improved. 
</p>
<p>49. Other interlocutors explained that, in practice, sexual work is seen as a condition to 
being identified as a victim. Labour exploitation has not been so far considered as a basis 
for identifying victims of trafficking. In fact, no trainee or technical intern has been 
identified as such. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provided statistics on the 
inspections of companies receiving trainees and technical interns that were carried out in 
2007 by the Labour Inspectorate. Of the 2,633 companies inspected (which were targeted 
for being suspicious), 1,907 were found to have some illegal conduct: 910 for violation of 
working hours, 444 for unpaid or delayed payment of salary, 704 for unpaid overtime, 375 
for not issuing a proper contract, 221 for improper dormitory conditions, 210 for not 
respecting the minimum wage and 743 for violating the health and safety regulations. 
However, no victim of trafficking was identified, since this is not the direct prerogative of 
labour inspectors. 
</p>
<p>50. The Immigration Bureau is also in charge of identifying victims of trafficking. 
However, this office does not have published or written internal guidelines on the 
identification of victims. It sometimes relies on IOM for the identification assessment, 
based on an agreement between the two entities. Following an established interview form, 
IOM interviews victims within 48 hours of their referral and, upon obtaining an informed 
consent from the victims, shares its decision on whether the person is a victim of trafficking 
with the Immigration Bureau, which then takes its decision. 
</p>
<p>51. Proper identification is also fundamental within the court system, in order not to 
criminalize victims and place them in double jeopardy. However, the lack of knowledge of 
prosecutors and judges on identification of victims is a real concern, since some victims are 
misidentified and end up being criminalized. For example, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed about a case in December 2008 where the public prosecutor pressed charges 
against a woman from the Philippines who had been identified as a victim of trafficking 
both by the police and IOM. The judge gave a guilty verdict. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Protection 
</b></p>
<p>52. Once identified, victims of trafficking are directed to a WCO, the local government 
offices in charge of assisting women in difficulty and that run shelters. WCOs mainly assist 
women victims of domestic violence, but since the adoption of the action plan, they are also 
in charge of temporarily protecting victims of trafficking. These centres provide the first 
protection to victims, a place where they can sleep and stay without fear. 
</p>
<p>53. In many cases, victims are afraid of going to the police, although the situation has 
improved since trafficking was established as a crime. Victims are less afraid and it is 
easier for them to be identified as victims. Despite this positive development, many victims 
prefer to go to NGOs, IOM, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) or the Japanese Association for Refugees, which organizations 
would then refer victims to private shelters.

 Geneva, International Organization for Migration, 2007. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13288 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>54. According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 261 victims of trafficking 
(all female) were provided with protection between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2009: 255 
by WCOs and 6 by child guidance centres. The Special Rapporteur is particularly 
concerned by the extremely low number of victims of trafficking identified and protected in 
Japan, in comparison with comparable industrialized countries.8 These numbers do not 
seem to reflect the reality of human trafficking in Japan and raise questions as to the 
effectiveness of the rescue and protection measures implemented by the Government. 
</p>
<p>55. The average age of victims was 25 years. Filipino, Indonesian and Thai nationals 
accounted for 88 per cent of the total number of victims. Of the 261 victims, 90 were hosted 
by shelters other than WCOs. Lastly, the average length of stay at a WCO is about 30 days. 
In the case of a foreign victim, embassies are alerted so that they can provide assistance, as 
may be required. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that there is no hotline for victims of 
trafficking, where they could call any time and report their case in different languages. This 
is a serious concern in terms of lack of access to protection for victims. The National Police 
Agency has a general police assistance line, which has limited knowledge concerning 
trafficking. According to some stakeholders, the line is answered only in Japanese and no 
effective action follows calls. However, the Government insists that it takes the necessary 
action to investigate reported cases and protect victims. Some private shelters have 
established hotlines, and some of them are available 24 hours a day in different languages, 
particularly Chinese, Filipino and Thai. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Assistance 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is in charge of providing assistance to 
victims of trafficking, principally through WCOs across the country. Civil society 
organizations and IOM also provide services to victims. In particular, IOM assistance 
includes: an initial victim identification interview; referral to various stakeholders, 
including shelters; legal assistance through a dedicated lawyer; referral to medical 
institutions; and provision of individual, culturally-sensitive counselling in a number of 
languages. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Shelters 
</i>58. In Nagoya, the Special Rapporteur visited the Nagoya Centre for Women, a WCO. 
The population of the Aichi prefecture is around 7 million people, and this is the only 
public shelter for that area. There are seven WCO branch offices in the prefecture, but they 
only provide counselling. According to the centre&#8217;s staff, the centre is inadequate, since it 
can host only 20 people at a time. Victims may stay up to two weeks, although this period 
can sometimes be extended. The longest stay was for 116 days. Since the shelter cannot 
accommodate all requests, it commissions other places to provide shelter services. Minors 
may be sent to a child consultation centre. 
</p>
<p>59. In 2007, of the 256 women who stayed in the centre, 4 were victims of trafficking. 
In 2008, of 330, 4 were victims of trafficking. The centre has a call line open from 9 a.m. to 
9 p.m. At night, the office phone line is also open and records messages, although in an

<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 In Italy, 54,559 victims were identified and provided assistance between March 2000 and April 2007 
</p>
<p>(see report from the Inter-ministerial Commission on Trafficking, available from 
www.pariopportunita.gov.it/images/stories/documenti_vari/UserFiles/Il_Dipartimento/Art_18_aggior
nato.pdf). In the United Kingdom, 347 victims were identified between April and September 2009 
(see United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre data at http://www.ukhtc.org/about-
ukhtc#Statistical). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4

</p>
<p>emergency, the staff take the call and report to the police so that they may rescue the victim 
and bring them to the centre. 
</p>
<p>60. The services provided include interpreters on call, counselling by three psychosocial 
experts and a legal attorney (in Japanese only), and referral to health facilities when 
required. Staff at the centre consider that domestic violence and trafficked victims have 
entirely different needs, more so when the latter are mainly foreigners. In that sense, they 
thought having a centre dedicated solely to victims of trafficking would be the best 
solution. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur also visited one of the two WCOs in Tokyo. From April 
2008 to March 2009, it received 901 women. Seventy per cent were victims of domestic 
violence (15 per cent were foreigners), and 0.2 per cent were victims of trafficking (only 
two cases). In the last six years (2003&#8211;2009), the centre has received 25 victims of 
trafficking; 96 per cent of them returned to their country. 
</p>
<p>62. The centre has a call centre working 24 hours a day that receives around 70 calls per 
day. The facilities include a day nursery, an emergency room, a study room for children and 
a restaurant that adapts to various religious food requirements and other needs. The centre 
also commissions services from nine other facilities in the prefecture. Women stay an 
average of two weeks. 
</p>
<p>63. The concerns expressed by the centre&#8217;s staff mainly related to the lack of 
interpretation services on a daily basis (it is mainly provided for legal issues) and to the fact 
that the personnel is specialized in domestic violence, therefore the psychosocial services 
provided to victims of trafficking are not fully adequate. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur also visited private shelters run by NGOs. They principally 
receive victims of domestic violence, with some victims of trafficking. The majority are 
foreign women, although they receive an increasing number of Japanese women. As 
opposed to WCOs, the private shelters visited had staff who spoke other languages, mainly 
Thai. But they lacked the necessary budget to be able to offer additional assistance, in 
particular medical and psychological assistance. 
</p>
<p>65. The stay of victims in these centres is paid for by the Government social services 
once they have been identified as victims of trafficking by the authorities and sent to these 
shelters. In an emergency, victims are admitted to the centre immediately and their case is 
then referred to the authorities for approval. 
</p>
<p>66. Throughout the visit, the Special Rapporteur observed that WCOs are rarely seen as 
a point of reference for victims of trafficking for several reasons: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lack of language skills and culture-sensitivity: as staff members speak only 
Japanese, foreign victims end up leaving since they feel isolated and cannot engage 
with the staff in order to receive proper assistance. Some shelters provide only 
Japanese food. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Medical costs: some victims have sexually transmitted infections including 
HIV/AIDS. WCOs provide basic medical support. For other medical needs, victims 
of trafficking are allowed to go to hospital at a reduced cost; however, they have no 
money to pay for medical treatment &#8212; and more generally for livelihood sustenance 
&#8212; and end up leaving Japan. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lack of training: since WCOs mainly receive victims of domestic violence, their 
staff members are not appropriately trained to respond to the needs of trafficked 
persons. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Isolation: since the vast majority of women have very different problems, victims of 
trafficking feel isolated. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13288 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Short length of stay: victims of trafficking are generally traumatized by the 
psychological and physical abuses they have suffered. Their self-esteem is extremely 
low. Their health is precarious. Medical and psychological assistance should be 
envisaged for a longer term. An average of one month&#8217;s assistance is not 
appropriate. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lack of rehabilitation or recovering services: shelters are not envisaged as places 
that can offer comprehensive services, where victims can have access to training 
activities in order to reintegrate into the Japanese society, if they so wish. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Exclusion of men: there is no shelter taking men and no assistance is envisaged for 
men. 
</p>
<p>67. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur observed a lack of clarity on assistance provided to 
trafficked children. Concerning girls, they should not be sent to WCOs, but to child 
guidance centres. However, that does not always happen, since there appears to be 
reluctance to take sexually abused children.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Rehabilitation (recovery) and reintegration 
</i>68. The plan of action does not include rehabilitation and reintegration services for 
victims. This is one of the biggest lacunae in the assistance framework. WCOs do not offer 
victims the possibility to learn skills and/or undertake activities that could enable them to 
reintegrate into society. In WCOs, victims of trafficking are left to their own devices and 
there is nothing to do for them. They have no money, are not allowed to work under the 
temporary permit granted to them and cannot learn any skill. They are in a limbo where 
they cannot take any steps to resolve their situation. 
</p>
<p>69. This concern has also been recently reiterated by the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women, which indicated that it &#8220;remains concerned about the 
persistence of trafficking in women and girls, the exploitation of prostitution, and the lack 
of measures aimed at rehabilitating women victims of trafficking&#8221;.9 Owing to the lack of 
rehabilitation, some victims leave WCOs and fall back into the trafficking circle. Others 
accept to be repatriated even if they may face reprisals once back in their country or risk 
being re-trafficked. 
</p>
<p>70. The Cabinet Office informed the Special Rapporteur that it is in the process of 
implementing programmes to help victims of domestic violence to find a job through 
collaboration with private companies. However, these rehabilitation/recovery programmes 
are not extended to victims of trafficking. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare also 
indicated that victims of trafficking who have a proper residence permit that allows them to 
work can access labour employment assistance and vocational training. However, women 
who do not have a proper permit are not included therein. 
</p>
<p>71. According to current government policy, assistance for the reintegration of victims 
is provided only when they are back in their own countries, through the financing of 
reintegration programmes, implemented mainly by IOM and the International Labour 
Organization. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Special residence permit and return 
</i>72. According to the amendment introduced in the Immigration Control and Refugee 
Recognition Act, a special residence permit can be given to victims of trafficking &#8220;for the 
purpose of protection, or for the prosecution of those responsible of procuring, providing or

</p>
<p>possessing a fraudulent Japanese passport&#8221;. According to that amendment, traffickers are 
subject to landing refusal and deportation, while victims of trafficking can be granted a 
special permission for temporary stay. The Immigration Bureau explained that, concerning 
the return of victims, they do consider whether the victim would be at risk in case of return 
to his or her country of origin and provide the option to continue staying in Japan if the 
victim so wishes. 
</p>
<p>73. This amendment is a welcome step that enhances the protection of victims. 
However, the kind of permit provided does not allow victims of trafficking to work, which 
makes their stay practically unfeasible. Also, no clear data were available on how many 
victims were granted such a permit and for how long. The Cabinet reported that this kind of 
permit has been given for one, three or six months, but that most victims have chosen to 
return to their countries of origin. Immigration officials indicated that there is no specific 
category of permits for victims of trafficking: depending on the interview and the case, 
different types of short-term permit are given. Another criterion considered in deciding 
which permit can be granted is whether the victim can earn a living in Japan. Participation 
in judicial proceedings is not a condition to being granted a permit; however, victims who 
decide to participate in proceedings are granted a permit for the duration of the proceedings. 
</p>
<p>74. A number of interlocutors from international organizations and civil society 
indicated that, in practice, the return of victims is still the rule. The Special Rapporteur 
believes that the main reasons for this are: the lack of proper identification of victims of 
trafficking, who are thus returned as undocumented migrants; the lack of appropriate 
assistance and rehabilitation programmes in Japan; and the lack of authorization to work 
under the permit they are eventually granted. 
</p>
<p>75. In 2007, the Committee on Torture expressed concern in relation to &#8220;victims of 
trafficking being treated as illegal immigrants and deported without redress or remedy&#8221;.10 In 
the light of this concern, the Special Rapporteur visited a detention centre for 
undocumented migrants in Tokyo. The centre visited had 600 detainees, of which 200 were 
women. The centre has detainees of 40 nationalities: 24 per cent are Chinese, 21 per cent 
Filipinos and 8 per cent Thai. The rest are mainly Asians, along with some Africans and 
Eastern Europeans. Women and men are detained on separate floors. Most of them have 
overstayed after the expiration of their residence permit and are detained pending the 
finalization of the deportation process. The average length of stay is 17 days. 
</p>
<p>76. During the visit to the detention centre, the Special Rapporteur was not given access 
to detainees, despite her requests. She saw the detainees&#8217; rooms, but was not allowed to 
speak to any of them. To her disappointment, she was therefore not in a position to verify 
the following information. The centre&#8217;s authorities indicated that they assess during the first 
interview whether some of the detainees could be victims of trafficking, while no 
identification assessment is done by any external entity. Detainees can use public phones 
with prepaid cards to contact any external person or entity they wish. They are not informed 
at the outset of their right to ask for legal aid, but if they so request, they are given access to 
free legal aid, limited to the deportation procedure. When necessary, outside interpreters are 
called in. 
</p>
<p>77. Children are temporarily released, together with their parents, until the time they are 
eventually deported. A new amendment to the Immigration Act that should enter into force 
in 2012 will allow undocumented migrants with children to stay in Japan when certain 
specific conditions are met.

 Concluding observations on Japan (CAT/C/JPN/CO/1), 3 August 2007, para. 25. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13288 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>78. According to information received by UNHCR, no victims of trafficking have been 
granted asylum or long-term residence permits on the basis of humanitarian considerations. 
</p>
<p>79. IOM is the main organization in charge of assisting the authorities and victims in 
organizing their return. The scope of IOM activities includes pre-return risk assessment, 
assisted legal return to countries of origin (including document arrangements and escort for 
minors or vulnerable victims) and reintegration activities in their country of origin through 
cooperation with government agencies and NGOs. IOM offices in countries of origin also 
assist in assessing whether victims can safely return to their villages. Post-return assistance 
also includes shelter services, legal aid, economic/social reintegration and empowerment of 
victims. 
</p>
<p>80. In the experience of IOM, the vast majority of victims of trafficking wish to return 
quickly to their countries, because of the traumatic experience they have had in Japan. A 
few victims wish to stay, mainly because they fear returning or have no means to survive. 
IOM mentioned the case of a woman who chose to stay. She was granted an unconditional 
permit within a couple of days. In her case, the permit was extended three times and she 
had been in Japan for nearly two years. However, as a victim of trafficking she cannot 
work. She receives safe accommodation, meals, legal and medical assistance, but she has 
no possibility of accessing rehabilitation activities or employment opportunities, in order to 
reintegrate into Japanese society. Without money and permission to work, her life is very 
hard, with no prospects for the future. For this reason, few victims choose to stay in Japan. 
In the view of IOM, if rehabilitation programmes existed in Japan, victims would be more 
inclined to stay in order to recover, have a proper reflection period, rehabilitate, reintegrate 
into society and cooperate in the prosecution of traffickers. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Prosecution of cases of trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Prosecuting and punishing traffickers 
</b></p>
<p>81. According to Tokyo&#8217;s Metropolitan Police, the Yakuza (Boryokudan), the Japanese 
mafia, is mostly responsible for human trafficking. The Yakuza uses big tuna fishing boats 
that stop in various ports to traffic arms and human beings. The police and the Immigration 
Bureau are trying to address this problem. 
</p>
<p>82. According to the National Police Agency,11 the number of arrests related to 
trafficking cases since 2005 is as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 2005: 83 persons arrested, of which 26 were traffickers; 117 victims 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 2006: 78 persons arrested, of which 24 were traffickers; 58 victims 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 2007: 41 persons arrested, of which 11 were traffickers; 43 victims 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 2008: 33 persons arrested, of which 7 were traffickers; 36 victims (2 Japanese and 
34 foreigners) 
</p>
<p>83. Of these cases, perpetrators were indicted for the crime of trafficking by the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in 39 cases. Thirty-one persons were sentenced in first instance, of 
whom 20 were sentenced without a stay of execution. 
</p>
<p>84. The number of traffickers arrested (68) and sentenced (31) in the last four years has 
been very low. The Special Rapporteur considers that this may be linked to the fact that, in 
</p>

 National Police Agency press release of 5 February 2009. Available from http://www.npa.go.jp/

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> GE.10-13288 
</p>
<p>the majority of cases, victims are returned to their countries of origin within a very short 
space of time. As a consequence, the majority of the victims do not offer their assistance in 
the prosecution of traffickers and a considerable amount of information on traffickers 
operating in Japan is getting lost. This is a serious obstacle in the fight against traffickers. It 
feeds impunity, which in turn encourages criminals to continue operating in the human 
trafficking business, and therefore severely undermines all efforts being undertaken by 
government and non-governmental actors to fight human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>85. Lastly, several stakeholders reported that prosecutors and judges lacked the capacity 
to deal with the problem of human trafficking. It was suggested that appropriate training 
could be delivered by the National Judicial Institute. Training efforts by the Government in 
this regard are clearly insufficient. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies and compensation for victims 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Ministry of Justice indicated that the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office provides protection to 
victims of trafficking who cooperate in judicial proceedings, which includes psychological 
counselling and escorts if they have any fear linked to attending court or being a witness. A 
psychologist can accompany them into court and a screen to separate witnesses and 
offenders can be installed, if the victim so wishes. Nevertheless, other organizations who 
assist victims of trafficking in judicial proceedings have indicated that their experience was 
that such protective measures were not in place. On the contrary, they reported that there 
have been instances where prosecutors threatened victims of trafficking with arrest and 
imprisonment if they were not forthcoming in providing testimonies. 
</p>
<p>87. Victims who have no financial means are, in principle, entitled to legal 
representation free of charge, but this has often not been the case. The Bar Association and 
some NGOs provide legal assistance to victims. In addition, IOM facilitates a victim 
notification procedure, keeping victims who have returned to their countries informed of 
the developments of judicial proceedings. 
</p><p>88. In relation to the forms of compensation available to victims of trafficking, the 
Ministry of Justice indicated that victims can file a case to seek compensation and damages 
under a 2008 amendment to the Criminal Victim&#8217;s Law. However, no figures have been 
made available to the Special Rapporteur on cases where victims of trafficking would have 
received compensation. According to the information received, no victim has received 
compensation through this avenue yet, but only through settlements outside the court. Some 
of the reasons could be the lack of knowledge on the part of the judges, prosecutors and 
lawyers of legal remedies that can be sought for victims and an unwillingness to seek them, 
as well as the difficulty of identifying perpetrators and, therefore, the impossibility of 
accessing their money and possessions to compensate victims. In that regard, the Special 
Rapporteur noted that there is currently no compensation fund for victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Cooperation with civil society 
</b></p>
<p>89. A number of NGOs working on trafficking issues gather under the umbrella of the 
Japan Network Against Trafficking in Persons, a network of individuals and NGOs 
established in 2003. 
</p>
<p>90. In Nagoya, the Special Rapporteur saw the important work done by a civil society 
organization based in the red light district supporting migrant workers and victims of 
trafficking, mainly from the Philippines, but also from other Asian and non-Asian 
countries. Their work chiefly consists of assisting victims who call or come to their centre, 
liaising with IOM regarding its identification procedure, giving counselling and referring 
victims to a shelter, and working with IOM to organize the return of those who wish to go </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4

</b></p>
<p>back home. They also succeeded in working closely with the prefectural authorities to 
organize information campaigns and liaise with countries of origin on prevention. 
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur observed that the level of cooperation between the 
Government and civil society is still relatively weak. Most NGOs were of the view that 
they had both expertise and grass-roots experience and that the Government could be more 
receptive to cooperating with them. Some indicated that they cooperated with prefectural 
governments. Many indicated that their work to help victims of trafficking might not be 
sustainable in the long term because of limited public funding options. 
</p>
<p><b> F. International, regional and bilateral cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>92. International, regional and bilateral cooperation is essential for an effective action to 
combat trafficking in human beings. In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported 
various international cooperation activities the Government had promoted in the fight 
against human trafficking. At the bilateral level, the Government has dispatched inter-
ministerial delegations to a number of countries to discuss the issue of trafficking in 
persons. Japan has a joint cooperation procedure with the Government of Thailand, called 
the Joint Task Force on Counter Trafficking in Persons, which met in 2006 and 2007. It 
includes police and immigration officers and aims at strengthening cooperation on 
prevention, law enforcement and protection. Standard operating procedures for cooperation 
with Thailand are being finalized. However, Japan has no bilateral agreement as such in the 
area of anti-trafficking. 
</p>
<p>93. At the regional level, Japan participates in the Bali Process on People Smuggling, 
Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, a consultative mechanism that 
brings participants together to work on practical anti-trafficking measures. Japan supports 
this process, including by financing the website of the Bali process. 
</p>
<p>94. At the international level, Japan participates actively in international forums 
advocating strong efforts to fight human trafficking. It also contributes to funding IOM and 
cooperates with it, in particular on the safe return of victims of trafficking. Japan also funds 
technical cooperation projects through various United Nations agencies and programmes, 
for example, it provided funding to UNICEF for a project on awareness-raising and 
prevention of girl trafficking in the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic in 2003 and the 
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for art therapy projects for the recovery of 
victims of trafficking in Thailand in 2006 and 2007. 
</p>
<p>95. Japan also finances projects with several countries in South-East Asia and Central 
Asia through the United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security established at the initiative 
of Japan, including on economic and social empowerment of returned victims of trafficking 
(Thailand and Philippines, 2006). Finally, the Japanese police shares information 
internationally by providing data to the International Criminal Police Organization 
(Interpol). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The Government of Japan, in recognition of the seriousness of the human 
trafficking problem, has taken measures to address it, in particular since 2004 with 
the adoption of a National Plan of Action on Measures to Combat Trafficking in 
Persons, the introduction of the crime of trafficking into the Penal Code in 2005 and </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-13288 
</p>
<p><b>the adoption of other legislative amendments. Victims in some cases have been 
granted the right to a special residence permit if they wish to stay in Japan. The 
Special Rapporteur also recognizes the efforts undertaken by the Government to 
cooperate with sending countries to support the reintegration of victims in their home 
countries and the Bali Process. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> Notwithstanding the considerable progress made by the Government in order 
to tackle this phenomenon, there are challenges that it must address in order to 
effectively combat trafficking in human beings occurring within its borders and 
affecting both its citizens and foreign nationals. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> In the light of the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur addresses the following 
recommendations to Japan. 
</b>99.<b> Japan should urgently ratify: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and 
the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children, supplementing that Convention 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
to the Convention against Torture and to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> Japan should adopt a clear definition of trafficking which includes all elements 
of the Palermo Protocol definition, and prepare written informative material and 
standard operating procedures which will allow all enforcement officials to have a 
clear understanding of when a person should be considered and identified as a victim 
of trafficking. In this regard, it should be made clear that trafficking also occurs for 
labour exploitation and affects men and boys. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Japan should strengthen the penalties for the crime of trafficking in persons, in 
particular with regard to the minimum duration of imprisonment. 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> Japan should adopt new legislation on the protection of victims of trafficking 
with a holistic approach, that would provide for comprehensive assistance to victims 
of trafficking through specialized shelters and assistance, including: psychological, 
medical, social assistance to be provided in the native languages of victims of 
trafficking; legal assistance to seek redress through judicial authorities; rehabilitation 
(recovering) programmes for victims to learn skills and be able to reintegrate into 
Japanese society; the possibility to assist victims for longer periods and grant longer 
residence permits with work permits; and appropriate budget to be allocated for these 
purposes. 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> The Act against Child Prostitution and Child Pornography should be amended 
to criminalize the possession of child pornography. There should be zero tolerance for 
child pornography and child prostitution, including the <i>enjo kosai</i> phenomenon. 
</b>104.<b> Concerning the Trainees and Technical Interns Programme, the Government 
should: </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13288 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Take full responsibility for the programme and its monitoring. Since JITCO is 
not playing an effective monitoring role, an independent body with no 
connection to the participating companies should be given direct responsibility 
to closely supervise companies participating in the programme and ensure the 
full respect of the rights of trainees and technical interns, including their right 
to appropriate wages and working hours, freedom of movement, privacy, 
health coverage, decent housing conditions and access to an interpreter. For 
that purpose, labour inspections should be significantly strengthened to closely 
monitor the correct implementation of the programme, in line with the 
concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women requesting the Government &#8220;to continue to monitor the 
issuance of visas for internship and trainee programmes closely&#8221;.</b>12<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Adopt a law to better regulate the programme, which would include more 
effective guarantees for the rights of trainees and interns outlined under the 
previous paragraph, as well as avenues for redress. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish a hotline and an office to report abuses under this programme. 
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> When revising the action plan and adopting any relevant legislative 
amendment, Japan should make use of the Principles and Guidelines on Human 
Rights and Human Trafficking as a reference, since these offer guidance on how to 
include a human rights-based approach in the combat against trafficking in persons. 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> Japan should establish a national rapporteur office or a coordination agency 
that will be solely dedicated to promoting, coordinating and monitoring policies and 
actions related to the fight against human trafficking, on a permanent basis, in 
cooperation with international organizations, civil society and other relevant 
stakeholders. The current Inter-ministerial Liaison Committee is not sufficient, as it is 
not a body with a secretariat that deals exclusively with anti-trafficking activities. 
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> Clear identification procedures should be set out and shared with all actors, in 
order to avoid victims of trafficking not being identified and/or incorrectly identified 
and thus being treated as undocumented migrants and deported without redress or 
remedy. Specialized training should be provided to law enforcement officials in this 
regard. 
</b></p>
<p>108.<b> Japan should establish regional and specialized shelters exclusively for victims 
of trafficking that would provide specific assistance to victims of trafficking, as well as 
sufficient time for a reflection period and rehabilitation if the person chooses to stay. 
</b></p>
<p>109.<b> Japan should establish a 24-hour multilingual hotline with staff trained on 
trafficking, as well as a clear referral mechanism within the country, which should 
include all government and non-governmental stakeholders and should ensure timely 
referral of victims to relevant entities. 
</b></p>
<p>110.<b> Free legal aid should be guaranteed to victims of trafficking who do not have 
sufficient financial resources. 
</b></p>
<p>111.<b> Trafficking in men and boys should be included in the action plan and in the 
legislation on human trafficking, in order to comprehensively address this 
phenomenon.

</p>
<p>112.<b> Despite the decreased use of entertainment visas, the Government should 
continue inspections and investigations in this sector, where trafficking, in particular 
of women and girls, continues to occur. 
</b></p>
<p>113.<b> Full implementation of the right of victims to obtain compensation should be 
ensured. The setting up of a fund for compensation of victims is recommended. 
</b></p>
<p>114.<b> Prevention and awareness-raising efforts should be considerably increased and 
should focus on both informing potential victims and educating potential 
perpetrators, including men who could be potential clients of trafficked persons in the 
sexual exploitation sector. This could be carried out jointly with civil society 
organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>115.<b> Criteria and conditions for granting permits to stay to victims of trafficking 
should be clear and applied systematically, not on an ad hoc basis. In order to allow 
victims to recover psychologically, feel socially integrated and prevent them from 
being re-trafficked, they should be allowed to reside for a longer time and work 
and/or study. To that effect, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare should 
establish rehabilitation programmes to allow victims to acquire skills that may enable 
them to integrate into society and stay and work in the country, if they so wish.</b>13<b> For 
example, existing programmes to help victims of domestic violence to find a job 
through collaboration with private companies could be extended to and adapted for 
victims of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>116.<b> Efforts should be intensified to eliminate all forms of violence against women 
and girls, in particular domestic violence, and bring perpetrators to account. The 
hotline for domestic violence should be answered in the main foreign languages 
spoken in Japan. The law should be revised to make domestic violence an offence to be 
prosecuted automatically and not subject to the victim&#8217;s complaint. Also, efforts 
should be made to allow victims of domestic violence to remain at home with their 
children, instead of the current practice whereby the men remain in the home and 
women are moved with their children to a shelter. 
</b></p>
<p>117.<b> In view of the serious lack of knowledge on the rights of victims of human 
trafficking, specialized mandatory training should be established to provide the 
necessary skills to law enforcement officers &#8212; in particular Immigration Bureau 
officials, judges, prosecutors and labour inspectors &#8212; on how to deal with victims of 
trafficking as well as prosecute and punish traffickers. Such training should include 
the acquisition of skills on identification and protection of victims and on the 
implementation of their right to an effective judicial remedy. Service providers, such 
as health-care workers, should also receive specialized training on human trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>118.<b> Improved partnership between the Government and NGOs and support for the 
work of NGOs that provide services to victims of trafficking should be urgently 
pursued. NGOs should also be involved in the implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation of the national action plan. 
</b></p>
<p>119.<b> Japan should seriously consider the adoption of bilateral agreements with 
source countries to tackle the human trafficking problem on a long-term basis, 
including by addressing the root causes of trafficking such as poverty, unemployment, 
undereducation and gender inequalities. Bilateral agreements should at the minimum 
include the following:
