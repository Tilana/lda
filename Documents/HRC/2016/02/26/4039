<p><b>  17/&#8230; Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
 or arbitrary executions 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which guarantees the right to 
life, liberty and security of person, and the relevant provisions of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Having regard </i>to the legal framework of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, including the provisions contained in 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1992/72 of 5 March 1992 and General Assembly 
resolution 47/136 of 18 December 1992,  
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the universal ratification of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, 
which alongside human rights law provide an important framework of accountability in 
relation to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
2006,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto,  
</p>
<p><i> Mindful </i>of all relevant General Assembly and Commission on Human Rights 
resolutions on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in particular Commission 
resolution 2004/37 of 19 April 2004, Human Rights Council resolution 8/3 of 18 June 
2008,  and Assembly resolutions 61/173 of 19 December 2006 and 65/208 of 21 December 
2010, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>that extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions are crimes under 
the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,  
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>of the need for effective action to combat and to eliminate the abhorrent 
practice of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, which represent a flagrant 
violation of the inherent right to life,  
</p>
<p><i> Dismayed </i>that, in a number of countries, impunity, the negation of justice, continues 
to prevail and often remains the main cause of the continued occurrence of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly condemns once again </i>all extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, in all their forms, that continue to take place throughout the world;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Acknowledges </i>the importance of relevant special procedures of the Human 
Rights Council, in particular the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, in their key role as early warning mechanisms in preventing the crime of 
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and encourages the relevant special 
procedures, within their mandates, to cooperate towards this end;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Demands </i>that all States ensure that the practice of extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions is brought to an end and that they take effective action to combat and 
eliminate the phenomenon in all its forms;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates</i> the obligation of all States to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to 
identify and bring to justice those responsible, while ensuring the right of every person to a 
fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by 
law, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their 
families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order 
to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such executions, as stated in 
the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions,1 and the proposed entry points, strategies and recommendations 
therein, and takes note of the recommendations made in previous years, and invites States 
to give them due consideration;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Commends </i>the important role that the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions plays towards eliminating extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions and encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue, within the 
framework of his or her mandate, to collect information from all concerned, to respond 
effectively to information that comes before him or her, to follow up on communications 
and country visits and to seek the views and comments of Governments and to reflect them, 
as appropriate, in the elaboration of his or her reports;  
</p>

<p> 7. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur, in carrying out his or her mandate:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To continue to examine situations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions in all circumstances and for whatever reason, and to submit his or her findings 
on an annual basis, together with conclusions and recommendations, to the Human Rights 
Council and the General Assembly, and to draw the attention of the Council to serious 
situations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions that warrant immediate 
attention or where early action might prevent further deterioration;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To continue to draw the attention of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to serious situations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
that warrant immediate attention or where early action might prevent further deterioration;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To respond effectively to information that comes before him or her, in 
particular when an extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution is imminent or threatened 
or when such an execution has occurred;  
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To enhance further his or her dialogue with Governments, as well as to 
follow up on recommendations made in reports after visits to particular countries;  
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To continue to monitor the implementation of existing international standards 
on safeguards and restrictions relating to the imposition of capital punishment, bearing in 
mind the comments made by the Human Rights Committee in its interpretation of article 6 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the Second Optional 
Protocol thereto;  
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To apply a gender perspective in his or her work;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges </i>States:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his 
or her task, to supply all necessary information requested by him or her and to react 
appropriately and expeditiously to his or her urgent appeals, and those Governments that 
have not yet responded to communications transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur to 
answer without further delay;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To give serious consideration to responding favourably to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s requests to visit their countries;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To ensure appropriate follow-up to the recommendations and conclusions of 
the Special Rapporteur, including by providing information to the Special Rapporteur on 
the actions taken on those recommendations;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Welcomes </i>the cooperation established between the Special Rapporteur and 
other United Nations mechanisms and procedures in the field of human rights, and 
encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue efforts in that regard;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with 
adequate human, financial and material resources in order to enable him or her to carry out 
the mandate effectively, including through country visits;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Decides </i>to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions for three years;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also decides </i>to continue to consider this matter in conformity with its 
programme of work.
