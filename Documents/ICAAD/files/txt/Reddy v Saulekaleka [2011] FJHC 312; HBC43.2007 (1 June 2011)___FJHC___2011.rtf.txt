The Evidence
 
8.      
The plaintiff called four witnesses. First, the plaintiff himself.

9.      
In his evidence in chief, the plaintiff stated that:-

"        
He was a passenger in vehicle EU 321 which was heading towards Savusavu. 

"        
The driver of EU 321 was Mr. Vinal Vasram. 

"        
He was sitting at the back seat behind the driver.

"        
EU 321 was being driven normally because there was no reason to rush. 

"        
At Qelewaqa, there was a bus parked on their left hand side of the road. The parked bus could be seen. At the front of the parked bus, was parked a vehicle registration number DT 964 driven by the 1st defendant and owned by the Land Transport Authority ("LTA"). 

"        
DT 964 could not be seen from behind the bus. As EU 321 approached the bus, the LTA vehicle made a straight turn across the road, wanting to make a U-Turn. The first time DT 964 could be seen was when EU 321 approached the bus or came behind the bus. The driver of EU 321 tooted the horn and applied the brakes but it was too late. DT 964 did not stop and the two vehicles collided. He could hear the brake sound. The front portion of EU 321 hit the driver's side of DT 694 and the two doors got damaged. 

"        
He saw the collision and subsequently fainted. He received injuries in the chest and the right hand. He is a right handed person. His seat belt was on and he was in so much pain, he could not get out of the vehicle. His boss Mahendra Kumar who was in the vehicle and the driver helped him out of the vehicle. He fainted due to the pain. 

"        
At the hump in Wailevu, he regained consciousness and knew that he was being taken to the hospital. The driver touched his chest. His hand was painful. He fainted again. 

"        
He regained conscious at the Labasa Hospital at the Intensive Care Unit ("ICU"). There he saw that the doctor was extracting blood. At that time, he could not move his body due to pain. His hand was swollen and had blood clots. The doctor admitted him and undertook an X-Ray. He was put on drips. 

"        
He was in the hospital for 3 days. He was treated for both the hand and the chest injuries. Because of the immense pain, he was given painkillers. He has never endured that kind of pain before. After painkiller injection was given, he would go off to sleep. After he woke up, he had the same pain. 

"        
He was told that his elbow was smashed and that there was no movement. A POP plaster was put on his injured hand and he was told that he would be sent to Suva. 

"        
The Labasa Hospital arranged for his travel to Suva. He went to Suva after two weeks. He paid his fare and his hand was still in immense pain. The hospital had arranged passage by boat but he preferred to go by air. 

"        
When he reached Suva, he was told that there was no appointment for him at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital ("CWM"). The CWM asked him to wait for two weeks but he could not as he did not have any family in Suva to stay with. 

"        
He came back and reported the matter to Labasa Hospital. On his return, a doctor from overseas had arrived at Labasa Hospital. He was Dr. Loefler who stayed at the hospital for some time and gave him treatment. He was given injection. The doctor also told him that he wanted to operate on him because he could not use his hand below the elbow. The doctor told him to come back to the hospital after 2-3 days and asked him to do slight movements of his hands.

"        
Another X-Ray was taken and the doctor told him that the bone has joined sideways and that if an operation was done, the problem could be fixed. 

"        
He continued the cast in his whole hand for 4 months. When the cast was removed after 4 months, he was in slings for 8 months. 

"        
When in the POP cast, his hand was still very painful. It was itchy and blisters had developed. There was no air passage and he could not scratch inside. He endured great pain. He could not have proper shower, dress and feed himself. He had to take assistance of his mother and brother. When his mother fell ill, he had to hire a boy from the neighbour to assist him and he paid him $25.00 per week. 

"        
After the cast was removed, the pain remained the same, so he was advised to use the sling. The sling remained for 8 months and after the removal of the sling, he could move his shoulder but his elbow movement was restricted. The movement is restricted until now. He therefore always wears a small bandage in his hand because when he moves his hand, his elbow makes a sound and gives pain. There is still pain in the elbow and he gets pain when he sits in the vehicle and when he accidently gets his elbow hit. His small finger and ring finger is still numb and painful. 

"        
On his shoulder is a swell which is painful. 

"        
He does not have a full grip in his right hand. His grip in right hand is weaker than in left hand. 

"        
Dr. Jaogi has examined him and assessed his permanent disability at 20%.

"        
He was working as a salesman and he could not work for 1 year but he was paid full salary.

"        
He is still employed. His job has changed. Before he used to be in sales alone. Now the company has given him an assistant. He is having an assistant from 2006. If any strenuous physical work is required then the assistant helps him out. He only drives and takes the orders. The Suva Office does not know that he works with an assistant and if they know of this, then he could be fired from work. 

"        
He is married with two children. He was 35 years old at the time of the accident. He also used to work on his cane farm, did gardening, raised cows and goats and also had a poultry farm as well. He had started the poultry farm after the marriage. After accident, he gave his 11 goats away to his in-laws. He kept the goats for sale. He used to sell 3-4 goats a year at a price of $100 per goat. The Poultry was for sale as well. He used to buy 24 chicks per month. He would consume 1 or 2 chicken but the rest he would sell it. The sale of chicken was on kilos and he used to sell between the range of $24-$26 per chicken. The cost of rearing a chicken was about $21 and he would make a profit of about $6 per chicken. He also used to sell his vegetable produce in the village for about $30 to $40 per week.

"        
After the accident, he had to give his farm to the brother. He had a share in his cane farm but after the accident he could not work the farm so he gave it away. He used to earn a net income of $1,400 per year from the cane farm and now he cannot get that money. 

"        
He also stopped poultry farming after the accident as he could not maintain working the poultry farm given his injuries. His wife cannot assist as she looks after the children. 

"        
He can drive now but cannot drive long distance. Before he had a manual car but after the accident he had to buy an automatic car.

"        
He has incurred a lot of expenses after the accident. He paid return air fare to Suva in the sum of $265. He paid $60 return fare from Nausori to CWM Hospital. He also paid $32 return fare to Labasa Airport. He also made more than 20 visits to hospital for clinics and the taxi fare would be $4.50 one way. He also spent money in buying medication from the hospital.

"        
There is also change in his personal life. He cannot hold his son. He used to play soccer for his village in local league and now he cannot do that. He used to play Volleyball with his family and now he cannot do that as well. If he plays, his hands shakes and he gets the pain. He wants to be compensated for his injuries.

10.     
Under cross-examination, the plaintiff's material testimony was that:-

"        
On his way to Savusavu, he was sitting relaxed. Everyone in the vehicle did talk at some point in time. The vehicle was being driven normally at 50 kmph. 

"        
The bus was parked infront of a house. He cannot describe the distance from which he saw the bus. The vehicle EU 321 could go past, between the bus and the white mark. He later retracted from his testimony and said that EU 321 had to go past by crossing the white line.

"        
EU 321 drove beside the bus on the middle of the road when the accident happened. He again later changed and said that EU 321 was being driven on the left side of the road.

"        
When the driver of EU 321 applied the brake then he came on the middle of the road. When the brakes were applied, the speed had reduced substantially.

"        
He gave an interview to the police. He was pointed to the contradictions in the police statement which was tendered in evidence as Exhibit 1. His explanation for the contradiction was that he gave the statement when he was in great pain. He maintained that he saw the collision but does not know where the vehicles were stationed after the accident as he had fainted.

"        
The LTA vehicle had tumbled when the collision occurred. When they first saw the LTA vehicle, they were behind the bus. Before the accident, EU 321 was on the left hand side. He does not know whether the vehicle went to the right or the left hand side.

"        
The vehicle could have gone on the right hand side because the driver of EU 321 would have thought to avoid the accident.

"        
He was not in good health but had fainted. Dr. Loefler saw him when he was still in cast. Dr. Loefler had told him that the operation could cause further damage to the bone and so he did not opt for the operation.

"        
He was also seen by Dr. Bhushan Ogale. The cast was still there. He was indeed in cast for 4 months and could not eat even with his left hand. He told Dr. Ogale doctor about the pains he had in his chest and hand and the fingers. Although the report does not mention about fresh complains, he had pain which he complained of.

"        
He was also seen by Dr. Eddie McCaig. He told all the doctors about the pain in his chest, hand and fingers.

"        
His employer Mr. Mahendra Kumar has provided assistance to him. Mr. Mahendra Kumar has authority over all employees. He gave assistance to him with knowledge of his problems. The assistance continues till the date and had been there for the past three years.

"        
The cane farm was in his elder brother's name. There was a will that the cane farm be shared. Three brothers were to share the cane farm. The one brother is a school teacher so he gave his share leaving the two brothers the share in the cane farm. His elder brother cultivates the cane farm now as he cannot. He did not sell his share of cane farm but after accident his brother gave him some money to buy a car. The money was for his share of the land.

"        
He used to work as a salesman for 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week. He used to wake up between 5.30am to 6.00am. He used to reach home after work at 5.30pm. Before the accident he used to go to work in a manual vehicle but after the accident he travels in the automatic car or a taxi. 

"        
Before the accident he used to do cane farming with his brother. Labourers' were hired only for harvesting purposes. 

"        
He has at home his wife and 2 children and his sickly mother. He used to do the poultry farm before and after marriage. He contradicted his earlier statement when he had said that he started poultry farm after marriage. His wife cannot do all that because she is a pre-school teacher and when she comes home she looks after the sickly mother and the children and does the house chores. He later said that his wife and children do not wish to do the dirty work of poultry farming. 

"        
His mother lives with his brothers too but lives with him on a full time basis.

"        
He also used to do gardening and his mother used to advise him but he cannot undertake the job now. 

"        
He does put on the bandage on the hand all the time. He stated that he puts on the bandage to avoid the sound and pain. The doctor also said for him to put the bandage on the hand all the time. He has the bandage on his hand full time. At times he takes it out and when he takes it out he has to take care of his hands.

11.     
Under re-examination the plaintiff testified that he does not work in the weekends as a salesman. The poultry farming only requires feeding in the morning and in the afternoon. He has made a provision for providing water to the fouls. There is a bottle from which the water drips for the chicken to drink. He used to do farm work in the weekends. The LTA vehicle was only 2-3 yards infront of the bus.

12.     
The second witness for the plaintiff was Mr. Mahendra Kumar. In his evidence in chief Mr. Mahendra Kumar stated as follows:-

"        
He was a passenger in Motor Vehicle EU 321 as well which was a "4x4 Hilux Twin Cab".

"        
The driver of EU 321 was also a staff officer. He is now in overseas. 

"        
He was seated in the front of the passenger seat. He had a clear vision infront and the vehicle EU321 was driving at a speed of 50-60 kmph. 

"        
They were heading towards Savusavu. The road is a two way carriage way. At the subject place there was no restriction on overtaking. 

"        
At Oelewaqa stretch/straight road he saw a bus parked. The weather was fine and the road condition was fine as well. 

"        
From a long distance it could be seen whether there was any vehicle coming from the opposite side of the road. The bus was parked on the road, so the EU 321 had to go a little bit on the other side of the road, say about ¾ on the tarseal. The driver of EU 321 slowed down. He almost past the bus, when the driver of LTA vehicle turned suddenly. It turned very fast without any warning. He wanted to go forward and come back and make a U-Turn. He saw the LTA vehicle in a flick of a second. The driver of EU 321 also saw the LTA vehicle suddenly. The LTA Vehicle was parked infront of the bus and it could not be seen.

"        
The driver of EU 321 tried to go on the other side, swerved to avoid the accident, tooted his horn and applied the brakes but the collision took place. The LTA vehicle overturned. 

"        
The EU 321 was being driven at about 50 - 60kmph. It was a 80 kmph zone. The accident could not have been saved by the driver of EU 321. 

"        
He himself surely could not have saved the accident. He has been driving for the last 20-30 years. He got his driver's license in the year 1985.

"        
He and another worker pulled the plaintiff out of the vehicle and put him on the side of the road. He was also hurt because of the seat belt. His eye glasses also broke. He later felt the pain but not at the site of the accident.

"        
He asked the driver of EU 321 whether he was okay. He said he was. The driver was shivering.

"        
The driver of the LTA vehicle came out and went to the nearby residence, washed his face. He called another LTA officer who came and took him away before the police came.

"        
The plaintiff is still working but with an assistant and he could be laid off because sales is not very good and if two people do the job of one sales man then Suva Office may lay off the physically weak employee.

"        
The plaintiff did not attend work for roughly 2-3 months after the accident. He knows that the plaintiff sustained injuries to his hand and that he cannot now lift heavy objects. He was in cast for about 6 months. After the cast he had the bandage and sometimes has slings.

"        
A week before the trial he was in Suva. The sales trend is not very good. The Company is trying to lay people off. The company will lay people off in Labasa too.

"        
He has visited the plaintiff at home before accident. He used to go to his place for religious ceremony and to buy chicken. He used to see 40-50 chicken at the plaintiff's place. After accident he only goes for the religious ceremony. He knows that the plaintiff had a farm, poultry farm and goat farm as well. He has bought chicken and goat from plaintiff before, chicken at $20.00 instead of $25 and goat at $120.

13.     
Under cross examination Mr. Mahendra Kumar stated:-

"        
That during the plaintiff's non-employment, he was paid full wages.

"        
That on each side of the road was a drain. The bus occupied about ¾ of the road. To overtake, one had to go on the other side of the road. 

"        
EU 321 was his vehicle so he told the driver to slow down when he approached the bus. The driver had almost passed the bus when he applied his brakes so he cannot explain the 13m brake marks as indicated by police in the sketch plan. 

"        
After the accident, the LTA vehicle tumbled once. He cannot recall whether it tumbled twice. The EU321 would have hit the van at 60kmph. Then he later changed and said that EU 321 may have hit the LTA vehicle at 40kmph. Subsequently he said he does not know the speed at which the LTA vehicle would have been hit.

"        
When questioned again as to how there was a 13m brake mark, the witness said he does not know about that but the speed was 50-60 kmph before the accident. It was then put to him that if he asked the driver to slowdown, it would mean that he was more than 50-60kmph. The witness then said the driver would have been 70-80kmph before he dropped his speed.

"        
Before approaching the bus, the speed was 70-80kmph and he asked the driver to slow down and he came to 60kmph. The driver of EU 321 was not driving at an excessive speed. There was a driveway infront but the vehicle had turned ahead of the driveway. EU321 ended up near the driveway but the impact had occurred ahead of the driveway. After the impact, the LTA vehicle was near the driveway and it was upside down. Even if the EU321 driver was driving at 20kmph, he could not have avoided the accident. The only difference would have been on the gravity of the impact. He suffered blood clots on his chest. The blood clots do not indicate the speed. That marks on the skin were due to sudden application of the brakes. The LTA vehicle just swung from its place without giving a right indicator and so that is how the accident happened. This was when the driver of EU 321 had almost passed the bus.

"        
The laying off of the employees would be part of a restructure and reorganization plan. 

14.     
The third witness for the plaintiff was Mr. Saten Prasad. His evidence in chief was:-

"        
That he lived in Qelewaqa along Labasa Seaqaqa Highway for the past 12-13 years. His house is beside the road, about 25-30 feet away. On the day of the accident he was near his verandah, close to a tap. The tap is facing the highway. From the tap he has a clear vision of the road. He saw that a LTA vehicle stopped a bus by tooting a horn. The driver of the bus stopped the bus. The bus then stopped on the tarseal but a little bit off the road on the left side. The driver from behind cannot see the LTA vehicle as the bus had covered the LTA vehicle. The left side has a drain as well. The LTA vehicle came and parked infront of the bus. The distance between the LTA Vehicle and the bus was about 5-6 steps away. A lot of people were sitting inside the LTA Vehicle. Some were sitting inside and some were sitting outside. They got off and sat in the bus. The driver of the LTA vehicle did not get out and he did not see him. The place where the bus was parked is a long straight stretch of road and both sides could be seen clearly. He then a saw vehicle EU321 coming towards the bus. When the vehicle EU 321 started overtaking he bus, the LTA vehicle suddenly turned towards his driveway. DT 964 did not move forward at all but turned from the same place. He did not see any indicator of the LTA Vehicle. The EU 321 tooted the horn but the LTA vehicle did not stop. He heard the scratching sound and then the EU 321 collided with DT 964. The LTA vehicle overturned once only and all its four tyres went up.

"        
He attended the accident scene. The LTA driver came out of the vehicle. He looked at the vehicle, checked his vehicle and brushed his hand. After that the driver of the LTA vehicle stayed there. The bus was parked there for some time but was gone before the police arrived.

15.     
Under cross-examination, Mr. Saten Prasad testified that:-

"        
He gave a statement to the police on the day of the accident. He said that he could not tell whether it was his statement until someone read it out to him and that he could not recognize his signature because he did not have his glasses. He had not brought his glasses to court.

"        
His statement was tendered in as evidence being Exhibit 2. He stated that he did give a statement at his home. When police did all the measurements then they took the statement. He had given the statement to a lady police.

"        
The LTA vehicle made a turn towards his driveway and not into his driveway. 

"        
He maintained that the driver did not get out of the vehicle. 

"        
He heard the scratching sound from the EU321 vehicle. The tyre sound had started when EU321 was on the side of the bus. He later changed to say that the tyre sound had started when EU 321 was reaching the bus.

"        
He cannot tell whether the scratching sound was for long or not. He later changed and said that the sound was for a short while and then the accident happened. Accident occurred near his junction which is his driveway. Later he retraced from his testimony and said that accident happened on the middle of the road. When this contradiction was put to him he stated that he cannot be accurate in identifying where the accident happened.

"        
After the accident, the vehicles were on the right side of the road. The front portion of the LTA vehicle was in the drain and the back of it was on the road with all 4 tyres up.

16.     
In his examination in chief Mr. Saten Prasad had stated that at the time of the police interview he had told the police officer that the DT 964 had turned towards the driveway and not into the driveway.

17.     
The plaintiff's fourth witness was a police officer, PC 2171, Mr. Umesh Prasad. In his evidence in chief he stated that:-

"        
He recalled attending the scene of accident in Qelewaqa. The road is called the Labasa-Seaqaqa Highway Open Road. The speed limit in the zone is 80 kmph. Overtaking is permitted on the road where the accident happened. It is a straight road and a driver can have clear vision. This applies to all drivers irrespective of the side they are approaching. A driver can have a clear view of more than 200 meters.

"        
He drew the rough sketch plan of the accident. The original width of the road is 7.5m. Half road would be 3.75 or 3.8m.

"        
The point of impact is on the right hand side from Labasa. The accident happened when the LTA vehicle was making a U-turn and the EU 321 was overtaking. Both vehicles are twin cabs. The LTA vehicle white in colour and the EU 321 green in colour. The length of LTA vehicle is 5m. The front portion of EU321 was damaged. The right side of the LTA vehicle was damaged. He specifically demonstrated that the middle of the right hand side of vehicle DT 964 was damaged. There was a 13m brake mark towards the right hand side. He said that the brake mark demonstrated that the EU321 tried to avoid the collision when he applied the brakes. 

"        
After making the sketch plan, he handed over the sketch plan to the investigating officer. He is not trained to determine the speed due to brake marks. He has a chart though, which shows that at 60kmph, the brake mark would be 24 m and at 100kmph, the brake marks would be 55m.

18.     
Under cross-examination, the police officer stated that:-

"        
That the chart he referred to was applicable when the vehicle came to a stop. For vehicles to collide there would be some speed at which a vehicle would be travelling. At the point of impact the speed could be zero. The brake marks were of 13m on the right hand side of the road. He did not draw the fair sketch plan. He does not know who made the fair sketch plan.

"        
There is a difference between the rough and the fair sketch plan. Point D in rough sketch plan is broken glasses and in fair sketch plan is point of impact. He found the glasses ahead of point of impact. He drew the point of impact but cannot tell how the point of impact was arrived at. It has been a long time since. He could have missed writing. Brake marks show that vehicle was on the right. Brake marks are wheel mark of the vehicle. The impact cannot be within the brake marks. He drew the plan as he found it to be.

"        
He then later sated that the point of impact had fallen debris of mud. It was then viciously put to him that he made up the evidence that he drew the point of impact because he saw the mud debris. The officer then replied that he attends a lot of accident and the mud debris is almost there in most accidents. He would have forgotten to write about the mud debris. The collision could have occurred either in the middle of the road or further to the right hand side of the road.

"        
The impact indicates that the driver of LTA vehicle was making a U-Turn. He then later changed and said that he does not know what the LTA driver wanted to do. The approaching vehicle behind the bus should have slowed down and overtake if the way is clear. He cannot determine that EU321 was travelling at a high speed. If EU 321 had exercised caution, the brake marks would have been shorter.

19.     
In re-examination the police officer witness testified that:-

"        
The personal reaction time when a personal travels at 50kmph is 9m. This means that if a person is travelling at 50kmph, he will need a travel distance of 9 m to be able to react.
"        
The rough sketch plan shows the original scene of accident. 
"        
Generally a point of impact is determined by the fallen debris.
"        
He cannot state whether the vehicles had moved after the impact.

20.     
The plaintiff's fifth witness was Dr. Jaoji Vulibeci. He took the court through the report he had made on the 24th day of September, 2007. I will first outline the doctors report in its material part:-

"&The above man was admitted to our ward on 8/10/2005. He had a fractured arm bone sustained at his work place.

Examination and full investigation done showed a supra condyler fracture of his right arm with some intra  articular extension on x-rays. This was treated conservatively and he was discharged on 10/10/2005.

Yenkat was followed up in our clinic and was seen twice by a visiting orthopaedic specialist from Australia. He agreed that no further operation was needed for Yenkat.

Yenkat continues to complain of pain when he works hard and cold weather. Pain which radiates to the shoulder mostly. He also complains of inability to fully flex his elbow and inability to handle heavy good with his right hand. 

Permanent impairment assessment was done on 29/8/2007 and showed the following findings:-

1.      
Elbow joint - Extension 20
-       
Flexion 70
-       
Supination 70
-       
Pronation 80

2.      
Grip strength 30% strength loss index.

Calculation for whole person impairment was done using the "Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment" by the American Medical Association.


	1.      
Elbow join	= (a) Extension of 20	
		= 2% upper extremity impairment [figure 16.34]	
		= 1% whole person impairment [table 16.3]	
			
		(b)Flexion of 70	
		= 15% upper extremity impairment [figure 16.34]	
		= 9% whole person impairment [table 16.3]	
			
		(c) Supination of 70	
		= 1% upper extremity impairment [Figure 16-37]	
		= 1% whole person impairment [Table 16.3]	
			
		(d) Pronation of 80	
		= 0% upper extremity impairment [figure 16-37]	
		= whole person impairment [table 16.3]	
			
	2.      
Grip strength of 30% strength loss index	
		= 10% upper extremity impairment [table 16.34]	
		= 6% whole person impairment [table 16.3]	


The other most important factor in his case is pain. I have found that there is one of the problems in his case and had limited his ability to work effectively. Pain assessment according to figure 18.1 page 574 states that "If pain related impairment appears to increase the burden of the individual's condition slightly, the examiner can increase the percentage found in steps I [above] by up to 3%. No formal pain related assessment is required".

Therefore pain impairment = 3%.

Total whole person impairment for this case is:
1% + 9% +1% +0% +6% + 3% = 20% permanent impairment.

Therefore the permanent impairment percentage for this case is = 20%..."

21.     
The Doctor explained the contents of his report. He stated that the plaintiff has mal alignment of the bones. The pain would be there with the plaintiff for the rest of his life. He would not be able to lift heavy weight. He can have swelling in his fingers. For safety reason he is advised to wear a bandage at all times. He can lift things up but the movement would be limited. The plaintiff cannot be advised to do vigorous work. The X-Rays show communited fracture and this would have caused lots of pain in the beginning. The appearance of the hand does not look good from a cosmetic point of view as well. The words extension in his report meant "straight ahead", Flexion meant "lifting up", Supination meant "circling the hand" Pronation meant "putting hand down" and Grip meant "holding".

22.     
Under cross examination the doctor testified that he does not have the plaintiff's folder to state whether he examined the plaintiff initially. He also could not say whether the plaintiff was referred to CWM. Sometimes it is good not to operate too early. He had conducted an X-Ray 2 months after. He took note from the file that there were multiple fractures. When fracture is healed then it cannot be made out as multiple fracture because the fracture joins as one. Dr. Bhushan Ogale says there is only one fracture but Dr. Ogale is not an orthopaedic surgeon. Further, when Dr. Bhushan made the report, the fractures would have united. The alignment can be operated but the operation sometimes does not fix all the problems. The operation could however have the benefit. He assessed the plaintiff's pain by the grip method and not the nerve method. He also did not assess a single nerve. It is difficult to say that the nerve has problems. The patient is asked to hold onto something and looking and observing his grip, the pain is assessed. It is truly a subjective assessment. In the plaintiff's case, all that could be done was done, so malunion is not as a result of medical flaws. In his report there is no complaint by plaintiff of swelling of elbows and fingers but it could be in his folder. The plaintiff has been asked to exercise his elbow so that his muscles are not wasted. Using of hands may also cause further injury in the plaintiff's case. The plaintiff can do normal chores like brushing, clothing, eating but that would be done with restricted movements. Light duties could be undertaken with restricted movements. The plaintiff has to be careful all the time.

23.     
 The first witness produced on behalf of the defendants was the 1st defendant Mr. Ponijasi Saulekaleka. In his evidence in chief he testified that:-

"        
In the morning of the accident, he had to transport the LTA surveyors to board the bus to Nabouwalu Jetty to catch the boat to go back to Suva. When he came to Labasa Town where the bus is normally stationed, he noticed that the bus had already left. He followed the bus. At Qelewaqa he saw the bus. He tooted the horns and flicked the lights to get the attention of the bus driver. The driver stopped the bus. He drove past and stopped about 6-8 meters ahead of the bus. The surveyors got off the bus. They took with them their bags and other luggage. He also got off his seat with the boarding passes. He talked to the driver and told the driver that the passengers were LTA surveyors and they needed to board the boat to Suva. The bus driver said that it was alright for them to board the bus. He then gave the boat pass to one of the surveyors. He said goodbye and came back to his vehicle. He sat in his vehicle, put the seat belt on, started his vehicle and moved ahead for about 8-10m to come to the centre of the road. His right trafficator was on and as he approached the white centre line, he checked his side vision mirror. He could see the back of the bus. His front side was clear and he did see the vehicle EU 321 at 20m which was far away. He turned into the driveway on the right. The front of his vehicle was into the driveway. He then heard a horn and a breaking sound. Then a vehicle hit the middle of of his vehicle and his vehicle tumbled twice. The surveyors were still boarding the bus. They came running to see if he was okay. He crawled out of the tumbled vehicle. He then saw the driver of EU 321. He asked him what happened and he did not say anything. He refreshed his face in a nearby tap and was taken to the hospital by some LTA Officers. He also gave a statement to the police. Given the sudden impact, the EU 321 must have been travelling at a speed of 120 kmph. The surveyors took the plaintiff out of the vehicle. The rough sketch plan does not correctly show the right point of impact which was on the edge of the right hand side of the road on the driveway. He was not making a U-Turn. He was going in the driveway to go into a compound to turn around and go to Labasa.

24.     
Under cross examination, the first defendant testified that:-

"        
He had approximately 10-12 passengers in his vehicle. He followed the bus after missing the same. He did not chase the bus. It was his responsibility that the employees of LTA were dropped at the bus stop for boarding.

"        
The previous night there was a party in the office. He did not attend that party.

"        
The road is a long straight road where the accident took place. He tried to leave before the bus left. 

"        
He did see EU 321 which was far behind. EU 321 hit the passenger door on the right. Before the impact he heard the sound of a horn. He could not stop because he was into the driveway. He said to police in his statement that he was about to turn into the driveway and by that he meant that he was into the driveway. He was driving into the driveway at 20kmph when the accident happened. The point of impact is on the driveway. He did not know that EU 321 was overtaking the bus. He was 6-8 m infront of the bus when he had stopped.

"        
After accident his vehicle had tumbled twice. EU 321 was travelling at a high speed of about 120kmph.

25.     
The defendants' second witness was Dr. Eddie McCaig. Dr. McCaig testified in chief that he examined the plaintiff and prepared a report dated the 10th day of March, 2009. I would first of all outline the doctors report in full:-

"Yenkat Reddy was seen in my clinic on 07/08/2008. Made available to me was a report by Dr Ogale dated 05/06/2006 and Dr Jaoji Vulibeci dated 24/09/2007.
Yenkat gave a vivid recollection of the incident on 08/10/2005. He was a back seat passenger in a Twin cab that crashed into a L.T.A. van that did an illegal u-turn in front of their vehicle.

He received his initial treatment at the Labasa Hospital and later sort consultation both in Suva and by a visiting Australian Orthopaedic Surgeon.

He sustained a closed fracture to his right distal arm. A supracondylar fracture to his right humerus. He was treated non-operatively.

Yenkat works as a Salesman with C.J Patel, he is right handed. He tells me that he was unable to work for about a year following the car crash.

When asked he list his present problems on being:

"        
Continuous unrelenting pain over the entire right upper limb. He takes Paracetamol on a regular basis.

He also complains of a painful pea like lump over the right clavicle (collar bone). He lists the tasks that he cannot do included are chopping wood, lifting and driving etc.

Examination sees a gentleman very angry with the LTA and Labasa Hospital, he is keen on operation that will rid him of all symptoms.

He sits with his arm held by his side all attempted movement of the limb is resisted. With encouraged the extremes of motion to shoulder, elbow and wrist are restricted. He has lost his carrying angle, the elbow has a cubitus varus deformity. There is no measurable wasting to the major muscle group.

A pea like lump is noted over the right clavicle. It is subcutaneous, mobile and painful to touch. I feel that this is a neuroma and unrelated to his injury.

Radiographs taken of his chest show no pathology. The elbow show a malunited supracondylar fracture to his right humerus. He has a varus angle compared to the left of about 5 degrees normal valgus.

In the incident, Yenkat broke his right arm. The fracture has consolidated i.e. the fracture has healed. He has lost his carrying anglo.

Yenkat has a continuous unrelenting pain over the entire right upper limb. All movement is painful. I feel that he has a post traumatic pain syndrome a.k.a causalgia, shoulder hand syndrome.

This is a poorly understood self limiting condition. His fracture has healed and he is encouraged to use his limb as this will certainly help in his rehabilitation. He will not further damage his limb.

I would strongly advise against surgery that he so desperate, wants. In his present state, I feel that compensation for pain suffering and loss of employment for a year would certainly help this very angry gentleman".

26.     
The doctor said in evidence in chief that the plaintiff really wanted an operation. His pain was disproportionate to his injury. His fracture has healed but he has a crooked arm. The doctor could not examine him because he resisted in pain. If there was so much pain, then there would be signs of muscle wasting but none could be noticed in the plaintiff. The carrying angle does not equate to the fact that one cannot work. It just looks ugly in appearance. He need not have a bandage. It is thought that bandage gives a comfort but there is none medically necessary. Grip assessment is a test to indicate how well one can grip. It is not a very objective test. The patient can also just avoid gripping hard. The plaintiff in this case did not say anything about swelling of elbows or fingers. The doctor said that he cannot prove or disprove the pain he has been complaining of. With the plaintiff, there was no pain in the specific area so he strongly advised against surgery. The plaintiff has pain everywhere ranging from hand, shoulder, wrist and elbow. If one has an unhealed fracture then pain would be in a specific area but in the plaintiff's case, the nature of pain was non-specific so surgery was not the answer. With the plaintiff, it could be post traumatic pain syndrome. It can last for months or years and it is not known as to what causes the same.

27.     
Under cross examination Dr. McCaig stated that when fracture is at elbow joint, the ulna nerve could be disturbed or affected. The bandage support makes one feel better but it does not support the joints as the joints do not work then. He did not tell the plaintiff on the implications of a bandage. Another injury at the elbow would hurt the elbow and cause it to be swollen. He was not allowed to take any examination by the plaintiff's behaviour. The doctor said that he did not have an advantage of seeing the plaintiff's folder. He does not doubt Dr. Jaoji's report that the bones have several fragments. There is nothing wrong with Dr. Jaoji's tests and guides used to assess impairment. The plaintiff has to live with the deformity for the rest of his life and there is nothing to correct that.

28.     
I also wish to outline the contents of another medical report which was tendered in by consent and the author doctor did not testify in court. The report was by Dr. Bhushan Ogale. The report in full reads:-

"Re:    
YENKAT REDDY F/N SUBRAMANI

The above named patient was admitted from Emergency Room, Labasa Hospital on 8/10/05 and clinical and x-ray findings were suggestive of right supracondylar Fracture of humerus.

He had history of alleged motor vehicular accident and sustained injury to his right upper limb.

His vital signs were stable and he had no other visible injury besides the right upper limb. Patient was treated with analgesics, sedatives, post POP slab for right elbow and discharged on 10/10/05.

He was reviewed in the surgical clinic on 20/10/05 and was referred to CWM Hospital Orthopaedic Surgeon for further management. Patient was readmitted on 23/10/05 for travel arrangement and referral to CWM Hospital but patient was discharged as he desired to travel by air and was making his own arrangement.

He went to CWM Hospital Orthopaedic Clinic on Tuesday however he was booked for Monday.

Patient could not be seen in Orthopaedic Clinic and returned to Labasa Hospital and again reviewed in Surgical Clinic when he was to be referred to orthopaedic clinic Lautoka Hospital. However patient opted to be seen at Labasa Hospital by the overseas visiting Orthopaedic Surgeon and accordingly reviewed by Dr Loefler, Orthopaedic Surgeon on 14.11.05. He opined that ROM was 20-100 flexion, good rotation and x-ray fracture uniting and on discussion with patient, to accept malunion.

Patient was reviewed in the Surgical Clinic then regularly on 30/11/05, 14/12/05, 11/01/06. On his last review in the surgical clinic he had no fresh complaints except some impairment of movements. On examination the R.O.M. right elbow joint was restricted terminally only and he was called for review. He was reviewed by visiting overseas Orthopaedic Surgeon, Dr. Loefler who opined that the fracture had healed and there was good R.O.M. of the elbow joint, however he would need ulnar nerve release/transposition in view of some paraesthesia in the hand. He would be referred to a Plastic/Hand Surgeon [visiting team in August 2006].

This medical report is issued as per request from the patient's Solicitor- Maqbool and Co for full medical report on the patient's authorization.

Yours faithfully
Dr Bhushan E. Ogale
Consultant Surgeon
For General Manager Hospital Services".

The Submissions

29.     
Both counsels had at length made their closing submissions which I have thoroughly considered in order to determine the issues in this matter.

The Delay in the Judgment

30.     
It is the courts duty to explain the reason why the judgment has been delayed in this matter.

31.     
This file, was amongst the many that was sent from Labasa office to me for writing of the judgment. I had upon close of the case made this direction. 

32.     
The Labasa office as a matter of procedure sent all the files containing similar directions to the Suva office.

33.     
The files were not delivered to me for writing of judgments until December 2010. 

34.     
A search revealed that the files were sent to the Suva office but was kept without being sent to me. This delay in receiving the files has caused the delay in delivery of the judgment in this matter. 

35.     
Nevertheless, the memories of the events of the trial, the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses are still fresh in my memory. With that benefit, I have had the advantage of reading the evidence which I had recorded by hand in a very comprehensive form.

36.     
The quality of the judgment, as a result, is not affected by the delay.

The Determination

37.     
The first issue that needs to be determined is how the accident happened. Each witness has given their version of how the accident has occurred. It is for me to assess the evidence to determine the cause of the collision.

38.     
The plaintiff's version of the accident is that he was travelling on the straight road named Qelewaqa. As he approached a parked bus, the 1st defendant who was parked 2-3 yards infront of the bus, made a sudden turn across the road with an intention to make a U-Turn when the accident happened. The driver of EU321 tooted the horn and tried to avoid the collision but it could not be avoided.

39.     
I have numerous difficulties in accepting the evidence of the plaintiff. The plaintiff's demeanour, deportment and evidence, all reflects that his testimony is an afterthought of how the accident has happened. He in fact has not witnessed the accident at all. His testimony and version of how the accident has happened is a sham to support his claim. I make this finding on the following basis:-

a.      
The plaintiff was basically inconsistent in his own evidence as to where the vehicle EU 321 was being driven when the accident happened. Under cross examination, he initially said that the vehicle EU 321 could go past between the bus and the white mark and that the vehicle EU 321 could safely overtake the bus without having to cross the white centre line. Then upon continuous cross examination as to how EU 321 could go on the right hand side of the road, he changed his evidence to state that EU 321 had to go over the white mark to safely pass the bus.

b.      
The plaintiff's description of how the accident happened is also totally inconsistent with:-

(i)     
The brake marks of 13 meters;
(ii)    
The positioning of the two vehicles after the accident;
(iii)   
The damage sustained to DT 964, and.
(iv)    
The logistics of making a U-Turn.

The rough sketch plan drawn by the police shows 13 meters brake mark of vehicle EU 321. This was undisputed evidence. The 13 meters brake mark is towards the extreme right of the right hand side of the road. This indicates that the driver of EU 321 was neither driving between the bus and the white mark when the accident happened nor was he little over the white mark when the accident happened. He infact was driving on the right hand side of the road. The brake mark is also indicative of the speed at which the EU 321 was travelling, about which I shall discuss later in my judgment.

After the accident, the LTA vehicle was found upside down with the front part in the drain and the back on the extreme right of the right hand side of the tarsealed road. The vehicle EU 321 was found facing in the direction it was being driven. EU 321 was found in the drain except for a little portion of the left rear on the tarsealed road. The alleged sudden swing by the LTA vehicle would have resulted in the accident either at the left or the centre of the road. It is conceivable as to how both the vehicles went to the extreme right.

The LTA vehicle sustained damage to its right hand side of the passenger door. I of course accept that the EU 321 did not hit the driver's side of the door, otherwise the result and injuries to the LTA driver would have been fatal and not minor as it was. The hit on the right side of the passenger door indicates that the LTA vehicle did not make a sudden swing from its place or else the impact would have been on the driver's right hand side.

The plaintiff also stated that the driver of DT 964 wanted to make a U-Turn. How does he speculate his intention when the DT 964 is alleged to have swung from its place across the road? That allegation could also be indicative of an intention to make a 3 point turn and also an intention to go into the driveway. The hypothetical description or opinion is a clear indication of how the plaintiff's version is an afterthought of how the accident happened.

c.      
The plaintiff has also lied about the speed of vehicle EU 321. The plaintiff said that EU321 was being driven normally at 50 kmph and that the speed would have been reduced substantially if the brakes were being applied. At a speed of 50kmph or a substantially reduced speed, the LTA vehicle would not have tumbled once or twice and be written off after the accident.

Moreover, the plaintiff and the passenger Mahendra Kumar both received injuries from the seat belt. Mr. Mahendra Kumar also had blood clots in his chest. This chest injuries and blood clots were as a result of the seat belt jerks. I find that for the seat belt to give immense chest pains and blood clots, the speed of the vehicle EU 321 would be more than 50kmph. This consequential effect of the accident is proper to draw an inference of the speed of EU 321.

Even if I were to accept the plaintiff's evidence on the speed limit, I have to state that 50-60kmph is definitely not an overtaking speed limit in the circumstances. Overtaking is a serious road business, as one has to leave the correct side of the road and go to the other side. There is always a potential of inconspicuous things or objects pre-existing on the road and always potential of inconspicuous human or animal using the road. There is thus a need for a lower speed limit and precaution at all material times. In this instance there was a parked bus which blocked the front view of the bus. In such situation the overtaking at 50-60kmph is certainly negligent and not justified.

d.      
The plaintiff had also given a statement to the police on the 12th day of October, 2005, just 4 days after the accident. In that statement to the police which was tendered as evidence in this court, the plaintiff had stated as follows:-

"I am employed for CJ Patel as a salesman for 4 years now.

I recall on Saturday 08/10/2005, my boss Mr. Mahendra Kumar came to pick me from home to proceed to Savusavu Wharf to pick our truck from there which has come by boat from Suva. Vinal Vasram was driving our company vehicle reg. No. EU321.
On our way to Savusavu at Qelewaqa I was relaxing at the back seat with my eyes closed but I was awake. I had put on my seat belt after I got into the van. I did not notice anything on the road as my eyes was closed. It came to my senses when I heard the brake sound and saw LTA van in front of our vehicle across the road. I then put my head down and do not know what happened after that. I then realized that my hand was injured on the elbow and chest pain. Vinal and my boss brought me one of the vehicle. I was then conveyed to hospital in Waiqele Sawmill van which was white in colour with green canopy. That is all I know that happened that day".
[Underlining is Mine]

The plaintiff told the police that he does not know how the accident happened as he had closed his eyes and was relaxing. He only saw the aftermath of the accident. The plaintiff has quite unconvincingly testified in cross examination that his statement to the police was given when he was in pain and so he said the above. I do not accept the plaintiff's explanation that his statement to the police in a totally different version from what he testified in court was due to pain. I accept that the version of the day's incident was correctly narrated by the plaintiff to the police then. His story has subsequently changed today in court or concocted at the time of filing the claim and this is obviously to support the allegation of negligence against the 1st defendant. Being in pain may result in inability to relate an incident at all or with minor omissions. Here I have a situation where the plaintiff initially said he saw nothing at all, and, then in court, he quite vividly recalls the incident with evasiveness to answer when being cross-examined.

e.      
The plaintiff's dishonesty was also apparent when he stated that he would be fired from the employment if the Suva Office came to know that he was working with an assistant. Was that a secret favour granted to him by his supervisor Mr. Mahendra Kumar? Why would that favour be granted by Mr. Kumar and not disclosed to the head office? If the supervisor Mr. Mahendra Kumar gave such a favour without disclosing this to his superiors, then I have a lot of difficulty in placing weight on his credibility as well. I simply do not believe the plaintiff when he said that the Suva office does not know that he was working with an assistant. He has been having an assistant for the past three years which is a long time for the head office to be oblivious of this. The plaintiff's behaviour was also very peculiar when he was being cross examined on this subject making it obvious that he is saying all this so that he could support his claim for loss of future earnings. I am of the judgment that the head office in Suva has granted this assistance to the plaintiff to avoid potential liability of the employer in case the driver of the EU 321 was found for negligence. The issue of vicarious liability and workmen's compensation claim would not have escaped the minds of the employer or its legal advisers. One must not forget that the plaintiff got injured whilst in employment. It is also possible that the job the plaintiff is now undertaking is in reality a job for two workmen, coupled with the possibility that the plaintiff's ability to continue his employment had not diminished because of the injuries that he sustained.

f.      
The plaintiff also lied in court when he said that he cannot work the cane farm now. He said that he gave his cane farm away because of the injuries he sustained. Under cross examination it was apparent that he gave or sold the cane farm to his brother at a price. Whether the sale transaction is legally effected and valid is not material but in fact the price has been paid for his share. The price money has been used to buy a car. With that the plaintiff maintains loss of income from the cane farm. This affects his credibility.

g.      
It also very difficult for me to accept the plaintiff's evidence that his family could not maintain the poultry farm and the goat farm. He said that he used to undertake the two all by himself. It is practically impossible for a full time worker to carry on poultry farming and raising goat absolutely on his own. He would have had assistance from his family members to be able to manage all together. His total denial that his family is not involved at any level is incredible and affects his sincerity on important matters.

h.      
The plaintiff also dishonestly said in examination in chief that he started poultry farming after marriage. Under cross examination he stated that he had poultry farming before and after marriage.

i.      
Another inconsistency I noted with the plaintiffs evidence was that he stated that he was unemployed for a period of 1 year from the date of the accident. His immediate superior at employment stated to the court that the plaintiff was away from work for about 2-3 months. I wonder what is correct.

My above observations are clear and concise and with all the observations, I find the plaintiff to be an inconsistent and an apparently dishonest witness. His evidence also cannot be sustained in light of the other existing evidence and thus I reject his testimony of how the accident occurred.

40.     
The second version of the accident was given by Mr. Saten Prasad. He also testified on behalf of the plaintiff. Mr. Prasad's evidence basically was that when the vehicle EU 321 started overtaking the bus, the LTA vehicle suddenly turned towards his driveway. He did not see any indicator of the LTA Vehicle. The EU 321 tooted the horn but the LTA Vehicle did not stop. He heard the scratching sound from EU 321 and the collision happened.

41.     
Mr. Saten Prasad's evidence has now put the blame on the 1st defendant who is alleged to have suddenly turned to go into the driveway when the EU321 was overtaking. This evidence is definitely not consistent with what he told the police, his statement being tendered in evidence. 

42.     
The police statement of Mr. Prasad given itself on the date of accident, when memories are fresh and clear as crystal reads:-

"I have been residing on the above mentioned address for 18 years now with my family

I can clearly recall this morning after living my goats at the back of my house. I came to the front to wash my hands and then I saw a bus facing towards Seaqaqa and a LTA vehicle overtook the bus and stopped in front to off load some passengers who was sitting at the tray to board the bus. After dropping the passengers the driver of LTA vehicle made a right turn into my driveway. As soon as he made the right turn the CJ Patel vehicle came from Labasa town overtook the parked bus and collided with the right side of the LTA vehicle. After the collision the LTA vehicle tumbled and CJ Patel vehicle went to the right side of the road into the drain.

As I went to the accident site both the driver came out of the vehicle to the main road that is all I have to say".

43.     
Mr. Prasad's statement to the police is apparently clear and obvious that DT 964 had first maneuvered into the driveway when EU 321 came and collided upon overtaking with DT 964. This version clearly indicates how negligently the EU 321 failed to observe and or notice DT 964 on the road, adhere to its presence and then control the vehicle which resulted in the collision. Mr. Prasad does not indicate why he has completely changed his statement. He did say in his evidence that he had told the police that the LTA vehicle had turned towards his driveway and not into the driveway. Even if that is so, the gist or the crux of the evidence remains that DT 964 had first turned when EU 321 decided to overtake. If this is so, then the plain and simple conclusion is that EU 321 should have noticed DT 964 on the road and the fact that it did not, is strange and overwhelming evidence of negligence against the driver of EU 321.

44.     
I do not know why but Mr. Prasad has changed his evidence. However he has totally changed his evidence in court. I cannot accept his explanation for want of proper explanation for retracting from his statement. I am very skeptical about this witness's change in his version of how the accident happened. He surely will not derive any benefit by maintaining his statement he gave to the police. His demeanour in court suggested to me that he was going to receive some monetary benefit for his concocted stories and so is my finding. He behaved that he wanted to blame the 1st defendant in some way or the other. He is a witness who should just be independent but he acted more a witness supporting the plaintiff then an independent eye witness.

45.     
It is still clear in my memory the demeanour and deportment of this Mr. Prasad who was asked to look at his police statement and the moment he was asked to identify his statement, his entire facial appearance changed, and to find some space he told the court that he did not have his glasses and so he could not read the statement and that he did not bring his glasses to court. My observation is that this act was a very careful act to avoid being questioned on the police statement for he well knew the potential problems that he would have to face. Yet he was taken through his statement where and when he could not explain his own inconsistency. 

46.     
Mr. Prasad's evidence is also unacceptable in that, if the EU 321 was overtaking and the LTA vehicle suddenly turned, then the accident would not occur on the extreme right side of the road. The two vehicles would have collided in the middle of the road.

47.     
The LTA's vehicle tumbling also suggests that the EU 321 hit the LTA vehicle with force for it to tumble. The sketch plan also shows that the LTA vehicle was pushed forward from the point of impact indicating that EU 321 hit the 1st defendants vehicle and not vice versa. This does not fit in with Mr. Prasad's evidence that the LTA vehicle swung from its place causing the collision. 

48.     
Further, Mr. Prasad stated that the driver of the LTA vehicle had stopped 5-6 steps ahead of the bus which may mean maximum of 4 m. Mr. Prasad also stated that EU 321 was overtaking the bus when DT 964 swung from its place. This means that EU 321 was in the process of overtaking the bus. If such is his evidence then definitely the brake marks could not be 13 m long. It would infact be much shorter. 

49.     
The above police statement of Mr. Prasad clearly indicates total fault on the part of the EU 321 which overtook when the 1st defendant had completed the process of driving into the driveway. The 1st defendant could not have done anything to avoid the accident unless it had wings to fly up from the place of the macabre situation. It just had to stay where it was and wish that the unexpected did not happen, but it did. How can one lay negligence at his door then? I surely cannot, because I find that the EU 321 has caused the accident due to its being driven in a very negligent manner.

50.     
Mr. Prasad was also inconsistent in his evidence:-

(i)     
 He initially said under the cross examination that he heard the scratching sound from EU321 vehicle and that the sound had started when EU321 was on the side of the bus. He later changed to say that the tyre sound had started when EU 321 was reaching the bus. If the tyre sound had started when EU 321 was behind the bus then what is the value of his testimony that DT 964 suddenly swung from his place when EU 321 was overtaking. One cannot be overtaking when it is behind a vehicle. 

(ii)    
Under cross examination he initially said that he cannot tell whether the scratching sound was for long or not. He later changed and said that the sound was for a short while and then the accident happened. This change was calculated to support his statement that the EU 321 was in the process of overtaking when the accident happened.

(iii)   
He stated initially in the cross-examination that the accident occurred near his junction which is his driveway. Later he retraced from his testimony and said that the accident happened on the middle of the road. When this contradiction was put to him he stated that he cannot be accurate in identifying where the accident happened. 

51.     
I do not accept Mr. Prasad's court version of how the accident happened. His numerous inconsistencies, his apparent dishonesty from his demeanour and deportment and his change in his evidence on my finding that it was changed for an ulterior motive, is too dangerous to place any weight on. I dismiss his evidence as incredible, concocted and unreliable.

52.     
The plaintiff's third witness was Mr. Mahendra Kumar who is also a totally unreliable witness. Mr. Kumar could also have been subjected to this claim as he was the owner of the vehicle EU 321. There is an obvious motive why Mr. Kumar has given evidence in the manner he did. He is saving both himself and the employers from the potential liability and his demeanour in court was nothing but an indication of his ulterior motives. If the employers have knowledge about the issue of an assistant being given to the plaintiff, then there is no reason to bring the subject of the plaintiff being terminated but to support the claim for loss of future earnings. This was in my view calculated evidence to extract for the plaintiff what appears to be a thin claim under the head "loss of future earnings".

53.     
Mr. Mahendra Kumar has stated that the plaintiff was not employed for about 2-3 months but he was paid full salary. The plaintiff said that he was unemployed for a year. There is inconsistency even between the two witnesses in this respect when there should not be.

54.     
Mr. Kumar stated in his testimony that the EU 321 was overtaking and about to pass the bus when the LTA vehicle suddenly swung from its place. Mr. Kumar is definitely lying. About to pass the bus would be about 1-2 meters left to pass the bus. If that is the case then the 13 meters brake mark cannot be possible. 

55.     
I am also astounded as to the gross manipulation of evidence by Mr. Kumar and his desparate attempt to blame the driver of DT 964. He said that the driver of DT 94 wanted to make a U-Turn by going forward and coming back and then going to Labasa side. The forward then backward manoeuvre will constitute a three point turn and not a U-turn. 

56.     
Mr. Kumar also tried to indicate to the court that the accident site was an overtaking zone and there was nothing wrong in overtaking at 60kmph. He said in his cross examination evidence that the EU321 would have hit DT 964 at a speed of 60kmph. Then he later changed and said that EU 321 may have hit the LTA vehicle at 40kmph. Subsequently he said he does not know the speed at which the LTA vehicle would have been hit. He tried very hard to put all the blame on the driver of DT 964. My finding is that instead of giving a true account of the accident, he came to court with one and only motive and that was to put the blame on the 1st defendant.

57.     
Against his evidence Mr. Kumar was asked as to how there was a 13m brake mark, when stated that he did not know about that but the speed of EU 321 was 50-60 kmph before the accident. It was then put to him that if he asked the driver to slowdown, it would mean that he was more than 50-60kmph. Mr. Kumar then said that the driver would have been 70-80kmph before he dropped his speed. This portion of his evidence indicated to the court how Mr. Kumar was so reluctant to talk about the high speed of EU 321 because his duty in court as per his understanding was to be the plaintiff's savior.

58.     
The scene of accident, the place of impact, the positioning of the vehicle after the accident, the place of damage to DT 964, the circumstance of LTA vehicle tumbling, the injuries received by the seat belts on passengers travelling in EU 321, all does not substantiate the witness Mr. Kumar's version of the accident and the speed at which the vehicle EU 321 was travelling. I reject Mr. Mahendra Kumar's evidence on how the accident has happened.

59.     
The police officer who drew the sketch plan cannot describe how the accident happened. However the crucial evidence of the police officer given in court is also not in an equipoise with the scene of the accident, the brake marks, the positioning of the vehicle after accident, the place of impact on the vehicle, the place of impact on the road, the damage sustained during the collision and the accepted testimony of the defendant witness. 

60.     
The police officer indicated in the rough sketch plan which he drew that the point of impact is further up and ahead of the driveway but the vehicle EU 321 is found partly on the driveway. The EU 321 had hit DT 964 causing DT 964 to tumble. So if the EU 321 is found partly on the driveway, the point of impact cannot be further ahead because the vehicle EU 321 hit DT 964 in a moving motion and as such EU 321 moved forward and not backward. This obviously suggests that the point of impact was at the driveway and substantiates what the plaintiff's eye witness had described to the police to be so.

61.     
The officer also told the court that he drew the point of impact but cannot tell how the point of impact was arrived at since it has been a long time when he drew the plan and that there was nothing in writing to indicate how he had picked up the point of impact.

62.     
I am also surprised when the officer said that the brake marks are wheel marks of the vehicle but the impact cannot be within the brake marks. Where else would it be then? The officer just refused to accept the obvious because of his evasiveness when he was being cross examined. His evidence is cynical.

63.     
Later under cross examination the officer stated that the point of impact had fallen debris of mud. It was then viciously put to him that he made up the evidence that he drew the point of impact because he saw the mud debris. The officer then replied that he attends a lot of accident and the mud debris is almost there in most accidents. He would have forgotten to write about the mud debris. I conclude from his this evidence that he has stereotyped his evidence when he said that most accidents have mud debris and so this one would have had mud debris as well for him to find a point of impact. In any event, the point of impact is inconsistent with the brake marks and outside the brake marks which is impossible in my finding. Furthermore, the positioning in which the EU 321 was found also explains that the point of impact as shown in the rough sketch plan cannot be correct.

64.     
I have to reiterate that this officer cannot possibly say how the accident has happened. If anything he can do, is to show and/ or depict the state of affairs after the accident. This officer himself said that the collision could have occurred either in the middle of the road or further to the right hand side of the road. In my judgment, he can only make his observations and not a finding.

65.     
The police officer also inconsistently stated that the impact indicates that the driver of LTA vehicle was making a U-Turn. He then later changed and said that he does not know what the LTA driver wanted to do. I can do no better than asking a simple rhetorical question of: how does this officer know of the intentions of the driver of DT 964 at the time? There is obviously nothing at the scene to indicate the motive of the driver of DT 964 then?

66.     
Succinctly, I have to state that I do not accept the evidence of the plaintiff and his witnesses on their description of how the collision occurred. For the plaintiff, 3 people had given evidence of how the accident happened and I have rejected the evidence of the three people as of against the evidence of the defendant who is the remaining person who also gave evidence of how the accident happened. Quantity of witness does not matter and cannot override the truth. This is a clear case of such a situation.

67.     
The 1st defendant testified that he wanted to turn into the driveway and go to a compound, turn around and return to Labasa. He looked at his side vision mirror saw the subject vehicle far away and so upon giving a right indicator he had turned into the driveway when he heard the tooting sound and the tyre scratch noise when he was hit. This is exactly how Mr. Saten Prasad had told the police on how the accident had happened. Further this statement of the defendant is substantiated by the surrounding circumstances of the accident which I have mentioned above, in particular, my finding that the point of impact is on the driveway leaving the rear of EU 321 partly on the driveway, the 13 meters brake mark towards the right indicating the speed at which EU 321 was travelling and the distance from which it saw the DT964 being a distance behind the bus and not when it was overtaking, the tumbling of DT 964 and the extent and place of damage sustained to it indicating the speed of EU 321. I have no reason and hesitation is accepting the evidence of the 1st defendant and I also accept it to be a true and credible account of how the accident has happened.

68.     
Mr. Sen had indicated that the 1st defendant had retracted from his statement to the police. The 1st defendant had told the police that:-

" & I was transporting LTA surveyors to board the Patterson Bus to go to Nabouwalu, at Qelewaqa stress I overtook the bus and signaled to the pull over and offload. I stopped the vehicle infront and the bus stopped from the rear. All my passengers got off. I then pull in to the lane after checking my side mirror and I could see a vehicle coming from the back towards Seaqaqa. The vehicle was quiet far from the bus and where I was and I decided to turn into the driveway on the other side of the road. I was about to turn into the driveway after giving my trafficator to do so, when I can hear a horn and a breaking sound of a vehicle. My vehicle tumbled after being hit and landed on its roof. I crawled out of the vehicle after a few minutes an LTA vehicle picked me from the scene and convey me to the hospital&"

The 1st defendant was being vigorously cross examined that when his memories were fresh and he had related the incident to the police, he had told the police that the accident happened when he was about to turn into the driveway. The 1st defendant testified that he told the police that he meant that he was into the driveway.

I do not find that the 1st defendant has changed his testimony. He has maintained his testimony that he was into the driveway. His informed the police officer who recorded the statement that he was into the driveway and that is what he meant. 

In any event even if the 1st defendant was about to turn into the driveway, then the EU 321 should have seen the DT 964 as the driveway is at the extreme side of the right hand side of the road. The presence of DT 964 would have been noticeable from a far distance.

The police officers recording of the 1st defendant's statement has many errors as one can notice and I do not think that the police officer at the time of recording the 1st defendant's statement would have appreciated the accuracy of recording the statement. This change is insignificant and unlike the evidence of the plaintiff and Mr. Saten Prasad, is not a total change of the evidence with no explanation why there was such total change.

I find the evidence of the 1st defendant credible and consistent, his demeanour and deportment to have substantiated his honesty. I accept his version of how the accident has happened.

69.     
The 1st defendant had obviously turned into the driveway when he was hit. I reiterate there was nothing that the 1st defendant could have done to avoid the accident. On the other hand I find it absolute negligence on the part of the driver of EU 321 which caused the accident in that:-

a.      
Having noticed a vehicle on the driveway, the EU321 should have slowed down or stopped to allow the DT 964 to complete the tour.

b.      
If EU 321 thought that overtaking was safe then it should have overtaken with due care, attention and diligence by going past the bus without having to go on the right hand side of the road thereby causing the collision.

c.      
EU 321 was definitely driving at an excessive speed and I accept the defendant's version of the speed to be 120 kmph and not 50-60 kmph. The excessive speed can be inferred from the 13 meters brake mark, the collision in itself causing the impact and the vehicle DT 964 to tumble and be written off. Even if EU 321 was driven at a speed of 50-60kmph, it was excessive in the circumstances I have explained above and especially when it was overtaking a parked bus.

70.     
 I do not find any negligence on the part of the 1st defendant at all. However there is absolute and sole negligence on the part of the driver of vehicle registration number EU 321. The plaintiff's choice of the defendant is wrong, but my duty is to determine the matter at hand and do what is just and fair in light of the evidence before the court.

71.     
I do not find the 1st defendant negligent and as a result, the 1st defendant and consequently the 2nd defendant are not liable for any claim in negligence against the plaintiff. The plaintiff's case must be dismissed and I do so now.

72.     
The plaintiff has pleaded res ipsa loquitor. In light of my findings on the facts of the case, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor does not apply.

The Costs

73.     
I am firmly of the view that the bringing of the plaint against the driver of the vehicle registration number EU 321 was by choice of the plaintiff. Only the 1st defendant was sued and on the balance of probability the plaintiff has not proved its case against the 1st defendant and consequently the 2nd defendant. The defendants are entitled to costs which I have powers to summarily assess under the High Court Rules 1988.

74.     
I do not lose sight of the fact that this was a 3 day trial with the defendant having to contest the matter with two persons travelling from Suva, being Dr. McCaig and the 1st defendant. Money surely would have been spent in travelling from Suva.

75.     
Further, this matter was heavily contested in terms of liability. Mr. Ram surely would have had to do enormous preparation and has spent a lot of time in court. He has also been very thorough in cross examination and underwent a painstaking exercise of submitting his closing submissions. 
76.     
The plaintiff's counsel Mr. Sen had himself asked for costs of $6,000.

77.     
I therefore summarily assess costs in the sum $3,500 in favour of the defendants.

Final Orders

78.     
The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.

79.     
The plaintiff is ordered to pay costs to the defendants in the sum of $3,500.

80.     
Orders accordingly.
