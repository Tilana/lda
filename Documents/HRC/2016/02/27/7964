<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> Illicit financial flows &#8211; generated from crime, corruption, embezzlement and tax 
evasion &#8211; represent a major drain on the resources of developing countries, reducing tax 
revenues and investment inflows, hindering development, exacerbating poverty and 
undermining the enjoyment of human rights. It is estimated that, on average, developing 
countries lost between US$783 billion and US$1,138 billion in illicit financial outflows in 
2010 and that these flows have increased in real terms to 8.6 per cent over the period 2001&#8211;
2010, suggesting that existing measures to tackle the problem have not had a significant 
impact.  
</p>
<p> Many of the countries affected by massive illicit financial outflows are burdened 
with heavy external debts and have to make difficult choices concerning allocation of 
scarce national resources between debt service and provision of essential public services. 
Curtailing illicit financial outflows and ensuring the repatriation of illicit funds to the 
countries of origin can increase the resources available to these countries for development, 
poverty alleviation and the realization of all human rights, particularly economic, social and 
cultural rights. Repatriation of illicit funds may also help ease the external debt burdens of 
the countries of origin. 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p> In order to devise effective strategies for tackling the problem of illicit funds and 
ensuring their repatriation to the countries of origin, it is important to understand the 
methods and channels of illicit financial flows, which countries such funds originate from 
and where they are held, as well as existing legal instruments and other initiatives designed 
to curb these flows. This interim report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council 
resolution 19/38 provides an overview of these issues. The final report of the Independent 
Expert on this issue will discuss in detail the impact of non-repatriation of illicit funds on 
development and the realization of human rights and will offer recommendations 
concerning strategies to combat illicit financial flows so as to ensure the application of the 
maximum available resources to the full realization of all human rights.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 19/38, the Human Rights Council requested the Independent Expert 
on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States 
on the full enjoyment of all human rights, to present to the Human Rights Council at its 
twenty-second session, a comprehensive study on &#8220;the negative impact of the non-
repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin on the application by States of 
the maximum available resources to the full realization of all human rights, in particular 
economic, social and cultural rights, with special attention paid to developing countries and 
countries with economies in transition burdened by foreign debt&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. The Independent Expert welcomes the request to analyse the human rights 
implications of the transfer of funds of illicit origin, which may endanger the stability and 
security of societies, undermine the values of democracy and morality and jeopardize 
social, economic and political development, especially when an inadequate national and 
international response leads to impunity. Corruption, the transfer of illicit funds and legal 
and other barriers to their repatriation not only divert resources away from activities that are 
critical for poverty eradication, the fight against hunger and economic and sustainable 
development, they also undermine the enjoyment of economic, social, cultural, civil and 
political rights.  
</p>
<p>3. He takes this opportunity to thank the Government of Guatemala for providing 
information on its legislative and institutional framework for combating illicit financial 
flows.   
</p>
<p>4. In order to formulate effective strategies for tackling the problem of illicit funds and 
ensuring their repatriation to the countries of origin, it is important to understand the 
different types of illicit financial flows, from which countries such funds originate and 
where they are held, as well as current initiatives to curb illicit financial flows. This interim 
report provides an overview of these issues. The final report of the Independent Expert on 
the subject will discuss in detail the impact of non-repatriation of illicit funds on 
development and the realization of human rights and will make recommendations 
concerning strategies to combat illicit financial flows so as to ensure the application of the 
maximum available resources to the realization of all human rights in the countries affected 
by these flows.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Illicit funds: overview of the problem 
</b></p>
<p>5. Financial flows may be illicit for two distinct although overlapping reasons. First, 
they may relate to proceeds of crime, such as corruption, embezzlement, drug trafficking or 
illegal arms trade. The proceeds are subsequently laundered often through offshore deposits 
in secrecy jurisdictions1 and shell companies designed to hide illicit financial flows. 
Second, although most illicit financial flows derive initially from legitimate economic 
</p>
<p>  
 1  The Tax Justice Network, an independent organization that conducts research, analysis and advocacy 
</p>
<p>in the field of tax and regulation, defines secrecy jurisdictions as &#8220;places that intentionally create 
</p>
<p>regulation for the primary benefit and use of those not resident in their geographical domain. That 
regulation is designed to undermine the legislation or regulation of another jurisdiction. To facilitate 
its use, secrecy jurisdictions also create a deliberate, legally backed veil of secrecy that ensures that 
those from outside the jurisdiction making use of its regulation cannot be identified to be doing so&#8221;. 
See Tax Justice Network, &#8220;Identifying Tax Havens and Offshore Financial Centers&#8221;, Briefing Paper 
(2007). </p>


<p>activities, the transfer abroad of such funds in contravention of relevant laws (such as non-
payment of applicable corporate taxes or breach of exchange control regulations) makes 
them illicit. Thus, illicit funds are funds which are illegally earned, transferred or utilized 
and include all unrecorded private financial outflows that set in motion the accumulation of 
foreign assets by residents in breach of relevant legal frameworks.2 
</p>
<p>6. Commonly used methods to evade taxation include trade mis-invoicing and transfer 
mispricing. Trade mis-invoicing occurs when businesses or individuals shift money abroad 
by falsifying trade documents (for example, prices in a customs invoice). A buyer and a 
seller may collude in a scheme in which the buyer only pays the standard market price for 
imported goods, but is billed for the goods at a higher price. The seller then deposits the 
difference in a bank account in a secrecy jurisdiction on behalf of the buyer, thus siphoning 
funds abroad and preventing national authorities from collecting much needed taxes. 
</p>
<p>7. Transfer mispricing refers to a similar process within multinational companies to 
evade taxes. A subsidiary of a company avoids paying taxes in a high taxation country by 
selling its products at a loss to a subsidiary in a low tax country, which then sells the 
product to final customers at market price and yields the profit.3 The Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that a significant percentage 
of all international trade is intergroup trade occurring between related companies, thus 
providing multinational corporations with opportunities to shift profits within companies in 
its own group to make sure that the accounts show high profits in low-tax jurisdictions.4 
</p>
<p>While tax evasion, breaking national tax laws, is illegal, many tax avoidance schemes 
comply with existing laws and regulations. As one researcher has recently noted: &#8220;While 
</p>
<p>some of the corporate practices used to dodge taxes are clearly illegal, such as false 
invoicing and trade mispricing, in many cases these are difficult to prove, given the lack of 
adequate instruments to effectively regulate them. Other means of shifting profits intra-
group are legal or semi-legal yet ethically highly questionable.&#8221;5 
</p>
<p>8. Such tax evasion schemes are a concern to all countries struggling with tight budgets 
and cuts in essential services. However, owing to, inter alia, their resource constraints and

<p><i>Update with a Focus on Asia</i> (Global Financial Integrity, 2011), p. 3. 
 3  Recently, corporate tax dodging practices in Europe and the United States have attracted international 
</p>
<p>attention. In November 2012, the managers of Starbucks, Google UK and Amazon appeared before 
the Public Accounts Committee of the British Parliament to explain why they reported only very 
limited profits for their business in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
through using more favourable European tax jurisdictions, such as the Netherlands, Ireland and 
Luxembourg to pay corporate their taxes (see BBC World News, &#8220;Starbucks, Google and Amazon, 
grilled over tax avoidance&#8221;, 12 November 2012. Available from www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-
20288077). Amazon UK is reported to have generated sales of more than GBP 3.3 billion in the 
United Kingdom in 2011, but paid no corporation tax on any profits in the United Kingdom for that 
year (see Ian Griffiths, &#8220;Amazon, &#163;7bn sales, no UK corporation tax&#8221;, <i>The Guardian</i>, 4 April 2012). 
In the United States of America, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has held 
similar hearings into tax evasion practices of technology companies, including Apple, Hewlett-
Packard and Microsoft (see Charles Duhigg and David Kocieniewski, &#8220;Inquiry into Tech Giants&#8223; Tax 
Strategies Nears End&#8221;, <i>New York Times</i>, 3 January 2012). Apple was reported to pay only 2 per cent 
corporate tax outside the United States (see BBC World News, &#8220;Apple paid only 2% corporate tax 
outside the US&#8221;, 4 November 2012. Available from www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20197710).

<p>heavy external debt burdens, developing countries tend to be the most severely affected by 
financial outflows related to such schemes. 
</p>
<p>9. It is notable that most illicit financial flows are facilitated by tax havens, secrecy 
jurisdiction, shell companies that cannot be traced back to their owners, anonymous trust 
accounts, bogus charitable foundations, money-laundering techniques and questionable 
trade practices.  
</p>
<p>10. While in the past persons hid their involvement with funds derived from bribery, 
embezzlement of public funds, tax evasion or other forms of corruption through anonymous 
bank accounts or accounts in fictitious names, this option is becoming increasingly less 
available. The preferred method is the use of a corporate vehicle. This term is used to refer 
to companies or corporations, foundations and trusts. A study by the Stolen Asset Recovery 
(StAR) Initiative, a joint initiative of the World Bank and the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime (UNODC), showed that trust and company service providers, including 
those in OECD countries, often fail to exercise sufficient due diligence when approached to 
create or provide administrative services for such corporate vehicles to comply with the 
recommendations by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).6  
</p>
<p>11. There is also evidence that, by failing to exercise due diligence, banks play a key 
role in facilitating illicit financial flows. A series of high profile court cases in the United 
States of America and elsewhere have shown that international banks have frequently been 
negligent or complicit in the laundering of corruption proceeds or tax evasion.7 On 11 
December 2012, for example, the bank HSBC entered into a deferred prosecution 
agreement in terms of which it agreed to pay penalties of a little more than US$1.9 billion 
for systemic and willful violations of United States anti-money-laundering and foreign 
sanctions laws.8 In the United Kingdom, a 2011 report by the Financial Services Authority 
based on a survey of the screening practices of British banks for politically exposed persons 
found that three quarters of the banks surveyed did not properly establish the legitimacy of 
the funds deposited by such persons; over half failed to apply enhanced due diligence to 
high-risk politically exposed persons; and over a third &#8220;appeared willing to accept very high 
levels of money-laundering risk&#8221; from such clients.9 Global Witness, a non-governmental 
organization that campaigns against natural resource-related corruption and conflict, has

<p>also prepared several evidence-based case studies, showing that the banking sector 
facilitated illicit financial flows by doing business with suspicious customers.10 
</p>
<p><b> A. Estimates of illicit financial flows</b>11<b> 
</b></p>
<p>12. The scarcity of data combined with lack of transparency on the part of banks and 
other financial intermediaries involved in illicit financial transactions renders it difficult to 
calculate illicit financial flows with a degree of certainty. However, a number of studies 
have provided useful estimates. A recent study by Global Financial Integrity (GFI) 
concludes that, depending on the method employed, in 2010, developing countries lost 
between US$783 billion and US$1,138 billion in illicit financial outflows.12 Despite 
increased efforts by the international community to curb the flow of illicit funds, the study 
indicates that such flows have grown in real terms by 8.6 per cent per annual on average 
over the period 2001&#8211;2010, signifying that existing measures to address the problem have 
thus far not been very effective.13 It is notable that this rate of growth of illicit flows 
exceeded the average rate of economic growth (6.3 per cent per annum) of developing 
countries for the same period.14 
</p>
<p>13. Transfer mispricing and trade mis-invoicing are considered the prime factors for 
illicit financial flows, followed by illicit flows related to international drug trafficking and 
other criminal activities. While flows of the proceeds of corruption out of developing 
countries account for only about 5 per cent of all illicit financial flows, they have been 
estimated at US$20&#8211;40 billion annually.15 This is still a very significant amount, 
</p>
<p>  
 10  See Global Witness, <i>Undue Diligence: How Banks do business with corrupt regimes</i> (London, 2009); 
</p>
<p>and Global Witness, &#8220;International Thief, Thief&#8221;: How British banks are complicit in Nigerian 
<i>Corruption</i> (London, 2010). 
</p>
<p> 11  There are several economic models employed to estimate illicit financial flows. The World Bank 
residual model, for example, considers the difference between the source and use of official funds, 
including additions to the country&#8223;s reserves. A difference thus suggests that money has been 
</p>
<p>misappropriated by someone with access to the Government&#8223;s coffers. Global Financial Integrity 
(GFI), a think tank that has worked for several years on the issue, estimates illicit financial flows 
through a combined measure by analysing balance of payments data to capture funds that flow 
through the banking system and trade statistics to estimate the flow of illicit funds through 
manipulated invoices in import/export operations. The strength of this method is to provide a more 
complete picture of the total amount leaving a country illicitly. GFI has further refined its 
methodology by now also providing estimates of illicit flows using the Hot Money Narrow model, 
which produces more conservative estimates. For a brief overview of the models, see Alessandra 
Fontana, &#8220;&#8222;What does not get measured, does not get done&#8223;, The methods and limitations of 
measuring illicit financial flows&#8221;, U4 Brief No. 2 (Bergen, 2010). See also United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime (UNODC), <i>Estimating illicit financial flows resulting from drug trafficking and 
other transnational organized crimes, Research report</i> (Vienna, 2011), pp. 15&#8211;18.

</p>
<p>countries of origin on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural 
rights, report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, A/HRC/19/42 and Corr.1, 
para. 5. This figure, based on data from Raymond Baker, Capitalism&#8217;s Achilles Heel: Dirty Money 
<i>and How to Renew the Free-Market System</i> (Hoboken, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2005), has been 
frequently used as an estimate by the Wold Bank and UNODC.  </p>


<p>representing between 15 per cent and 30 per cent of all official development aid (ODA) 
currently received by developing countries.16  
</p>
<p>14. The Independent Expert is concerned that, of the considerable amount of illicit funds 
referred to above, only a small proportion has been repatriated to the countries of origin. 
According to the StAR Initiative, only US$5 billion in stolen assets have been repatriated 
over the past 15 years.17 A recent survey of 30 OECD member countries showed that only 
six of these had frozen assets worth slightly over US$1.2 billion during the years 2006 to 
2009, and they had managed to return only assets worth US$227 million to foreign 
jurisdictions during these four years.18 
</p>
<p>15. Other studies also demonstrate low rates of repatriation of illicit funds or stolen 
assets to countries of origin. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) has estimated that only around 2 per cent of the estimated funds of illicit origin 
annually leaving the developing world are repatriated to their countries of origin.19 While 
the Arab Spring has renewed efforts to freeze a significant amount of stolen assets by 
politically exposed persons (such as heads of State and senior public officials) from this 
region, it is likely that only a fraction of all illicit funds can be traced and finally returned to 
their countries of origin after the required investigations. Similarly, a study analysing the 
fate of assets stolen, embezzled or otherwise unlawfully obtained by 25 prominent political 
leaders after they were forced from office shows that the overall sum of stolen assets by 
these rulers and their family members was approximately US$140 billion. However, only a 
small fraction (5 per cent) of these assets have ever been traced and frozen abroad, and even 
a smaller fraction (2.4 per cent) had been returned to new, legitimate successor 
Governments.20 
</p>
<p>16. The low level of repatriation of illicit funds is attributable to several factors, 
including the length and complexity of the asset recovery process.21 It can also be argued 
that the lack of political will on the part of the authorities of the countries of origin and 
countries where illicit funds are held is another obstacle.22

<p><b> B. Countries of origin 
</b></p>
<p>17. Studies indicate that most illicit financial outflows are from developing countries.23 
According to GFI estimates, 61.2 per cent of all illicit financial flows from developing 
countries come from Asia, mostly due to massive outflows from China and India, the 
largest developing economies in the region. Illicit financial flows related to commercial 
transfer mispricing and trade mis-invoicing are estimated to account for over 90 per cent of 
illicit financial flows from this region. Latin America and the Caribbean follow at 15.6 per 
cent, with the Middle East and North Africa at 9.9 per cent. Developing Europe follows 
with 7 per cent of illicit flows, while Africa accounts for 6.3 per cent of all illicit outflows.24  
</p>
<p>18. According to GFI, the following countries accounted for 76 per cent of all illicit 
financial outflows worldwide during the period 2001&#8211;2010: China, Mexico, Malaysia, 
Saudi Arabia, the Russian Federation, the Philippines, Nigeria, India, Indonesia and the 
United Arab Emirates (cited in order of size of estimated illicit outflows).25  
</p>
<p>19. While at first glance illicit financial outflows from least developed countries (LDCs) 
may account only for a small portion of all illicit financial outflows worldwide, they have a 
particularly negative impact on social development and the realization of social, economic 
and cultural rights in these countries. Given that LDCs account for less than 2 per cent of 
world gross domestic product (GDP) and only about 1 per cent of global trade in goods,26 
illicit financial flows from these countries are in relative terms, compared to their small 
economies, very large. The United Nations Development Programme has estimated that 
illicit flows from LDCs amounted, on average, to 4.8 per cent of their GDP over the period 
1990&#8211;2008. This means, that for every dollar received in ODA, on average, 60 cents exit 
these countries in illicit flows. In eleven LDCs, capital loss related to illicit financial flows 
was estimated to have exceeded the total ODA received. The total amount of estimated 
illicit financial flows for 39 LDCs for which sufficient data was available, amounted to 
US$246 billion, surpassing debt service payments of US$164 billion and thus constituting 
the principal contributing factor to the net resource transfer from these countries to the rest 
of the world, estimated at US$197 billion (all data for the period 1990&#8211;2008).27 
</p>
<p><b> C. Countries of destination 
</b></p>
<p>20. There is a lack of comprehensive information pertaining to where illicit funds are 
held. While in some cases significant funds may be returned by corrupt or criminal actors 
and invested in private assets, such as land and luxury estates in the countries of origin, 
most funds remain offshore.28 Usually illicit financial flows are laundered through a 
</p>
<p>  
 23  Trade mis-invoicing was the dominant method of transferring illicit funds from all regions except the 
</p>
<p>Middle East and North Africa, where it accounted for 37 per cent of total outflows during the period 
2001-2010. See Kar and Freitas, <i>Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries</i>, p. 15.

<p>complex web of corporate vehicles based in secrecy jurisdictions and tax havens and are 
subsequently invested in shares, real estate or other assets, often together with wealth 
acquired through legitimate means. Assets held offshore (that is, in jurisdictions where the 
investor has no legal residence or tax domicile) were estimated to amount to US$7.4 trillion 
in 2009.29 While European investors hold the largest amount off assets offshore &#8211; mostly in 
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Luxembourg &#8211; the percentage of wealth held 
offshore by investors from Latin America, Africa and the Middle East is particularly high. 
According to the Boston Consulting Group, investors from Latin America, the Middle East 
and Africa hold between 23.5 and 33.3 per cent of their wealth in offshore financial 
centres.30 The banking research firm MyPrivateBanking has estimated that 41 per cent of all 
offshore assets from the Middle East and Africa are in European Union countries, including 
the United Kingdom (in the Channel Islands), while 33 per cent of these offshore assets are 
located in Switzerland. The United States and Latin American and Caribbean countries 
account for 18 per cent, while Asia, notably Singapore, accounts for 8 per cent of offshore 
assets from the Middle East and North Africa.31 Australia is regarded as the main 
destination of illicit funds from Papua New Guinea. 32  
</p>
<p>21. The Asset Recovery Watch database of the StAR Initiative provides an indication of 
where stolen assets have so far been detected by criminal investigators. As of October 
2012, it covered 199 international asset recovery efforts. The database includes 49 recovery 
efforts in the United States, 32 in the United Kingdom (including the Channel Islands) and 
31 in Switzerland. Other reported recovery efforts include: Nigeria (7), France (6), Iraq (6), 
Lesotho (5) and Australia (4).33 However, the database includes only publically reported 
recovery efforts that have come to the attention of the World Bank/UNODC research team 
and may underestimate the location of illicit assets in countries or jurisdictions that have so 
far been less active in international asset recovery efforts and may not include cases 
reported in national media only. 
</p>
<p>22. During the 2009 financial crisis, the fight against tax evasion became a political 
priority in wealthy countries and the pressure on tax havens mounted. In early 2012, a study 
evaluating the &#8220;G20 tax haven crackdown&#8221;, which compelled tax havens to sign more than 
300 bilateral treaties providing for exchange of bank information, was published. The study 
concluded that these &#8220;treaties have led to a relocation of bank deposits between tax havens 
but have not triggered significant repatriations of funds. The least compliant havens have 
attracted new clients, while the most compliant ones have lost some, leaving roughly 
unchanged the total amount of wealth managed offshore&#8221;.34 While the Channel Island of 
Jersey, Luxembourg and Switzerland lost between 0.5 and 4 per cent of deposits by 
foreigners, Singapore, the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong attracted between 2 and 3 per 
cent more funds.35 Furthermore, most bilateral treaties were signed between OECD 
countries and tax havens or between tax havens, thus hardly contributing to the reduction of 
tax evasion suffered by developing countries.

<p>23. In order to enhance efforts to tackle the problem of illicit financial flows, it is critical 
that the international financial system is made more transparent and that countries of origin 
and countries of destination improve their cooperation in the fight against these flows. 
Making the global financial system more transparent requires fundamental reforms. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Current initiatives to curb illicit financial flows 
</b></p>
<p>24. There are a number of legal instruments and initiatives at the international, regional 
and national levels to address the issue of illicit financial flows, mostly resulting from 
corruption. Most of the conventions discussed below require the contracting parties to 
criminalize activities undertaken to hide or launder the proceeds of corruption and envisage 
measures to confiscate such proceeds.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Multilateral initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>25. The United Nations has been involved in combating the transfer of illicit funds 
derived from corruption for many years.36 The topic was extensively discussed during the 
drafting of the United Nations Convention against Corruption.37 The Convention, which has 
been ratified by 165 States (as of 18 February 2012) and sets a comprehensive point of 
reference for anti-corruption laws, institutions and actions of States parties, recognizes the 
return of illicit funds as a fundamental principle. Article 57, paragraph 3 (a), requires that 
the requested State party shall: &#8220;In the case of embezzlement of public funds or of 
</p>
<p>laundering of embezzled public funds &#8230; return the confiscated property to the requesting 
</p>
<p>State Party.&#8221; The same also applies to proceeds of crimes covered by the Convention. 
Article 52, paragraph 1, enjoins each State party to:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take such measures as may be necessary, in accordance with its domestic law, to 
require financial institutions within its jurisdiction &#8230; to conduct enhanced scrutiny 
of accounts sought or maintained by or on behalf of individuals who are, or have 
been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close 
associates. Such enhanced scrutiny shall be reasonably design to detect suspicious 
transactions for the purpose of reporting to competent authorities.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>26. In its resolution 1/4, the Conference of States Parties to the Convention set up the 
Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on Asset Recovery to assist the Conference 
in the implementation of its mandate relating to the return of the proceeds of corruption. 
One of its tasks is to assist in the development of cumulative knowledge in the area of asset 
recovery, including through mechanisms for locating, freezing, seizing, confiscating and 
returning the instruments and proceeds of corruption; identifying capacity-building needs 
and encouraging cooperation among relevant existing bilateral or multilateral initiatives; 
facilitating the exchange of information, good practices and ideas among States; and 
</p>
<p>  
 36  See, e.g., General Assembly resolutions 55/61, 55/188, 56/186, 57/244, 65/169 and Economic and 
</p>
<p>Social Council resolution 2001/13. See also the reports by the Secretary-General on preventing and 
combating corrupt practices and transfer of assets of illicit origin and returning such assets, in 
particular to the countries of origin, consistent with the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption, A/65/90 and A/67/96. 
</p>

corruption, A/AC.261/12. </p>


<p>building confidence and encouraging cooperation between requesting and requested 
States.38  
</p>
<p>27. In mid-2007, UNODC and the World Bank jointly launched the StAR Initiative to 
support international efforts to end safe havens for funds earned through corruption. The 
initiative offers capacity-building, policy analysis and knowledge-building and provides, 
upon request, technical assistance to countries that are operationally engaged in asset 
recovery cases. It has published several research reports and tools for practitioners 
including the<i> Asset Recovery Handbook: A Guide for Practitioners</i>.39 In 2012, the StAR 
Initiative provided country-specific technical assistance in 16 countries or groups of 
countries that can be divided in two categories: (a) assistance to countries engaged in active 
asset recovery cases; and (b) assistance to countries to build capacity to generate and 
conduct asset recovery cases (A/67/96, para. 33). The StAR Initiative also advocates for the 
effective implementation of Chapter V of the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption and other standards to detect, deter and recover the proceeds of corruption. 
</p>
<p>28. The OECD framework for fighting bribery consists of the Convention on Combating 
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, the 
Recommendation on the Tax Deductibility of Bribes to Foreign Public Officials and the 
Recommendation for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in 
International Business Transactions. However, the Convention only deals with the supply 
side of bribery (that is, when someone is offering a bribe and not when someone is asking 
for a bribe). It also does not address issues such as the use of offshore financial centres and 
practices that block effective investigation and prosecution of corruption offences. OECD 
has tracked anti-corruption and asset recovery commitments of its 30 member States and 
has been engaged jointly with the Asian Development Bank in an Anti-Corruption Initiative 
for Asia and the Pacific on the subject of asset recovery and mutual legal assistance.40   
</p>
<p>29. Combating the flow of illicit funds has been also on the agenda of the African Union 
and the Economic Commission for Africa. In March 2011, the Fourth Joint Annual 
Meetings of the African Union Conference of Ministers of Economy and Finance and 
Economic Commission for Africa Conference of Ministers of Finance, Planning and 
Economic Development adopted resolution 886 (XLIV) on illicit financial flows mandating 
the establishment of a high-level panel on illicit financial flows from Africa.41 The aim of 
the panel is to undertake extensive and in-depth studies to shed light on the extent and 
effect of illicit financial flows on national economies as well as on the human impacts of 
the phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>30. The African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption provides 
for prevention, criminalization, regional cooperation and mutual legal assistance, as well as 
the recovery of stolen assets. It covers a number of offences, including bribery (domestic

<p>and foreign), diversion of property by public officials, money-laundering, trading in 
influence, illicit enrichment and concealment of property. 
</p>
<p>31. In Europe, there are several legal instruments for fighting corruption. The European 
Union instruments are the 1997 Convention on the fight against corruption involving 
officials of the European Communities or Officials of Member States of the European 
Union and the 2003 Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA on combating corruption in the 
private sector. However, both of these instruments are concerned with penalizing and not 
preventing corruption. The Council of Europe anti-corruption instruments are the Criminal 
Law Convention on Corruption and the Civil Law Convention on Corruption, both of 
which were adopted in 1999.  
</p>
<p>32. The Inter-American Convention against Corruption, which was adopted by the 
Organization of American States in March 1996 and entered into force in March 1997, 
covers corruption in the public sector and provides for a comprehensive system of inter-
State monitoring and compliance assessments. Under the Convention, corruption includes 
bribery, domestic and foreign; illicit enrichment; money-laundering and concealment of 
property. 
</p>
<p>33. In May 2012, the G8 adopted an Action Plan on Asset Recovery within the overall 
framework of the Deauville Partnership with Arab Countries in Transition. In the plan, G8 
countries commit to a comprehensive list of actions that aim to promote cooperation and 
case assistance, capacity-building efforts and technical assistance in support of the efforts 
of Arab countries in transition in recovering assets diverted by previous regimes. In this 
context, an inaugural meeting of the Arab Forum on Asset Recovery was held in Doha from 
11 to 13 September 2012 co-organized by Qatar and the United States presidency of the 
G8, with technical support from the StAR Initiative. 
</p>
<p>34. Also worthy of mention are the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and 
FATF. The Initiative is a joint effort by civil society, business and Governments, which 
seeks to ensure that information on payments to Governments by companies in the 
extractive industries sector is published by both companies and Governments.42 It has been 
suggested, however, that for the extractive industries initiatives to be more relevant to 
efforts to tackle illicit financial flows, their transparency requirements should extend 
beyond revenues to licensing, contracts, resources flows and other production factors, as 
well as to public expenditure.43 In addition, these initiatives should integrate elements of the 
tax justice and tax evasion agendas. 
</p>
<p>35. FATF, an intergovernmental body with 36 members representing most major 
financial centres, was established by the G7 countries in 1989 to become an international 
policymaking body in the fight against money-laundering.44 It develops and promotes 
policies to combat &#8220;money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the

</i></p>
<p><i>initiatives?</i> U4 issue No. 13 (November 2011). 
 44  A key problem for FATF in its formative years was to gain international acceptance of its 
</p>
<p>recommendations beyond the participating FATF States. However, in 1998, the General Assembly, in 
its resolution S-20/4 D countering money-laundering, adopted a Political Declaration and Action Plan 
in which it identified the FATF recommendations as &#8220;the standard&#8221; by which &#8220;the measures against 
</p>
<p>money-laundering&#8221; adopted by individual States &#8220;should be judged&#8221;. See also General Assembly 
resolution 60/288; Security Council resolution 1617 (2005); and the 2009 Political Declaration and 
Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter 
the World Drug Problem.  </p>


<p>integrity of the international financial system&#8221;.45 While its regime initially focused on 
combating money-laundering related to drug trafficking, FATF has recently devoted more 
attention to the issue of laundering of the proceeds of corruption.46 In February 2012, FATF 
adopted a new set of recommendations which, if translated into national law, will provide 
an opportunity to ensure that national legislation makes it more difficult to hide illicit 
money in secrecy jurisdictions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. National initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>36. Many countries have adopted anti-money-laundering legislation enabling banks and 
other financial intermediaries to identify parties to agreements or to report any suspicious 
transactions.  
</p>
<p>37. Some countries have recently adopted measures that require companies listed on 
their stock exchange to provide information about their financial activities on a country-by-
country basis. For example, the Dodd-Franck Act in the United States requires extractive 
companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange to disclose information about their 
financial activity around the world on a country-by-country basis. On 22 August 2012, the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued binding regulations to implement the oil-
gas and mining disclosure provisions contained in the Dodd-Franck Act. Starting in 2014, 
an estimated 1,100 companies will have to start disclosing the payments they make to 
Governments on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. A directive that would 
introduce country-by-country reporting by multinational companies in the European Union 
is currently under consideration.47 Expanding country-by-country reporting to the European 
Union would be an important step, as it has been pointed out, that out of the 350 gas, oil 
and mining companies that are for example listed on the London Stock Exchange, only 14 
companies would have to report to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United 
States.48 So far such initiatives have mainly been limited to extractive industries. 
</p>
<p>38. Since 2001, the Government of Switzerland has organized informal meetings of 
Government experts on asset recovery in Lausanne. In 2011, the Government introduced a 
new law, the Restitution of Illicit Assets Act, which supplements the Federal Act on 
International Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters and provides a further legal 
basis for freezing and repatriating assets of politically exposed persons (that is, heads of 
State and senior public officials who embezzle State funds) when procedures of mutual 
legal assistance have failed to produce the desired outcome. The country has returned about 
CHF1.7 billion to countries of origin. 
</p>
<p>39. The Independent Expert welcomes the above-mentioned multilateral and national 
initiatives. Nevertheless, there are some questions about the effectiveness of some national 
initiatives which may point to the need for more robust regulation by the States concerned. 
For example, in November 2012, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority 
published an assessment of due diligence obligations of Swiss banks when handling assets 
of politically exposed persons. The study found that Swiss banks had correctly identified 22 
out of 29 customers as politically exposed persons. The study however indicated that one 
bank had applied a very narrow definition of politically exposed persons in its operations

<p>and that, in two cases, a politically exposed person had deliberately been treated as a 
normal customer, although banking staff were aware of the high-risk nature of the 
customer.49 Similarly, while the Annual Report of the Money Laundering Reporting Office 
of Switzerland for 2011 showed a surge of 40 per cent in suspicious activity reports to it by 
Swiss commercial banks from 2010 to 201150 and some observers have concluded that this 
is a sign that official measures against money laundering have increasingly become 
effective, Swiss NGOs have disputed this, pointing out that the surge of reporting to the 
Office was rather a reflection of international pressure as many Swiss banks had been 
engaged for years with corrupt customers from North Africa until the Government of 
Switzerland decided to freeze their assets.51 
</p>
<p>40. The Independent Expert considers that it is desirable that all measures to tackle illicit 
financial flows are designed with the need to promote the realization of human rights of the 
populations of the countries of origin of illicit funds, particularly the poor who 
disproportionately suffer the negative effects of the shortage of resources resulting from 
illicit financial outflows. Indeed, such an approach would be consistent with the recognition 
(explicit or implicit) in most anti-corruption conventions of the negative impact of illicit 
financial flows on development, governance and human rights.52 
</p>
<p><b> C. Other initiatives  
</b></p>
<p>41. A number of non-governmental organizations have played an important role in 
exposing corruption and lack of due diligence on the part of international banks, as well as 
drawing attention to the negative impact of illicit funds on the rule of law and the 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights. They include Global Financial Integrity, 
Global Witness, Transparency International, Publish What You Pay, Tax Justice Network, 
Christian Aid, Eurodad, Aktion Finanzplatz Schweiz and many others. Some of these 
organizations have been active in the Task Force on Financial Integrity and Economic 
Development, a consortium of Governments and research and advocacy organizations that 
focuses on achieving greater transparency in the global financial system for the benefit of 
developing countries.   
</p>
<p>42. Some organizations have campaigned for improved national legislation and policies 
to reduce the flow of illicit funds from developing countries or to ensure their repatriation, 
or provided technical assistance to Governments focusing on anti-money-laundering and

</p>
<p> 52  For example, the African Union and Council of Europe anti-corruption conventions recognize the 
threat that corruption poses to the enjoyment of human rights. Thus, the preamble to the African 
Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption refers to the States parties&#8223; awareness of 
&#8220;the need &#8230; to foster the promotion of economic, social and political rights in conformity with the 
provisions of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights and other relevant human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments&#8221; (fourth para.), while article 2, paragraph 4, states as one of the objectives of the 
Convention the promotion of &#8220;socio-economic development by removing obstacles to the enjoyment 
of economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights&#8221;. The preambles of both 
Council of Europe Conventions stress that corruption threatens the enjoyment of human rights 
(Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, fifth para., and Civil Law Convention on Corruption, fifth 
para.). </p>


<p>asset recovery. For example, the International Centre for Asset Recovery at the Basel 
Institute on Governance in Switzerland assists authorities in enhancing their capacities to 
seize, confiscate and recover the proceeds of corruption and money-laundering. To this end, 
the Centre delivers interactive, country-specific on-site training programmes conceptualized 
and devised to enhance the skills and competencies of investigators and prosecutors to 
analyse, investigate and prosecute complex corruption, financial crime and money-
laundering cases. The Centre further assists countries by facilitating mutual legal assistance 
and providing advice to concerned law enforcement authorities in handling specific asset 
recovery cases.53 
</p>
<p>43. In Norway, the U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre assists donor practitioners in 
more effectively addressing corruption challenges through their development support. U4 
offers relevant anti-corruption material, including our own applied research, through an 
extensive web-based resource centre and runs in-country and online training on anti-
corruption measures and strategies for partner agencies and their counterparts.54 
</p>
<p><b> D. The role of international assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>44. The successful repatriation of illicit funds to countries of origin and the prevention 
of further illicit financial outflows require a concerted effort by the international 
community. Thus, the United Nations Convention against Corruption and other instruments 
on corruption all contain provisions on international cooperation and/or mutual legal 
assistance.55 
</p>
<p>45. It is notable that international cooperation for development, as well as for the 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights, is an obligation of all States. The 
principle of international assistance and cooperation is underscored in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (art. 28); the Declaration on the Right to Development (art. 3, 
para. 3); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (arts. 2, para. 
1, 22 and 23) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 4). 
</p>
<p>46. In the context of addressing the human rights and development challenges posed by 
the diversion of resources through illicit financial flows, it is important to note that States 
are under a duty to ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all. Under article 2, 
paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, a State 
party is obligated to take the necessary steps &#8220;to the maximum of its available resources&#8221; to 
</p>
<p>ensure the progressive realization of the rights enshrined in the Covenant. It is accepted that 
the phrase &#8220;its available resources&#8221; refers to both the resources within a State and those 
</p>
<p>available from the international community through international assistance and 
cooperation.56 Moreover, international assistance and cooperation must be directed towards 
the establishment of a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set 
forth in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights can be fully 
realized.

<p><b> IV. Illicit funds, asset recovery and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>47. As the Independent Expert&#8223;s work on the subject matter of resolution 19/38 is 
ongoing, this section offers some preliminary comments about the impact of non-
repatriation of illicit funds to the countries of origin on the enjoyment of human rights. The 
final report of the Independent Expert on the subject will contain a detailed analysis of the 
impacts, drawing on the experiences of a number of developing countries that have been 
severely affected by the scourge of illicit financial flows.57  
</p>
<p>48. It is widely recognized that illicit funds (including the proceeds of crime, corruption, 
money-laundering and tax evasion) divert resources intended for development, thereby 
undermining Government efforts to provide basic services and their ability to comply with 
their human rights obligations.58 The diversion of resources due to illicit financial flows and 
the non-repatriation of these funds reduce the &#8220;maximum resources&#8221; available to the 
countries of origin for the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights. The 
impact is disproportionately felt by the poor. 
</p>
<p>49. The non-repatriation of illicit funds also has an impact on the rule of law in the 
country of origin. Where both the incentives for and opportunities to export illicit wealth 
are significant, it is likely that the damage to the rule of law will be exacerbated. It has been 
pointed out that &#8220;the potential to hide illicit capital securely in tax havens is a direct 
</p>
<p>stimulus to corruption and other illicit activities like transfer mispricing. It decreases the 
</p>
<p>  
 57  A recent, widely publicized case is that of Zambia. According to a report by Global Financial 
</p>
<p>Integrity, between 2001 and 2010, Zambia lost US$8.8 billion in illicit financial flows, of which 
US$4.9 billion is attributable to trade mis-invoicing. This is a massive amount for a poor developing 
country with an external debt of US$2.5 billion and a Human Development Index ranking of 164 out 
of 187 countries. In 2011, the GDP of Zambia was US$19.2 billion, while its GDP per capita was 
US$1,413. The Government collected a total of US$4.3 billion in revenue. Illicit financial outflows 
drain the country of resources needed for economic development and social investment. The loss also 
means the Government has to borrow from external sources. In 2012, the Government issued a 
Eurobond of US$750 million which pushed up the country&#8223;s external debt from US1.6 billion to 
approximately US$2.5 billion. It is notable that these illicit outflows come on top of outflows from 
legal corporate tax avoidance, mainly through abusive transfer pricing in the mining sector. 
According to the country&#8223;s Deputy Finance Minister, Miles Sampa, US$2 billion is lost yearly to tax 
avoidance by multinational corporations operating in Zambia. Of all the major multinationals that 
export copper and other metals out of Zambia, just &#8220;one or two&#8221; officially recorded a profit, and

<p>therefore pay no corporate tax. It is estimated that legislation being considered by the Government to 
close corporate tax avoidance loopholes and criminalize false reporting will enable the Government to 
raise US$1.5 billion annually. This would increase the national revenues by 35 per cent and allow 
much needed investment in education, health or infrastructure. See Sarah Freitas, &#8220;What Billions in

<p> 58  See, e.g., A/HRC/19/42. All the international legal instruments dealing with corruption recognize that 
the scourge undermines economic development.  </p>


<p>chances of detection and therefore increases the likely returns&#8221;.59 If parts of the political 
elite are able or willing to accumulate wealth through illicit outflows, economic inequalities 
are exacerbated and incentives to strengthen tax agencies, investigatory powers of police 
services, the independence of the judiciary and public audit services are low. This is in 
particular a problem in developing countries that face resource constraints in establishing 
well-equipped and independent institutions to address such complex issues like transfer 
mispricing. 
</p>
<p>50. It is important that asset recovery efforts are viewed as part of several efforts that 
States must make in order to comply with their human rights obligations. As the OHCHR 
study on the subject underscores, these &#8220;obligations apply to both countries of origin and 
recipient countries of funds of illicit origin due to the principle of international cooperation 
and assistance towards the realization of human rights, particularly economic, social, and 
cultural rights&#8221; (A/HRC/19/42, para. 24). 
</p>
<p>51. In addition, a human rights approach to asset recovery has to consider policy 
implications relating to the use of returned illicit funds. The StAR Initiative has pointed out 
that the use of returned assets is the sovereign decision of the country that recovers its 
stolen property. However, in a study on the management of returned assets, it has 
concluded that &#8220;countries that have embraced a policy of openness and transparency in the 
</p>
<p>design of arrangements for the management of returned assets have benefitted from this 
approach&#8221;.60  
</p>
<p>52. The Independent Expert supports this view. In his estimation, respect for and 
adherence to the human rights principles of transparency, accountability and participation is 
a critical factor in ensuring the prudent use of repatriated illicit funds. He further endorses 
the view advanced in the OHCHR study that &#8220;decisions over resources allocation cannot be 
made behind closed doors, but publicly and openly, with due attention to civil society&#8223;s 
demands. In some cases, lack of transparency and participation in the allocation decisions 
can end up in the use of the recovered assets to ends different from those sought by human 
rights principles&#8221; (A/HRC/19/42, para. 30). As the study underscored, since &#8220;recovered 
resources are not foreseen or public income included in the budget, States must allocate 
them in accordance with their obligation to devote the maximum of available resources to 
the fulfilment of economic, social, and cultural rights. This is the starting point with regards 
to the measures that must be taken with repatriated funds&#8221; (ibid., para. 28.) 
</p>
<p>53. It is worth noting in this regard that the Special Rapporteur on the right to education 
has recently stressed that the restitution of illicit funds frozen by the European Union would 
provide Tunisia with an opportunity to ensure and improve the realization of the right to 
education.61 In transitional countries, returned illicit assets may also help States to fulfil 
their obligations to provide reparation to victims of human rights violations of a previous 
regime.62 While not a comprehensive solution to the problem of financing transitional 
justice initiatives and reparation programmes, recovered assets have for example been used 
in Peru for anti-corruption and transitional justice measures, including truth-seeking and

<p>reparations.63 This is particularly the case if returned illicit funds derive from assets 
controlled by politically exposed persons that are alleged to have directly or indirectly been 
responsible for past human rights violations, including violations of economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>54. According to a study commissioned by the European Parliament, there is a 
comprehensive European Union regulatory framework to identify, trace, seize and 
confiscate proceeds of organized crime in the European Union. However, implementation 
of this regulatory framework is proceeding slowly. Moreover, there is no regulation 
pertaining to the social re-use of confiscated assets and most European Union member 
States do not have provision for the use of confiscated assets for civil society or for social 
purposes.64  
</p>
<p>55. Human rights are also relevant for the seizure and freezing of the proceeds of 
corruption or other criminal activities. It is notable in this regard that some provisions of the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption have been contested on human rights 
grounds. Article 31, paragraph 8, of the Convention provides that an offender must 
demonstrate the lawful origin of not only the alleged proceeds of crime but also of other 
property liable to confiscation. Nevertheless, the OHCHR study notes that &#8220;similar 
</p>
<p>provisions were analysed in a set of precedents that established the conditions that must be 
met in order not to violate due-process rights. Such precedents held that the right to be 
presumed innocent is not an absolute right, and that legal presumptions in criminal law are 
not per se restrictive to such right as long as States take into account the importance of what 
is at stake, and respect the right to defense&#8221; (A/HRC/19/42, para. 46). 
</p>
<p>56. Finally, illicit financial flows should not be a human rights concern for States only. 
While States have the primary duty to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, the Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights require business enterprises to &#8220;avoid causing or 
</p>
<p>contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities, and address such 
impacts when they occur&#8221; (guiding principle 13). Business enterprises that contribute 
through transfer mispricing, tax evasion or corruption to significant illicit financial outflows 
and undermine the abilities of States to progressively achieve the full realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights cause adverse human rights impacts. This is 
particularly the case when they operate in States that have difficulties in meeting the 
minimum core human rights obligations. The same applies to trust and company service 
providers and commercial banks that do not meet basic due diligence standards when they 
provide services or help launder and hide illicit funds in offshore financial centres.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Next steps 
</b></p>
<p>57. Over the next few months, the Independent Expert will continue gathering 
information for the study requested by the Council. Given the complexity of the subject 
matter and the paucity of empirical data concerning the human rights and development 
dimensions of the illicit financial flows, he considers that he will only be in a position to 
prepare a comprehensive study after extensive consultations with all stakeholders, including 
</p>
<p>  
 63  For an argument that transitional justice should engage more strongly with corruption and economic 
</p>
<p>crimes, see, inter alia, Ruben Carranza, &#8220;Plunder and Pain: Should Transitional Justice Engage with 
</p>
<p>Corruption and Economic Crimes?&#8221; <i>The International Journal of Transitional Justice</i>, vol. 2, No. 3 
(2008), pp. 310&#8211;330.  
</p>
<p> 64  See European Parliament, T<i>he need for new EU legislation allowing the assets confiscated from 
criminal organisations to be used for civil society and in particular for social purposes</i> (Brussels, 
2012). </p>


<p>States, United Nations bodies and agencies, as well as other international and regional 
entities engaged in addressing transfers of illicit origin or supporting the recovery and 
repatriation of stolen assets. In particular, he intends to convene an expert consultation on 
the subject bringing together experts from all regions. In this regard, he has identified a core 
group of experts. The Independent Expert therefore requests the Council to consider 
allocating sufficient funds for this activity which he considers an important part of his 
efforts to carry out the mandate set on in resolution 19/38.65   
</p>
<p>58. The Independent Expert hopes, resources permitting, to convene the expert meeting 
and finalize the report for submission to the Council at the earliest possible time.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> The magnitude and growth of illicit funds generated by crime, corruption, 
embezzlement and tax evasion, as well as their socioeconomic implications, underscore 
</b></p>
<p><b>the need for robust policy responses that will not only curtail these flows but also 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that countries of origin sufficient are able to use the maximum available 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the obligations assumed under the relevant international human rights instruments. 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> In order to develop effective strategies for tackling the problem of illicit funds 
and ensuring their repatriation to the countries of origin, it is important to 
</b></p>
<p><b>understand the methods and channels of illicit financial flows, which countries such 
</b></p>
<p><b>funds originate from and where they are held, as well as existing legal instruments 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other initiatives designed to curb these flows. This interim report, submitted 
</b></p>
<p><b>pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/38 has provided an overview of these 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues. The final report of the Independent Expert on this issue will discuss in detail 
</b></p>
<p><b>the impact of non-repatriation of illicit funds on development and the realization of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and will offer recommendations concerning strategies to combat illicit 
</b></p>
<p><b>financial flows so as to ensure the application of the maximum available resources to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the full realization of all human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> The Independent Expert looks forward to continuing his consultations and his 
dialogue with all stakeholders in order to generate sufficient information for a 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive study on this important subject as requested by the Council.    
</b></p>
<p>    
</p>
<p>  
 65  In September 2012, the Independent Expert arranged a meeting of experts on the issue of illicit funds 
</p>
<p>and human rights to generate information for the study requested in resolution 19/38, reflecting 
regional experiences concerning the impact of the non-repatriation of illicit funds to the countries of 
origin on the realization of human rights in such countries. However, the meeting was cancelled due 
to, inter alia, the insufficient resources OHCHR had been able to identify for it. It appears that the 
lack of an explicit request, in resolution 19/38, for such a consultation led to the statement of 
programme budget implications arising from the draft resolution not providing for such activity. 
According to the statement of programme budget implications, the preparation of the study requested 
in resolution 19/38 required only a three-month consultancy &#8220;to assist the Independent Expert with 
technical aspects of the research&#8221; and &#8220;conference services for translation of the study&#8221;. </p>
