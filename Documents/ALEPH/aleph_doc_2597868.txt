China Magnesium Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries 
Managing Director’s Report – 30 June 2016 
 
Managing Director’s Report 
 
Dear Shareholders 
 
I am pleased to report on continued positive progress in our journey to become a large, low cost, integrated 
producer of magnesium, semi coke, tar oil and other industrial products. 
 
Financial summary 
The Group has recorded a net loss after tax of $2.3M compared with a 2015 loss of $3.5M. 
 
During the year CMC completed the installation and testing of semi coke crackers. This allows CMC to 
commence magnesium production using semi-coke gas instead of coal-to-gas facilities.  
 
No trading of magnesium, semi coke, metallurgical coke, tar oil or calcium metals occurred during the year, as 
CMC completed the installation and testing of crackers. 
 
The Co-Operation Agreement with Shanxi Pingyao County Fengyan (Fengyan) relating to Pingyao County 
Fengyan Mineral Wool Co. Ltd. (FMW) was terminated on 24 June 2016. The financial result includes $4.5M 
share of income pursuant to the termination agreement terms  
 
Pingyao County Fengyan Mineral Wool Co. Ltd. (FMW) 
CMC completed the upgrades of the FMW production line during the financial period to 24 June 2016.  
 
During the financial period 1 July 2015 to 24 June 2016 FMW produced 13,567 tonnes of pig iron, 10,465 
tonnes of ferronickel and 415 tonnes of mineral wool.  
 
CMC terminated the Co-Operation Agreement with Fengyan with respect to FMW effective from 24 June 
2016. As part of the termination agreement Fengyan acquired CMC’s 60% interest and assumed all rights and 
responsibilities including CMC’s share of operating losses in FMW from 1 February 2015 to 24 June 2016.  
 
Fine Chemicals & Fertiliser Agreement 
During the year CMC signed a conditional agreement with Taiyuan Hailifeng Science & Technology Co. Ltd for 
the 20 year lease of business and production facilities in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province. This plant currently 
produces G3 (a cross linking agent in powder coatings for various indoor and outdoor applications), G1 (used 
in water treatment, in paints and coatings & also as slow release fertiliser) and other chemicals.  
 
Negotiation for a second 20 year lease at Shandong (Shandong Province) producing magnesium nitrate, 
sodium nitrate and other chemicals is in progress.  
 
CMC has commenced small scale chemical and fertilizer trading in the financial year.  
 
Working capital 
Pursuant to the Investment and Co-Operation Agreement with Fengyan, CMC & Fengyan have continued 
evaluation of direct working capital facilities.  
 
The termination of the FMW Co-Operation Agreement does not affect Fengyan’s continued working capital 
support, including their intention to act as guarantor for relevant working capital loans. 
 
Commodities Trading Desk 
The international trading desk is the exclusive trading desk for a number of Fengyan operations (including 
FMW) in addition to the CMC Group.

China Magnesium Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries 
Managing Director’s Report – 30 June 2016 
 
 
Looking forward 
CMC has now substantially completed all work necessary to commence production. We are encouraged by 
the co-incidental mid-year recovery in magnesium prices.  
 
We continue to seek diversification in the market offerings from magnesium and magnesium alloy into an 
array of other manufactures including semi coke and calcium metal. 
 
CMC remains committed to becoming one of the world’s largest, integrated, low cost magnesium producers, 
whilst building capacity in other industries to further leverage our strengths and advantages.
Yours sincerely,
Tom Blackhurst 
Managing Director

China Magnesium Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries  
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - 30 June 2016
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The  financial  statements  are  for  the  consolidated  entity  consisting  of  China  Magnesium  Corporation 
Limited and its subsidiaries.
(a) Basis of preparation
These  general  purpose  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian 
Accounting Standards, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards 
Board and the Corporations Act 2001. China Magnesium Corporation Limited is a for-profit entity for 
the purpose of preparing the financial statements. 
 
i)  Compliance with IFRS 
Australian Accounting Standards include Australian equivalents to International Financial Reporting 
Standards (AIFRS).  Compliance with AIFRS ensures that the consolidated financial statements of 
China  Magnesium  Corporation  Limited  comply  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards 
(IFRS).  
 
ii)  Historical cost convention 
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
 
iii) Critical accounting estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with AIFRS requires the use of certain critical 
accounting  estimates.    It  also  requires  management  to  exercise  its  judgement  in  the  process  of 
applying  the  Group’s  accounting  policies.    The  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgement  or 
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are 
disclosed in note 3. 
Material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are presented 
below and have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated.
(b) Principles of consolidation
i)  Subsidiaries 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  incorporate  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  subsidiaries  of 
China Magnesium Corporation Limited (“Company” or “parent entity”) as at 30 June 2016 and the 
results  of  its  subsidiaries  for  the  year  ended.  China  Magnesium  Corporation  Limited  and  its 
subsidiaries together are referred to in these financial statements as the Group or the consolidated 
entity. 
 
Subsidiaries  (as  stated  in  note  23)  are  all  those  entities  (including  special  purpose  entities)  over 
which the Group has control. The Group has control over an entity when the Group is exposed to, or 
has rights to variable returns from its investment with the entity and has the power to affect those 
returns. 
 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.  They 
are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group 
(refer to note 1(c)). 
 
Intercompany  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  Group 
companies  are  eliminated.  Unrealised losses are  also eliminated unless the transaction  provides 
evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred.  
 
Non-controlling  interests  in  the  results  and  equity  of  the  subsidiaries  are  shown  separately  in  the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and other Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes 
in Equity and Statement of Financial Position, respectively.
8
China Magnesium Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries  
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - 30 June 2016 
 
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(Continued)
Accounting policies of the subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency 
with the policies adopted by the Group. 
 
ii)   Changes in ownership interests
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as 
transactions  with  equity  owners  of  the  Group.  A  change  in  ownership  interest  results  in  an 
adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect 
their  relative  interests  in  the  subsidiary.  Any  difference  between  the  amount  of  the  adjustment  to 
non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognised in a separate reserve 
within equity attributable to owners of China Magnesium Corporation Limited. 
 
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair 
value  with  the  change  in  carrying  amount  recognised  in  profit  or  loss.  The  fair  value  is  the  initial 
carrying  amount  for  the  purposes  of  subsequently  accounting  for  the  retained  interest  as  an 
associate, jointly controlled entity or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised 
in  other  comprehensive  income  in  respect  of  that  entity  are  accounted  for  as  if  the  Group  had 
directly  disposed  of  the  related  assets  or  liabilities.  This  may  mean  that  amounts  previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(c) Business combinations
The  acquisition  method  of  accounting  is  used  to  account  for  all  business  combinations. 
Consideration is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity 
interests issued by the Group on acquisition date. Consideration also includes the acquisition date 
fair  values  of  any  contingent  consideration  arrangements,  any  pre-existing  equity  interests  in  the 
acquiree  and  share-based  payment  awards  of  the  acquiree  that  are  required  to  be  replaced  in  a 
business combination. The acquisition date  is the  date on  which the Group obtains control of the 
acquiree. Where equity instruments are issued as part of the consideration, the value of the equity 
instruments is their published market price at the acquisition date unless, in rare circumstances it 
can  be  demonstrated  that  the  published  price  at  acquisition  date  is  not  fair  value  and  that  other 
evidence and valuation methods provide a more reliable measure of fair value. 
 
Identifiable  assets  acquired  and 
in  business 
combinations are, with limited exceptions, initially measured at their fair values at acquisition date. 
Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  the  consideration  transferred  and  the  amount  of  the  non-
controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  over  fair  value  of  the  identifiable  net  assets  acquired.  If  the 
consideration  and  non-controlling  interest  of  the  acquiree  is  less  than  the  fair  value  of  the  net 
identifiable  assets  acquired,  the  difference  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  as  a  bargain  purchase 
price,  but  only  after  a  reassessment  of  the  identification  and  measurement  of  the  net  assets 
acquired. 
 
For each business combination, the Group measures non-controlling interests at either fair value or 
at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. 
 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed when incurred.
liabilities  and  contingent
liabilities  assumed
(d) Segment reporting
The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and 
used  by  the  Board  of  Directors  (chief  operating  decision  maker)  in  assessing  performance  and 
determining the allocation of resources. Operating segments are determined on the basis of financial 
information reported to the Board which is at the Group level.  
 
Accordingly,  management  currently  identifies  the  Group  as  having  only  one  reportable  segment, 
being the processing and sale of magnesium, ferronickel, coke and related products.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - 30 June 2016 
 
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(Continued)
There have been no changes in the operating segments during the year. Accordingly, all significant 
operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Group as one segment. The financial results 
from this segment are equivalent to the financial statements of the consolidated entity as a whole.
(e) Foreign currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency 
 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the 
currency  of  the  primary  economic  environment  in  which  the  entity  operates  (‘the  functional 
currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is China 
Magnesium Corporation Limited’s functional and presentation currency.
(ii) Transactions and balances  
 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates 
prevailing  at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the 
settlement  of  such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year  end  exchange  rates  of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except when 
they are deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or 
are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation. All foreign exchange gains and 
losses are presented in the profit or loss on a net basis within income or expenses. 
 
Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. Translation differences on assets and 
liabilities  carried  at  fair  value  are  reported  as  part  of  the  fair  value  gain  or  loss.  For  example, 
translation  differences  on  non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  such  as  equities  held  at  fair  value 
through  profit  or  loss  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  as  part  of  the  fair  value  gain  or  loss  and 
translation  differences  on  non-monetary  assets  such  as  equities  classified  as  available-for-sale 
financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
 
(iii) Group companies 
 
The functional currency of the overseas subsidiaries is Chinese Renminbi and United States Dollar. 
The  results  and  financial  position  of  foreign  operations  (none  of  which  has  the  currency  of  a 
hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency 
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
•  assets and liabilities for each Statement of Financial Position presented are translated at the
•
closing rate at the date of that Statement of Financial Position; 
income  and  expenses  for  each  Statement  of  Profit  or  Loss  and  other  Comprehensive 
Income  are  translated  at  average  exchange  rates  (unless  this  is  not  a  reasonable 
approximation  of  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  rates  prevailing  on  the  transaction  dates,  in 
which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and
•  all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
(f)  Revenue recognition
Revenue  is  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  or  receivable.  Amounts 
disclosed as revenue are net of discounts, refunds, rebates and amounts collected on behalf of third 
parties. 
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable 
that the future economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of 
the Group’s activities as described below. The Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking 
into  consideration  the  type  of  customer,  the  type  of  transaction  and  the  specifics  of  each 
arrangement.
10
China Magnesium Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries  
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - 30 June 2016 
 
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(Continued)
Revenue is recognised for the major business activities as follows: 
  
(i) Sale of magnesium, coke, ferronickel and related products 
 
The Group sells magnesium, magnesium alloys, coke products, ferronickel and related products. 
 
Domestic and export sales of goods are recognised when a Group entity has delivered products to 
the purchaser or, in the case of export sales, free on board and there is no unfulfilled obligation that 
could affect the purchasers acceptance of the products. Delivery does not occur until the products 
have been shipped to the specified delivery location or vessel, the risks of obsolescence and loss 
have  been  transferred  to  the  purchaser,  and  either  the  purchaser  has  accepted  the  products  in 
accordance  with  the  sales  contract,  the  acceptance  provisions  have  lapsed,  or  the  Group  has 
objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.  
 
(ii) Interest  
 
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
(g) Income Tax
The income tax expense or revenue for the  year is the tax payable  on the current  year’s taxable 
income based on the national income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred 
tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. 
 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising 
between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  consolidated 
financial statements.  However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time 
of  the  transaction  affects  neither  accounting  nor  taxable  profit  or  loss.    Deferred  income  tax  is 
determined  using  tax  rates  and  laws  that  have  been  enacted  or  substantially  enacted  by  the 
reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or 
the deferred income tax liability is settled. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only 
if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences 
and losses. 
 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.  
Current  tax  assets  and  tax  liabilities  are  offset  where  the  entity  has  a  legally  enforceable  right  to 
offset  and  intends  either  to  settle  on  a  net  basis,  or  to  realise  the  asset  and  settle  the  liability 
simultaneously. 
 
Current  and  deferred  tax  balances  attributable  to  amounts  recognised  directly  in  equity  are  also 
recognised directly in equity.
(h) Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.  Finance leases are capitalised at the 
lease’s  inception  at  the  fair  value  of  the  leased  property  or,  if  lower,  the  present  value  of  the 
minimum  lease  payments.    The  corresponding  rental  obligations,  net  of  finance  charges,  are 
included in other short-term and long-term liabilities.  Each lease payment is allocated between the 
liability and finance cost.  The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease term so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year.
11
China Magnesium Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries  
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - 30 June 2016 
 
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(Continued)
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the 
Group as lessee are classified as operating leases.  Payments made under operating leases (net of 
any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease.
(i)  Impairment of non-financial assets
Non-financial  assets  are  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognised for the 
amount  by  which  the  asset’s  carrying  amount  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount.    The  recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other 
assets  or  groups  of  assets  (cash-generating  units).  Non-financial  assets  other  than  goodwill  that 
suffered  an  impairment  are  reviewed  for  possible  reversal  of  the  impairment  at  the  end  of  each 
reporting period.
(j)  Cash and cash equivalents
For Statement  of Cash  Flow  presentation  purposes,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  includes  cash  on 
hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts 
are shown in current liabilities on the Statement of Financial Position.
(k) Trade and other receivables
Trade  and  other  receivables  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  and  subsequently  measured  at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Trade receivables 
are  generally  due  for  settlement  within  30  days.  They  are  presented  as  current  assets  unless 
collection is not expected for more than 12 months after the reporting date. 
 
Collectability  of  trade  and  other  receivables  is  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Debts  which  are 
known  to  be  uncollectible  are  written  off  by  reducing  the  carrying  amount  directly.  An  allowance 
account (provision for impairment of receivables) is used when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Significant  financial  difficulties  of  the  debtor,  probability  that  the  debtor  will  enter  bankruptcy  or 
financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 30 days overdue) are 
considered indicators that the receivable is impaired. The amount of the impairment allowance is the 
difference  between  the  asset's  carrying  amount  and  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash 
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to short-term receivables 
are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. 
 
The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. When a receivable for which an 
impairment  allowance  had  been  recognised  becomes  uncollectible  in  a  subsequent  period,  it  is 
written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 
are credited against other expenses in profit or loss.
(l)  Inventories
Raw materials and stores, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of 
variable and fixed overhead expenditure - the latter being allocated on the basis of normal operating 
capacity. Costs are assigned to individual items of inventory on the basis of weighted
12
China Magnesium Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries  
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - 30 June 2016 
 
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(Continued)
average costs. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. 
Net  realisable  value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  less  the 
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
(m)  Investments and other financial assets
Classification 
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through 
profit  or  loss,  loans  and  receivables,  held-to-maturity  investments  and  available-for-sale  financial 
assets.    The  classification  depends  on  the  purpose  for  which  the  investments  were  acquired.  
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and, in the case of 
assets classified as held-to-maturity, re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date. 
 
i)  Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that 
are  not  quoted  in  an  active  market.  They  are  included  in  current  assets,  except  for  those  with 
maturities  greater  than  12  months  after  the  reporting  period  which  are  classified  as  non-current 
assets.  
 
ii)  Held-to-maturity investments 
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
and fixed maturities that the Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to 
maturity.  If the Group were to sell  other than an insignificant  amount of held-to-maturity financial 
assets, the whole category would be tainted and reclassified as available-for-sale.  Held-to-maturity 
financial  assets  are  included  in  non-current  assets,  except  for  those  with  maturities  less  than  12 
months from the reporting date, which are classified as current assets.
iii) Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or 
not  classified  in  any  of  the  other  categories.    They  are  included  in  non-current  assets  unless 
management  intends  to  dispose  of  the  investment  within  12  months  of  the  reporting  date.  
Investments  are  designated  as  available-for-sale  if  they  do  not  have  fixed  maturities  and  fixed  or 
determinable payments and management intends to hold them for the medium to long term.   
 
Recognition and de-recognition 
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date - the date on which 
the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.  Investments are initially recognised at fair value 
plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.  Financial 
assets carried at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value and transaction 
costs are expensed. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from 
the  financial  assets  have  expired  or  have  been  transferred  and  the  Group  has  transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 
 
Measurement  
After  initial  recognition,  loans  and  receivables  and  held-to-maturity  investments  are  carried  at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.  Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at 
fair value.
13
China Magnesium Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries  
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - 30 June 2016 
 
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(Continued)
Impairment of Financial Assets 
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a 
financial  asset  or  group  of  financial  assets  is  impaired.  A  financial  asset  or  a  group  of  financial 
assets  is  impaired  and  impairment  losses  are  incurred  only  if  there  is  objective  evidence  of 
impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a 
‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the 
financial  asset  or  group  of  financial  assets  that  can  be  reliably  estimated.  In  the  case  of  equity 
investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the 
security below its cost is considered an indicator that the assets are impaired.
(n) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.  
 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow 
to  the  Group  and  the  cost  of  the  item  can  be  measured  reliably.  The  carrying  amount  of  any 
component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced.  All other repairs and 
maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the reporting year in which it is incurred. 
 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost or revalued amounts, 
net of their residual values, over the estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements 
and certain leased plant and equipment, the shorter lease term as follows:
– Buildings 25-40 years 
– Plant and equipment 3-15 years 
– Vehicles 5-8 years 
– Leasehold land 50 years 
– Quarry 10 years
An  asset’s  carrying  amount  is  written  down  immediately  to  its  recoverable  amount  if  the  asset’s 
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 
 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These 
are included in profit or loss.
(o) Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of 
the year which are unpaid.  The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 – 60 days of 
recognition. Amounts received in respect of subscriptions for the issue of shares in the Company are 
also included in trade and other payables until the shares are issued.
(p) Borrowings
All  loans  and  borrowings  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value,  net  of  transaction  costs  incurred. 
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds 
(net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period 
of  the  loans  and  borrowings  using  the  effective  interest  method.  Fees  paid  for  establishing  loan 
facilities are recognised as transaction costs if it is probable that some or all of the facility will be 
drawn down, and deferred until the draw down occurs. If it is not probable that the facility will be 
drawn  down,  fees  are  capitalised  as  prepayments  for  liquidity  services  and  amortised  over  the 
period to which the facility relates.
14
China Magnesium Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries  
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - 30 June 2016
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 
Borrowings are derecognised from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the 
contract has been discharged, cancelled or expires. The difference between the carrying amount of the 
borrowing  derecognised  and  the  consideration  paid  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  as  other  income  or 
finance costs 
 
Where the terms of a borrowing are renegotiated and the group issues equity instruments to a creditor to 
extinguish all or part of a borrowing, the equity instruments issued as part of the debt for equity swap are 
measured at the fair value of the equity  instruments issued, unless the fair value cannot be measured 
reliably,  in  which  case,  they  are  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  the  debt  extinguished.  The  difference 
between the carrying amount of the debt extinguished and the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
is recognised as a gain or loss in profit or loss. 
 
All  borrowings  are  classified  as  current  liabilities  unless  the  Group  has  an  unconditional  right  to  defer 
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
(q) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and 
the amount has been reliably estimated.  Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. 
 
Provisions  are  measured  at  the  present  value  of  management’s  best  estimate  of  the  expenditure 
required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.  The discount rate used to determine 
the  present  value  reflects  current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the  risks 
specific to the liability.  The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as 
interest expense.
(r) Employee benefits
i)  Short-term obligations 
Liabilities  for  wages  and  salaries,  including  non-monetary  benefits  are  recognised  in  respect  of 
employees'  services  up  to  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  and  are  measured  at  the  amounts 
expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. All other short-term employee benefit obligations 
are presented as payables. 
 
ii)  Other long-term employee benefit obligations 
The liability for long service leave and annual leave are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 
months  after  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  They  are  recognised  in  the  provision  for  employee 
benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of 
services  provided  by  employees  up  to  the  reporting  date  using  the  projected  unit  credit  method.  
Consideration  is  given  to  expected  future  wage  and  salary  levels,  experience  of  employee 
departures and  years of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at 
the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as 
closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. 
 
iii)  Termination benefits 
The Group recognises termination benefits as an expense and a liability on the earlier of when the 
Group: 
• 
•
can no longer withdraw the offer and the benefits; and  
recognises  costs  for  restructuring  under  AASB137  Provisions,  Contingent  Liabilities  and 
Contingent Assets which involves the payment of termination benefits. Benefits falling due more 
than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to the present value.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - 30 June 2016
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(Continued)
(s) Contributed equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.  
 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity instruments, for example as the result 
of a share buy-back or a share-based payment plan, the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable  incremental  costs  (net  of  income  taxes)  is  deducted  from  equity  attributable  to  the 
owners of China Magnesium Corporation Limited as treasury shares until the shares are cancelled 
or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net 
of  any  directly  attributable  incremental  transaction  costs  and  the  related  income  tax  effects,  is 
included in equity attributable to the owners of China Magnesium Corporation Limited.
(t)  Dividends
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no 
longer at the discretion of the Group, on or before the end of the financial year but not distributed at 
reporting date.
(u) Earnings per share
i)   Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
•
the profit attributable to owners of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other 
than ordinary shares
•  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares  outstanding  during  the  financial  year, 
adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year and excluding treasury 
shares.
ii)  Diluted earnings per share 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share 
to take into account:
•
•
the  after  income  tax  effect  of  interest  and  other  financing  costs  associated  with  dilutive 
potential ordinary shares, and 
the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding 
assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
(v) Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the 
GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. Where the GST is not recoverable from 
the taxation authority it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the 
expense. 
 
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable.  The net 
amount  of  GST  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the  taxation  authority  is  included  with  other 
receivables or payables in the Statement of Financial Position.   
 
Cash  flows  are  presented  on  a  gross  basis.    The  GST  components  of  cash  flows  arising  from 
investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are 
presented as operating cash flow.

(w)  New accounting standards and interpretations
No new or revised Australian Accounting Standards that have been issued but not yet effective have 
been applied in the preparation of these financial statements. Such standards are not expected to 
have a material impact on the Group’s financial report on initial application.
NOTE 2: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
(a) General Objectives, Policies and Processes
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of 
financial instruments. This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in 
respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.  
 
There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its 
objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them 
from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.  
 
The principal financial instruments from which financial instrument risk arises are: 
•  Cash and cash equivalents 
•  Trade and other receivables 
•  Secured loans 
•  Trade and other payables 
 
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management 
objectives and policies.  
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, 
interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management 
program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the financial performance of the Group. 
The Group uses different methods to measure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These 
methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate, foreign exchange and price risks 
and aging analysis for credit risk.  
Risk  management  is  carried  out  under  policies  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors.    The  Board 
provides principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as, 
interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of excess liquidity.
Market risk arises from the use of interest bearing and foreign currency financial instruments. It is 
the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in interest rates (interest rate risk) and foreign exchange rates (currency risk). Cash and a 
secured loan are the only financial instruments of the Group that are subject to interest rate risk. 
Cash earns interest at a standard variable rate and the secured loan bears interest at a variable 
rate.  
Foreign currency risk arises from the Group’s investment in its foreign controlled subsidiaries. The 
currency in which transactions with these investments are primarily denominated is the Chinese 
Renminbi, United States Dollar and Singapore Dollar. The Group’s investment in its subsidiaries is 
not hedged.
(c) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency 
exposure to the Chinese Renminbi, Singapore Dollar and the United States Dollar.
(b) Market risk
17
China Magnesium Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries  
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - 30 June 2016 
 
NOTE 2: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)
Foreign  exchange  risk  arises  in  particular  from  the  Group’s  loans,  payables  and  commitment  for 
capital expenditure that is denominated in Chinese Renminbi that is not offset by financial  assets 
denominated in Chinese Renminbi. The Group’s exposure to such expenditure at 30 June 2016 was 
AUD  $3,485,424  (2015:  AUD  $3,799,774).  A  change  of  10%  +  or  –  in  the  exchange  rate  of  the 
Australian Dollar to the Chinese Renminbi would have an impact on Other Comprehensive Income 
of an increase of AUD $316,857 (2015: AUD345,434) or a decrease of AUD$387,269 (2015: AUD 
$422,197), respectively. 
Foreign exchange risk arises from the Group’s cash holdings in Singapore Dollars. At 30 June 2016 
the Group held AUD$329,424 in Singapore Dollars (2015: AUD$721,427). A change of 10% + or – 
in the exchange rate of the Australian Dollar to the Singapore Dollar would have an impact on Other 
Comprehensive Income of a decrease of AUD $29,948(2015: AUD $65,584) or an increase of AUD 
$36,603 (2015: AUD $80,159), respectively. 
Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Group’s cash holdings and trade receivables in United 
States Dollars. At 30 June 2016 the Group had cash holdings and receivables of AUD$82,715 in 
United States Dollars (2015: AUD$603,609). A change of 10% + or – in the exchange rate of the 
Australian Dollar to the United States Dollar would have an impact on Other Comprehensive Income 
of  a  decrease  of  AUD  $7,520  (2015:  AUD  $54,874)  or  an  increase  of  AUD  $9,191  (2015:  AUD 
$67,068), respectively.
(d) Credit risk
(e) Liquidity risk
Credit risk is the risk that the other party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge their obligation 
resulting in the Group incurring a financial loss. The maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting 
date is the  balances recognised in cash and trade  and  other  receivables.  Cash  is  deposited  with 
major banks in Australia, (National Australia Bank and Bank of China), China (China Construction 
Bank), and Singapore (United Overseas Bank and CIMB Bank Berhad).
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall 
due.  The  objective  of  managing  liquidity  risk  is  to  ensure,  as  far  as  possible,  that  the  Group  will 
always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they fall due.  
 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding 
through access to debt or equity funding sources. The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously 
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and 
liabilities.

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and borrowings are assumed to 
approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
NOTE 3: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other 
factors, including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the Group and that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
 
(a) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting estimates will, by 
definition,  seldom  equal  the  related  actual  results.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below. 
 
(b)  Going concern
The  Directors  have  prepared  the  financial  report  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which  contemplates  the 
continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in 
the normal course of business. 
 
The  Group  incurred  a  net  loss  of  $2,341,665  and  an  operating  cash  outflow  of  $2,115,345  for  the 
financial  year  ended  30  June  2016.  At  that  date  the  Group  was  in  a  net  current  asset  position  of 
$921,553. Included in net current assets is VAT receivable of $811,095 that will only be recovered once 
the Group generates sufficient income in China.  
 
Also included in net current assets are trade creditors of $1,949,687 which the Group has entered into 
formal  arrangements  to  extend  payment  terms  for  work  completed  up  to  1  year  after  the 
commencement of production. 
 
The  Group  also  has  $1,211,769  capital  commitments  in  relation  to  its  Pingyao  operations.  Further 
details are provided in Note 20. 
In forming a view that the Group is a going concern, the directors have assumed:-
•  Continued financial support from creditors who have agreed to extended terms of payment; 
•  Pingyao plant is projected to contribute to positive cash flow by 30 April 2017 
•  Fengyan will continue to provide working capital facilities to SYMC pursuant to the Investment
and Co-Operation Agreement announced 17 December 2013
•  Continued expansion of cash flow positive chemicals and fertiliser trading 
•  Capacity to raise working capital from exercise of options and other means, including directors’
loans

NOTE 3: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS 
(continued) 
 
.(b) Going concern (continued) 
 
Should all of the above  assumptions not eventuate, there exists a material uncertainty regarding  the 
Company’s  and  Group’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  realise  its  assets  and  settle  its 
liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the financial 
statements. No adjustment has been made to the financial statements relating to the recoverability and 
classification  of  the  assets  and  the  carrying  amount  and  classification  of  the  liabilities  should  the 
directors assumptions not eventuate. 
 
(c) 
 
On 1 February 2015 CMC Commodities Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of China Magnesium 
Corporation Limited, entered into a Co-operation Agreement with FMW, pursuant to which arose 
benefits of synergy in the marketing and distribution of magnesium, ferronickel, semi coke and other 
industrial products in which the two partnering entities specialise.
Pingyao Country Fengyan Mineral Wool Co. Ltd. (FMW)
For a consideration of RMB100 Shanxi Pingyao County Fengyan Coal Group (Fengyan) acquired 
CMC’s 60% interest in FMW, all rights & responsibilities of FMW, and CMC’s share of the operating 
loss for the period 1 February 2015 to 24 June 2016. Pursuant to this the Co-operation Agreement 
between CMC and Fengyan with respect to FMW was terminated effective 24 June 2016.
(d) Impairment Assessment
The Group assesses impairment at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Group 
that may lead to impairment of assets. Value-in-use calculations performed in assessing recoverable 
amounts incorporate a number of key estimates and require the Group to estimate the future cash flows 
expected  to  arise  from  the  cash-generating  units  and  a  suitable  discount  rate  in  order  to  calculate 
present value. 
 
These  calculations  use  cash  flow  projections  covering  a  five  year  period  that  are  based  on  financial 
forecasts  of  how  the  business  is  expected  to  operate  based  on  current  performance  consistent  with 
previous experience and external data, excluding any benefit expected to arise from future restructuring 
or from improved asset performance. Cash flows  beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using 
perpetual growth rates. 
 
The key assumptions used include the expansion of planned production, commodity pricing, costs of 
production and discount rate. Production is planned to increase to the First Phase magnesium capacity 
of 20,000tpa, together with increased production of semi-coke etc. assumed in the cash flow projections 
by March 2017. Commodity pricing has been based on current market prices for the different products 
produced. Costs of production are based on an assessment of costs following pilot production trials. 
 
In performing value-in-use calculations, the company has applied a post-tax discount rate to discount 
the  forecast  future  cash  flows.  Discount  rates  represent  the  current  market  assessment  of  the  risks 
specific to each cash generating unit, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual 
risks  of  the  underlying  assets  that  have  not  been  incorporated  into  the  cash  flow  estimates.  The 
discount  rate  calculation  is  based  on  the  specific  circumstances  of  the  Group  and  its  operating 
segments  and  is  derived  from  its  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  The  WACC  takes  into 
account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by 
the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on the interest bearing borrowings the Group is obliged 
to service. A risk premium is included in each CGU’s discount rate, reflecting the level of forecasting, 
size, country and financing risk for that CGU. The post-tax discount rate used is 13.93%.

NOTE 4: SEGMENT INFORMATION 
 
(a) Description of segments
The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and 
used  by  the  Board  of  Directors  (chief  operating  decision  maker)  in  assessing  performance  and 
determining the allocation of resources. Operating segments are determined on the basis of financial 
information reported to the Board, which is at the Group level.  
Accordingly,  management  currently  identifies  the  Group  as  having  only  one  reportable  segment, 
being  the  processing  and  sale  of  magnesium,  ferronickel,  coke  and  related  products.  There  have 
been no changes in the operating segments during the year. All significant operating decisions are 
based  upon  analysis  of  the  Group  as  one  segment.  The  financial  results  from  this  segment  are 
equivalent to the financial statements of the consolidated entity as a whole.
