MISCELLANEOUS JURISDICTION

MISCELLANEOUS ACTION NO: HAM0047 OF 2003S

Between:

STATE
Applicant

And:

SEREMAIA BALELALA
Respondent

Counsel: Mr. N. Lajendra for State
Respondent in Person

Hearing: 4th December 2003
Ruling: 4th December 2003

RULING

The accused is now convicted on 3 counts of rape and 1 count of Wrongful Confinement. A custodial sentence according to sentencing authorities is likely. The presumption in favour of bail is rebutted in the case of a convicted offender. In this case it is in the public interest to hold the accused in remand until he is sentenced on the 23rd of December 2003.

Bail is refused.
