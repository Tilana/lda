</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 2005/82 established the mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan. Sima Samar was appointed as 
mandate-holder. The Special Rapporteur was requested to monitor the human rights situation in 
the Sudan and report to the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly. The 
Human Rights Council, in resolution 6/34, decided to extend for one year the mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur, in accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/82. 
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 6/34, the Council further requested the Special Rapporteur to ensure effective 
follow-up and to foster the implementation of the remaining short- and medium-term 
recommendations identified in the first report of the group of experts mandated by the Human 
Rights Council in resolution 4/8 (the group of experts)<b>2</b> through an open and constructive 
dialogue with the Government of the Sudan, taking into account the final report of the group of 
experts<b>3</b> and the replies of the Government thereon, and to include information in this regard in 
her report to the Council at its ninth session. The addendum to this report contains information in 
this regard. 
</p>
<p>3. In resolution 7/16, the Council expressed particular concern that perpetrators of past and 
ongoing serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have not yet been 
held accountable for their crimes and urged the Government of the Sudan to address urgently this 
question by thoroughly investigating all allegations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law violations, promptly bringing to justice the perpetrators of those violations. 
The Council urged the Government of the Sudan to continue cooperating fully with the Special 
Rapporteur and to respond favourably to her request to visit all parts of the Sudan to provide her 
with all the necessary information to enable her to fulfil her mandate even more effectively. 
</p>
<p>4. This report covers the period January to July 2008 and updates the report presented to the 
seventh session of the Human Rights Council in March 2008.<b>4</b> It reflects the findings of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visits to Sudan, which were undertaken from 28 February 
to 10 March 2008 and from 29 June to 11 July 2008, respectively. 
</p>
<p>5. During her first visit to the Sudan this year the Special Rapporteur focused on the situation 
in northern Sudan, eastern Sudan and Darfur. The Special Rapporteur visited Kober prison in 
Khartoum and interviewed three groups of people on the circumstances of their arrest, detention 
and trial: defendants charged in connection with the murder of a student at Nilein University in 
February 2007; detainees sentenced to death for the murder of newspaper editor Mohamed Taha; 
and detainees sentenced to between 10 and 20 years&#8217; imprisonment for allegedly having plotted a 
coup in 2004. In her second visit to the country the Special Rapporteur focused on the situation 
in northern Sudan, Darfur, the transitional areas and Southern Sudan.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of National Unity, and the 
Government of Southern Sudan for their cooperation during her visits. She wishes to thank all 
her interlocutors and counterparts for their contribution. She regrets that she was not allowed 
access to Northern State<b>5</b> and some of the officials and institutions in Khartoum which she had 
expressed the wish to visit,<b>6</b> as necessary for the discharge of her mandate. She also regrets that 
the Government refused to issue a visa for the United Nations human rights officer assigned to 
service her mandate to travel with her to the Sudan in June 2008. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of National Unity for the information 
provided with regard to action taken to implement the recommendations of the group of experts 
to further the protection of human rights in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the United Nations Mission in Sudan 
(UNMIS) and the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) human 
rights sections for the support they provided and all the people who took the time to provide her 
with information about the human rights situation in the Sudan. She commends the national 
human rights defenders and the international agencies for their hard work in further promoting 
and protecting human rights, and in providing humanitarian assistance to the people in need. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL SITUATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. Sudan is State party to a number of international human rights instruments.<b>7</b> The second 
periodic report of the Sudan to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was due 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  The Special Rapporteur planned to undertake a three-day visit to Northern State during her 
</p>
<p>visit to Sudan in March 2008 to assess the situation of communities affected by the 
Merowe Dam and the planned Kajbar Dam. Although the programme had been carefully 
coordinated with the Government and the United Nations had provided security clearance, 
permission to travel to Northern State was withdrawn the day prior to her departure, on the 
advice of the State Security Committee. The reasons provided were that the security services had 
observed mobilization in the areas affected by the dam project, as well as the presence of 
political party representatives and foreign observers. Two foreign nationals had been arrested 
and deported from Northern State. United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) Human Rights 
has been denied access to the area since August 2006. 
<b>6
</b>  National Intelligence and Security Services and Dam Implementation Unit. 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and its two Optional Protocols, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, the 1926 Genocide Convention, the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 
two Additional Protocols, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. Sudan is also 
a signatory to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. It has recently referred 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to parliament for ratification. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>on 30 June 2003, and the deadline for the third periodic report was 30 June 2008. In addition to 
the reports due under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
follow-up report to the 2007 concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee is due on 
1 August 2008. The overdue 12th to 16th periodic reports to the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination have been due every two years since 20 April 2002 and the report to the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict was due on 26 August 2007. 
</p>
<p>10. In June and July 2008, UNMIS human rights section, in cooperation with the Advisory 
Council on Human Rights of the Government of Sudan (ACHR) and the Ministry of Legal 
Affairs and Constitutional Development (MOLACD), organized workshops in Khartoum and 
Juba on obligations to implement and report under the international human rights treaties ratified 
by Sudan. Special attention was given to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, in view of the expressed decision of the Government of the Sudan to complete 
its report on implementation of this treaty. The workshop also covered the treaties that had not 
been ratified by the Sudan, to advance the discussion about the implications of ratifying them. 
The workshop concluded with the development of a list of recommendations on the matter. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  National framework, institutions and reforms 
</b></p>
<p>11. Some progress has been made in implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
(CPA) during the reporting period. With regard to the national legal framework, according to 
information provided by the Legislative Committee of the National Assembly, by July 2008 
59 new bills had been passed by the National Assembly and other bills had been presented. The 
laws passed include, amongst others, the Armed Forces Act, the Criminal Procedure Act, the 
Elections Act, the Joint Integrated Units Act, the National Civil Service Act, the Police Forces 
Act and the Political Parties Act. 
</p>
<p>12. The Elections Act was passed on 7 July 2008 and was signed into law by the President 
on 14 July 2008. According to information received, the Act allocated 40 per cent of seats for 
proportional representation to enable a better representation for small parties and regional 
groups; 60 per cent of seats were designated for geographical constituents; and 25 per cent of 
seats were allocated for women who may also compete for other seats. The Act also provides for 
the establishment of an electoral commission. 
</p>
<p>13. Amongst the laws not reformed or passed are those governing the National Intelligence 
and Security Services (NISS) and establishing the national human rights commission. According 
to the Government these are subject to extensive consultations and scheduled to be passed during 
the next session of the National Assembly commencing in October 2008. During previous 
missions to the Sudan the Special Rapporteur was informed that these laws will be passed but 
there has been no progress. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to prioritize these laws 
in the interest of improving the human rights situation in the country. 
</p>
<p>14. The revised amended version of the 2004 Child Act was finalized by the Legal Reform 
Committee and forwarded to the Cabinet of Ministers for review and endorsement. The Special 
Rapporteur is pleased to note that the bill defines a child as a person who has not yet reached the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>age of 18 and revokes &#8220;signs of maturity&#8221; as a criterion for defining a child as adopted by the 
previous Act. It also prohibits female genital mutilation, raises the age of criminal responsibility 
to the age of 18, dedicates a section for juvenile trials, and provides for the creation of a special 
prosecutor and courts. The bill also elaborates on the means of reform and rehabilitation and 
provides better guarantees for children with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>15. The fifth national census in the Sudan conducted from 22 April to 6 May 2008 received 
widely differing reactions around the country with some stating it had been successful and others 
complaining of underrepresentation of certain elements of the population. In Darfur, the census 
operation went ahead despite the opposition of all non-signatories to the Darfur Peace 
Agreement and the Minni Minawi faction of the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA). Internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) resisted enumeration in a number of camps despite attempts by the 
United Nations and the international community to break the impasse, and areas in 
Western Darfur bordering Chad and Southern Darfur remained inaccessible to enumerators 
owing to the prevailing insecurity. Government officials reported a coverage rate of 85 per cent 
in Western Darfur and 90 per cent in Northern and Southern Darfur. The National Population 
Council has announced that it will estimate the number of people not reached by enumerators on 
the basis of the 1993 census results. 
</p>
<p>16. On 8 June 2008, President Al Bashir issued Republican Decree 146 adopting a landmark 
agreement between the National Congress Party and the Sudan Peoples&#8217; Liberation Movement 
entitled &#8220;The Road Map for Return of IDPs and Implementation of Abyei Protocol&#8221;. The four 
main points outlined were: security arrangements, return of IDPs, an interim administration and 
final arbitration. A follow-up to the decree, specifying the modalities for the establishment of the 
interim administration was issued on 15 June 2008. The road map establishes the geographical 
boundaries of the interim administration in an agreed map that was attached to Decree 146. It 
also gives the Abyei administrative area a special status under the Presidency and establishes the 
Abyei Executive Council, Abyei Security Committee, and Abyei Area Council, and outlines how 
they will be financed. This interim agreement will come into effect pending the result of the final 
arbitration process. 
</p>
<p>17. The Speaker of the Southern Sudan Legislative Assembly (SSLA) announced that the 
Code of Civil Procedure Bill, the Southern Sudan Research Council Bill, the Personal Income 
Tax Provisional Order Bill, the Appropriation Bill, the Judiciary Bill, the Judicial Service 
Council Bill and the Kush Institution Bill have been passed into law. 
</p>
<p>18. In summary, there has been some progress, however significant portions of the CPA 
relating to strengthening the human rights record of the Sudan have not been implemented and as 
a result, the human rights legal and institutional framework remains weak. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  General human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>19. In the present report the Special Rapporteur briefly highlights the most significant events 
which have occurred during the period under review, region by region. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II.  NORTHERN SUDAN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Justice and Equality Movement attack, 10 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>20. On 10 May 2008 armed members of the Darfurian Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) 
launched an attack on Khartoum. The United Nations Secretary-General condemned the attack 
and expressed concern over its possible effect on civilian lives and property. The fighting that 
took place in the Omdurman district of Khartoum entailed violations of international human 
rights and humanitarian law reportedly committed by both sides. The Government&#8217;s response in 
the weeks after the attack entailed serious violations of civil and political rights. </p>
<p>21. Child soldiers as young as 11 years old were apparently used in the JEM attack. The 
Government has taken the commendable decision to allow independent observers access to the 
captured child combatants. In line with the Government&#8217;s findings that these children were 
forcibly recruited they should be treated as victims of the conflict. This includes attempting to 
trace their families and ensuring they are not prosecuted in relation to the attack but demobilized 
and fully reintegrated in society. While access for international observers to the children was a 
positive development, the children were subjected to repeated interviewing by a range of actors, 
among them criminal investigators, international journalists and members of international 
organizations, with seemingly little consideration given by the authorities to the possibility that 
this might re-traumatize them. They were also used as principal witnesses in court for the trial of 
JEM combatants. The authorities should have taken every measure to ensure that the procedures 
would be child-friendly and to protect the identity of the children so as not to put them or their 
families at risk of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>22. In the days following the attack, pictures and names of some of the captured alleged child 
combatants were made public by the Government. The public exposure of photographs of the 
children and their identity details may undermine future efforts for their reintegration. 
</p>
<p>23. On 11 July 2008 the Special Rapporteur was given access to some 90 children who are 
being detained in a training facility 90 km north-east of Khartoum. According to Government 
sources, all were child combatants captured after the Omdurman attacks. The visit took place in 
the presence of members of ACHR. The children were held in good conditions of detention and 
appeared to be well cared for. 
</p>
<p>24. Before international observers were given access to the children, they were held for around 
three weeks without contact with the outside world. The children reported that prior to being 
moved to a separate detention facility, they had been held for several days, together with adults, 
in a large hangar whose location they were unable to identify. They indicated that detention 
conditions there had been harsh but did not provide further details. More than 10 children, who 
remained detained with adult suspects after most of the children had been transferred to a 
separate detention facility, were charged along with adults for criminal offences related to the 
Omdurman attacks. Seven of them have been excluded from the judicial proceedings at different 
stages of the trials, on the grounds that they were minors. One defendant believed to be 16 years 
old was sentenced to death on 31 July; the judge reportedly had not agreed to conduct a medical 
examination to determine his age. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>25. The use of child soldiers is not limited to the Omdurman attacks. Compounding numerous 
reports of the use of child combatants, during her visits the Special Rapporteur encountered some 
child soldiers recruited by different factions, including the Sudanese armed forces. 
Encouragingly, the Government&#8217;s Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) 
Commission continues to be very active in its efforts to campaign against the recruitment and use 
of child soldiers and carries out reintegration programmes in close collaboration with the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), as well as other international partners. 
</p>
<p>26. According to the Government, 34 civilian deaths were caused as a result of the fighting in 
Omdurman. There were reports of serious violations by combatants on both sides, including the 
targeted killings of civilians, indiscriminate fire, the disproportionate use of force and the 
execution of wounded or captured enemy combatants. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Arbitrary arrests and detention 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Government responded to the events of 10 May by making numerous arrests. 
According to police figures, in the Khartoum area 481 people were detained and then released 
again in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Other sources have reported that several hundred 
civilians were arbitrarily arrested and detained without charge in the aftermath of the attacks, in 
addition to combatants and some 90 alleged child combatants. At the end of July, two and a half 
months after the attacks, some 500 were feared to still be in NISS detention, their whereabouts 
unknown, and the authorities had provided no specific information on those in detention to 
relatives or human rights workers. Other sources report even higher figures of detainees 
remaining in custody in connection with the attack. Those held reportedly include human rights 
activists, journalists, family members of the accused, and women. As the United Nations still 
does not have access to places of detention in Khartoum, the exact number of detainees is 
impossible to verify. The large majority of those detained appear to be of Darfurian origin and 
there is credible evidence that many of them were arrested on grounds of their ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>28. According to reports, detainees have been held incommunicado. There were allegations of 
torture, mistreatment and inhumane detention, with some sources even reporting a number of 
deaths in custody. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s request to visit detainees other than the captured 
child combatants was refused by the Government, which stated that the detainees could only 
meet with their defence counsels. The Ministry of Justice gave assurances that &#8220;the 
Government&#8217;s firm policy is that nobody will be tortured&#8221; and ACHR has expressed a 
willingness to follow up on any allegations of torture in coordination with UNMIS. However, no 
information has been provided with regard to the whereabouts of the estimated 500 persons who 
have been subjected to enforced disappearance. The Special Rapporteur must express her grave 
concern about the safety of the detainees and urge the Government to investigate the allegations 
of torture. She encourages ACHR to respond to the letters submitted in this regard by the 
Director of the UNMIS human rights section. 
</p>
<p>29. In addition to those held without charge, some 64 persons have been charged with criminal 
offences in connection with alleged participation in the 10 May attack and brought before special 
courts created under the 2001 Terrorism Act. This is the first time anyone has been tried under 
this Act. Several accounts of the trials have emphasized incompatibilities with international legal </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>due process standards. These have reportedly included severe limitations on access of appointed 
defence counsels to their clients and refusal by the courts to take due account of and investigate 
allegations of torture made by the defendants. Also, the courts operate in accordance with 
specific rules of procedure, set out by the Chief Justice in consultation with the Minister of 
Justice. These administrative orders override laws enacted by parliament, including the 
protection they offer from unfair trial. The Government should strictly observe due process, in 
particular for those accused of serious crimes who may be facing severe sentences or the death 
penalty. 
</p>
<p>30. On 29 and 31 July 2008, three of the five anti-terrorism courts in Khartoum 
pronounced 30 death sentences for alleged participation in the 10 May attacks on Omdurman. 
The verdict was reached chiefly on the basis of confessions which the defendants said they were 
forced to make under torture or ill-treatment and which they retracted in court. Another 
important element were testimonies by some of the children detained since the attacks on 
account of their alleged participation in the attacks. The children stated in court that they 
recognized the defendants as having been among the attackers. Defence lawyers will be 
appealing the judgement. Verdicts against 28 other defendants are expected to be passed shortly, 
and further trials are expected to take place after the current round of trials ends. 
</p>
<p>31. The National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) reportedly carried out many of the 
arrests connected to the 10 May attack. This reinforced concerns about the 2001 National 
Security Forces Act, which contravenes human rights guarantees contained in the Interim 
National Constitution (INC) and international human rights law and standards. Despite the 
progress on reforming other laws based on provisions set out in the INC and the CPA, the 
National Security Forces Act is still unreformed. Members of the Human Rights and Legislative 
Committees of the National Assembly gave assurances that this Act would be the focus of the 
next Parliamentary session commencing in October 2008. The Special Rapporteur is concerned, 
however, that some members also expressed sentiments that the 10 May attacks had shown that 
the hands of the national security services could not be tied and NISS could not be restricted to 
just gathering intelligence as stipulated in the CPA. 
</p><p>32. There is evidence that NISS, beyond the response to the 10 May attacks described above, 
regularly uses arbitrary arrest and detention against political dissidents. According to reports, 
individuals are frequently picked up and detained by unidentified NISS agents without being told 
the reason for their arrest. Detainees have in some instances been held for several months 
without charge and without access to a lawyer or to their families. The locations in which NISS 
detainees are held are frequently unknown and there are allegations of secret detention facilities 
being maintained in residential or office premises. Members of several different political and 
opposition groups from around the country, as well as those associated with such groups, have 
reported being held by NISS in connection with their public political activities. 
</p>
<p>33. NISS is not the only Government authority reportedly responsible for arbitrary arrest and 
detention. The police have on several occasions been reported to hold individuals in their 
custody without initiating the required judicial review within 24 hours of the arrest. Police have 
also been accused of carrying out arrests based on only very limited evidence and without much 
regard as to whether physical detention is actually necessary in the case. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>34. Most likely exacerbated by the 10 May incident, restrictions on freedom of expression 
have been further tightened. Media organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 
human rights defenders have all reported increasing harassment and censorship by the 
Government and especially NISS. On 14 May, for instance, NISS officers searched the premises 
of the Arabic-language newspaper, <i>Alwan</i>, confiscating property and indefinitely suspending 
publication of the paper. Reportedly, the reason for the raid and the suspension were allegations 
that <i>Alwan </i>had disclosed sensitive military information by publishing a story about a Sudanese 
military aircraft that was allegedly shot down by JEM during their attack on Khartoum. 
Journalists from other papers have been summoned and detained by authorities for resisting 
censorship. Some have reported ill-treatment during such detentions, including death threats and 
calculated humiliation. 
</p>
<p>35. The regular censorship of newspapers by NISS that was reinstated in February 2008 has 
also continued, with visits by NISS officials to newspaper offices on the evening before 
publication to review and potentially restrict content by removing or changing articles. An 
attempt to force newspaper editors to submit advance copies of papers to NISS every evening, 
however, was strongly resisted by several Arabic-language papers. Eight newspapers refused to 
comply with the new measure, which resulted in three of them being temporarily banned from 
publishing. In protest, the daily <i>Ajrass Al Huriya</i> called a press conference and was then again 
prevented from publishing for trying to cover it in the next day&#8217;s edition. Ultimately NISS 
agreed to stop requiring advance copies to be submitted, and resumed the nightly visits to 
newspaper premises instead. 
</p>
<p>36. As Sudan prepares for a general election scheduled for 2009, it is essential that 
fundamental freedoms of expression, association, assembly and movement are guaranteed and 
respected across the country. Following the passing of a new Elections Act, much will also 
depend on a genuinely independent and impartial electoral commission being set up. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Justice and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>37. One of the most important challenges to human rights protection in Sudan continues to be 
the lack of justice and accountability for serious crimes. In far too many incidents the 
Government has failed to hold accountable perpetrators of human rights and international human 
rights law violations. Even when confronted with the most serious and well-documented 
allegations, investigations of an appropriate standard frequently do not take place, are not made 
public or drag on for many months or years. 
</p>
<p>38. In her last reports the Special Rapporteur reported on a number of cases of killings of 
civilians which have not been prosecuted, including an incident in 2007 where security forces 
used lethal force in suppressing protests against the construction of a hydropower dam in Kajbar, 
killing four civilians.<b>8</b> The Government stated that the investigative process was still ongoing 
and a report will be handed over to the Ministry of Interior. According to the Government, 
</p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>investigations such as the Kajbar one take time because of the number of people involved in 
them, but the Government was still hoping to complete it &#8220;in the coming time&#8221;. The Special 
Rapporteur is deeply concerned at the lack of progress in identifying responsibility for the 
killings and initiating criminal prosecutions. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  EASTERN SUDAN 
</b></p>
<p>39. In March 2008 the Special Rapporteur visited Port Sudan in Red Sea State for the first 
time. She enquired about the killing of 22 civilians and the injury of others during a non-violent 
demonstration on 29 January 2005 in Port Sudan.<b>9 </b>The incident followed the delivery of a 
statement by youths to the local government office demanding employment and a share in the 
wealth generated by the gold mine and harbour, as well as positions of political power. The 
Special Rapporteur has raised this case numerous times with the authorities and was pleased to 
have an opportunity to visit the region to gather more information. She requested information on 
the status of the investigation and prosecution of those responsible and received information that 
Special Forces were brought to Port Sudan to deal with the unrest and that they used excessive 
lethal force. An investigative committee was formed by the Government on 18 February 2005. 
Its members included a judge from Khartoum, a judge from Port Sudan, a member of NISS, a 
member of the police, a member from the office of the Attorney-General, and an official from 
the local native administration. The committee undertook a survey of the area of the incident and 
visited the hospital where those killed and injured were taken. It received witness accounts and 
many people testified during the one-month period. The report was submitted to the authorities, 
but the findings were not made public. The only action taken upon conclusion of the 
investigation was to start the process of compensation settlement through blood money or <i>dia</i>. 
The Government provided <i>dia</i> to 16 out of the 22 families of those who were killed. Six families 
refused to accept the blood money. Many of the relatives have faced threats and intimidation for 
continuing to ask for justice in this case. None of the families have received any information 
about the outcome of the investigation three years later and no one has been brought to justice. 
The Special Rapporteur called on the Government to make the findings of the investigative 
committee public and to bring those responsible to justice without further delay. 
40. The Special Rapporteur received reports that NISS continues to harass and violate the 
rights of citizens through arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and ill-treatment and general 
abuse of power. According to information received on 21 February 2008, 300 students gathered 
in Port Sudan for a peaceful demonstration were threatened that if they did not disperse they 
would be killed, as in 2005. 
</p>
<p>41. Another critical demand for people in eastern Sudan is development, particularly in the 
areas of health, education, employment and water. The eastern region, particularly the Red Sea 
and Kassala States, has been marginalized economically and politically within Sudan for many 
years, which has generated widespread poverty. The Beja are non-Arabs with their own 
language; some can read or write Arabic but are confined to low-paying jobs. Allegations were 
received that certain ethnicities, namely, Beja, Hausa, Fallata and Massalit face discrimination.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  DARFUR 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Government has taken some initial steps to implement the recommendations of the 
group of experts on Darfur and address human rights concerns. The Swiss Government 
generously donated funds to assist the Government in this endeavour; on 1 July in El Fasher 
there was a public launch of the Swiss technical cooperation project to support implementation 
of the recommendations. Examples of steps taken by the Government include the increased 
number of police - including several dozen police women - that have been deployed to Darfur, 
and the activities of the State committees against sexual and gender-based violence. Also, the 
indictment, prosecution and sentencing of several regular forces personnel accused and found 
guilty of rape sends an important signal to perpetrators and communities. The Government&#8217;s 
progress reports, as well as updates from the ground on the status of implementation of the 
recommendations of the group of experts are documented in detail in the addendum to this 
report. 
</p>
<p>43. Fighting involving Government of Sudan forces, signatories and non-signatories to 
the 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement, and other armed groups has resulted in civilian casualties, 
widespread destruction of civilian property, including homes and markets, loss of livelihood and 
mass displacement of affected communities. In addition, increasing insecurity negatively impacts 
on humanitarian space and the security of the civilian population. Violence and sexual abuse of 
women and children by State, non-State and private actors, such as criminal groups and bandits, 
also continue almost unabated throughout Darfur. A culture of impunity is prevalent: the State 
fails to investigate, punish and prosecute perpetrators of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>44. Although violations of the Darfur Peace Agreement occur frequently and are committed by 
all parties to the conflict, the Ceasefire Commission continues to be unable to investigate and 
monitor incidents on a formal basis as the Joint Commission still has not met to agree a new 
structure for the Ceasefire Commission. The continued failure of parties to the conflict to protect 
the civilian population from the fighting, distinguish between combatants and civilians, and 
utilize only proportionate force during clashes and military operations remains a critical issue. 
</p>
<p>45. There are several reports of air attacks by Government forces, leading to extensive civilian 
casualties. These include attacks on civilians in Saraf Jidad, Sirba, Silea and Abu Suruj in 
West Darfur in January and February 2008,<b>10</b> the bombing of a number of villages in 
North Darfur such as the air attacks on Helif village on 29 April or on Ein Bissar and 
Shegeg Karo villages on 4 May 2008. In May alone such air strikes reportedly caused the death 
of 19 civilians and injury of another 30, including women and young children. Objects 
indispensable to the survival of communities were also destroyed during the attacks. The 
majority of the bombs apparently impacted on civilian populated areas, including detonations in 
the vicinity of water installations, a school and a market. The available information suggests that 
the bombing of these villages was indiscriminate, and the impact on civilian communities was 
disproportionate to any military advantage likely to be gained as a result of the air strikes. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  For details see the ninth periodic report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights on the human rights situation in the Sudan, 20 March 2008 available at 
http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AfricaRegion/Pages/SDPeriodicReports.aspx. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46. In the first three weeks of July 2008 there were 21 separate incidents of aerial 
bombardment. The air strikes were carried out by the Government of Sudan with Antonov 
aircrafts and MIG fighter jets. Reportedly, the strikes impacted in the vicinity of civilian 
communities and allegedly resulted in the deaths of 12 persons, including 5 women and 
2 children. The United Nations received further reports that civilian objects, in particular 
cultivated land and livestock, were also destroyed. 
</p>
<p>47. In another worrying example of a direct attack on civilian targets by Government forces, 
an attack on Tawilla by members of the Central Reserve Police (CRP) on 12 May left the town 
completely deserted. After a CRP member was found dead inside the Rwanda IDP camp, CRP 
personnel responded by burning and looting of huts and destroying the market. Approximately 
20,000 people from Tawilla town and the IDPs from Rwanda camp were forced to flee the area. 
As of 22 July 2008, most have not returned to the area. Representatives of the local community 
complained about killings, violent assaults and rapes that occurred during the attack. No action 
has been taken for accountability and justice. 
48. Civilians also continue to suffer from violence and abuses carried out by both signatory 
and non-signatory rebel groups. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to the Mario villages near 
Kafod she was extremely concerned to see an example of this. Armed clashes between the two 
signatory factions, the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA)/MM and SLA/Free Will on 21 May 
resulted in the almost complete destruction of the villages, including the burning down of the 
mosque. The clashes killed 13 civilian villagers, including the <i>mullah</i> and the <i>muezzin</i> and 
injured another 8 (see the addendum to this report). 
49. In Gereida, South Darfur, under the control of SLA/MM, the Special Rapporteur enquired 
about the case of 19 Massalit men who were arrested by SLA/MM and then disappeared on 
29 September 2006 following an attack on Gereida by an armed group. In October 2006 a mass 
grave was found containing the remains of some of those who had been arrested. The Special 
Rapporteur called upon the Government to investigate, inform the families of the fate of their 
relatives and bring the perpetrators of human rights violations to justice. To date the Special 
Rapporteur has not received any information. 
</p>
<p>50. Many communities and other interlocutors in Darfur expressed strong concerns regarding 
what they perceived as the inability of UNAMID to protect the civilian population from the 
conflict and incidents such as the one that occurred in Tawilla right next to a UNAMID camp. At 
the same time, the 8 July attack that killed seven UNAMID peacekeepers in Darfur tragically 
demonstrated the risks United Nations personnel run in carrying out their mission. The 
population&#8217;s expectations of the relatively new mission, which is still struggling with 
deployment issues, may well be unrealistically high and very often United Nations personnel on 
the ground simply do not have the resources and support to intervene to the full extent of their 
mandate. If the trust and support of the population is to be maintained it is essential that the 
Sudanese Government and the international community give their unconditional support to 
speeding up and completing the deployment of UNAMID and to ensuring that the mission is 
fully staffed and equipped to effectively carry out its core mandate of protection of civilians. 
Such support must be combined with more active awareness-raising activities amongst 
communities. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>51. Beyond direct violations committed by the conflicting parties, Darfurians are also suffering 
from an overall increase in insecurity and the resultant shrinking of humanitarian space. 
Comparing the statistics for the beginning of 2008 with the same period in 2007, killings of 
humanitarians have risen from one in that period in 2007 to eight in 2008; armed assaults on 
humanitarian premises have gone up from 23 to 51; and abductions of humanitarians has leapt 
from 45 to 103. 
</p>
<p>52. The most illustrative example of increasing insecurity and its impact on humanitarian 
space is perhaps the increasing prevalence of carjackings in Darfur. According to United Nations 
figures, in the first six months of 2008 alone 135 vehicles belonging to humanitarian agencies 
and NGOs were lost as the result of such incidents. This is almost the same number as the total 
of 139 vehicles for the whole of 2007. As a direct result, for instance, since 1 May 2008 the 
World Food Programme has been forced to reduce the rations it gives out by almost half. While 
the Government cannot realistically be expected to prevent every single incident of carjacking, 
there are disturbing reports of extremely slow and ineffective responses by the concerned 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>53. One of the major obstacles to improving the human rights situation in Darfur remains the 
widespread absence of justice and accountability for violations and the impunity this promotes. 
This is clearly evident from the lack of follow-up to incidents such as the one in Tawilla, in 
which no investigation was carried out to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice. The 
prevalence and negative effects of impunity are demonstrated extremely well by looking at the 
issue of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and other grave violations which are 
prohibited by international law. 
</p>
<p>54. SGBV has been an ongoing part of the conflict in Darfur and remains widespread, despite 
several encouraging steps by the Government to address the issue. Conflict-related violence 
against women and girls includes rape, gang rape, attempted rape, serious assaults and beatings. 
Although there has been an increase in the reporting of SGBV, the majority of incidents of 
sexual violence remain unreported, mainly due to fear of the social stigma associated with rape. 
On several occasions victims chose not to file complaints because in most cases police cannot or 
will not take appropriate action against perpetrators (see the addendum to this report). 
</p>
<p><b>V.  TRANSITIONAL AREAS 
</b></p>
<p>55. Between 14 and 20 May 2008, ongoing political tensions in Abyei escalated into violent 
clashes and heavy fighting between the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Sudan People&#8217;s 
Liberation Army (SPLA), both supported by groups of armed civilians. The battle had severe 
repercussions on the civilian population of the town and surrounding areas. Large areas of the 
town were completely destroyed, burnt and looted. UNMIS estimates that 4,379 huts were 
burned during and following the fighting, while some 2,005 remained intact.<b>11</b> According to 
humanitarian agencies an estimated 50,000 people were displaced from the area. Eyewitnesses 
and victims reported extremely serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian 
law. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  Report of the Secretary-General on the Sudan, S/2008/485, para. 20. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>56. Most likely triggered by an incident in which an SAF sergeant was killed by SPLA police 
on 13 May, armed clashes between the SAF and SPLA broke out in Abyei town the next day. 
Reportedly, the SAF was supported by former members of the Southern Sudan Union Movement 
(SSUM) who are now integrated into the SAF and armed Misseriya civilians, while the SPLA 
drew support from armed Dinka civilians. The following six days saw heavy fighting, in which 
the conflicting parties were said to have employed tanks, heavy artillery, rocket-propelled 
grenades and mortars. On 20 May a reported SPLA attack was repulsed by the SAF which 
established full military control over Abyei. 
</p>
<p>57. According to eyewitness testimony, destruction of large parts of the town was not only due 
to fighting, but also a result of the comprehensive looting and burning of civilian houses and 
other properties including United Nations and NGO compounds. Eyewitnesses reported seeing 
both SAF and SPLA personnel participating in the burning and looting. From 16 May, only the 
SAF and Misseriya were looting since the SPLA was no longer in the town. Looting continued 
after 20 May, after the SAF repulsed an SPLA attack from outside the town and major hostilities 
ceased. Witnesses reported seeing looted property being stored inside the SAF 31st Brigade 
compound. On a number of occasions United Nations Military Observers (UNMO) saw SAF 
soldiers burning houses, such as on 16 May when an UNMO observed an SAF soldier on a 
donkey setting fire to several civilian houses. Looting was frequently accompanied by violence. 
There are several reported cases of elderly or infirm persons who had not been able to flee the 
town being physically attacked and seriously injured by looters. For example, one old woman 
who was bedridden at the time of the attack stated that armed men she thought belonged to the 
SSUM militia had entered her house and, upon finding her there, had beaten her until she lost 
consciousness. 
</p>
<p>58. As of 26 July 2008, at least 68 bodies had reportedly been recovered from Abyei town, 34 
of which appeared to be civilians, including several women. Eyewitnesses reported that several 
deaths had resulted from the indiscriminate use of force, violence linked to looting and, most 
disturbingly, the deliberate killing or execution of dozens of civilians as well as of one injured 
combatant who was hors de combat. The majority of incidents reported identify SAF and allied 
forces as the perpetrators although there are also accusations directed against the SPLA and its 
supporters. Given the seriousness of the allegations, the Government of National Unity must take 
immediate action and support an in-depth, independent fact-finding inquiry and make the report 
public. 
</p>
<p>59. Some progress towards addressing these issues has been made as part of the commendable 
political agreement (the Abyei Road Map) that was struck on 8 July to de-escalate the crisis. 
Besides agreeing on the withdrawal of all SAF, SPLA and proxy forces from Abyei, the parties 
also agreed to refer the underlying unresolved dispute regarding the findings of the Abyei 
Boundaries Commission to be decided by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. The 
agreement also initiated an inquiry by the Joint Military Committee established under the 
ceasefire into military aspects of the incidents in Abyei. Further to the political agreement, the 
rifts that the incident created between the local Dinka and Misseriya communities must also be 
addressed as a matter of urgency. Beyond justice and accountability, steps must also be taken to 
ensure community reconciliation and healing. With the seasonal migration of the Misseriya and 
their cattle towards the Kiir river area now approaching, steps must urgently be taken to ensure 
respect for traditional grazing routes and mutual accommodation of the local populations in order 
to avoid additional violent clashes. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>60. Several interlocutors expressed strong concerns regarding what they perceived as the 
inability of the United Nations to protect the civilian population of Abyei during the conflict. 
With a Chapter VI mandate, and limited equipment and resources, United Nations personnel did 
not have the means to contain two major armies with heavy weaponry and intervene as forcefully 
as they might have wanted to. Rather, UNMIS said it had to restrict itself to sheltering civilians 
seeking refuge and evacuating them to safe locations away from the clashes. In the wake of the 
events in Abyei it is essential that the United Nations provide clearer and more practically 
applicable guidance on how exactly UNMIS implements issues of protection of civilians under 
its mandate and how this should be put into practice on the ground. This should be supplemented 
with an improved rapid deployment capacity of UNMIS in order to strengthen troop levels in 
hotspots. Measures need to be taken to better integrate civilian action, including high-level 
follow-up with civilian authorities and public diplomacy. 
</p>
<p>61. The transitional areas face serious problems in the administration of justice. Frequently, 
official systems and localized set-ups that emerged during the period of armed conflict can be 
found within a state. In Southern Kordofan, for instance, the official state government based in 
Kadugli cannot exert its power over SPLA-controlled areas, which are administered by SPLM 
officials and retain close ties to Southern Sudan. This has blocked significant legal and judicial 
reforms and contributes to ongoing political tension. It also promotes impunity for criminal 
offences, as perpetrators from one area can escape punishment by simply moving to the other 
area of control. In this regard, it is positive that the CPA parties have recently made progress in 
their efforts to integrate national police and SPLM police in Southern Kordofan. 
</p>
<p>62. The SAF and SPLA have been involved in arrests and detention of civilians, falling outside 
their legal mandates. In Kadugli in Southern Kordofan, for instance, a 14-year-old boy was 
arrested by SAF military intelligence officers on 5 March 2008. Apparently the SAF did not seek 
the legally required prior approval of a civilian prosecutor before carrying out the arrest. 
Accused of having stolen a sub-machine gun from a SAF garrison, the boy was held for a total of 
44 days without being handed over to the police, even after the responsible civilian authorities 
made an official transfer request. Conversely, the SPLA arrested and detained a 55-year-old 
veterinary assistant of the Hawazma tribe in White Lake/Jaw on 28 January 2008. The man had 
worked for six years in the White Lake region, which is an assembly area for SPLA troops 
moving out of Southern Kordofan. The man was reportedly questioned by SPLA military 
intelligence in connection with the arrest of another SAF soldier. He was allegedly given 
25 lashes on the morning of 29 January, and again three days later after he was questioned. The 
victim reported that he had 2,000 Sudanese Pounds worth of medicine with him when he was 
arrested and alleges that the medicine was not given back to him when he was released 
on 12 February. 
</p>
<p>63. In addition, the presence of the formal judiciary in remote areas is so limited that local 
populations rely almost entirely on traditional, customary law-based administration of justice. 
While traditional systems of justice may work well in resolving many local disputes and minor 
criminal cases such as petty thefts or the destruction of property, their processes and decisions 
can contravene human rights norms. This remains a concern, even though customary laws are 
changing to reflect changing social attitudes. Decisions on family law and personal status in 
particular frequently discriminate against women and customary courts are also not appropriate 
forums to resolve penal cases of a serious nature, in particular cases of rape or other sexual 
offences. In some parts of the country, most notably in Southern Sudan, there have been efforts </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to integrate these often widely respected systems as an official part of the judicial system and, as 
part of this process, ensure their compliance with fundamental human rights norms. Given the 
other complications affecting the administration of justice in the transitional areas, however, 
such initiatives have been extremely limited. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  SOUTHERN SUDAN 
</b></p>
<p>64. Many interlocutors in Southern Sudan display a commitment to human rights, but the 
Government of Southern Sudan should take a more proactive approach to implementing a broad 
human rights agenda by allocating resources to institutions that support human rights, such as 
independent commissions, the police and the judiciary. Without financial support, which requires 
political will, commendable commitment will not necessarily have an impact. There are major 
human rights concerns linked to prevailing insecurity and the proliferation of firearms, as well as 
the role of the SPLA in civilian law enforcement. Concerns also include the impunity of SPLA 
personnel, the administration of justice, the conditions in detention centres and the lack of 
progress on the fulfilment of social and economic rights. 
</p>
<p>65. The Southern Sudan Human Rights Commission (SSHRC) was established by the 
Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) as an independent Commission under article 149 of the 
Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan with a mandate to protect and promote human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. Since the last report of the Special Rapporteur the Commission has made 
significant progress towards carrying out its role as an independent oversight mechanism, 
promoting human rights standards and raising concerns with the relevant authorities. Its first 
annual report was published in June 2008 and it plans to expand its presence beyond Juba. 
Strong international support, including technical, financial and logistical assistance, plays an 
essential role in continuing these positive developments, improving the capacity of the SSHRC 
and extending its reach. As of July 2008 the GoSS had still not passed and signed the enabling 
act for the Commission. It is imperative that the SSHRC is backed up by a strong law clearly 
defining its role and powers according to the Paris Principles.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>66. Numerous people in Southern Sudan are killed as a result of localized armed clashes and 
general insecurity. A particular security concern is the continuing presence of the Lord&#8217;s 
Resistance Army (LRA) and other armed groups across a wide area of Southern Sudan. 
</p>
<p>67. Localized armed clashes between tribes commonly occur over disputes related to land, 
cattle, other resources and family affairs. Because of the proliferation of weapons and the so far 
limited effect of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, in many cases the 
Government has not intervened or taken sufficient action to protect the lives and property of 
those affected by inter- and intra-tribal fighting. In other instances the Government has 
intervened so forcefully as to aggravate rather than alleviate the situation. The latter is of 
particular concern in the light of the President of Southern Sudan&#8217;s operation order No. 1/2008 
regarding the disarmament of the civilian population, which was issued in May 2008. If 
disarmament does not occur voluntarily, it may cause some violence. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  General Assembly resolution 48/134. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>68. Following tensions related to cattle raiding, between the villages of Logurony and Iloli in 
Hiyala, Torit, SPLA forces were sent to the area to attempt to disarm the community and prevent 
them from clashing. In the darkness, mistaking the SPLA forces for livestock raiding attackers 
from Iloli, the Logurony villagers opened fire. In the ensuing fight several villagers and eight 
soldiers were killed. In the aftermath of the battle the SPLA took retaliatory action, including the 
burning of huts and, allegedly, the execution of three captured villagers. According to the SPLA, 
a board of inquiry has been set up and as of July an investigation into the incident was reportedly 
ongoing. The Government of Southern Sudan must ensure that anybody found responsible for 
violations be held fully accountable and the investigation report made public. 
</p>
<p>69. The incident also illustrates a general concern regarding the role that military SPLA forces 
play in supposedly civilian law enforcement. For the justice and law enforcement institutions of 
the Government of Southern Sudan, the issue of SPLA demobilization and integration into 
civilian life has been a source of difficulty. The integration of thousands of SPLA members into 
the Southern Sudan Police and Southern Sudan Prison Services has caused considerable strain, 
as it is being done without due consideration for the skills and numbers required, or for the 
limited resources within these institutions. In addition, former SPLA members frequently 
maintain their old rank upon transfer into the new services making many of them excessively 
top-heavy and causing some dissatisfaction amongst the professional staff. The relatively new 
police forces and prison service of Southern Sudan also face many additional challenges of both 
infrastructure and capacity. 
</p>
<p>70. One of the most problematic symptoms of the transition to civilian law enforcement is the 
continuing interference and abuse of power by both civil and (especially) military officials. 
There are several reports detailing cases of military personnel asserting powers of arrest over 
civilians, despite the fact that the Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan states in 
article 154 (5) &#8220;the Armed Forces in Southern Sudan shall have no internal law and order 
mandate, except as may be requested by the civil authority when necessity so requires&#8221; and thus 
clearly prohibits the SPLA from initiating police action. 
</p>
<p>71. Detention centres and correctional facilities are generally in very bad condition and do not 
meet international standards. Lack of resources results in overcrowding, bad sanitation and an 
absence of separate facilities for children, women or mentally ill people. Due to a lack of 
specialized facilities for the mentally ill, all are detained in prison without receiving proper 
medical care. In most prisons, approximately half of the population are remand prisoners, whose 
cases are part of the enormous backlog of cases to be reviewed. UNMIS is trying to encourage 
regular judicial reviews of the cases. Since January 2007 there have been three prison riots 
resulting from frustration over lengthy detention periods on remand. The authorities are aware of 
these problems as well as the wider issues facing the correctional system, and appear eager to 
address them. A comprehensive human rights handbook on detention and correctional issues has 
been produced, with plans to provide it to every official in the prison system. There is also a 
programme to refurbish existing detention facilities, although this has suffered from slow 
progress and a lack of funds committed and released by GoSS and the international community. 
</p>
<p>72. Reports continue to be received regarding SPLA personnel enjoying impunity for crimes 
committed by them. The bulk of reported incidents are cases of assault, rape, arbitrary arrest, 
intimidation and other general abuses of power. According to the police, they cannot investigate 
cases involving military personnel as they fall under the responsibility of the SPLA and the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>military justice system. The SPLA has to some extent acknowledged the problem and has reacted 
by moving army barracks away from the city centres. The military justice system is also being 
strengthened, although the SPLA has admitted that it would take time and a substantial 
commitment of resource to successfully transform the former guerrilla army into a disciplined, 
professional force. 
</p>
<p>73. Discriminatory practices still persist against women when it comes to divorce, child 
custody and property rights, as traditional courts will often favour the husband. Early and forced 
marriages are still a common practice across Southern Sudan, resulting in school dropouts and, at 
times, death during child delivery. Wife inheritance is still practised. Domestic violence appears 
to be widespread but underreported. Domestic violence is still considered a domestic issue that 
stays within the family. Only when a case becomes &#8220;serious&#8221; may it be taken to the chief courts 
or even to the police. There is no specific legislation dealing with domestic violence and there 
are no shelters available. At times women end up in prison for their own protection.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>74. Sexual violence is prevalent in Southern Sudan and underreported. There are a number of 
reports where the alleged perpetrators have been men in uniform, i.e. police, SPLA or members 
of the Joint Integrated Units (JIU). In such cases, investigations are not always carried out or 
pursued due to fear of reprisals, or judgements are simply delayed. Women traders in 
marketplaces who stay at night to guard their goods have been victims of sexual harassment and 
rape, as well as tea sellers and women working in restaurants and bars at night. A further 
problem is the practice of denying medical treatment to the victims unless they have filled in a 
Form 8 at the police station. Receiving proper medical treatment and adequate examinations is a 
challenge, as the facilities or equipment are not always available and medical staff are not trained 
in how to deal with such cases. 
</p>
<p>75. Despite notable efforts and some progress, serious challenges remain in the protection and 
promotion of human rights in Southern Sudan. Institutions continue to struggle with meagre 
resources, both human and financial, to find redress to many problems. Several of these 
institutions have revisited or are currently revisiting their plans, budgets, structures and legal 
frameworks, and strategizing on their future and compelling priorities. Several of them have also 
welcomed and benefited from assistance provided by the international community, including that 
of the United Nations, in the form of technical and financial support, training, infrastructure and 
logistics. However, enormous challenges remain ahead as key laws still need to be passed or 
amended, viable mechanisms need to be put in place to guarantee adequate protection of basic 
human rights, and increased awareness on human rights needs to be disseminated throughout 
Southern Sudan. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>76. Despite some steps by the Government of Sudan principally in the area of law reform, the 
human rights situation on the ground remains grim, with many interlocutors even reporting an 
overall deterioration in the country. Human rights violations and breaches of humanitarian law 
continue to be committed by all parties. Land and air attacks by Government forces on civilians 
in Darfur; the 10 May Justice and Equality Movement attack on Omdurman; the arbitrary arrest 
and detention of hundreds of Darfurians; several serious incidents in Darfur, including the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>12 May Central Reserve Police attack on Tawilla and the fighting between rebel groups near 
Kafod on 21 May; the fighting in Abyei in May between the Sudan Armed Forces and the Sudan 
People&#8217;s Liberation Army (SPLA); and clashes between villagers and the SPLA in Torit, 
Eastern Equatoria on 4 June all entailed reports of serious violations being committed by all the 
parties to the conflict. It is essential that impartial, transparent and comprehensive inquiries be 
held to investigate allegations, identify perpetrators and hold them accountable. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates her request that the Government of National Unity and the Government of 
Southern Sudan make the reports of investigative committees public in order to combat impunity 
and further the promotion of the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>77. Concerns are mounting about the violations of civil and political rights in different parts of 
the country in the lead-up to the general elections. In the period under review there have been 
widespread allegations of arbitrary arrests and detention, torture, incommunicado detention and 
serious violations of the right to fair trial. 
</p>
<p>78. One of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s principal concerns remains impunity. Allegations of 
violations of human rights are not duly investigated, nor are the findings made public. 
Perpetrators of serious crimes, such as the killing of civilians, have not been brought to justice 
and reparations have not been provided to victims. The Special Rapporteur has raised several 
cases on numerous occasions with the Government of the Sudan, however to date there has been 
no progress. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports and recommendations contain her assessment of the gaps 
and the needs of the Sudan in order to further the protection of human rights in the country. 
During her visits to Sudan she was pleased to note that the United Nations bodies and agencies, 
UNAMID, UNMIS and others operational in Sudan with support from the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, continue to provide technical assistance 
to the Government of Sudan with a view to assisting it to implement its obligations under 
international law. Donors have also continued to provide funds for technical assistance for the 
improvement of the human rights situation in the Sudan. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations

<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates all previous unimplemented human rights
