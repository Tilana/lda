<p>A/HRC/10/14/Add.<footnote name="3">4. The Working Group observes that the private military and security industry is growing, 
and it fears that the rapid rate of this growth has shifted the discussion from whether non-State 
actors should be allowed to use force to simply how they should use such force. In accordance 
with General Assembly resolution 62/145, the Working Group believes that it is essential to 
actively pursue the debate on the fundamental question on the role of the State as holder of the 
monopoly of the use of force.

</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In accordance with General Assembly resolution 62/145 and Human Rights Council 
resolution A/HRC/7/21, the Working Group held a regional consultation in Moscow, on 17 
and 18 October 2008. 
</p>
<p> The consultation sought to gain a regional perspective about the current practices related to 
mercenaries and private military and security companies registered, operating or recruiting 
personnel in the region. It also provided an opportunity to discuss the fundamental question of 
the role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the use of force and also to share information 
on steps taken by States in the region to introduce legislation and other measures to regulate and 
monitor activities of such companies on the international market. The Working Group discussed 
general guidelines, norms and basic principles for the regulation and oversight of the activities of 
private companies offering military assistance, consultancy and security services on the 
international market to encourage the further protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p> The consultation was attended by representatives of the Governments of Armenia, Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Republic of Moldova, Poland, the Russian Federation, 
Serbia, Slovenia, Tajikistan and Ukraine. Also attending were eight resource persons (including 
consultants) on the subject, representatives from the Collective Security Treaty Organization 
(CSTO) and the International Committee of the Red Cross, a member of the Russian State 
Duma, representatives from civil society, a representative of the United Nations Information 
Centre, nine academics and a representative from a private military and security company. The 
list of participants is attached in annex 1. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group was represented by the Chairperson-Rapporteur, 
Mr. Alexander Nikitin, Ms. Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez, Mr. Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado and 
Ms. Shaista Shameem. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/14/Add.<footnote name="3">3. The Working Group notes that the operation of private military and security companies is a 
global phenomenon. They can be found in various countries of the Eastern European Group and 
Central Asia region, either as branches of foreign multinational private military and security 
companies, or as companies originating or owned domestically.

<p>A/HRC/10/14/Add.<footnote name="3">2. It believes that the consultation, as well as the Working Group&#8217;s reports, helped raise the 
awareness of national authorities and international public opinion on the impact of the activities 
of private military and security companies and their employees on the enjoyment of human 
rights. In certain situations, those activities may result in human rights violations.  
</footnote>

</p>
<p><b>I.  BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 15 of resolution 62/145, the General Assembly requests the office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to convene regional governmental 
consultations on traditional and new forms of mercenary activities as a means of violating human 
rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, in particular 
regarding the effects of the activities of private military and security companies (PMSCs) on the 
enjoyment of human rights. 
2. In addition, Human Rights Council resolution A/HRC/7/21 requests OHCHR to inform the 
Council in a timely manner, of the dates and places for the convening of the other regional 
governmental consultations on this matter, in conformity with paragraph 15 of 
General Assembly resolution 62/145, bearing in mind that this process may lead to the holding 
of a high-level round table of States under the auspices of the United Nations to discuss the 
fundamental question of the role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the use of force, with 
the objective of facilitating a critical understanding of the responsibilities of the different actors, 
including private military and security companies, in the current context, and their respective 
obligations for the protection and promotion of human rights and in reaching a common 
understanding as to which additional regulations and controls are needed at the international 
level. 
</p>
<p>3. In consultation with OHCHR, the Working Group decided to hold a second regional 
consultation for the Eastern European Group and Central Asian Region in Moscow on 17 and 
18 October 2008. The first regional consultation had been held on 17 and 18 December 2007 in 
Panama City for the Latin American and Caribbean Region. The regional consultation was 
organized by OHCHR in close collaboration with the Working Group. In order to gain an 
in-depth understanding of the issues, the Working Group also organized a legal consultation the 
day prior to the regional consultation.   
</p>
<p><b>II.  SUMMARY OF THE MEETING 
</b></p>
<p>4. The following subjects were considered during the consultation: (a) the monopoly of the 
State on the use of military and security force; (b) private actors and use of military and security 
force; (c) the role of the State and non-State actors in the military sphere of the CIS 
(Commonwealth of Independent States) and CSTO Regions; (d) towards the elaboration of a 
new international convention on private military and security companies; (e) national 
experiences and views. In addition, - participants met with the Deputy Secretary-General and 
other members of the CSTO secretariat.  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Opening of regional consultation and introductory remarks 
</b></p>
<p>5. Mr. Serguei Chumarev, Chief of the Section of Universal Cooperation on Human Rights of 
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, welcomed the meeting participants 
on behalf of the Ministry, and expressed Russia&#8217;s support of the work of the Working Group and 
expressed hope that it would continue to hold regional consultations. He observed the shift from </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/14/Add.<footnote name="3">1. The Working Group would like to draw attention to the reaffirmation by representatives of 
the Governments participating in the Regional Consultation and the members of the Working 
Group, of the obligation of States to respect, realize and promote human rights. 
</footnote> 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>traditional mercenarism towards private military and security companies. He recalled the action 
taken by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council with respect to the issue of 
mercenarism, and expressed Russia&#8217;s desire that a convention on the regulation of private 
military and security companies be elaborated in accordance with United Nations procedures and 
be brought before the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>6. Mr. Karim Ghezraoui of the Special Procedures Division of OHCHR introduced the work 
of OHCHR and steps taken to support the work of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>7. Mr. Alexander Nikitin opened the consultation, introducing the participants and outlining 
the agenda and objectives of the consultation, namely to discuss the role of the State as holder of 
the monopoly of the use of force, gain a regional perspective about the current practices relating 
to mercenaries and private military and security companies, and also an opportunity to share 
information on steps taken by States to regulate and monitor them. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Monopoly of the State on the use of military and security force 
</b></p>
<p>8. Several participants provided presentations which covered issues including the use of force 
in international law, developments in United Nations peacekeeping, the question of non-State 
actors using military force and arms supply, and mercenary activity in the Caucasus. 
</p>
<p>9. The resource persons emphasized various aspects, including the principles of international 
law governing the use of force, whether carried out by States or private actors. They recalled that 
States hold responsibility under public international law, but also considered that regulation of 
private military and security companies should be increased. 
</p>
<p>10. In subsequent discussion, members of the Working Group and other participants discussed 
the use of private security companies by the United Nations, including the degree of its 
accountability for their actions, and the current &#8220;gaps&#8221; in the international regulation of these 
companies. The positive role that private military and security companies can play in the 
humanitarian sphere was considered, as well as potential practical advantages for States using 
them instead of or in addition to their armed forces. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Private actors and the use of military and security force 
</b></p>
<p>11. The session on private actors and the use of military and security force started with 
presentations by resource persons who were asked to prepare submissions for the consultations. 
</p>
<p>12. One consultant noted that with private military and security companies, a new commodity - 
security - was now traded at the international level. This shift has been noticed by several 
international players - the Council of Europe, the United Nations and also the Swiss Initiative. 
As regards the Swiss Initiative, the consultant outlined the content of the Montreux Document,<b>1</b> 
explaining that it contains principles of existing international humanitarian and human rights law 
as well as a series of good practices for relevant actors. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  A/63/467. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/14/Add.<footnote name="3">0. The Working Group has taken note of submissions made during the consultation and 
considers them to be part of the process of establishing within the United Nations community a 
shared understanding of standards, guidelines and principles for the regulation of the private 
military and security industry. The Working Group has made the following observations on the 
discussion at the consultation and its proposed follow-up. 
</footnote> 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>13. The consultant also considered possible next steps to be taken by the international 
community to better regulate private military and security companies. Proposals included: (a) the 
international community agreeing on a standard definition of private military and security 
companies, identifying in what context they operate, and deciding what duties they should or 
should not perform; (b) transforming voluntary codes of conduct into binding codes; 
(c) instituting an effective vetting system of private military and security company employees; 
(d) the international community appointing an independent international &#8216;PMSC Ombudsman&#8217; 
who would receive complaints from all interested stakeholders regarding the activities of private 
military and security companies and perform preliminary investigations to help decide which 
complaints deserved further attention, keeping such allegations in the public eye; (e) establishing 
a civil arbitration panel to hear complaints against private military and security companies and 
developing an international criminal code applicable to private military and security companies 
on the model of the International Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>14. Another consultant highlighted the practice of private military and security companies 
recruiting former soldiers in Latin America. By setting up several layers of sub-contracting, the 
legal situation is complicated, so that the companies can effectively bypass international laws. 
The consultant highlighted the difficulties in obtaining information on the ground during conflict 
situations and emphasized the need for a solution at the international level, rather than just the 
national level. He provided options for improved regulation, including that all parties remain 
focused on the primary responsibility of States to regulate companies incorporated or acting on 
their territories, as well as suggesting a model contract system. The consultant recommended the 
continued ratification by states of the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, 
Financing and Training of Mercenaries and expressed support for establishing international 
corporate criminal responsibility. 
</p>
<p>15. In the ensuing discussion, members of the Working Group and other participants 
considered the proposals and recommendations of the consultants as they related to the mandate 
of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>16. Mr. Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado, member of the Working Group, presented the findings of 
a model law project he had coordinated with the School of Law at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison on regulating private military and security companies. The document 
included the following outcomes: (a) in view of a lack of accountability for acts committed by 
such companies, they posed a greater threat to civilians than regular armed forces these private 
employees replace; (b) better effective regulation would protect not only civilians but also States 
from infringement by these companies on the State&#8217;s monopoly of the use of force; (c) there is a 
lack of political will to eliminate or regulate such companies; (d) current self-regulation by the 
security industry is insufficient; and (e) there are a number of activities which are inherently 
governmental and inappropriate for outsourcing to private companies. The model law proposed, 
for those States intending to establish judicial, administrative and investigative oversight of the 
activities of private military and security companies, the establishment of an inter-agency 
taskforce responsible for adopting legislation and setting up regulatory mechanisms to control 
and monitor their activities, including a system of registering and licensing that would authorize 
these companies to operate and allow them to be sanctioned when the norms are not respected. In </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/14/Add.3 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>addition, the taskforce would establish and make known to the public and to all government 
contractors those functions that the State alone may perform and a list of activities that can be 
legally conducted by private military and security companies. The taskforce would create a dual 
ranking system, coordinating (a) the risk that the activity may result in human rights abuses, and 
(b) the degree to which a private company bidding for a government contract complies with the 
taskforce&#8217;s minimum standards for the private military and security industry. 
</p>
<p>17. Presentations were made by several resource persons and academics in the field and a 
representative from a private security company. They provided an overview of their work in the 
area, including an appraisal of recent regulatory changes in South Africa, a view from within the 
private military and security industry, an analysis of both the potential and the limitations for the 
private military and security industry to self-regulate, and a new academic research project 
examining the regulatory framework at national, European and international levels. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Meeting with the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) 
</b>18. The meeting started with a film in Russian, which explained the history and structure of the 
CSTO. Mr. Valery Semerikov, Deputy Secretary-General, then gave a presentation introducing 
the CSTO, explaining that it was a military alliance based on the collective security treaty of the 
CIS. It was founded in October 2002 and as of October 2008 Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan were members. He explained that the charter of 
the CSTO affirmed the desire of its signatory States to abstain from the use or threat of force, 
that signatories were not able to join other military alliances, and that aggression against 
one signatory would be perceived as an aggression against all. 
</p>
<p>19. The CSTO is an observer organization at the General Assembly, and recently agreed to 
expand the organization so that it could create a CSTO peacekeeping force that could be 
deployed in its member States, or even beyond if authorized under a United Nations mandate. 
The CSTO cooperated with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on issues such as 
security, crime, and drug trafficking, and was seeking closer cooperation with NATO. 
</p>
<p><b>5. The role of State and non-State actors in the military 
sphere of the CIS and CSTO regions 
</b></p>
<p>20. Several resource persons provided presentations which covered issues including the legal 
status of private military and private security companies in the Russian Federation, the 
experiences of former Soviet soldiers and the social challenges they face, the potential for the 
international supply of security and military services within the CSTO structure, and the 
prevalence and regulation of mercenarism within the CIS. 
</p>
<p>21. In subsequent discussion, members of the Working Group and other participants raised 
various issues including the distinction between &#8220;private military company&#8221; and &#8220;private security 
company&#8221;, the potential depletive impact on State forces by recruitment practices of these 
companies, the existence of minimum age limits for private security employees in different 
jurisdictions, and the degree of national adoption by CIS States of the CIS model law &#8220;On 
counteracting mercenarism&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/14/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p><b>6. Towards the elaboration of a new international convention 
on private military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p>22. A resource person presented a draft for a convention on regulating private military and 
security companies on behalf of a group of lawyers and academics, prepared at the request of the 
Working Group. The draft convention includes general provisions setting out the definitions and 
basic background principles of international law, a core section on applicable principles for 
regulating private military and security companies, a section on rules to be implemented by 
States and a section setting out principles on jurisdiction and extradition. 
23. It was noted that key aspects of the draft convention related to the distinction between the 
import and export of services and the licensing of such imports or exports. States would need to 
establish both a general State registry of private military and security companies and mandatory 
licensing. Licenses could be issued for domestic operation by a private military or security 
company, for export of such services, or for import of such services. Other measures would need 
to be instituted in conjunction with the licensing system, for example criminalizing breaches of 
the licensing regime and establishing appropriate jurisdiction. 
24. The Working Group members and other meeting participants discussed several issues 
relating to the draft convention such as modalities for its implementation, including reporting 
obligations. The Working Group noted that any future convention would need to be in full 
compliance with the current international human rights and humanitarian law framework. It 
would in no way undermine existing rights and standards, but rather would seek to strengthen 
their realization. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  National experiences and views 
</b></p>
<p>25. The representatives of Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Moldova, 
Poland, Serbia, Slovenia, Tajikistan and Ukraine gave presentations, informing the Working 
Group on the phenomenon of mercenarism in their respective countries, including specific 
instances thereof, and on the laws in place for the regulation of the private military and security 
industry in their countries. 
</p>
<p>26. Topics highlighted included the status of ratification by their respective countries of the 
International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, 
provisions within their domestic criminal laws for the punishment of mercenarism, the degree of 
regulation of their domestic private security industry, the general absence or lack of adequate 
regulation of private military companies within their territories as well as, in some cases, the 
prevalence of traditional mercenary activity, either within the State or carried out by nationals 
abroad. 
</p>
<p>27. During the discussion, members of the Working Group and other participants raised 
questions on the degree to which the domestic law of States prohibited mercenary or 
mercenary-related activities carried out by their citizens abroad, the phenomenon of military and 
law enforcement personnel seeking employment in the private security and military sector, 
domestic law relating to the carrying of firearms, the involvement of some of them in the Swiss 
Initiative process and the prevalence of foreign companies operating in the respective States.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>8.  Other views  
</b></p>
<p>28. A representative from the International Committee of the Red Cross gave a presentation 
recalling States&#8217; obligations under international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b>9.  Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Working Group concluded the meeting by thanking all participants for their 
contributions and reiterating key points that had been raised at the meeting, including the 
discussion on the role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the use of force, the strong desire 
for increased international regulation of private military and security companies expressed by 
many participants, the wide range of reported instances of mercenarism and private military and 
security company activities in the region, and the broad range of regulatory options available to 
States. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  OBSERVATIONS OF THE WORKING GROUP 
</b></p>
<p>A/HRC/10/14/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>accordance with international humanitarian and human rights law, in particular a need to develop 
international definitions of and standards for the phenomenon of private military and security 
companies and the duties they perform. 
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group, after consultation with many national Governments in the course of 
regional consultations and country visits, has come to the conclusion that a legal codification of 
the comprehensive system of oversight and regulation for the private military and security 
industry should be based upon certain identified principles.<b>2</b> These principles, which were 
circulated to the participants and informed the meeting, are: 
</p>
<p> (a) Respect of the private military and security companies as legal bodies and their 
employees as natural bodies for the universal norms of human rights and humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> (b) Respect of the private military and security companies and their employees for 
national laws of countries of origin, transit and operation; 
</p>
<p> (c) Respect of the sovereignty of States, internationally recognized borders and rights of 
people for self-determination; 
</p>
<p> (d) Non-participation of private military and security companies and their employees in 
any activities aimed at overthrowing legitimate Governments or authorities, violent change of 
internationally recognized borders, or taking violent foreign control over natural resources; 
</p>
<p> (e) Guaranty of legitimate ways of acquiring, exporting, importing, possession and use 
of weapons by private military and security companies and their employees; 
</p>
<p> (f) Guaranty of adequate, mandated and proportional use of force; 
</p>
<p> (g) Restraint from the overuse of weapons, total prohibition of use of weapons of mass 
destruction, or weapons resulting in overkill, mass casualties or excessive destruction; 
</p>
<p> (h) Accountability of private military and security companies before the Governments of 
the country of origin (registration) and country of operations; 
</p>
<p> (i) Adequate public transparency over the activities of private military and security 
companies; 
</p>
<p> (j) Mechanism for the detailed registration of private military and security companies; 
 (k) Mechanism of licensing of the contracts of private military and security companies 
for operation abroad; 
</p>
<p> (l) Mechanisms of monitoring, inquiries, investigations, complaints and allegations 
regarding activities of private military and security companies; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  A/63/325, para. 90. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/14/Add.3 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p> (m) Mechanism of sanctions which may be applied nationally and/or internationally to 
private military and security companies in case of revealed violations; 
</p>
<p> (n) Standard mechanisms of contracting national and foreign personnel. 
</p>
<p>37. In accordance with these principles, the Working Group believes there is a need to develop 
effective vetting systems for the selection of employees of private military and security 
companies, which would prevent a person who may pose a higher risk of committing human 
rights violations from performing private military or security duties. 
</p>
<p>38. The Working Group is of the view that in order for any regulatory mechanisms to be 
implemented for private military and security companies, enforcement mechanisms should be 
put in place. Also, effective accountability for violations of human rights by both companies and 
individuals should be ensured. 
</p>
<p>39. Further, the Working Group believes that an effective system for the licensing of the 
private military and security industry and the training of its employees should be developed. 
</p>
<p>40. The goal of the Working Group is to incorporate these elements into an effective system 
that is widely embraced and adopted by the international community. Effective regulation needs 
action at several levels: international and regional agreements, national legislation and policy, 
parliamentary control, self-regulation by the industry itself and monitoring by civil society 
institutions. 
</p>
<p>41. During the regional consultation, drafts of potential new legal instruments - a draft 
international convention on the regulation and oversight of private military and security 
companies and a draft model law for the national level of regulation - were introduced by 
resource persons at the request of the Working Group and subsequently discussed by the 
members of the Working Group together with representatives of participating States. 
</p>
<p>42. The Working Group plans in 2009-2011 to hold regional consultations in Asia, Africa and 
Western Europe. New legal instruments on regulating private military and security companies, 
which are under elaboration by the Working Group, would be deliberated with Member States at 
these consultations, to provide wide input into the content and consensus on the format of these 
instruments. </p>
