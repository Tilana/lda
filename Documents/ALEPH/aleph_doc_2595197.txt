NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1 – Basis of Presentation
The interim financial statements included herein have been prepared by Fuel Performance
Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as International Fuel Technology, Inc.) (the "Company," "we,"
"us" or "our") without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading.
These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in
the opinion of management are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained
therein. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. We suggest that
these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed
with the SEC on March 30, 2016. We follow the same accounting policies in preparation of
interim reports as we do in our annual reports.
Note 2 – Substantial Doubt about Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
Our financial statements are presented on the going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have
incurred significant losses since inception and currently have and previously from time to time
have had limited funds with which to operate. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management is in the process of executing a
strategy based upon marketing technologies that offer enhanced engine performance and
greater fuel economy along with pollution control benefits.
We have been funded since inception primarily by unregistered sales of Company restricted
stock, generally to existing shareholders. We have also relied on a $1,000,000 equity
commitment from one of our Directors, Rex Carr, of which $500,000 remains available (See Note
5. Equity Commitment and Related Party Transactions). Rex Carr passed away on April 27,
2015. On April 30, 2015, the Company elected Glenn Carr as a Director to its Board of Directors
(the "Board"). Glenn Carr is the son of Rex Carr. The Company believes that the equity
commitment of Rex Carr will be honored by his estate. However, we can make no assurances as
to the timing of when the estate may be settled, and how much we may receive once the estate
is settled. During the second quarter of 2016, we assigned $12,500 of our claim against the Rex
Carr estate pursuant to our $1,000,000 equity commitment, to an interim capital investor (see
Note 9. Short term Notes Payable issued in Q2 2016). Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we assigned
an additional $300,000 of our claim against the Rex Carr estate to other interim capital investors
(see Note 13. Subsequent Events).
In addition, during the third quarter of 2014, we obtained additional funding in the form of a
convertible notes payable (see Note 6. Convertible Short-term Notes Payable). During the third
quarter of 2015, we obtained additional funding in the form of a subordinated notes payable
(see Note 7. Long term Notes Payable). We also obtained funding in the first quarter of 2016 in
the form of subordinated notes (see Note 8. Short term Notes Payable issued in Q1 2016) and
funding in the second quarter on 2016 in the form of subordinated notes (see Note 9. Short term
Notes Payable issued in Q2 2016).
We are currently in discussions with our investment bankers and a number of potential
investors to raise additional capital. We believe we will be successful in raising additional capital
to fund our operations, but if we are unable to secure additional capital, we will need to curtail
operations.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on
the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

Table of Contents
Note 3 – Significant Accounting Policies
Derivative Financial Instruments
We evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or
contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that
are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and
is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in our
statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, we use a Lattice
Model option pricing model, assuming maximum value, in accordance with the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") ASC
815-15, "Derivatives and Hedging," to value the derivative instruments at inception and on
subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether
such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each
reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in our balance sheet as current
or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could
be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Debt Issuance Cost
In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03: Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, we have reclassified Deferred Financing Costs as a direct
deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset for the period ending June 30,
2016 and retroactively for the period ending December 31, 2015.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We measure our financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of ASC 820,
"Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," which clarifies the definition of fair value,
prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify
the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the
reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1
primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives, marketable
securities and listed equities.
Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which
are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date and includes those financial
instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are
primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted
forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual
prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full
term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable
levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category
generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps, interest rate
swaps, options and collars.
Level 3 - Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from
objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that
result in management's best estimate of fair value.
The following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the Company's financial
assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value as of June 30, 2016, and December 31,
2015:

Note 4 – Stockholders' Equity (Deficit)
On March 25, 2016, we filed a certificate of amendment to our Articles of Incorporation
increasing the number of our authorized shares from 350,000,000 to 750,000,000 shares with the
Nevada Secretary of State.
Non-cash stock-based compensation expense recorded during the three and six months ended

During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we did not issue any options to employees or
Directors for Director-related services. The $903 of non-cash stock-based compensation
expense recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2016 relates to employee options
grants made during 2014 that have subsequent vesting terms. These 2014 employee options
grants became fully-vested during the six months ended June 30, 2016. $0 of unrecognized
non-cash stock-based compensation expense remains as of June 30, 2016.

Effective December 11, 2007, we received an investment commitment from Rex Carr, a Director
of the Company and a holder of over 5% of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the
commitment, Mr. Rex Carr agreed to invest up to an aggregate of $1,000,000 in the Company, at
such time or times as we may request, in the form of a purchase or purchases of our restricted
common stock. We may elect to draw from the commitment at one time or from time to time;
provided, however, that the aggregate of such draws may not exceed $1,000,000. We have
drawn down $500,000 of the commitment and issued to Mr. Rex Carr that number of our shares
of restricted common stock equal to the value of the investment then provided to us. The
number of shares to be issued was calculated based on the closing price of our common stock
as quoted on OTC Market Group's OTCQB marketplace on the date of the sale. There is no
stipulation regarding the duration of this commitment. The total amount available under this
commitment is $500,000 as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. However, during the
second quarter of 2016, we assigned $12,500 of our claim against the Rex Carr estate pursuant
to our $1,000,000 equity commitment, to an interim capital investor (see Note 9. Short term
Notes Payable issued in Q2 2016). Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we assigned an additional
$300,000 of our claim against the Rex Carr estate to other interim capital investors (see Note 13.
Subsequent Events).
Rex Carr passed away on April 27, 2015. On April 30, 2015, the Company elected Glenn Carr to
its Board. Glenn Carr is the son of Rex Carr, a deceased Director of the Company. The
Company believes that the equity commitment of Rex Carr referenced above will be honored by
his estate. However, we can make no assurances as to the timing of when the estate may be
settled, and how much we may receive once the estate is settled.
Note 6 – Convertible Short-term Notes Payable
On August 22, 2014 (the "2014 Closing Date"), we closed a financing transaction by entering
into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated August 22, 2014 (the "2014 Securities Purchase
Agreement") with certain funds and investors signatory to such 2014 Securities Purchase
Agreement (the "2014 Purchasers") for an aggregate subscription amount of $1,000,000 (the
"2014 Purchase Price") of which $50,000 is from a related party. Pursuant to the 2014 Securities
Purchase Agreement, we issued the following to the 2014 Purchasers: (i) 10% Convertible
Promissory Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1,150,000 (the "2014 Notes"), and (ii)
warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,666,667 shares of the Company's common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, for an exercise price of $0.12 per share for a period of five (5) years from
the effective date of the registration statement (the "2014 Warrants").
We recorded $150,000 of original issuance cost related to this transaction, which we have
recorded as debt discount.
The terms of the 2014 Notes and the 2014 Warrants are as follows:
10% Convertible Promissory Notes
The total principal amount of the 2014 Notes is issued with a 115% premium to the subscription
amount. The 2014 Notes accrue interest at a rate equal to 10% per annum and originally had a
maturity date of February 22, 2016. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, the maturity date of the
2014 Notes was extended to April 30, 2016. Subsequent to March 31, 2016, the maturity date of
the 2014 Notes was further extended to June 15, 2016. The note is currently in default. We are
currently in discussions with The 2014 Note Holders to further extend the maturity date. The
2014 Notes are convertible any time after the issuance date of the 2014 Notes. The 2014
Purchasers have the right to convert the 2014 Notes into shares of the Company's common
stock at a conversion price equal to $0.10 per share, subject to standard adjustments for stock
dividends, stock splits, subsequent equity sales, subsequent rights offerings and pro rata
distributions. While the 2014 Notes are outstanding, in the event of a subsequent equity sale at
a price lower than the conversion price of $0.10 per share, the conversion price of the 2014
Notes shall be reduced to the lower conversion price. The 2014 Notes can be redeemed under
certain conditions and the Company can force the conversion of the 2014 Notes in the event
certain equity conditions are met.

Table of Contents
In the event of default, the 2014 Purchasers have the right to require the Company to repay in
cash all or a portion of the 2014 Notes at a price equal to 125% of the aggregate principal
amount of the 2014 Notes plus all accrued but unpaid interest.
We recorded $29,513 and $30,840 of interest expense related to the issuance of the 2014 Notes
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively.
We recorded $62,765 and $60,593 of interest expense related to the issuance of the 2014 Notes
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively.
Warrants
The 2014 Warrants are exercisable in whole or in part, at an initial exercise price per share of
$0.12, subject to adjustment. The exercise price and number of shares of the Company's
common stock issuable under the 2014 Warrants (the "2014 Warrant Shares") are subject to
adjustments for stock dividends, splits, combinations, subsequent rights offerings, pro rata
distributions and any issuance of securities below the exercise price of the 2014 Warrants.
While the 2014 Warrants are outstanding, in the event of a subsequent equity sale including a
warrant exercise price lower than the exercise price of $0.12 per share, the exercise price of the
2014 Warrants shall be reduced to the lower exercise price. Any adjustment to the exercise
price shall similarly cause the number of 2014 Warrant Shares to be adjusted so that the total
value of the 2014 Warrants may increase, provided, that in no event shall the number of 2014
Warrant Shares exceed 200% of the original number of 2014 Warrant Shares originally issued.
In addition to the 2014 Warrants described above, the Company also issued 800,000 warrants to
a placement agent assisting with the convertible note transaction. The terms of the placement
agent warrants are the same as of the terms of the 2014 Warrants explained above.
Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the sale of the 2014 Notes and 2014 Warrants pursuant to the 2014 Securities
Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the "2014
Registration Rights Agreement") with the 2014 Purchasers, pursuant to which the Company
agreed to register all of the shares of common stock underlying the 2014 Notes and the shares
of common stock underlying the 2014 Warrants (together, the "2014 Registrable Securities") on
a Form S-1 registration statement (the "2014 Registration Statement") to be filed with the SEC
within thirty (30) calendar days following the 2014 Closing Date (the "2014 Filing Deadline") and
to use its best efforts to cause the 2014 Registration Statement to be declared effective under
the Securities Act within one hundred (100) calendar days following the 2014 Closing Date (the
"2014 Effectiveness Deadline"). The 2014 Registration Statement became effective November
26, 2014.
Deferred Financing Cost
In connection with the convertible note transaction explained above, the Company paid $55,000
for legal fees and $80,000 for placement agent fees. In addition, $29,550 was also recorded to
deferred financing costs related to the fair value valuation of the placement agent warrants. $0
and $27,189 of deferred financing costs were amortized during the three months ended June 30,
2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. $17,008 and $53,403 of deferred financing costs were
amortized during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. The
deferred financing cost balance related to the 2014 Notes is $0 and $17,008 as of June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Derivative
Because the above convertible 2014 Notes and 2014 Warrants have full reset adjustments tied
to future issuances of equity securities by the Company, they are subject to derivative liability
treatment under ASC 815-40-15, "Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is
Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock" ("ASC 815-40-15"). ASC 815-40-15 requires as of the date the
convertible 2014 Notes and 2014 Warrants are issued, the derivative liability to be measured at
the fair value and re-evaluated at the end of each reporting period. See Note 11. Derivative
Liability.

Blencathia was a public shell company with immaterial assets and liabilities and 312,000 shares
outstanding at the time of the merger, which it redeemed and cancelled upon the merger. In
exchange, we issued 312,000 of our common shares to the prior Blencathia owner with the
contractual understanding that such shares were to be sold by that owner to achieve gross
cash proceeds of $500,000. Any excess proceeds were to be returned to us and any deficiency
was to be made up by us issuing additional shares or paying the difference in cash. As we
believed that we controlled the ultimate timing of the sale of these 312,000 shares by the prior
Blencathia owner, we did not consider these shares as issued or outstanding for purposes of
computing earnings per share prior to 2006.
In 2006, we learned that the prior Blencathia owner had, in fact, sold the 312,000 shares for
aggregate proceeds of approximately $150,000, without our consent. Accordingly, in the fourth
quarter of 2006, we recorded $500,000 of general expenses (representing the cost of the 1999
merger) and the deemed issuance of approximately $150,000 of common stock. The remaining
$350,000 obligation was reflected as a current accrued expense. Beginning in 2006, the 312,000
shares have been reflected as outstanding for earnings per share computations. During 2009
and 2010, we made payments totaling $160,000 to the prior Blencathia owner. We have not
made any payments to the prior Blencathia owner since 2010. The related current accrued
expense balance remains at $190,000 at June 30, 2016. We are in negotiations with the prior
Blencathia owner to resolve this obligation and may ultimately settle the obligation with either
cash or equity securities with a lower market value.
Note 11 – Derivative Liability
During 2009, we granted a warrant to purchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common
stock to an accredited investor in conjunction with equity raise efforts. On April 12, 2013, our
Board authorized and approved the extension of the expiration date and a change of exercise
price for this warrant. The outstanding share purchase warrant originally had a March 23, 2014
expiration date and an exercise price of $0.25. The new modified terms extended the warrant
expiration date to April 11, 2018 and reduced the exercise price to $0.226. The exercise price is
also subject to dilutive adjustments for share issuances (full ratchet reset features). As of both
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the exercise price has been reduced to approximately
$0.14 and an additional 1,620,015 and 1,430,134 warrants as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively, are to be issued to the investor due to the reset features.

Table of Contents
On August 21, 2015, we issued 4,150,000 warrants to investors and 296,000 warrants to a
placement agent. The exercise price of these warrants is also subject to dilutive adjustments for
share issuance (full ratchet reset features). During Q1 2016, an additional 5,810,000 warrants
were issued to the 2015 Notes Payable holders and an additional 414,400 warrants were issued
to the placement agent because of the reset provision. See Note 7. 2015 Notes Payable.
On August 22, 2014, we issued 6,666,667 warrants to investors and 800,000 warrants to a
placement agent. The exercise price of these warrants is also subject to dilutive adjustments for
share issuance (full ratchet reset features). During Q1 2016, an additional 9,333,334 warrants
were issued to the 2014 Notes Payable holders and an additional 1,120,000 warrants were
issued to the placement agent because of this reset provision. See Note 6. Convertible Short-
term Notes Payable.
In the first quarter of 2016 we issued 3,737,500 warrants to investors (see note 8). The exercise
price of these warrants is subject to dilutive adjustments for share issuance (full ratchet reset
features).
In the second quarter of 2016 we 525,000 warrants to investors (see note 9). The exercise price
of these warrants is subject to dilutive adjustments for share issuance (full ratchet reset
features).
Because the convertible 2014 Notes, 2014 Warrants and 2015 Warrants and 2016 Warrants all
have full reset adjustments tied to future issuances of equity securities by the Company, they
are subject to derivative liability treatment under ASC 815-40-15, which requires as of the date
the convertible 2014 Notes, 2014 Warrants and 2015 Warrants are issued, the derivative liability
to be measured at fair value and re-evaluated at the end of each reporting period.
Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the convertible 2014 Notes are as follows:
Stock price volatility (one-year measurement):
December 31, 2015 measurement
June 30, 2016 measurement
 
Probability of default triggering 21% interest rate, increasing 1% per month
to a maximum of 10% with a 125% penalty:
Probability of the Company redeeming the convertible 2014 Notes (with
130% penalty): projected initially at 0% of the time, increasing 2% monthly
to a maximum of 5% (from alternative financing being available for a
redemption event to occur)
Conversion behavior - holder automatically converts the convertible 2014
Notes at a maximum of 2 times the conversion price.

derivative liability of $321,230 and $65,166 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30,
2015, respectively.

Note 12 – Legal Proceedings
We are periodically subject to various lawsuits and claims with respect to matters arising out of
the normal course of business. While the impact on future financial results is not subject to
reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists, management believes, after
consulting with counsel, that it is more likely than not that the ultimate liabilities resulting from
such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.
On July 31, 2006, we received notice from the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") of a
Demand for Arbitration dated July 27, 2006 received by the AAA naming the Company as
Respondent and TPG Capital Partners ("TPG"), the prior Blencathia owner, as the Claimant. The
arbitration had been requested by TPG to resolve an alleged aggregate proceeds shortfall from
the sale of our securities issued in the Blencathia merger. TPG has claimed they sold some or
all of the 312,000 shares and the sales have not generated at least $500,000 of proceeds, as
guaranteed in the merger documents.
In an effort to resolve this matter prior to submission to binding arbitration, both TPG and the
Company participated in a non-binding mediation conference on January 30, 2007, which did
not resolve the matter. Informal discussions are ongoing. It is not expected that the ultimate
settlement of this matter, considering we have recorded a liability for the shortfall amount, will
have an additional adverse material effect on the Company. Since 2009, the Company has made
payments to TPG totaling $160,000 to reduce the recorded liability. The remaining recorded
liability balance is $190,000 at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
We are a defendant in litigation with a former employee regarding accrued but unpaid salary. We
are in discussions for settlement of this claim and have accrued an amount that we believe will
resolve this matter.
Note 13 – Subsequent Events
On July 7, 2016, July 20, 2016 and July 27 2016, the Company issued $42,000, $42,000 and
$41,000, respectively, of notes payable to non-affiliated individual investors. A total of 1,250,000
five-year warrants with an exercise price of $0.05 per share were issued pursuant to these
investments.The terms of these loans were the same as the terms of the 2016 Q2 Notes Payable
(see Note 9.). In addition, a total of $300,000 of collateral, in the form of an assignment of our
claim against the Rex Carr estate, was assigned to these investors.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have
affected the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Fuel Performance
Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as International Fuel Technology, Inc.) (the "Company," "we,"
"us" or "our") during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. This
discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in
our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 30, 2016 (the "Annual Report").
Forward-looking Statements and Associated Risks
This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that are based largely
on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many
of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, economic, competitive and other
factors affecting our operations, markets, products and services, expansion strategies, our
ability to raise additional capital and other factors described elsewhere in this report and
documents filed by us with the SEC, including in our Annual Report under the "Risk Factors"
section. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates,"
variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. In light
of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, there can be no assurance that the forward-
looking information contained in this report will, in fact, prove accurate. We do not undertake
any obligation to revise these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or
circumstances.
Overview
We are a fuel performance enhancement technology company transitioning to a commercial
enterprise. We believe the macroeconomic environment for our technology and products is
excellent now and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. We believe ever-increasing
fuel environmental regulations will likely result in increased demand for additive products to
help offset adverse fuel performance and engine impacts resulting from these regulations. We
believe our products and technology are uniquely positioned to benefit from this macro
environment by offering fuel performance enhancement solutions that specifically address
these macro developments and trends.
Commercial Update
During fiscal year 2015 and continuing into the first half of 2016, our three primary distribution
partners, Unipart, Brenntag and Nordmann Rassmann ("NRC"), reorganized their efforts on our
behalf and committed additional resources to better capitalize on the growing opportunities
they foresee with our proprietary fuel additive formulations. These additional efforts by our
distribution partners have resulted in more commercial opportunities for us that should come to
fruition in 2016.
This repositioning by our distribution partners in 2015 and into the first half of 2016 had a
negative effect on our revenues in the short term, but has provided us with a greater platform to
succeed going forward.
The second quarter of 2016 was not a great quarter in terms of revenues. However, it was a
productive quarter as a number of high profile projects with numerous rail and road transport
operators in Europe continued to move forward. We are close to finalizing a number of these
projects which should result in revenues beginning in the third quarter of 2016.
Our distribution partners will continue to account for the vast majority of our commercial
opportunities and progress.
Unipart: Since the third quarter of 2014, our commercial efforts have been focused on the
development of, preparation for, and the launch of the Fuel Efficiency Management ("FEM")
program in conjunction with Unipart.
20
Table of Contents
Since that time period, in consultation with Unipart, we put all of our DiesoLiFTTM sales and
marketing efforts in the United Kingdom and Europe on hold pending the proper development
of the FEM program. Equipment vendors for all aspects of the FEM program have now been
sourced and vetted and the deliberate pace to ensure the FEM program was ready for proper
deployment has reached the launch point. Unipart now has a group set up for the specific
purpose of commercializing DiesoLiFTTM. Unipart continues to commit more time, effort and
resources toward making the FEM program a success.
In the third quarter of 2015, we expanded our marketing and distribution agreement with
Unipart. The revised marketing and distribution agreement with Unipart provides Unipart
exclusive distribution rights for DiesoLiFTTM for the rail industry worldwide; exclusive
distribution rights for DiesoLiFTTM for commercial and public service vehicle and retail markets
in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Australia, South Africa and theMiddle East;
exclusive distribution rights for GasoLiftTM for all sectors in the United Kingdom and The
Republic of Ireland; and non-exclusive distribution rights for DiesoLiFTTM and GasoLiFTTM
worldwide.
In addition, Unipart has been granted exclusive distribution rights for PerfoClean in the United
Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and non-exclusive distribution rights worldwide.
PerfoClean is our proprietary formulation specifically designed to clean bulk fuel storage tanks.
Unipart adopted the FEM program in its own fleet of distribution vehicles in 2015 and is actively
involved in commercial projects with numerous road transport operators (both private and
public sector), rail operators (both passenger and freight) and fuel wholesalers. We expect
additional deployments of the FEM program in the third quarter of 2016.
The FEM program is our primary business focus and will be the primary driver of our future
revenues and profits.
Brenntag: In 2015, Brenntag made the decision to re-evaluate their efforts on our behalf. After
extensive analysis, and as part of their strategic fuel business planning, Brenntag decided there
was a compelling opportunity to put in place a more organized and concerted marketing and
sales approach to our product line. Brenntag has completed its market by market studies and
will roll-out their revised marketing and sales plan for distribution of our products across
Europe in the third quarter of 2016.
Brenntag will also continue to sell our products to Bardahl, Lubrichim, ETSP, Lubro and Eurol,
who all repackage the products and sell to retail customers under their own brand name.
Going forward, we expect Brenntag to execute on their revised plan and ramp up their selling
efforts of our products to: the road transport industry (fleets); refineries and fuel distributors;
bio-diesel manufacturers; and the marine industry.
NRC: In 2015, NRC decided to re-evaluate their efforts on our behalf. After extensive review,
NRC concluded there was a compelling opportunity to more aggressively market and sell our
unique fuel additives formulations. As a result, the entire Company product line was moved out
of NRC's new business division and into their Oleochemicals, Lubes & Growth division. This
transition provides NRC with more resources to market and sell our products.
We are in the process of updating and expanding our distribution agreement with NRC to reflect
the increased resources that NRC is now dedicating to the marketing and sales of our
proprietary fuel additive formulations.
21
Table of Contents
The primary thrust of NRC efforts will continue to be with our PerfoLiFTTM line of bio-diesel
stabilization additives used to stabilize and prolong the shelf life of bio-diesel fuels or all
underlying sources. NRC continues to receive orders from and sell our products to some of the
largest bio-diesel manufacturers in Europe.
Despite the fact that sales of our PerfoLiFTTM BD-Series product line to NRC decreased during
2015 and in the first half of 2016 compared to prior periods, we expect NRC to increase its sales
of our PerfoLiFTTM BD-Series of bio-diesel stability additives in 2016 and beyond through
increased sales to existing accounts and sales to new accounts.
NRC has also begun to market our products to the marine industry and to some road transport
fleets.
Results of Operations
Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three and Six Months Ended June 30,
2015
Net Revenues
Net revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $9,045, as compared to $91,295 for
the three-month period ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to
decreased sales of the PerfoLiFTTM BD-Series and DiesoLiFTTM through our distributor
network during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, all of our sales were to one of our distribution
partners. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, 100% of our sales were concentrated
among three customers. Sales revenue generated during the three months ended June 30, 2016
and June 30, 2015 was primarily generated from the sale of the PerfoLiFTTM BD-Series and
DiesoLiFTTM.
Net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $56,667, as compared to $225,368
for the six month period ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to
decreased sales of the PerfoLiFTTM BD-Series and DiesoLiFTTM through our distributor
network during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, 100% of our sales were concentrated among two
customers. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, 100% of our sales were concentrated
among four customers. Sales revenue generated during the three months ended June 30, 2016

a $45,404 decrease in professional services expenses; and
 
a $38,592 decrease in salary and wages pertaining to the implementation of salary reductions.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net was $92,605 and $167,519 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest expense, net is primarily attributable to
interest expense recorded relating to the third quarter of 2015 Notes financing.
Interest expense, net was $292,709 and $316,475 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in interest expense, net is primarily attributable to
interest expense recorded relating to the third quarter of 2015 Notes financing.

Gain (Loss) on Derivative Liability
Gain on derivative liability was $258,793 and $27,860 for the three months ended June 30, 2016
and June 30, 2015, respectively.
The gain on derivative liability recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June
30, 2015 was primarily attributable to certain warrants issued during 2009 and during 2014, 2015
and the first and second quartersof 2016 (see Note 11 – Derivative Liability) that are subject to
dilutive adjustments for share issuances (full ratchet reset features) tied to future issuances of
our equity securities. Because of these characteristics, our derivative liability must be measured
at fair value and re-evaluated at the end of each reporting period. The mark-to-market of the
derivative liability at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 caused such gain.
Gain on derivative liability was $321,230 and $65,166 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and June 30, 2015, respectively.
The gain on derivative liability recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June
30, 2015 was primarily attributable to certain warrants issued during 2009 and during 2014, 2015

at fair value and re-evaluated at the end of each reporting period. The mark-to-market of the
derivative liability at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 caused such gain.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of both components of our derivative
liability was $134,484 and $425,035, respectively.
Income Tax Provision
We have operated at a net loss since inception and have not recorded or paid any income
taxes, other than for non-cash deferred tax expense related to a basis difference between
financial reporting and tax reporting goodwill. We have significant net operating loss ("NOL")
carry-forwards that would be recognized at such time as we demonstrate the ability to operate
on a profitable basis for an extended period of time. The deferred income tax asset resulting
primarily from the NOL carry-forwards has been fully reserved with a valuation allowance.
Because goodwill is not depreciated and has an indefinite life for book purposes, the deferred
tax liability related to the book to tax basis difference is not offset against the deferred tax
assets when establishing our valuation allowance. We did not record any expense during the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively, as we deemed the valuation
allowance to be sufficient.
Net Loss
Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $(49,618), as compared to $(505,195) for
the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to: an
increase in gain on derivative liability of $230,933; and decreases in net interest expense
($74,914), salaries and wages ($56,542), employee expenses ($38,685, non-cash stock-based
compensation expense ($35,507), and professional services ($29,887). described above. The
basic and diluted net loss per common share for both the three months ended June 30, 2016
and June 30, 2015 was $(0.00), respectively.
Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $(489,520), as compared to $(975,724) for
the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to: an increase
in gain on derivative liability ($256,064); and decreases in employee expenses ($79,626, non-
cash stock-based compensation expense ($71,880), , professional services ($45,404) and salary
and wages ($38,592) as described above. The basic and diluted net loss per common share for
both the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 was $(0.00), respectively.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards,
if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Derivative Financial Instruments
We evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or
contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that
are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and
is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in our
statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, we use a Lattice
Model option pricing model, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
"FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") ASC 815-15, "Derivatives and Hedging,"
to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be
recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative
instrument liabilities are classified in our balance sheet as current or non-current based on
whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve
(12) months of the balance sheet date.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue from the sale of our products when the price is fixed and determinable,
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the products are shipped, and title and risk of
loss has passed to the buyer and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably
assured. The majority of our revenues is from sales to product distributors. Product distributors
do not have the option to return product that is not immediately sold to an end-user. Therefore,
our revenue recognition is not conditional on whether a distributor is able to sell product to an
ultimate product end-user. Our sales policies for end-users are consistent with product
distributor sales policies.
Beginning in May 2013, as an effort to address our outstanding payable balance with and at the
request of our product manufacturer, our non-United States customers began remitting
receivable payments directly to our product manufacturer in lieu of remitting payment directly to
us. Under this arrangement, we still maintained the risks and benefits related to sending the
product to each customer and thus recorded sales revenues (and associated cost of sales)
applying the gross reporting treatment for each transaction pursuant to ASC 605-45, "Principal
Agent Considerations." During the first quarter of 2014, we once again began collecting
payments directly from our non-United States customers and paying our product manufacturer
separately for the corresponding cost of manufactured goods.
Investor Warrant Modifications
The Company and the Board from time to time have authorized the modification to the terms of
certain prior warrant issuances. We analyze such modifications under ASC 718
"Compensation-Stock Compensation" ("ASC 718") and ASC 505, "Equity Based Payments to
Non-Employees" ("ASC 505") and have historically determined that no gain or loss is
recognized upon the modification due to the warrants having been issued to an investor and
investor awards not being subject to either ASC 718 or ASC 505.
25
Table of Contents
Valuation of Goodwill
We account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350 "Intangibles-
Goodwill and Other" ("ASC 350"). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with
indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or
circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. In
addition, ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level
(operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between
annual tests when circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of
goodwill may be in doubt. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment,
including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units,
assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. Significant judgments
required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows,
determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates
and assumptions or the occurrence of one or more confirming events in future periods could
cause the actual results or outcomes to materially differ from such estimates and could also
affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment at future reporting dates.
We employed a qualitative analysis for goodwill at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
and determined there was no impairment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
A critical component of our operating plan affecting our ability to execute the product
commercialization process is the cash resources needed to pursue our marketing and sales
objectives. Until we are able to generate positive and sustainable operating cash flow, our ability
to attract additional capital resources in the future will be critical to continue the funding of our
operations.
In its audit report dated June 30, 2016, our independent registered public accounting firm
expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.
We have been funded since inception primarily by unregistered sales of Company restricted
stock, generally to existing shareholders. We have also relied on a $1,000,000 equity
commitment from one of our Directors, Rex Carr, of which $500,000 remains available (See Note
5. Equity Commitment and Related Party Transactions.) Rex Carr passed away on April 27,
2015. On April 30, 2015, the Company elected Glenn Carr as a Director to its Board. Glenn Carr
is the son of Rex Carr. The Company believes that the equity commitment of Rex Carr will be
honored by his estate. However, we can make no assurances as to the timing of when the estate
may be settled, and how much we may receive once the estate is settled. During the second
quarter of 2016, we assigned $12,500 of our claim against the Rex Carr estate pursuant to our
$1,000,000 equity commitment, to an interim capital investor (see Note 9. 2016 Q2 Notes
Payable). Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we assigned an additional $300,000 of our claim against
the Rex Carr estate to other interim capital investors (see Note 13. Subsequent Events).
In addition, during the third quarter of 2014, we obtained additional funding in the form of a
convertible notes payable (see Note 6. Convertible Short-term Notes Payable) and during the
third quarter of 2015, we obtained additional funding in the form of a subordinated notes
payable (see Note 7. 2015 Notes Payable). We also obtained funding in the first and second
quarters of 2016 in the form of subordinated notes (see Note 8. 2016 Q1 Notes Payable and Note
9. 2016 Q2 Notes Payable).
While we cannot make any assurances as to the accuracy of our projections of future capital
needs, based on our current cash available as of August 15, 2016 (approximately $70,000) and
additional capital commitments from Directors, we have adequate cash and cash equivalents
balances and commitments to fund operations through the end of September 2016.
Management implemented a salary deferral program for all employees during 2011 to conserve
our cash position. This salary deferral program has continued.
We are currently working with two U.K.-based investment banks. Based on recent discussions
with them, we believe they will be successful in raising long term capital in the fourth quarter of
2016.
However, if we are unable to secure additional capital, we will need to curtail operations.

Cash used in operating activities was $383,121 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to cash used in operating activities of $498,353 for the six months ended June 30,
2015. The decrease in cash flow used in operating activities was due primarily to a decrease in
our accounts receivable balance ($282,211) due to timing of customer cash collections and a
$256,064 gain on derivative liability, partially offset by a decrease in our accounts payable
balance ($201,218) due to timing of vendor payments.
Cash provided by financing activities was $376,250 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. During the six months ended June 30,
2016, we received gross proceeds of $376,250 from the issuance of notes payable.
Net cash increased (decreased) by ($11,871) and $(498,353) for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, we did not make significant
investments in property and equipment and do not anticipate doing so in the immediate future.
Working capital deficit at June 30, 2016 was $(3,338,696), as compared to $(3,126,013) at
December 31, 2015. The negative working capital balance for June 30, 2016 is negatively
impacted by continued operational cash burn to fund ongoing operations during the six
months ended June 30, 2016, the issuance of the 2016 Notes payable and the reclassification of
the 2014 Notes payable and associated accrued interest payable from a long term liability to a
current liability at December 31, 2015. The negative working capital balance for December 31,
2015 is negatively impacted by continued operational cash burn to fund ongoing operations
during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and the reclassification of the 2014 Notes
payable and associated accrued interest payable from a long term liability to a current liability at
December 31, 2015.
Effective October 27, 1999, we merged with Blencathia Acquisition Corporation ("Blencathia").
Blencathia was a public shell company with immaterial assets and liabilities and 312,000 shares
outstanding at the time of the merger, which it redeemed and cancelled upon the merger. In
exchange, we issued 312,000 of our common shares to the prior Blencathia owner with the
contractual understanding that such shares were to be sold by that owner to achieve gross
cash proceeds of $500,000. Any excess proceeds were to be returned to us and any deficiency
was to be made up by us issuing additional shares or paying the difference in cash. As we
believed that we controlled the ultimate timing of the sale of these 312,000 shares by the prior
Blencathia owner, we did not consider these shares as issued or outstanding for purposes of
computing loss per share.
In 2006, we learned that the prior Blencathia owner had, in fact, sold the 312,000 shares for
aggregate proceeds of approximately $150,000, without our consent. Accordingly, in the fourth
quarter of 2006, we recorded $500,000 of general expenses (representing the cost of the 1999
merger) and the deemed issuance of approximately $150,000 of common stock. Since 2009, we
have made payments to the prior Blencathia owner in the aggregate of $160,000 reducing this
obligation. The remaining $190,000 obligation has been reflected as a current accrued expense.
We are in negotiations with the prior Blencathia owner to resolve this obligation and may
ultimately settle the obligation with either cash or equity securities with a lower market value.
Beginning in 2006, the 312,000 shares have been reflected as outstanding for earnings per
share computations.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
Not applicable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2016. Based
on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have identified a
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Because of the material
weakness, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at June 30, 2016.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-
15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30,
2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our independent auditors
regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to
attestation by our independent auditors pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit our
company to provide only management's report in this quarterly report.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
We are periodically subject to various lawsuits and claims with respect to matters arising out of
the normal course of business. While the impact on future financial results is not subject to
reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists, management believes, after
consulting with counsel, that it is more likely than not that the ultimate liabilities resulting from
such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.
On July 31, 2006, we received notice from the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") of a
Demand for Arbitration dated July 27, 2006 received by the AAA naming us as Respondent and
TPG Capital Partners ("TPG"), the prior Blencathia owner, as the Claimant. The arbitration had
been requested by TPG to resolve an alleged aggregate proceeds shortfall from the sale of
Company securities issued in the Blencathia merger. TPG has claimed they sold some or all of
the 312,000 shares and the sales have not generated at least $500,000 of proceeds, as
guaranteed in the merger documents.
In an effort to resolve this matter prior to submission to binding arbitration, both TPG and the
Company participated in a non-binding mediation conference on January 30, 2007, which did
not resolve the matter. Informal discussions are ongoing. It is not expected that the ultimate
settlement of this matter, considering we have recorded a liability for the shortfall amount, will
have an additional adverse material effect on the Company. Since 2009, we have made
payments to TPG totaling $160,000 to reduce the recorded liability. The remaining liability
balance is $190,000 at June 30, 2016.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company received a cumulative total of $52,500 in the
form of subordinated notes; $12,500 from external investors and $40,000 from two Directors of
the Company (see Note 9. 2016 Q2 Notes Payable above). The subordinated 2016 Q2 Notes
included warrants to purchase 525,000 shares of our common stock with a five year term and an
exercise price of $0.05, subject to adjustments for stock dividends, splits, combinations,
subsequent rights offerings, pro rata distributions and any issuance of securities below the
$0.05 exercise price. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities
Not applicable.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
Not applicable.
Item 5. Other Information
There have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may
recommend nominees to our Board of Directors since the filing of our Annual Report.
