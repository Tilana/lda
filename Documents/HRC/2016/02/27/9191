<p><b>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY-BUILDING

<p><b>Situation of human rights in Haiti 
</b></p>
<p> For personal reasons beyond his control, Mr. Louis Joinet, independent expert appointed 
by the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights in Haiti, has been unable to carry out 
his last mission to Haiti, initially planned for late 2007. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Joinet very much regrets that he will not therefore be in a position to present his report 
to the Human Rights Council at its eighth session in June 2008.
