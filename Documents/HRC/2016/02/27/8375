<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eleventh 
session from 2 to 13 May 2011.  The review of Sierra Leone was held at the 8th meeting on 
5 May 2011. The delegation of Sierra Leone was headed by Franklyn Bai Kargbo, 
Attorney-General and Minister of Justice. At its 12th meeting, held on 9 May 2011, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Sierra Leone. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Sierra Leone: Maldives, Slovakia and 
Zambia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Sierra Leone: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/SLE/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SLE/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SLE/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Sierra Leone through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. In his introductory remarks, the head of delegation provided the context in which the 
national report under the UPR was compiled. The present Government came to power in 
September 2007 headed by President Koroma. A new rights-based development framework 
was quickly enunciated by the Government, called an Agenda for Change. The process for 
reporting under the UPR was launched by the President in 2010 and designated as a priority 
activity. Extensive consultations were held with civil society, children, women 
development partners and traditional and religious leaders, with the help of partners. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation reminded participants that Sierra Leone had suffered a brutal 11-year 
war, fought against unarmed civilians. Massacres, murder, forced recruitment of children 
into the fighting factions and forced marriages marked this war. The war officially ended on 
18 January 2002, following which two transitional-justice mechanisms were established. 
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was tasked with collating a historical 
record of the conflict and making recommendations to avoid any reoccurrence of conflict. 
The Special Court for Sierra Leone, which is a hybrid court, was established by the 
Government and the United Nations. It was tasked with addressing impunity for those 
bearing the greatest responsibilities in the perpetration of egregious human rights violations 
during the war. Eight persons were now serving prison sentences in Rwanda. The trial of 
the former President of Liberia, Charles Taylor, continued. </p>


<p>7. The basic law of Sierra Leone is the 1991 Constitution of Sierra Leone. It contains 
an entrenched Bill of Rights under its Chapter III. In 2007, the present Government 
inherited a Constitutional Review Process which had addressed emerging concerns about 
legislation that discriminated against women and discriminatory provisions within 
citizenship legislation as well as questions relating to the abolition of the death penalty. The 
delegation indicated that this process had been put on hold pending the 2012 elections, 
given the fragility of Sierra Leone&#8217;s new democracy. 
</p>
<p>8. The Government planned to adopt legislation, prior to the next election, to accord 30 
per cent representation for women in all public positions, including parliamentary 
administration and Cabinet positions. Consultations were ongoing on this matter. 
Information was provided on recently adopted legislation, including the Registration of 
Customary Marriage and Divorce Act of 2007, the Devolution of Estates Act 2007, the 
Domestic Violence Act, the HIV Prevention Act of 2007 and the recently passed Disability 
Act. 
</p>
<p>9. Reference was made to the National Human Rights Commission established in 2004 
which controlled its own processes and budget. It was expected that the Commission would 
shortly be accredited under the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>10. On the protection of women and girls, the Government intended to press the issue of 
curtailing and eventually abolishing deeply rooted harmful traditional practices such as 
early marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM). Legislation had been passed to 
mandate the age of consent at 18 years. The Government has also embarked upon a massive 
sensitization of the population about FGM in collaboration with the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>11. Sierra Leone held its fiftieth anniversary on 27 April 2011. The UPR provided an 
ideal opportunity for serious stocktaking and showcasing the steps taken to meeting its 
international obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>12. During the interactive dialogue, 41 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations commended Sierra Leone for its commitment to human rights issues, for the 
national report which set out the challenges faced by the Government, as well as for 
cooperating and consulting with civil society in its preparation. A number of delegations 
recognized the human rights progress achieved after more than 10 years of civil war. 
Recommendations made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present 
report. 
</p>
<p>13. Japan commended Sierra Leone&#8217;s efforts to promote the reintegration of former 
child soldiers. It welcomed the educational reform and the establishment of a free health 
care programme.<b> </b> It noted with concern the systematic abuse of women, girls and children 
during the conflict, the continuing gender-based violence, and structural and legal gender 
inequality. Japan inquired on specific measures taken to respond to recommendations made 
by United Nations institutions to amend discriminatory domestic legislation against women 
and to ensure equality in employment between women and men. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>14. Nepal<b> </b>noted with appreciation legislative and institutional initiatives undertaken and 
the efforts made for socio-economic development and enhancing effective service delivery. 
Sierra Leone was also commended for its reconstruction and rehabilitation strategies. Nepal 
urged the international community to support Sierra Leone&#8217;s initiatives through technical 
assistance and capacity-building. It made recommendations. </p>


<p>15. Poland noted the enactment of some crucial laws in the fields of women&#8217;s and 
children&#8217;s rights. Poland was aware of Sierra Leone&#8217;s challenges, caused by difficult socio-
economic conditions and capacity constraints. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>16. Algeria commended the setting up of institutions and mechanisms and the adoption 
of action plans and national strategies in the areas of the rights of children, women and 
persons with disabilities. It noted that in spite of Sierra Leone&#8217;s commitment to end 
discrimination and violence against women and to include at least 30 per cent of them in 
political life, these objectives remained a challenge. Algeria mentioned the overcrowding in 
prisons. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>17. Morocco<b> </b>commended Sierra Leone&#8217;s political commitment to achieve truth and 
reconciliation; to establish peace and stability; and to rebuild the social fabric through 
dialogue. It commended the legal and institutional measures taken, good governance and 
other human rights achievements. Morocco called for solidarity and technical and financial 
assistance to support these efforts, notably to organize and speed up constitutional reform, 
to implement fundamental rights and meet the priorities of the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs) such as access to food, housing, health, water and education. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>18. France raised concerns about gender discrimination, particularly the 
underrepresentation of women in politics, discrimination of women under customary law 
and the lawfulness of female genital mutilation. It asked if legal measures and strategies 
were being considered to remedy this situation. France asked about the measures to put an 
end to human ritual sacrifice and about intentions to abolish death penalty. It requested 
information on the measures to remedy the overcrowding in prisons and poor detention 
conditions. It asked about the provisions considered to combat impunity for the crimes 
perpetrated during the armed conflict and the 2007 elections and to punish abuses 
committed by the police and the security forces. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>19. Canada expressed appreciation for Sierra Leone&#8217;s commitment to fully implement 
the TRC recommendations. It noted the Presidential Apology to women and girls for their 
suffering during the war, the National Action Plan on Security Council resolutions 1325 
(2000) and 1820 (2008) and the establishment of Family Support Units. Canada welcomed 
Sierra Leone&#8217;s commitment to equality and non-discrimination principles. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>20. Ireland<b> </b>welcomed the Human Rights Commission while noting reported funding 
difficulties. Ireland noted the TRC&#8217;s contribution to hastening the development of human 
rights culture and commended the Government&#8217;s commitment to fully implement the TRC 
recommendations. It referred to significant corruption issues within the Sierra Leone police 
undermining public confidence in the institutions. Ireland welcomed Sierra Leone&#8217;s de 
facto moratorium on the use of death penalty but noted that much work remained to 
permanently remove this punishment from legislation.<b> </b>Ireland made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>21. Azerbaijan noted Sierra Leone&#8217;s social and economic challenges stemming from the 
civil war. It welcomed the measures taken to investigate the issues related to the war and 
the commitment to rebuild society and economy. It also commended the gender equality 
efforts, including the National Gender Strategic Plan and the establishment of Family 
Support Units. It mentioned the Children&#8217;s Forum Network, the Directorate for Gender and 
a Directorate for Children. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. Spain<b> </b>recognized the efforts made by Sierra Leone to overcome the wounds of 
armed conflict and the steps taken to improve the human rights situation, although serious 
human rights issues remained. As a sign of improvement, Spain referred to the two 
electoral processes carried out in the country. Spain made recommendations. </p>


<p>23. The delegation replied that<b> </b>Sierra Leone intended to meet its human rights treaty 
reporting obligations in the future, however, there was a need for technical assistance in 
that regard. 
</p>
<p>24. While there may be instances of child labour, the delegation reaffirmed that the 
recruitment of children in the armed forces had been expressly prohibited under the Child 
Rights Act and extensive publicity had been given to that ban. 
</p>
<p>25. The delegation explained that there was no violence during the 2007 election. 
However, after the election, there was an incident in Freetown. With the facilitation of 
UNIPSIL, a Commission was established, with Commissioners nominated by all concerned 
parties.  A report was produced, blame was apportioned and the necessary steps were taken. 
The delegation noted that another report about violence, unrelated to elections and 
ethnicity, was outstanding. The Government intended to address those issues and bring the 
perpetrators to book. 
</p>
<p>26. The Government was committed to the elimination of the practice of FGM. Steps 
were being taken progressively and continuously to reach that goal. 
</p>
<p>27. There was no discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. It was expressly 
prohibited under the Constitution.  The delegation reiterated the Government&#8217;s commitment 
that persons under its jurisdiction will be protected by the law. 
</p>
<p>28. The delegation referred to a new Local Courts Act which brought the administration 
of justice at the customary and traditional level into the mainstream and the formal legal 
system. It was expected to become law by the end of June. The law would bring the 
administration of these courts under the purview of the Chief Justice, reducing the 
possibility of violations and non-access to justice. The Government in Cabinet had also 
adopted a national legal-aid project which was extended to the local courts level. That 
legislation was being reviewed by Parliament. Additionally, the Government had created an 
enabling environment whereby NGOs and other institutions operated a legal aid system at 
the community level. 
</p>
<p>29. Currently, Sierra Leone had no death-row prisoners. On 27 April 2011, the President 
of Sierra Leone commuted all death sentences to life imprisonment and three death-row 
prisoners were given a pardon. No one had been executed in Sierra Leone since 1998. The 
question of the abolition of the death penalty was on the legislative agenda of the 
Government. It had been extensively discussed during the Constitutional Review Process.  
That process will continue after the 2012 elections. 
</p>
<p>30. On the question of citizenship the Government recognized that the provision in its 
1973 Citizenship Act requiring that forefathers twice removed must be of negro-African 
descent, was contrary to international human rights obligations. That issue will also be 
addressed in the future Constitutional Review process. 
</p>
<p>31. Norway expressed concern regarding women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; illiteracy, jeopardizing 
their job possibilities and active involvement in development. Norway expressed concern 
about infant and maternal mortality rates. While commending Sierra Leone&#8217;s support for 
the joint statement on ending human rights violations based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity, Norway noted that criminal sanctions against sexual activity between 
consenting adults of the same sex were maintained. It expressed deep concern about 
impunity in cases of sexual violence. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Cuba<b> </b>mentioned Sierra Leone&#8217;s challenges, due to economic crises, international 
exploitation and civil war, highlighting poverty, youth unemployment, poor basic social 
infrastructure, street children, youth violence and women&#8217;s underrepresentation in 
leadership positions. Cuba noted progress to achieve peace and reconciliation; to prioritize 
free public health care; to implement policies to fulfil the rights of women, as </p>


<p>recommended by the TRC, and to reduce illiteracy by increasing free and compulsory 
education. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Austria welcomed the elaboration of the national report in consultation with civil 
society. It commended institutional reforms, including the establishment of the Human 
Rights Commission Anti-Corruption Commission, the Human Rights Secretariat and the 
Parliamentary Human Rights Committee. It noted that important TRC recommendations 
had yet to be implemented and asked for further information on the delivery of benefits to 
war victims and completion of the constitutional review process. It expressed concern about 
the high level of violence against women, particularly the widespread practice of FGM and 
asked about concrete steps taken to discontinue the practice. Austria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Germany noted the establishment of a Commission to review the Constitution, a key 
recommendation of the TRC. Germany wished to know how the Government would  
advance its efforts to overcome the contradiction between Constitutional provisions and 
progressive human rights-supportive laws, for example, in the field of equality between 
women and men. Germany noted estimates that 90 per cent of women in Sierra Leone had 
undergone FGM. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Argentina highlighted the actions of the Special Court for Sierra Leone to 
investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for the crimes committed during the 
armed conflict. Argentina placed stress on the implementation of mechanisms to recognize 
the conflict&#8217;s victims and provide them with reparation. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Brazil welcomed Sierra Leone&#8217;s commitment to combat poverty, consolidate 
democracy and revitalize the economy through the implementation of the &#8220;Agenda for 
Change&#8221;. Brazil noted such achievements as the Presidential Apology to women and girls, 
the adoption of the Domestic Violence Act, the establishment of mechanisms to investigate 
cases of sexual and domestic violence and free health care programmes. It appreciated 
assurances that the abolition of the death penalty was on the legislative agenda and that a 
standing invitation was issued to the special procedures. Brazil noted the persistence of a 
high incidence of gender-related crimes and that challenges remained in relation to access 
to medical care and legal assistance. It made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>37. Australia congratulated Sierra Leone for its request to be considered by the United 
Nations Peace Building Commission. Australia called for the domestic implementation of 
international human rights treaties and the TRC recommendations. Australia expressed 
concern about extended periods of detention without trial resulting from a lack of 
prosecutorial capacity, and reported impunity in cases of gender-based violence as well as 
the exploitation of child labour. It encouraged Sierra Leone to strengthen its judicial 
system. Australia was pleased to have provided assistance to Sierra Leone. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Chile<b> </b>pointed to the TRC and its 2004 report as an important transitional-justice 
mechanism to fight impunity, promote national reconciliation and guarantee their non-
reoccurrence. Chile congratulated Sierra Leone on its efforts to implement the TRC  
recommendations. Chile especially welcomed the recent free public health programme and   
noted the death-penalty commutations. Chile made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>39. Hungary acknowledged the TRC&#8217;s remarkable work, the adoption of the Health 
Sector Strategic Plan 2010-2015 and the establishment of the National AIDS Secretariat. 
Hungary noted that primary education was still not free of charge and that the lack of 
infrastructure and overcrowded classrooms affected the learning environment. Hungary 
suggested that Sierra Leone use the concluding observations of treaty bodies to identify the 
most pressing human rights issues. It made recommendations.  </p>


<p>40. The Netherlands commended impressive legal developments, while noting that the 
basic rights of vulnerable groups remained threatened, especially those of women and 
children, prisoners, human rights defenders and journalists. Their right to freely express and 
organise themselves had reportedly been violated without the intervention of the 
authorities. It took note of the National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS. It thanked Sierra 
Leone for supporting the statement on ending human rights violations based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity, while referring to reports that LGBT people did not benefit 
from the protection afforded by article 27 of the Constitution which prohibited 
discrimination. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. The delegation indicated that although the Follow-up Committee to the Truth and 
Reconciliation Committee had yet to be constituted, the Government intended to do so, in 
due course. Recommendations of the TRC were, nevertheless, being implemented. For 
example, the National Commission for Social Action was implementing the reparations 
programme. Despite a background of severe economic constraints and unfulfilled 
assurances from development partners, Sierra Leone continued to implement the 
Commission&#8217;s recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Ratification of international treaties was at the top of the Government&#8217;s agenda. An 
agency had been set up within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assist in this task and the 
delegation asked that partners consider giving assistance to strengthen its capacity.  
</p>
<p>43. Reconciliation was a national endeavour and paramount to Sierra Leone. On the 
fifiteth anniversary of the country&#8217;s independence, the President promised to hold a national 
conference in the second quarter of 2011 at which issues would be openly discussed. 
</p>
<p>44. The Government had supported the National Human Rights Commission since its 
establishment, including through the payment of salaries and had allocated a building to the 
Commission. The delegation requested that interested countries consider the possibility of 
augmenting the Government&#8217;s efforts.  
</p>
<p>45. On the question of corruption, the Government has established an autonomous Anti-
Corruption Commission. Though its work, three Government ministers were prosecuted, 
and the Head of the National Revenue authority and other Government agencies were 
brought before the courts. The Anti-Corruption Commission had the full support of the 
Government as it recognized that corruption was also a violation of human rights.  
</p>
<p>46. Free health-care service was introduced in 2010 and continued, despite severe 
constraints, such as the &#8220;brain drain&#8221; of doctors and other trained health personnel. The 
Government was considering ways to address this situation and in the next few weeks is 
planning to set up a second teaching hospital with a view to increasing the number of 
trained medical personnel. 
</p>
<p>47. Child labour was being addressed. Priority had been given over the last six years to 
enhancing the formal education of girls. By way of affirmative action, certain incentives 
had been provided to the family and the child, including through the Government&#8217;s 
SABABU education project.  The entire education sector had also been the subject of a 
review, recommendations of which were being currently being considered by the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>48. Mexico<b> </b>recognized Sierra Leone&#8217;s efforts to create and promote a human rights 
culture and to investigate and punish the human rights violations committed. Mexico noted 
the TRC and its Reparation Programme which provided financial support and labour 
training to the war victims Mexico asked for Sierra Leone&#8217;s views on ensuring continuity of 
the reparation programme through international cooperation and capacity building. Mexico 
took note of Sierra Leone&#8217;s presidency of an Economic Community of West African States </p>


<p>(ECOWAS) Commission as a demonstration of the country&#8217;s political will to promote and 
protect human rights. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Switzerland praised Sierra Leone&#8217;s efforts to promote national reconciliation and 
implement many TRC recommendations. Switzerland welcomed the legislation adopted on 
domestic violence in 2007 and encouraged renewed efforts for its implementation. 
Switzerland expressed concern at the prevalence of FGM and the limited access to the 
formal judicial system, particularly in rural areas. It observed that judgements were 
frequently handed down late, detention was extended and prison sentences exceeded the 
legal limit. It noted that excessive use of force, corruption and other abuses committed by 
the police had reportedly lowered confidence in the security and police forces. Switzerland 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. The United States of America commended the Government&#8217;s commitment to 
alleviating high infant and maternal mortality rates and encouraged improved oversight and 
management of the programme and expanded rural coverage. It noted the progress made by 
the Anti-Corruption Commission. It encouraged full implementation of the three &#8220;gender 
laws&#8221; particularly in rural areas and for national resources to be committed to declared 
goals. It expressed concern over the conditions in overcrowded prisons and detention 
centres, as well as the inaccessibility of legal representation and delayed trial dates. It noted 
governmental officials&#8217; occasional interference with journalists&#8217; work. It remained 
concerned about the prevalent use of child labour, particularly in the mining sector. While 
commending preparations for the 2012 elections, it expressed concern about the possible 
adverse effects of tensions between the ruling and opposition parties. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Turkey welcomed the recommendations of the TRC with regard to women and girls 
who had suffered during the civil war. Turkey appreciated the establishment of the National 
AIDS secretariat and the National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS 2011-2015. It commended 
the introduction of the free health-care initiative and the efforts to increase access to 
education with a view to achieving universal primary education by 2015. It supported the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to address youth unemployment, reinforce democratic institutions and 
promote national cohesion and unity. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. While<b> </b>noting the de facto moratorium on the death penalty, Portugal asked about the 
Government&#8217;s intentions to amend legal provisions for the replacement of this penalty. 
Portugal noted that despite the progress made, discriminatory laws against women 
remained as did a high percentage of sexual and domestic violence, torture and rape. 
Portugal asked about the measures to reduce and eliminate child labour and child mortality 
and to assist and compensate children who were victims and participants during the civil 
war. Portugal was concerned at the widespread practice of FGM and the intention to 
prohibit this practice only for girls below 18 years old. Portugal raised concerns about the 
poor provision and realization of economic, social and cultural rights and asked about the 
measures taken to achieve related MDGs. Portugal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Slovenia,<b> </b>while commending Sierra Leone for its development of strategies and 
plans, remained concerned about discrimination against women in law and practice 
Slovenia was concerned about the reported thousands of orphaned and vulnerable children 
who were victims of exploitation. Slovenia commended the free health-care programme 
and asked about other measures taken to address the high infant, under-five and maternal 
mortality rate, including to improve safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. Slovenia 
also asked about measures to effectively monitor the situation of former child combatants, 
particularly girls, who were not included in the disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration (DDR) process with a view to providing them with the necessary assistance to 
facilitate their full reintegration. Slovenia made recommendations. </p>


<p>54. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<b> </b>was encouraged by 
Sierra Leone addressing what was at one point the world&#8217;s highest infant and maternal 
mortality rates. It acknowledged other progress made through the creation of a Human 
Rights Commission, the 2007 &#8220;Gender Acts&#8221; and the 2011 Disability Act. Challenges 
remained to improve access to justice; to address poverty; to bring the Human Rights 
Commission in line with the Paris Principles; to roll back discriminatory laws, practices and 
customs which entrench gender equality, and to prevent reoccurrence of conflict through 
promotion of national reconciliation. It encouraged the Government to address those issues 
as the country moved towards elections in 2012 and beyond. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Italy noted the important steps taken for consolidating peace and enhancing political 
pluralism and the launching of reforms. It welcomed the free health-care programme to 
improve maternal and child health. Italy recognized the many challenges faced because of 
dire social and economic conditions it faced and the acknowledged problem of the 
increasing number of street children and youth violence. Italy referred to concerns 
expressed about the widespread harmful practice of FGM in the country, which severely 
harmed the individual and negatively affected women&#8217;s empowerment and development. 
Italy made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>56. Sweden commended the criminalization of domestic violence, including sexual 
assault within marriage through the Domestic Violence Act 2007. However, it noted reports 
that domestic violence, including rape, remained a serious problem and very few offenders 
were prosecuted. It asked for elaboration on measures to reinforce women&#8217;s protection from 
domestic violence. It noted with appreciation efforts to reduce maternal mortality by 
introducing free heath care for birth delivery. Sweden noted that other causes of maternal 
mortality remained to be addressed such as early marriages, lack of reproductive health 
information, unsafe abortion and FGM, in particular. It inquired about the measures to 
improve health care in birth delivery. Sweden made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. South Africa welcomed the Presidential Apology of March 2010 and asked for 
information on steps taken to implement the call by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) for a comprehensive strategy with clear goals 
and timetables to modify or eliminate harmful negative cultural practices and stereotypes 
that discriminate against women. South Africa referred to acknowledged challenges such as 
the need to strengthen and nurture democratic institutions and mechanisms, the very high 
poverty rate, youth unemployment and ensuring gender equality. It encouraged the 
international community to provide technical assistance to overcome these challenges. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. The delegation of Sierra Leone pointed out that the Government needed to redouble 
its efforts for the elimination of the practice of FGM. The delegation would convey to the 
Government the international community&#8217;s views on FGM and assured the Council that 
policies were designed to attain that objective. 
</p>
<p>59. Regarding steps taken by the Government to curtail sexual, gender based and 
domestic violence, the delegation referred to the extensive publicity given to their negative 
effects and to the establishment of special courts before which offenders of such violence 
are given speedy but fair hearings. 
</p>
<p>60. On access to justice in the rural areas, the delegation referred to the amendment to 
the Local Courts Act which is in its final stages of consideration by Parliament. According 
to its draft provisions the administration of justice would be brought under the purview of 
the formal justice sector, which was headed by a female Chief Justice. The Government had 
created an environment within which legal services, including legal aid in particular, was 
extended to the smallest of communities. </p>


<p>61. Replying to concerns raised about the difficulties journalists faced in doing their 
work, the delegation observed that Sierra Leone, with a population of almost 6 million 
people, had 52 national papers, all of which were privately owned. The Sierra Leone 
Association of Journalists operated freely. The Freedom of Information Bill was at 
committee stage. Since the Government came to office, no journalist has been jailed or 
taken to court by the Government. The Independent Media Commission adjudicated on 
cases and complaints between journalists and the Government. The Public Order Act of 
1965, which criminalized libel, had not been used. The issue was on the Government&#8217;s 
legislative agenda and the ultimate intention was to remove it from the Statute books. 
</p>
<p>62. Regarding the question on human trafficking, the delegation referred to cooperation 
on this issue, including through the work of National Taskforce comprising Government, 
United Nations agencies and civil society, and of the good progress achieved. 
</p>
<p>63. Responding to issues raised about elections, the delegation noted that the Electoral 
Commission was strong and independent and headed by Christiana Thorpe, who was 
internationally renowned. The Commission had recently undertaken consultations, the 
report of which had been validated. It was being recommended that the laws governing 
elections which were to be found in various Statutes should be consolidated so that all 
provisions would be contained in one volume. 
</p>
<p>64. Good progress had been made on food sufficiency, with Sierra Leone exceeding the 
obligations for budgetary allocations to agriculture required under the Maputo Declaration. 
</p>
<p>65. On the problem of overcrowding in prisons, the Government had established a 
leadership group on this matter, with external partners as members. The Government had 
taken steps to ensure that juveniles are not incarcerated with adult prisoners, which 
although prohibited by law had occurred in practice. A prison had recently been 
refurbished. Prisoners were to be transferred there, to ease the overcrowding at the 
Pademba Road prison, the main prison. All persons receiving a sentence of more than 7 
years&#8217; imprisonment had to serve their sentence at the main prison; this practice was also 
being considered for re-examination from the perspective of reducing overcrowding.  
Alternative sanctions to imprisonment and shorter sentences were also under consideration. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>66. China noted the importance given to development issues, the commitment to meet 
poverty-reduction targets, the accession to core international human right treaties, the 
emphasis on protecting the rights of vulnerable groups, such as women and children, and on 
ensuring children&#8217;s right to education. It acknowledged Sierra Leone&#8217;s difficulties in 
ensuring the rights to food, adequate housing and safe drinking water. It called upon the 
international community to provide necessary financial and technical assistance. It made a 
recommendation.

</p>
<p>68. Costa Rica<b> </b>recognized the institutions established and the human rights legislative 
measures taken as well as the public policies adopted to reduce child and maternal 
mortality. Costa Rica expressed concern about the vulnerability of women and children and 
requested that particular attention be accorded to this situation. It requested the international 
community&#8217;s cooperation to overcome those challenges. Costa Rica made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>69. Bangladesh<b> </b>noted that poverty remained a serious issue, hampering the full 
enjoyment of human rights. Bangladesh noted achievements, including in the health sector,  
and commended the Government&#8217;s initiatives to ensure free and compulsory formal </p>


<p>primary education. Bangladesh encouraged the full implementation of the Child Rights Act. 
Bangladesh acknowledged that much remained to be achieved to promote and protect the 
rights of women and children. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Uganda commended the Government&#8217;s commitment to stemming the ravages of the 
civil war and its efforts in restoring peace and democracy, building an enabling 
environment and a human rights regime, including through the establishment of the Human 
Rights Commission. Uganda commended the work of the TRC and the Presidential 
Apology to women and girls as examples of best practice for countries emerging from war, 
especially since women bore the brunt of war. Uganda encouraged the Government to 
pursue the promotion of women into the high ranks of the army and police force. It noted 
Sierra Leone&#8217;s need for technical cooperation. Uganda made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>71. Ukraine encouraged the use of the United Nations Peace-building Fund to carry out 
the reform of the judiciary. Ukraine noted that the existing customary justice practices 
frequently violated the Sierra Leone&#8217;s international human rights obligations and asked 
about the measures to correct this situation. It appreciated the delegation&#8217;s assurance to pay 
additional attention to eliminating negative cultural practices and stereotypes harmful to 
women and children. It noted that reports to human rights bodies were overdue and it made 
a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>72. Belgium welcomed the free health-care initiative. It asked for information on 
measures taken to allay CEDAW&#8217;s concern at legislation relating to women, particularly 
section 27 4 (d) of the Constitution. Belgium referred to the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child&#8217;s concern about the use of children by armed groups and the Committee&#8217;s 
recommendation on the adoption of a national plan of action for children and asked about 
progress made on these matters. Belgium noted with satisfaction the continued application 
of the moratorium on the death penalty and asked whether the Government was considering 
abolishing the death penalty in the Constitution. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Senegal commended Sierra Leone&#8217;s commitment to work towards stability, peace 
and development. Senegal was pleased to note that Sierra Leone was a party to the main 
international and regional human rights instruments. It welcomed the establishment of a 
human rights normative and institutional framework to ensure respect for those rights 
including through the establishment of a dynamic National Human Rights Commission in 
line with the Paris Principles and the Ministry for Equality. Senegal requested more 
information on policies to achieve the MDGs. Senegal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. Indonesia commended the efforts made to ensure that human rights remained a key 
priority in the national rebuilding process and made reference to the work of the National 
Human Rights Commission. It noted the importance of access to education and of gender 
equality and women&#8217;s rights. Indonesia appreciated the Government&#8217;s commitment to 
implement the TRC recommendations. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Ghana<b> </b>commended the establishment of the Human Rights Commission. Ghana 
applauded the efforts to fully implement the TRC recommendations, particularly those 
relating to the promoting the rights of women and children. It urged the Government to 
remain committed to ensuring a minimum 30 per cent quota for women in governance. 
Ghana expected that the provisions of free and compulsory formal education, with 
particular emphasis on girls, will yield fruitful dividends. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>76. Nigeria welcomed the efforts to consolidate peace and stability and to harmonize 
domestic legislation with international human rights instruments. Nigeria observed that 
there were still some treaties in the process of being ratified. Nigeria commended the 
reforms and programmes on education, health, women rights, children rights and persons 
with disabilities. It recognised the challenges and constraints to achieve its MDGs.  It made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>77. With regard to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, the delegation 
referred to the Government&#8217;s Agenda for Change, which had been transformed into the 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper II. This Paper was informed by the MDGs and 
incorporated strategies for the attainment of those Goals.  The Government was actively 
engaged in meeting the Goals within a time framework.  
</p>
<p>78. Since 2007 Sierra Leone had adopted a new mines and minerals policy and enacted 
legislation and regulations governing the exploitation of natural resources and the 
distribution of mineral wealth within the country. Sierra Leone was a candidate country of 
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and expected to be considered 
under this initiative&#8217;s process in the near future.  Sierra Leone was mindful of the 
importance of the careful management of resources as one of the findings of the Truth 
Commission was that country&#8217;s mineral resources, although not a direct cause of the 
conflict, had contributed to its prolongation.  
</p>
<p>79. In conclusion, Sierra Leone promised to continue its efforts to honour its obligations 
and wished to record that technical assistance would be needed to address many of the 
issues facing the country which were raised during the dialogue. The delegation thanked 
participants for their engagement and promised cooperation.
