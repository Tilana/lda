The major factors contributing to the above variances are as follows: 
 
  Loss  after  tax  attributable  to  members  during  the  period  includes  the  impact  of  Sirius  Resources  NL  (Sirius) 
acquisition and integration costs totalling $65.1 million.  In addition, the results include an impairment at the half-
year of the carrying value of the Stockman Project by $32.5 million in light of lower forecast base metals prices.
  The  Tropicana  Gold  Mine  contributed  $64.3  million  in  profit  before  tax  compared  to  $76.1  million  in  the  prior 
period.  Revenue decreased by 2%, primarily due to the cessation of grade streamlining in December 2015.  The 
average AUD gold price achieved increased by 8% compared to FY15, however this was offset by lower gold 
sales (10%) and expected higher cash costs;
  Revenue from the Jaguar Operation for FY16 decreased by 19% to $133 million, primarily due to a decrease in 
zinc revenue of 27% and copper revenue of 20%.  This was due to a combination of 13% lower payable zinc sold 
and 9% lower AUD realised prices.  Copper decreased by 18% due to lower AUD realised prices; and
  Revenue  from  the  Long  Operation  decreased by  43%  during  FY16, primarily  due  to  34%  lower  realised  AUD 
nickel prices, together with 16% lower payable nickel tonnes sold.  In addition, a restructure was implemented in 
September 2015 resulting in the discontinuation of a number of mining methods at the Long Operation, resulting 
in lower, though more profitable, sales.
Further details and analysis can be found in the Operating and Financial Review contained in the Directors’ Report of 
the Financial Report following this Appendix. 
The Company has announced the payment of a final dividend of 2 cents per share, to be paid on 23 September 
2016.  The final dividend will be fully franked. 
 
During the year, the Company finalised the acquisition of Sirius through two separate but inter-conditional Schemes 
of Arrangements, being the Acquisition Scheme, whereby Independence Group NL (IGO) would acquire all of the 
shares in Sirius, and the Demerger Scheme, under which Sirius would create a new listed company, S2 Resources 
Limited.  Following the approval of the Schemes on 12 September 2015, the Scheme participants received 0.66 new 
shares in IGO and $0.52 cash per Sirius ordinary share.  The transaction was completed on 22 September 2015. 
The following minor entities were deregistered or dissolved during the period: Independence ESP Pty Ltd (22 June 
2016); Independence Jaguar Exploration Parent Pty Ltd (22 June 2016); Independence Jaguar Exploration Pty Ltd 
(22  June  2016);  Independence  CM  Pty  Ltd  (22  June  2016);  Independence  Projects  Pty  Ltd  (22  June  2016); 
Independence BBS Pty Ltd (22 June 2016); VMS Metals Pty Ltd (26 April 2016); and Sirex Exploration Canada Ltd 
(14 December 2015).   
Other  than  the  acquisition  and  deregistration/dissolution  of  the  companies  described  above,  there  have  been  no 
other acquisitions of entities or losses of control of entities during the period. 
The  accounts  have  been  audited  by  BDO  Audit  (WA)  Pty  Ltd.    The  accounts  are  not  subject  to  dispute  or 
qualification.

(continued)
The Group currently has operations in the production phase in Western Australia comprising:
•
The Tropicana Gold Mine (IGO: Non-operator joint venturer; 30% owned) is located 330km east northeast of
Kalgoorlie. The Operation comprises approximately 3,000km2 of tenements (excluding the Beachcomber and Salt
Creek joint venture tenure) stretching over more than 275km in strike length along the Yilgarn Craton and Fraser
Range Mobile Belt Collision Zone. The Company targeted and pegged the area containing the current Ore
Reserves in 2001. AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited farmed into the project in 2002, discovering Tropicana,
Havana and the Boston Shaker gold deposits in 2005, 2006 and 2010 respectively. The gold deposits occur over a
5km strike length with gold mineralisation intersected to a depth of 1km vertically beneath the natural surface. The
decision by the Tropicana Joint Venture partners to develop the Tropicana Gold Mine was announced in November
2010 following a positive bankable feasibility study assessment. In early 2011, construction commenced with the
site access road, followed by key site infrastructure including an aerodrome, accommodation village, borefields and
processing plant. Mining of the Havana deposit commenced in 2012.
Commissioning of the processing plant occurred in 2013, with the first gold poured in September 2013. Nameplate
capacity of the processing plant, 5.8Mtpa, was achieved in March 2014, and the operation is currently targeting and
on track to expand the capacity to 7.5Mtpa in FY17.
The gas pipeline project, including the installation of the gas fired generators, is complete with the commissioning of
the 17 gas generating units.

•
The Jaguar zinc, copper and silver mine and processing operations, located 60km north of Leonora in Western
Australia - 100% owned. The Jaguar Operation consists of the Bentley underground mine, the Jaguar processing
facility and administration infrastructure and the accommodation village. These assets are situated on tenure that
hosts a 50km long corridor of prospective stratigraphy.
The prospective corridor has hosted three economically viable volcanogenic massive sulphides (VMS) ore bodies.
The first deposit discovered was Teutonic Bore in 1976. The Jaguar deposit was discovered in 2002, approximately
4km south of Teutonic Bore and the most recent discovery, the Bentley deposit located another 4km south of
Jaguar, was discovered in 2008.
All ore is processed at the Jaguar concentrator, which produces both a copper concentrate and a zinc concentrate.
The copper concentrate also contains significant silver and gold credits. The concentrates are trucked to the port of
Geraldton for export.
•
The Long nickel mine located near Kambalda - 100% owned. The Company acquired the Long Operation in
Kambalda, Western Australia, from BHP Billiton Nickel West Pty Ltd (BHPB Nickel West) in September 2002. The
mine was successfully re-commissioned in October 2002 and has been operating successfully and safely since
then.
Since recommissioning, and through to 30 June 2016, the Long Operation has mined 3.2Mt ore for 124,600t of
contained nickel metal and has achieved exploration success with the discovery of the McLeay (2005) and Moran
(2008) ore bodies. At the time of purchasing the Long Operation, the Group entered into an offtake agreement with
BHPB Nickel West whereby the ore produced from the mine is delivered to the adjacent BHPB Nickel West
Kambalda Nickel Concentrator
treatment and production of nickel concentrate. The current offtake
agreement with BHPB Nickel West expires in February 2019.
for toll
In September 2015, the Company restructured its mining activities at the Long Operation to ensure that the mine
remains profitable and sustainable at lower nickel prices. Future mining activities at the Long Operation are focused
on longhole stoping, supported by twin boom jumbo development. Other mining methods and activities, including
mechanised cut and fill and air-leg mining, were discontinued with effect from 9 September 2015.
The Group also has one operation in the construction phase in Western Australia as follows:
•
Nova Project - The Company completed the acquisition of Sirius Resources NL (Sirius) in September 2015. Sirius
was an ASX listed minerals exploration and development company with a key focus on the development of the
Nova Project, located east of Norseman in Western Australia.
On 25 May 2015, the Company and Sirius announced two separate but inter-conditional Schemes of Arrangement,
being the Acquisition Scheme of Arrangement (the Acquisition Scheme), whereby the Company would acquire all of
the shares in Sirius, and the Demerger Scheme of Arrangement (Demerger Scheme), under which Sirius would
create a new listed company, S2 Resources Limited. Following the approval of the Schemes on 12 September
2015, the scheme participants received 0.66 new shares in IGO and $0.52 cash per Sirius ordinary share.
The transaction was completed on 22 September 2015, resulting in cash consideration paid for the acquisition of
Sirius of $250.6 million plus the issue of 275,842,684 shares in the Company. Suspension of trading of Sirius was in
effect on close of business 10 September 2015. Implementation of the Schemes occurred on 22 September 2015
and integration of Sirius into the Group was completed during the December 2015 quarter. An Optimisation Study to
a bankable feasibility level, which demonstrated a significant enhancement of the project value, was also completed
in the December 2015 quarter.
Progress at Nova has continued according to plan during the period, reaching the 93.4% mark as at 30 June 2016
and remaining ahead of schedule and on budget relative to the Optimisation Study schedule. Total expenditure for
the period on the Nova Project was $240.4 million, with $179.5 million spent since the Company completed the
transaction.
The Nova Project comprises an underground mine to mine two orebodies, Nova and Bollinger, as well as a 1.5Mtpa
processing facility that will produce a nickel concentrate and a copper concentrate, and associated infrastructure.

•
In July 2016, the Company announced it was accelerating the development of the Bollinger orebody (Bollinger).
This work would enable earlier access to Bollinger which is expected to deliver enhanced early cash flow and
additional project value while staying within the original $443 million capital cost estimate announced in the
Optimisation Study schedule.
Total mine development of 5.53km had been completed and the first ore from development activities was mined
and hauled to the surface by the end of the period. The current schedule indicates concentrate will be produced and
ready for shipment, as planned, during December 2016.
The Company has actively focused on organic growth during FY16 through dedicated exploration programs for base
and precious metals. An outline of the key work activities during this period include:
Brownfields Exploration
•
Tropicana Gold Mine - An extensive resource extension drilling program, which was initiated at Tropicana during
2015 to provide a framework for the understanding of the Tropicana Mineralised Complex, was completed in the
June 2016 quarter. The drilling forms part of the ongoing mining studies internally referred to as the Long Island
Study. A total of 106,750m of drilling has been completed since June 2015 to the end of the period. The drilling has
focused on the resource extension to the Boston Shaker, Tropicana, Havana and Havana South mineralised zones
at depth. The drilling has returned encouraging results which continue to highlight the potential of the Tropicana
mineralised system. A mineral resource update is scheduled for the September 2016 quarter.
•
•
•
Jaguar Operation - Exploration activities during FY16 focused on in-mine diamond drilling programs designed to
upgrade the Mineral Resource confidence on the Flying Spur lens along with testing resource extensions on the
Arnage lens. Regional exploration was focused on the Triumph Prospect, located approximately 5km north of the
Jaguar processing plant. Drilling at Triumph has identified mineralisation over a strike length of 400m.
Nova Project - The focus on the Nova Project has been on the commencement of grade-control drilling from
underground drill platforms as part of the development of the project to production of first concentrate scheduled for
December 2016. Exploration focused on resource extensions and discovery of additional orebodies will be a key
focus for work streams in FY17. This will
include utilisation of the underground drilling platforms to test for
mineralised positions beneath the Nova and Bollinger orebodies.
Long Operation - Exploration activities at Long were suspended in early calendar year 2016 due to low nickel
prices. Renewed exploration activities are planned to re-commence in FY17.
Greenfields Exploration
• Greenfields exploration during FY16 has focused on in-ground expenditure on three projects that deliver belt-scale
opportunities, being Fraser Range/Tropicana Belt, Lake Mackay and Bryah Basin projects.
This review should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes.
The objective and strategy of the Group is to create long-term shareholder value through the discovery, development
and acquisition of low cost and high grade gold and base metals projects. Since incorporation in 2002, and including the
current financial year, the Company has returned to shareholders in excess of $146.6 million by way of a combination of
$136.9 million fully franked dividends and a $9.7 million share buy back in 2009. The Company currently has
586,698,580 shares outstanding.
The Group’s future prospects are dependent on a number of external factors that are summarised towards the end of
this report.
At the end of the financial year, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $46.3 million and marketable securities of
$5.0 million (2015: $121.3 million and $15.6 million respectively).
Cash flows from operating activities for the Group were $95.2 million, despite the drop in base metals prices during the
year. This was a result of strong gold sales from the Tropicana Gold Mine, combined with sound operating cash flows
from the Jaguar Operation and the Long Operation. Payments for exploration expenditure fell by 22% to $20.0 million.
Included in operating activities were cash outflows of $6.9 million in relation to the Syndicated Facility Agreement (refer
Facility Agreement below) and $12.4 million in acquisition and other integration costs.

Directors' report
30 June 2016
(continued)
Operating and financial review (continued)
Cash outflows from investing activities increased during the year to $423.5 million, primarily due to the cash payment for
the acquisition of Sirius ($202.1 million, net of cash acquired) and payments towards the construction of the Nova
Project ($179.5 million). Other movements comprised $10.6 million for capitalised exploration expenditure and $10.7
million associated with acquisition of property, plant and equipment, primarily driven by Tropicana improvement work
aimed at delivering higher plant throughput. The Group also realised $16.0 million from the sale of its investment in Gold
Road Resources Ltd.
On 16 July 2015, the Company entered into a new Syndicated Facility Agreement (Facility Agreement) with National
Australia Bank Limited, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited and Commonwealth Bank of Australia
Limited for a $550 million committed term finance facility on an unsecured basis. The Facility Agreement comprises a
five year $350 million amortising term loan facility that was used to refinance Sirius' existing Nova Project finance
facility, and provide funds for the continued development, construction and operation of the Nova Project; and a five
year $200 million revolving loan facility that was used to partially fund the payment of the cash component of the
Acquisition Scheme and transaction costs, in addition to providing funding for general corporate purposes.
Cash flows from financing activities during the financial year predominantly comprised drawdowns from the debt facility,
which totalled $271.0 million for the period. In addition, the Group paid $12.8 million in dividends during the year. Total
cash flows relating to capitalised transaction costs associated with the Facility Agreement were $5.3 million. These
costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the Facility Agreement and include loan origination fees, legal
fees and other costs relating to the establishment of the loan.
During discussions of the operating results of its business, the Group’s Board and management monitor a measure
known as Underlying EBITDA. The Board considers this measure to be important to the Group and investors alike, as it
represents a useful proxy to measuring an operation’s cash generating capabilities. Underlying EBITDA is calculated as
profit after tax adjusted for income tax expense, finance costs, interest income, asset impairments, depreciation and
amortisation. Underlying EBITDA decreased relative to the previous financial year as can be seen in the following chart:
Net profit/(loss) after tax (NPAT) for the year was a loss of $58.8 million compared to a profit of $76.8 million in the
previous financial year. The current year loss includes $65.1 million of acquisition and related integration costs relating
to the acquisition of Sirius, $35.5 million of impairments of capitalised exploration costs (primarily Stockman Project) and
$19.7 million of exploration expenditure. The chart below outlines the key drivers of the results for FY16 compared to
the prior corresponding year.

** All-in Sustaining Costs is a measure derived by the World Gold Council. On 27 June 2013, the Council released a publication
outlining definitions of both Cash Costs and All-in Sustaining Costs.
Tropicana revenue for the period was $215.0 million, which was slightly lower than the previous year as a result of the
cessation of grade streaming in December 2015. The average AUD gold price achieved increased by $111 per ounce or
8% compared to the previous period whilst gold sold to the Company's account decreased by 14,972 ounces or 10%.
Cash costs per ounce produced, which comprises the costs of producing gold at the mine site and includes credit
adjustments for waste stripping costs and inventory build and draw costs, were $730 or 29% higher than the previous
period. All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) per ounce sold were $918 or 15% higher. AISC comprises of cash costs and
capitalised sustaining deferred waste stripping costs, sustaining exploration costs, sustaining capital and non-cash
rehabilitation accretion costs. AISC excludes improvement capital expenditure and other sustaining or expansion
exploration expenditure.
During the period, optimisation and upgrades have steadily increased processing plant
throughput continued to trend higher with an annualised rate of 6.9Mtpa being achieved in the June 2016 quarter.
throughput. Annualised
Total Tropicana segment assets increased by 30% due to ongoing contributions by the Company to the operation by
way of cash calls paid to the joint venture manager ($148.8 million for the year). During the year, a total of 7.3Mt of full
grade ore (>0.6g/t), 1.2Mt of marginal ore (grading between 0.4 & 0.6g/t Au) and 50.3Mt of waste material was mined,
with the average run-of-mine grade for full grade ore (>0.6g/t Au) being 2.13g/t Au for the year. At year end, the
capitalised run of mine stockpile comprised ore > 0.6g/t and totalled 9.0Mt grading an average of 0.96g/t (2015: 8.9Mt at
1.09g/t).
Based on current ore reserves, the mine currently has a life of approximately 7.5 years.
Long Operation
Independence Long Pty Ltd has entered into a long term ore tolling agreement with BHPB Nickel West whereby the
Group is paid for the nickel metal contained in the ore mined, less applicable ore toll charges and payability discounts.
Revenue from nickel sales is priced on a quotational period of three months after the month of production. 70% of the
sales receipt is provisionally paid based on the average London Metals Exchange (LME) price for the month of delivery;
a balancing adjustment is paid in the fourth month after delivery based on the average LME price of the third month
after delivery. The mine produced 8,493t of contained nickel during the year at payable cash costs including royalties
(net of copper credits) of $3.67/lb (2015: $4.01/lb).

Long Operation (continued)
The Long Operation constitutes an operating segment as disclosed in the Financial Report. During the year a total of
215,337t of ore was mined, sourced from Moran (93%), Long Lower (3%), McLeay (2%) and Victor South (2%). The
majority of ore continued to be mined from long hole stoping (91%) with lesser amounts coming from other mechanised
mining methods and non-mechanised methods.
Total segment revenue decreased by 43% during 2016, driven predominantly by a 34% lower realised AUD nickel price
together with 16% lower payable nickel tonnes sold. In addition, the restructure that was implemented in September
2015 resulted in the discontinuation of a number of mining methods at the Long Operation, resulting in lower, though
more profitable, sales volumes.
Based on current ore reserves, the mine currently has a life of approximately 1.5 years.

Jaguar Operation
The Jaguar Operation was acquired by the Company in 2011 through the acquisition of Jabiru Metals Limited. The
Operation is located 60km north of Leonora and 300km north of Kalgoorlie. All ore is currently mined from the Bentley
underground mine, located 6km south of the Jaguar processing facility, which is used to beneficiate the ore mined to
produce zinc and copper concentrates. These concentrates are trucked to the Geraldton port for shipping to customers
primarily in Asia. The copper concentrate contains significant levels of silver and gold as by-products, which attract
precious metal credits that contribute significantly to the Group’s cash flows and revenue. The zinc concentrate has
minor amounts of silver in its concentrate.
In addition, both near mine and greenfields exploration targets continue to be investigated for potential to add mine life
to the operation. Two potential areas are projects known as the ‘Bentley deeps', beneath the existing Bentley
underground mine, and Triumph, located 6km north of the Jaguar processing facility. Both projects continued to be
targeted in the 2016 financial year for drilling, once completed they will be further evaluated.
The performance of the Bentley underground mine outperformed the previous year; ore mined increased by 3% and ore
milled increased by 4%. Copper grades were constant at 1.8% while zinc grades mined fell 1.6% to 8.9%. This variation
in run of mine grades is due to the variable nature of the geology and the stopes scheduled for mining. Both reserves
and resources are reconciling well.
Copper and zinc concentrate sales are paid on a quotational period that varies between one and four months, with
generally 90% of the sales receipt payable by the customer shortly after shipment. The one month or four month
average LME copper and zinc price ultimately determines the final price paid by the customer.

The Jaguar Operation also constitutes an operating segment. Segment revenue decreased by 19% during FY16, with
the main drivers of this result being a decrease in zinc revenue of 27% and copper revenue of 20%. This was due to a
combination of 13% lower payable zinc sold and 9% lower realised prices. Copper revenue decreased due to 18%
lower realised prices.
External factors affecting the Group's results
The Group operates in an uncertain economic environment and its performance is dependent upon the result of inexact
and incomplete information. As a consequence, the Group’s Board and management monitor these uncertainties and
mitigate the associated risk of adverse outcomes where possible. The following external factors are all capable of
having a material adverse effect on the business and will affect the prospects of the Group for future financial years.
Commodity prices
The Group’s operating revenues are sourced from the sale of base metals and precious metals that are priced by the
LME. The Group is not a price maker with respect to the metals it sells and it is, and will remain, susceptible to adverse
price movements. The Company took advantage of strong gold price appreciation and hedged additional gold
production during and after the year-end to further de-risk future cash flow during the expected term of the repayment of
the debt used primarily for construction of the Nova Project. Hedging in FY17, FY18 and FY19 represents approximately
70%, 50% and 40% respectively of the Company's share of forecast annual gold production. The average realised gold
price achieved in FY16 was A$1,576/oz.
During the period, the Company initiated diesel hedging in order to benefit from historically low oil prices. As at
year-end, the Company had hedged 25% of expected diesel usage for the next two years.

External factors affecting the Group's results (continued)
Directors' report
30 June 2016
(continued)
Exchange rates
The Group is exposed to exchange rate risk on sales denominated in United States dollars (USD) whilst its Australian
dollar (AUD) functional currency is the currency of payment to the majority of its suppliers and employees. The monthly
average AUD/USD currency pair weakened from 0.8188 for the 2015 financial year to 0.7272 for the year ended 30
June 2016. A weaker AUD implies a higher AUD receipt of sales denominated in USD. The Group’s policy is to mitigate
adverse foreign exchange risk by transacting commodity hedges in AUD equivalent terms where possible.
Downstream processing markets
The price of sea freight, smelting and refining charges are market driven and vary throughout the year. These also
impact on the Group’s overall profitability.
Interest rates
Interest rate movements affect both returns on funds on deposit as well as the cost of borrowings. Furthermore, AUD
and USD interest rate differentials are intimately related to movements in the AUD/USD exchange rate.
Native Title
With regard to tenements in which the Group has an existing interest in, or will acquire an interest in the future, it is the
case that there are areas over which common law Native Title rights exist, or may be found to exist, which may preclude
or delay exploration, development or production activities. Specifically, at our Long Operation, a Federal Court ruling by
a single Judge, which determined that certain tenements are invalid insofar as they are inconsistent with the exercise of
the Native Title rights of the Aboriginal Native Title holders, was overturned on appeal by the Full Bench of the Federal
Court. An application for Special Leave to appeal to the High Court has been lodged by the Native Title holders however
no date has yet been set for the hearing. The Company will continue to monitor the matter, in conjunction with other
affected parties.
Exposure to economic, environmental and social sustainability risks
The Company has material exposure to economic, environmental and social sustainability risks, including exposure to
base metal and foreign exchange market fluctuations and changes in environmental regulatory legislation.
The Company employs suitably qualified personnel to assist with the management of its exposure to environmental and
social sustainability risks, including appropriate health and safety personnel, as well as heritage and environmental
experts. These risks are discussed in more detail in the Company's Sustainability Report which can be found on the
Company's website.
Other external factors and risks
• Operational performance including uncertain mine grades, seismicity ground support conditions, grade control, in fill
resource drilling, mill performance and experience of the workforce;
Contained metal (tonnes and grades) are estimated annually and published in resource and reserve
statements, however actual production in terms of tonnes and grade often vary as the ore body can be
complex and inconsistent.
Active underground mining operations can be subjected to varying degrees of seismicity. This natural
occurrence can represent significant safety, operational and financial risk. To mitigate this risk substantial
amounts of resources and technology are used in an attempt to predict and control seismicity.
•
Exploration success or otherwise;
Due to the nature of an ever depleting reserve/resource base, the ability to continually find or replace
reserves/resources presents a significant operational risk. Drill sites need to be continually mined (for
underground drilling) to enable effective exploration drilling.
• Operating costs including labour markets and productivity;
•
•
•
•
•
Labour is one of the main cost drivers in the business and as such can materially impact the profitability of
an operation.
Changes in market supply and demand of products;
Any change in the supply or demand impacts on the ability to generate revenues and hence the profitability
of an operation.
Changes in government taxation legislation;

Significant changes in the state of affairs
Significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the financial year were as follows:
The Company completed the acquisition of Sirius Resources NL (Sirius) in September 2015. Sirius was an ASX listed
minerals exploration and development company with a key focus on the development of the Nova Project, located east
of Norseman in Western Australia.
On 25 May 2015, the Company and Sirius announced two separate but inter-conditional Schemes of Arrangement,
being the Acquisition Scheme of Arrangement (the Acquisition Scheme), whereby the Company would acquire all of the
shares in Sirius, and the Demerger Scheme of Arrangement (Demerger Scheme), under which Sirius would create a
new listed company, S2 Resources Limited. Following the approval of the Schemes on 12 September 2015, the scheme
participants received 0.66 new shares in IGO and $0.52 cash per Sirius ordinary share.
The transaction was completed on 22 September 2015, resulting in cash consideration paid for the acquisition of Sirius
of $250.6 million plus the issue of 275,842,684 shares in the Company. Suspension of trading of Sirius was in effect on
close of business 10 September 2015. Implementation of the Schemes occurred on 22 September 2015 and integration
of Sirius into the Group was completed during the December 2015 quarter. During this quarter, the Company also
completed an Optimisation Study to bankable feasibility level which demonstrated a significant enhancement of the
project value.
In July 2015, the Company entered into a Syndicated Facility Agreement (Facility Agreement) with National Australia
Bank Limited, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited and Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited for a
$550 million unsecured committed term finance facility. The Facility Agreement comprises:
•
A five year $350 million amortising term loan facility that was used to refinance the existing Nova Project finance
facility, and provide funds for the continued development, construction and operation of the Nova Project; and
A five year $200 million revolving loan facility that was used to partially fund the payment of the cash component of
the Acquisition Scheme for Sirius (as discussed above) and transaction costs, in addition to providing funding for
general corporate purposes.
•
There have been no other significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the year.
Events since the end of the financial year
On 31 August 2016, the Company announced that a final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2016 would be paid on
23 September 2016. The dividend is 2 cents per share and will be fully franked.
On 27 July 2016, the Company announced it was conducting a fully underwritten institutional placement (Placement) to
raise approximately $250.0 million. The Placement comprised an issue of 66,666,667 new shares in the Company and
was underwritten at a price of $3.75 per share (Placement Price).
The Company also conducted a non-underwritten Share Purchase Plan (SPP)
to facilitate retail shareholder
participation of up to $15,000 per eligible shareholder at the Placement Price, subject to an overall cap of $30 million (or
approximately 8 million shares)
(the Placement and SPP together being the Equity Raising). The SPP was
oversubscribed, however in recognition of the strong interest in the SPP by eligible retail shareholders, the Company's
Board resolved to accept all valid applications without any scale back. The SPP resulted in the issue of an additional
8,388,689 ordinary shares and raised $31.5 million.
The Company undertook the Equity Raising to strengthen its balance sheet and to provide greater financial flexibility to
fund growth initiatives. Specifically,
the Equity Raising provided funding for the remaining development capital
expenditure for the Nova Project, reducing the requirement for further drawdown under the Company's existing debt
facilities. The Equity Raising will also provide additional funds for the payment of residual acquisition costs (stamp duty),
funding for debt repayment and general corporate purposes including working capital.

Remuneration Committee
The Company’s Remuneration Committee (Committee) is made up entirely of non-executive directors, the majority of
whom are independent. The Committee is charged with assisting the Board by reviewing and making appropriate
recommendations on the following:
•
•
the Company’s remuneration policy and structure annually, to ensure it remains aligned to business needs and
meets the Company’s remuneration principles (including determining total fixed remuneration (TFR), short-term
incentive (STI) key performance indicators and long-term incentive (LTI) performance hurdles, and vesting of
STIs/LTIs);
an executive remuneration policy for KMP (including reviewing and monitoring the ongoing appropriateness and
relevance of the policy);
equity based remuneration plans for KMP and other employees;
superannuation arrangements; and
remuneration by gender.
•
•
•
The Committee, chaired by Peter Buck, held five meetings during the year. Messrs Bilbe, Clifford, Spence and
Warburton are also Committee members. The Managing Director is invited to attend those meetings which consider the
remuneration strategy of the Group and recommendations in relation to Executives.

Use of remuneration consultants
From time to time, the Committee engages external remuneration consultants to ensure it is fully informed when making
remuneration decisions. During the year ended 30 June 2016 no remuneration recommendations, as defined by the
Corporations Act, were provided by remuneration consultants. However, it did utilise data provided by AON Hewitt
McDonald ($5,030), Mercer Consulting ($4,500), Godfrey Remuneration Group ($4,000) and Ernst and Young ($5,100)
regarding salaries and benefits across the organisation.
Remuneration philosophy
The Board recognises that, as a mid-tier diversified mining company, there is an added complexity to the business that
depends upon the quality of its Directors and Executives. To ensure the Company continues to succeed and grow, it
must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled Directors and Executives.
The principles supporting the Company’s remuneration policy are that:
•
•
remuneration arrangements are competitive and reasonable to attract and retain key talent;
remuneration is linked to the Company’s strategic and business objectives and the creation of shareholder value;
and
individual reward is based on performance against a range of appropriate targets relating to the delivery of and
execution of the Company’s strategic plan.

• To provide an ‘at risk’ incentive to reward
for current year performance which aims to
align individual’s performance with
achieving the overall strategic plan through
the achievement of annual performance
measures.
• To provide an ‘at risk’ grant to incentivise
and motivate executives to pursue the
long-term growth and success of the
Company which aligns to long-term
shareholder value and the Company’s
long-term strategic objectives.
• To support retention of executives and key
personnel.

Developments during FY16
Following extensive market research and the report prepared by Gerard Daniels in FY15 (as reported in the 2015
Annual Report) which examined the competitiveness of remuneration for Director's and executives employed by the
Company, on the recommendation of the Committee the Board approved:
•
•
•
•
•
no increase to the Managing Director’s TFR for the second consecutive year;
no general increase to executive TFR, except for instances of role change, for the second consecutive year;
increase in potential STI award for the Managing Director from 40% to 50% of TFR;
increase in potential STI award for executives from 15-25% to 30-40% of TFR; and
no increase to Directors’ fees, however additional committee chairman fees were introduced (see page 26 for
details).

1. Effective 1 July 2015, TFR increase due to change in role from Human Resources Manager to Organisational Capability Manager.
The Committee and Board consider the remuneration for Executive Management on an annual basis to ensure that the
Company remains competitive and is able to attract and maintain key personnel.
In prior years, remuneration reviews have been based upon benchmark surveys or targeted market research on an
alternating basis. For the 2016 review recommendations, the Committee relied upon benchmark surveys, including Aon
McDonald, AusRem and Godfrey Remuneration Group. Further to this review, the following recommendations were
approved by the Board for FY17:

* Due to the sensitive nature of some corporate KPIs the full detail on measures and achievement is confidential.
The KPIs are set and weighted at the beginning of each year and are designed to drive successful and sustainable
financial and business outcomes, with reference to the Company’s strategic plan. The Board assesses and sets the
KPIs applicable to the Managing Director, and the Managing Director assesses and sets the KPIs for each of his direct
reports in consultation with the Board.
The Board determined the KPIs above reflected the key result areas of the business. KPIs related to the operations and
financial, near term growth and longer term growth were chosen as they are key future profitability drivers, the
sustainability of
the business is paramount, hence is included as a measure and individual KPIs focus on key
performance elements that align to the Company’s strategic plan and are within the executive’s control.
As a result, STI payments for FY16 to executive KMP were recommended as detailed in the following table, and will be
paid in September 2016.
The following table reflects eligible individual executives’ potential STI components as a percentage of TFR against paid

The payment of STIs is subject to Board approval. The Board has the discretion to adjust remuneration outcomes
higher or lower to prevent any inappropriate reward outcomes, including reducing (down to zero, if appropriate) any STI.
Variable remuneration - LTIs
The LTI component of the remuneration package is to reward executive directors, senior managers and other invited
employees of the Group in a manner which aligns a proportion of their remuneration package with the creation of
shareholder wealth over a longer period than the STI.
The Independence Group NL Employee Performance Rights Plan (PRP) was approved by shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting in November 2014. Under the PRP, participants are granted share rights for no consideration that will
only vest if certain performance conditions are met and the employees are still employed by the Group at the end of the
vesting period. Participation in the PRP is at the Board’s discretion and no individual has a contractual right to
participate in the plan or to receive any guaranteed benefits.
To FY16, the Managing Director has the opportunity to earn 100% of his TFR as an LTI. All other executives have the
opportunity to earn between 20-55% of their TFR as an LTI. From FY17, the LTI opportunity for the Managing Director
will reduce to 70% of TFR and the LTI opportunity for all other executives will be between 20-40% of TFR.
During the period 643,911 share rights were issued as FY16 LTIs to executive KMP and senior staff in accordance with
the PRP. Of this amount, 217,391 were issued to the Managing Director as approved by shareholders at the 2015
Annual General Meeting. The quantum of share rights is determined by the executive’s TFR; the applicable multiplier;
and the face value of the Company's shares, calculated as the 20 day volume weighted average price (VWAP).
The following share rights were issued to executive KMP in relation to FY16:

(continued)
Remuneration report (continued)
2016 Executive remuneration (continued)
Variable remuneration - LTIs (continued)
The number of share rights able to be issued under the PRP is limited to 5% of the issued capital. The 5% limit includes
grants under all plans made in the previous five years (with certain exclusions under the Corporations Act 2001). This
percentage now stands at 1.1%. There are no voting or dividend rights attached to the share rights.
Share rights granted after 1 July 2014
Vesting of the share rights granted to executive KMP after 1 July 2014 is based on a continuous service condition and a
total shareholder return (TSR) scorecard.
Service condition
The service condition is met if employment with IGO is continuous for three years commencing on or around the grant
date. The condition is aimed at retaining key personnel.
The treatment of LTI awards of executives, whose employment ceases prior to vesting, depends on the reason for
cessation and is subject to Board discretion to determine otherwise. If, in the opinion of the Board, the executive acts
fraudulently or dishonestly, or is in material breach of his or her obligations to any Group entity, then the Board in its
absolute discretion may determine all the executive's unvested share rights will lapse and the Board's discretion will be
final and binding.
Performance condition
The TSR scorecard for the three year measurement period will be determined based on a percentile ranking of the
Company's TSR results relative to the TSR of each of the companies in the peer group over the same three year
measurement period. Reflecting on market practice,
relative TSR is an appropriate
performance hurdle because it ensures that a proportion of each participant’s remuneration is linked to the return
received by shareholders from holding shares in a company over a particular period. There is no re-testing provision of
the TSR performance condition following the initial testing at the end of the three year measurement period.
The peer group is to comprise the constituents of the S&P ASX 300 Metals and Mining Index who are engaged in gold
and/or base metals mining in Australia and have the closest market capitalisation to the Company.
The vesting schedule of the share rights subject to relative TSR testing is as follows:
the Board considers that
Relative TSR performance
Less than 50th percentile
Between 50th and 75th percentile
75th percentile or better
Level of vesting
Pro-rata straight line percentage between 50% and 100%
Zero
100%
The Company's TSR performance for share rights issued during FY16 will be assessed against the following 20 peer
group companies:
Peer Group
Aditya Birla Minerals Ltd1
Cudeco Ltd
Medusa Mining Ltd
Northern Star Resources Limited
Panoramic Resources Ltd
Resolute Mining Limited
Silver Lake Resources Limited

Share trading policy
The trading of shares issued to participants under the PRP is subject to, and conditional upon, compliance with the
Company’s Dealing in Securities Standard. The Standard also prohibits all employees, including Directors and senior
management, from entering into any hedging arrangement over unvested securities issued pursuant to any share
scheme, performance rights plan or option plan.

Shares rights granted prior to 30 June 2014
Vesting of the share rights granted to executive KMP prior to 30 June 2014 is subject to a combination of the
Company’s shareholder
the three year
measurement period, the following performance hurdles are achieved:
Shareholder return
The vesting of 75% of the share rights at the end of the third year will be based on measuring the actual shareholder
return over the three year period compared with the change in the S&P ASX 300 Metals and Mining Index (Index) over
that same period. The portion of share rights (75% of the total) that will vest based on the comparative shareholder
return will be:

Between 100% and 115% of the Index

Level of vesting

Return on equity
The vesting of the remaining 25% of the share rights at the end of the third year will be based on the average return on
equity over the three year period compared with the average target return on equity as set by the Board for the same
period.
Return on equity (ROE) for each year will be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
ROE = Net profit after tax / Total shareholders’ equity
The target ROE will be set each year by the Board as part of the budget approval process for the following year. The
target ROE used in previous financial years was 10%. The portion of share rights (25% of the total) that will vest based
on the comparative return on equity will be:

Long term incentive - Non-executive directors
The PRP permits non-executive directors to be eligible employees and therefore to participate in the plan. It is not
currently intended that non-executive directors will be issued with share rights under the PRP and any such issue would
be subject to all necessary shareholder approvals.
Developments for FY17
FY16 has been a year of continued development for the Company. During this period the Committee has continued to
focus on the employee remuneration to ensure that the Company remains market competitive and can attract, motivate
and retain the diverse range of skilled people that are essential to achieve its strategic objectives and maximise the
alignment of employee performance and shareholder value.
Following a review of the Company’s Remuneration and Rewards policies a number of changes have been made which
will have effect from 1 July 2016. The completed changes will be reported in more detail in the 2017 Remuneration
Report, however a summary of the key elements has been provided below:

Developments for FY17 (continued)
Executive Management STI
•
To date the STI has been a 100% cash payment. In order to further align the interests of shareholders and
management, from FY17 the STI will be paid annually as a cash payment (50%) and service rights (50%). The
service rights will vest in two tranches, with the first tranche of 50% vesting after 12 months following the award and
the second tranche of 50% vesting after 24 months;
Clawback provisions will be put in place for any unvested STI and LTI awards in the case of fraud, dishonesty,
gross misconduct or a material misstatement of the financial statements and subject to Board discretion;
In the event of a takeover or change of control of the Company, the Board will have discretion to determine the
treatment of the unvested STI and LTI awards which may include pro-rata vesting; and
The LTI measurement period will remain at three years and the performance measurement will continue to be
relative TSR, however, a gateway will be put in place to provide the Board with the overriding discretion to adjust
the LTI vesting if TSR is negative over the period.
•
•
•
Group-wide Remuneration
A number of changes have been made to the Company’s group-wide Total Rewards Framework to ensure the
Company continues to attract, motivate and retain the best people. The key highlights being:
•
•
A revised benchmarking policy and job banding system;
Payment of a competitive and equitable total
increment;
Revision of the STI program; and
Agreement to launch an Employee Share Ownership Plan in FY17 (subject to shareholder approval).

Company performance and remuneration
The Company aims to align its executive remuneration to the strategic and business objectives of the Group and the
creation of shareholder value. The table below shows measures of the Group's financial performance over the last five
years as required by the Corporations Act 2001. These measures are not necessarily consistent with the measures
used in determining the variable amounts of remuneration to be awarded to KMPs as other internal measures are used

Remuneration expenses for KMP's
The following table shows the cash value of earnings realised by executive KMP during FY16. The cash value of
earnings realised include cash salary, superannuation and cash bonuses received in cash during the year and the
intrinsic value of LTI vesting during the financial year.
This is in addition and different
to the disclosures required by the Corporations Act and Accounting Standards,
particularly in relation to share rights. As a general principle, the Accounting Standards require a value to be placed on
share rights based on probabilistic calculations at the time of grant, which may be reflected in the remuneration report
even if ultimately the share rights do not vest because performance and service hurdles are not met. By contrast, this
table discloses the intrinsic value of share rights, which represents only those share rights which actually vest and result
in shares issued to a KMP. The intrinsic value is the Company’s closing share price on the date of vesting.

Non-executive director remuneration policy
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the Board within the maximum amount approved by
shareholders in general meeting. Non-executive directors are not entitled to retirement benefits other than statutory
superannuation or other statutory required benefits. Non-executive directors do not participate in share or bonus
schemes designed for executive directors or employees.
The remuneration of Non-executive directors is fixed to encourage impartiality, high ethical standards and
independence on the Board. The available non-executive directors’ fees pool is $1,500,000 which was approved by
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 December 2015, of which $885,000 was being utilised at 30 June

Financial Performance
Segment information
Identification of reportable segments
This section of the notes includes segment information and provides further information on key line items relevant to
financial performance that the Directors consider most relevant, including accounting policies, key judgements and
estimates relevant to understanding these items.
1
(a)
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board that are used to
make strategic decisions. The Group operates in predominantly only one geographic segment (ie. Australia) and has
identified the following operating segments, being the Tropicana Operation, the Long Operation, the Jaguar Operation,
the Nova Project and New Business and Regional Exploration Activities (New Business).
The Tropicana Operation represents the Group’s 30% joint venture interest in the Tropicana Gold Mine. AngloGold
Ashanti Australia Limited (AngloGold Ashanti) is the manager of the project and holds the remaining 70% interest.
Programs and budgets are provided by AngloGold Ashanti and are considered for approval by the Company's Board.
The Long Operation produces primarily nickel, together with copper, from which its revenue is derived. Revenue derived
by the Long Operation is received from one customer, being BHP Billiton Nickel West Pty Ltd. The Registered Manager
of the Long Operation is responsible for the budgets and expenditure of the operation, which includes exploration
activities on the mine’s tenure. The Long Operation and exploration properties are owned by the Group’s wholly owned
subsidiary Independence Long Pty Ltd.
The Jaguar Operation primarily produces copper and zinc concentrate. Revenue is derived from a single customer. The
General Manager of the Jaguar Operation is responsible for the budgets and expenditure of the operation, responsibility
for ore concentrate sales rests with the Chief Operating Officer. The Jaguar Operation and exploration properties are
owned by the Group’s wholly owned subsidiary Independence Jaguar Pty Ltd.
The Nova Project was acquired by the Company following the acquisition of Sirius Resources NL in September 2015.
The Nova Project comprises the construction and development of the Nova nickel, copper and cobalt mine, located east
of Norseman in Western Australia. The General Manager of the Nova Project is responsible for the budgets and
expenditure of the Project. During the construction phase, the Project Manager has responsibility for construction
budgets and costs.
The Group’s Chief Growth Officer is responsible for budgets and expenditure relating to the Group’s regional
exploration, scoping studies, feasibility studies and new business development. The New Business division does not
normally derive any income. Should a project generated by the New Business division commence generating income or
lead to the construction or acquisition of a mining operation, that operation would then be disaggregated from New
Business and become reportable in a different segment.

(a) Recognition and measurement
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable to the extent that it is probable that
the economic benefits will flow to the Group and revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition
criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when there is persuasive evidence indicating that there has been a
transfer of risks and rewards to the customer.
Sales revenue comprises gross revenue earned, net of treatment and refining charges where applicable, from the
provision of product to customers, and includes hedging gains and losses. Sales are initially recognised at estimated
sales value when the product is sold. Adjustments are made for variations in metals price, assay, weight and currency
between the time of sale and the time of final settlement of sales proceeds.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the
amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective interest
rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial
asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.

(g) Recognition and measurement
Current taxes
The income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based on the
applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to
temporary differences and to unused tax losses.

Income tax (continued)

(g) Recognition and measurement (continued)
Current taxes (continued)
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of
the reporting period in the countries where the Company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable
income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable
tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected
to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred taxes
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred
tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not
accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination
that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those
temporary differences and losses.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax
bases of investments in foreign operations where the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the
temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Offsetting deferred tax balances
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and
liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities
are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
(h) Significant estimates
The Group is subject
to income taxes in Australia and jurisdictions where it has foreign operations. Significant
judgement is required in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. There are many transactions and calculations
during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
In addition, deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is
probably that future forecast taxable profits are available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and the tax
losses continue to be available having regard to the relevant tax legislation associated with their recoupment.
The Australian consolidated tax group has recognised a deferred tax asset relating to carry forward tax losses of
$166,506,000 at 30 June 2016 (2015: $92,958,000). The utilisation of this deferred tax asset amount depends upon
future taxable amounts in excess of profits arising from the reversal of temporary differences. The Group believes this
amount to be recoverable based on taxable income projections.

(c)
Share rights
There are share rights granted to executives and employees under the Company's Employee Performance Rights Plan
that are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are anti-dilutive for the current period.
Share rights have been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share in the prior period to the extent that
they were dilutive. The rights are not included in the determination of basic earnings per share. Further information
about the share rights is provided in note 26.
(d) Calculation of earnings per share
(i) Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
•
•
the profit attributable to owners of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus
elements in ordinary shares issued during the year and excluding treasury shares.
(ii) Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into
account:
•
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares;
and
the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

No balances within trade and other receivables contain impaired assets. The balance of trade receivables includes
amounts of $1,448,000 (2015: $nil) that are past due but not impaired.
(a) Change in accounting policy
The Group has early adopted AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) with effect from 1 July 2015. AASB 9 introduces
a new impairment model for financial assets at amortised cost (including trade receivables). The new model did not
have a material impact on the Group's assessment of its doubtful debt provision for the 2016 financial year which was
assessed as $nil.
(b) Recognition and measurement
(i) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are generally received up to four months after the shipment date. The receivables are initially
recognised at fair value.
Trade receivables are subsequently revalued by the marking-to-market of open sales. The Group determines
mark-to-market prices using forward prices at each period end for copper and zinc concentrates and nickel ore.
(ii)
Collectibility of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Individual debts that are known to be uncollectible
are written off when identified. An allowance is made for doubtful debts based on credit losses expected over the life of
the trade receivable taking into account information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of further
economic conditions. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectible, the gross carrying value of the
asset is written off against the associated provision.

(a) Classification of inventory
Inventory classified as non-current relates to 0.6g/t to 1.2g/t grade gold ore stockpiles which are not intended to be
utilised within the next 12 months but will be utilised beyond that period.
(b) Recognition and measurement
(i) Ore, concentrate and gold inventories
Inventories, comprising copper and zinc in concentrate, gold dore, gold in circuit and ore stockpiles, are valued at the
lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value. Costs include fixed direct costs, variable direct costs and an
appropriate portion of fixed overhead costs. A portion of the related depreciation, depletion and amortisation charge is
included in the cost of inventory.
(ii) Stores and fuel
Inventories of consumable supplies and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is
assigned on a weighted average basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business less estimated costs of completion, and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
The recoverable amount of surplus items is assessed regularly on an ongoing basis and written down to its net
realisable value when an impairment indicator is present.
(c) Key estimates and judgements
The Group reviews the carrying value of inventories regularly to ensure that their cost does not exceed net realisable
value. In determining net realisable value various factors are taken into account, including estimated future sales price
of the product based on prevailing spot metals prices at the reporting date, less estimated costs to complete production
and bring the product to sale.
Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tonnes added and removed from the stockpile, the amount of
contained metal based on assay data, and the estimated recovery percentage based on the expected processing
method.

(b) Recognition and measurement
The Group classifies financial assets at fair value through profit or loss if they are acquired principally for the purpose of
selling in the short term, ie are held for trading. They are presented as current assets if they are expected to be sold
within 12 months after the end of the reporting period; otherwise they are presented as non-current assets.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

(continued)
12 Provisions (continued)
(b) Recognition and measurement (continued)
Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as rehabilitation and restoration borrowing expense in
the profit or loss.
(i) Rehabilitation and restoration
Long-term environmental obligations are based on the Group’s environmental management plans, in compliance with
current environmental and regulatory requirements.
Full provision is made based on the net present value of the estimated cost of restoring the environmental disturbance
that has occurred up to the reporting date. To the extent that future economic benefits are expected to arise, these costs
are capitalised and amortised over the remaining lives of the mines.
Annual increases in the provision relating to the change in the net present value of the provision are recognised as
finance costs. The estimated costs of rehabilitation are reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate for changes in
legislation, technology or other circumstances. Cost estimates are not reduced by the potential proceeds from the sale
of assets or from plant clean-up at closure.
(ii) Employee benefits
The provision for employee benefits represents annual
employees.
Short-term obligations
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and accumulating sick leave that are expected to be
settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are
recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts
expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
Long service leave
The liability for long service leave is recognised and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be
made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future
wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures, and periods of service. Expected future payments are
discounted using market yields at
the reporting date on national Government bonds with terms to maturity and
currencies that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.
(c) Key estimates and judgements
Rehabilitation and restoration provisions
The provision for rehabilitation and restoration costs is based on the net present value of the estimated cost of restoring
the environmental disturbance that has occurred up to the reporting date. Significant estimates and assumptions are
made in determining the provision for mine rehabilitation as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate
liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technological
changes, regulatory changes, cost increases as compared to the inflation rates and changes in discount rates. These
uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision at
reporting date represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future rehabilitation costs required.
Long service leave
Long service leave is measured at the present value of benefits accumulated up to the end of the reporting period. The
liability is discounted using an appropriate discount
to determine key
assumptions used in the calculation, including future increases in salaries and wages, future on-costs rates and future
settlement dates of employees' departures.

(b) Non-current assets pledged as security
Refer to note 16 for information on non-current assets pledged as security by the Group.
(c) Recognition and measurement
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. It also
includes the direct cost of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for first use and the estimated
future cost of rehabilitation, where applicable. The assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item
can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised
when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they
are incurred.
Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using either units-of-production or straight-line
depreciation as follows:
Depreciation periods are primarily:
Buildings
Mining plant and equipment
Motor vehicles
Furniture and fittings
Leased assets
5 - 10 years
2 - 10 years
3 - 8 years
3 - 10 years
3 - 4 years
Depreciation is expensed as incurred, unless it relates to an asset or operation in the construction phase, in which case
it is capitalised.
Derecognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is sold or otherwise disposed of, or when its use is
expected to bring no future economic benefits. Any gain or loss from derecognising the asset (being the difference
between the proceeds of disposal and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the profit or loss in the period the
item is derecognised.
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting
period.
(d) Key estimates and judgements
The estimations of useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods require significant management judgements
and are regularly reviewed. If they need to be modified, the depreciation and amortisation expense is accounted for
prospectively from the date of the assessment until the end of the revised useful life (for both the current and future
years).

(a) Recognition and measurement
(i) Mine properties
Mine properties in development
Mine properties in development represent the expenditure incurred when technical feasibility and commercial viability of
extracting a mineral resource have been demonstrated, and includes the costs incurred up until such time as the asset
is capable of being operated in a manner intended by management. These costs are not amortised but the carrying
value is assessed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may
exceed its recoverable amount.

(a) Recognition and measurement (continued)
(i) Mine properties (continued)
Mine properties in production
Mine properties in production represent the accumulation of all acquisition, exploration, evaluation and development
expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the Group in relation to areas of interest in which mining of the mineral resource
has commenced. When further development expenditure, including waste development and stripping, is incurred in
respect of a mine property after the commencement of production, such expenditure is carried forward as part of the
cost of that mine property only when substantial future economic benefits are established, otherwise such expenditure is
classified as part of the cost of production.
Amortisation is provided on a units-of-production basis, with separate calculations being made for each mineral
resource. The units-of-production method results in an amortisation charge proportional
the
economically recoverable mineral resources (comprising proven and probable reserves).
A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward
costs in relation to that area of interest. An impairment exists when the carrying value of mine properties exceeds its
estimated recoverable amount. The asset is then written down to its recoverable amount and the impairment losses are
recognised in profit or loss.
(ii) Deferred stripping
Stripping activity costs incurred in the development phase of a mine are capitalised as part of the cost of constructing
the mine and subsequently amortised over the life of the mine on a units-of-production basis.
Stripping activity incurred during the production phase of a mine is assessed as to whether the benefit accruing from
that activity is to provide access to ore that can be used to produce ore inventory, or whether it in addition provides
improved access to ore that will be mined in future periods.
To the extent that the benefit from the stripping activity is realised in the form of inventory produced, the Group accounts
for those stripping activity costs in accordance with AASB102 Inventories. A stripping activity asset is brought to account
if it is probable that future economic benefits (improved access to the ore body) will flow to the Group, the component of
the ore body for which access has been improved can be identified and costs relating to the stripping activity can be
measured reliably.
The amount of stripping activity costs that are capitalised is determined based on a comparison of the stripping ratio in
the relevant period with the life of mine stripping ratio. To the extent that there is a period of sustained stripping that
exceeds the average life of mine stripping ratio, mine waste stripping costs are capitalised to the stripping activity asset.
Such capitalised costs are amortised over the life of that mine on a units-of-production basis. The life of mine ratio is
based on ore reserves of the mine. Changes to the life of mine are accounted for prospectively.
(b) Key estimates and judgements
(i) Proved and probable ore reserves
The Group uses the concept of a life of mine as an accounting value to determine the amortisation of mine properties. In
determining life of mine, the Group prepares ore reserve estimates in accordance with the JORC Code 2012, guidelines
prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian
Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia. The estimate of these proved and probable ore reserves, by
their very nature, require judgements, estimates and assumptions.
Where the proved and probable reserve estimates need to be modified, the amortisation expense is accounted for
prospectively from the date of the assessment until the end of the revised mine life (for both the current and future
years).
(ii) Deferred stripping
The Group defers advanced stripping costs incurred during the production stage of its operations. This calculation
requires the use of judgements and estimates, such as estimates of tonnes of waste to be removed over the life of the
mining area and economically recoverable reserves extracted as a result. Changes in a mine's life and design may
result in changes to the expected stripping ratio (waste to mineral reserves ratio). Any resulting changes are accounted
for prospectively.

Impairment
(a)
The Group recognised impairment charges of $35,518,000 during the current reporting period (2015: $3,461,000).
An amount of $32,533,000 related to the Stockman Project, which is an exploration asset reported within the New
Business and Regional Exploration Activities segment. The circumstances and events that led to the recognition of the
impairment loss emerged following an assessment for the existence of impairment triggers as at 31 December 2015 in
accordance with AASB6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources. The recognised impairment charge has
been determined with reference to the recoverable amount of the asset being assessed based on its fair value less
costs of disposal.
The Company adopted a discounted cash flow fair value model to arrive at the recoverable amount. Key assumptions
include a post-tax real discount rate of 10.2%, and five year average commodity prices as follows: Copper: USD5,380
per tonne, Zinc: USD2,076 per tonne, Silver: USD16.50 per ounce and foreign exchange: USD:AUD 0.72.
(b) Recognition and measurement
Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources is the search for mineral resources after the entity has obtained
legal rights to explore in a specific area, as well as the determination of the technical feasibility and commercial viability
of extracting the mineral resource.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is expensed to the profit or
circumstances in which case the expenditure may be capitalised:
•
The existence of a commercially viable mineral deposit has been established and it is anticipated that future
economic benefits are more likely than not to be generated as a result of the expenditure; and
The exploration and evaluation activity is within an area of interest which was acquired as an asset acquisition or in
a business combination and measured at fair value on acquisition.
loss as incurred except
in the following
•
A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward
costs in relation to that area of interest. An impairment exists when the carrying value of expenditure exceeds its
estimated recoverable amount. The area of interest is then written down to its recoverable amount and the impairment
losses are recognised in profit or loss.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

(continued)
15 Exploration and evaluation (continued)
(b) Recognition and measurement (continued)
Upon approval for the commercial development of an area of interest, exploration and evaluation assets are tested for
impairment and transferred to 'Mine properties in development'. No amortisation is charged during the exploration and
evaluation phase.
(c) Key estimates and judgements
The recoverability of the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on the successful
development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective area of interest.
The Group reviews the carrying value of exploration and evaluation expenditure on a regular basis to determine whether
economic quantities of reserves have been found or whether further exploration and evaluation work is underway or
planned to support continued carry forward of capitalised costs. This assessment requires judgement as to the status of
the individual projects and their estimated recoverable amount.

(a) Corporate loan facility
On 16 July 2015, the Company entered into a Syndicated Facility Agreement (Facility Agreement) with National
Australia Bank Limited, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited and Commonwealth Bank of Australia
Limited for a $550,000,000 unsecured committed term finance facility. The Facility Agreement comprises:
•
A five year $350,000,000 amortising term loan facility that was used to refinance the existing Nova Project finance
facility, and provide funds for the continued development, construction and operation of the Nova Project; and
A five year $200,000,000 revolving loan facility that was used to partially fund the payment of the cash component
of the Acquisition Scheme for Sirius Resources NL and transaction costs, in addition to providing funding for
general corporate purposes.
•
The Facility Agreement replaced the existing Corporate Loan Facility (Loan Facility) which the Company previously had
with National Australia Bank. The Loan Facility comprised a corporate debt facility of $20,000,000, an asset finance
facility of $20,000,000 and a contingent instrument facility of $20,000,000.
Total capitalised transaction costs to 30 June 2016 are $5,549,000 (2015: $nil). Transaction costs are accounted for
under the effective interest rate method. These costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the loan and
include loan origination fees, commitment fees and legal fees. At 30 June 2016, a balance of unamortised transaction
costs of $5,174,000 (2015: $nil) was offset against the bank loans contractual liability of $271,000,000 (2015: $nil).
Borrowing costs of $11,055,000 (2015: $nil) relate to a qualifying asset (Nova Project) and have been capitalised in
accordance with AASB 123 Borrowing Costs. Refer to note 14.
The Facility Agreement has certain financial covenants that the Company has to comply with. All such financial
covenants have been complied with in accordance with the Facility Agreement.
(b) Assets pledged as security
There were no assets pledged as security at 30 June 2016 (2015: $nil).

(d) Recognition and measurement
(i) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at
transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption
amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is
probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs
and amortised over the period of the remaining facility.
(ii) Borrowing costs
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a
qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its
intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their
intended use or sale.
Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

(c) Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to
sustain future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and
equity, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Operating cash flows are used to maintain and expand the Group’s operating and exploration assets, as well as to
make dividend payments. The Board and management assess various financial ratios to determine the Group’s debt
levels and capital structure prior to making any major investment or expansion decisions.
None of the Group’s entities are currently subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
(d) Recognition and measurement
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in
dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in proportion to the number of and amounts paid on the
shares held. Every holder of ordinary shares present at a meeting in person or by proxy, is entitled to one vote, and
upon a poll each share is entitled to one vote.

(b) Nature and purpose of reserves
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve is used to record gains or losses on derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow
hedges and that are recognised in other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified to profit or loss when the
associated hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
Share-based payments reserve
The share-based payments reserve is used to record the value of share-based payments provided to employees,
including key management personnel, as part of their remuneration. Refer to note 26 for further details of these plans.
Foreign currency translation reserve
Exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign controlled entity are recognised in other comprehensive
income and accumulated in a separate reserve within equity. The cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss
when the net investment is disposed of.
Acquisition reserve
The acquisition reserve is used to record differences between the carrying value of non-controlling interests and the fair
value of the shares issued, where there has been a transaction involving non-controlling interests that do not result in a
loss of control. The reserve is attributable to the equity of the parent.

(c)
The impact on the franking account of the dividend recommended by the Directors since the end of the reporting period,
but not recognised as a liability at the reporting date, will be a reduction in the franking account of $5,029,000 (2015:
$5,480,000).
(d) Recognition and measurement
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the
discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.
A provision for dividends is not recognised as a liability unless the dividends are declared, determined or publicly
recommended on or before the balance sheet date.

Instruments used by the Group
(a)
Derivative financial instruments are used by the Group in the normal course of business in order to hedge exposure to
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and diesel prices.
The derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading and accounted for at fair value through profit or
loss unless they are designated as cash flow hedges. The Group's accounting policy for its cash flow hedges is set out
below.
The fair value of the derivative instruments at the reporting date is reflected in current and non-current assets and
liabilities in the balance sheet and is calculated by comparing the contracted rate to the market rates for derivatives with
the same length of maturity.
Refer to note 21 and below for details of the foreign currency, commodity prices and diesel fuel risk being mitigated by
the Group’s derivative instruments as at 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015.
Gold
Gold collar structures (i.e. purchased put and sold call) have been designated as hedges of future gold sales and have
been designated as cash flow hedges. These comprise:

Nickel
There were no nickel commodity contracts held by the Group at 30 June 2016. The tables below detail the outstanding
nickel commodity contracts denominated in United States dollars (USD), and the foreign exchange contracts which
match the terms of the commodity contracts, held by the Group at 30 June 2015. These contracts were used to reduce
the exposure to a future decrease in the Australian dollar (AUD) market value of nickel sales.

(b) Change in accounting policy
The Group has early adopted the new accounting standard AASB 9 Financial Instruments with effect from 1 July 2015.
As explained in note 31, the adoption of the standard has affected the accounting treatment of the fair value of certain
derivative assets and liabilities. The adoption of the standard had no impact on the net assets of the Group, however
resulted in the restatement of balances at 1 July 2015 with a reduction in accumulated losses of $1,036,000 and a
corresponding debit in the hedging reserve of $1,036,000.
(c) Recognition and measurement
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value
depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being
hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
•
•
hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedges); or
hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly probable
forecast transactions (cash flow hedges).
The Group documents, at the inception of the hedging transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The
Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that
are used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or
cash flows of hedged items.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
30 June 2016
(continued)
20 Derivatives (continued)
(c) Recognition and measurement (continued)
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of
the hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the
hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability. Movements in the
hedging reserve in shareholder's equity are shown in note 18.
(i) Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit or
loss, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
(ii) Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve in equity. The gain or loss relating
to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or
loss. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of forward foreign exchange contracts hedging export sales is
recognised in profit or loss within 'sales'.
The changes in the time value component of options are recognised in the hedge reserve. The cumulative changes
accumulated in the hedge reserve are reclassified to the profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur,
the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.
(iii) Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative
instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
21 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks; market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk,
equity price risk and commodity price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial
performance of the Group. The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts, forward
commodity contracts and collar arrangements to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management relating to commodity and foreign exchange risk is overseen by management, under policies
approved by the Board of Directors. The Board identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation
with the Group’s operating units. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written
policies covering specific areas, such as mitigating foreign exchange, commodity price, interest rate and credit risks,
use of derivative financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.
(a) Risk exposures and responses
(i) Foreign currency risk
As the Group’s sales revenues for nickel, copper, zinc, gold and silver are denominated in United States dollars (USD)
and the majority of operating costs are denominated in Australian dollars (AUD), the Group’s cash flow is significantly
exposed to movements in the AUD:USD exchange rate. The Group mitigates this risk through the use of derivative
instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts denominated in AUD.

The cash balance above only represents the cash held in the USD bank accounts at the reporting date and converted
into AUD at the 30 June 2016 AUD:USD exchange rate of $0.7426 (2015: $0.7680). The remainder of the cash balance
of $31,491,000 (2015: $104,325,000) was held in AUD and therefore not exposed to foreign currency risk.
The trade and other receivables amounts represent the USD denominated trade debtors. All other trade and other
receivables were denominated in AUD at the reporting date.

(ii) Commodity price risk
The Group’s sales revenues are generated from the sale of nickel, copper, zinc, silver and gold. Accordingly, the
Group’s revenues, derivatives and trade receivables are exposed to commodity price risk fluctuations, primarily nickel,
copper, zinc, silver and gold.
Nickel
Nickel ore sales have an average price finalisation period of three months until the sale is finalised with the customer.
It is the Board’s policy to hedge between 0% and 70% of total nickel production tonnes.
Copper and zinc
Copper and zinc concentrate sales have an average price finalisation period of up to four months from shipment date.
It is the Board’s policy to hedge between 0% and 70% of total copper and zinc production tonnes.
Gold
It is the Board’s policy to hedge between 0% and 70% of forecast gold production from the Company’s 30% interest in
the Tropicana Gold Mine.
Diesel fuel
It is the Board's policy to hedge up to 75% of forecast diesel fuel usage. Diesel fuel price comprises a number of
components, including Singapore gasoil and various other costs such as shipping and insurance. The total of all costs
represent
the wholesale or Terminal Gate Price (TGP) of diesel. The Group only hedges the Singapore gasoil
component of the diesel TGP, which represents approximately 40% of the total diesel price.

(a) Risk exposures and responses (continued)
(ii) Commodity price risk (continued)
The markets for nickel, copper, zinc, silver and gold are freely traded and can be volatile. As a relatively small producer,
the Group has no ability to influence commodity prices. The Group mitigates this risk through derivative instruments,
including, but not limited to, quotational period hedging, forward contracts and collar arrangements.
At the reporting date, the carrying value of the financial instruments exposed to commodity price movements were as

(iii) Equity price risk sensitivity analysis
The following sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risks at the reporting date.
Each equity instrument is assessed on its individual price movements with the sensitivity rate based on a reasonably
possible change of 20% (2015: 45%). At reporting date, if the equity prices had been higher or lower, net profit for the
year would have increased or decreased by $702,000 (2015: $4,890,000).

(b) Credit risk
Nickel ore sales
The Group has a concentration of credit risk in that it depends on BHP Billiton Nickel West Pty Ltd (BHPB Nickel West)
for a significant volume of revenue. During the year ended 30 June 2016 all nickel sales revenue was sourced from this
company. The risk is mitigated in that the agreement relating to sales revenue contains provision for the Group to seek
alternative revenue providers in the event that BHPB Nickel West is unable to accept supply of the Group’s product due
to a force majeure event. The risk is further mitigated by the receipt of 70% of the value of any months’ sale within a
month of that sale occurring.
Copper and zinc concentrate sales
Credit risk arising from sales to customers is managed by contracts that stipulate a provisional payment of at least 90%
of the estimated value of each sale. This is generally paid promptly after vessel loading. Title to the concentrate does
not pass to the buyer until this provisional payment is received by the Group.
Due to the large size of concentrate shipments, there are a relatively small number of transactions each month and
therefore each transaction and receivable balance is actively managed on an ongoing basis, with attention to timing of
customer payments and imposed credit limits. The resulting exposure to bad debts is not considered significant.
Gold bullion sales
Credit risk arising from the sale of gold bullion to the Company's customer is low as the payment by the customer (being
The Perth Mint Australia) is guaranteed under statute by the Western Australian State Government. In addition, sales
are made to high credit quality financial institutions, hence credit risk arising from these transactions is considered to be
low.
The Group has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit
history.
Other
In respect of financial assets and derivative financial
instruments, the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from
potential default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Exposure at the reporting date is addressed below. The Group does not hold any credit derivatives to offset its credit
exposure.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are restricted to high credit quality financial institutions.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

On analysis of trade and other receivables, no balances are impaired for either 30 June 2016 or 30 June 2015. Trade
receivables balance includes $1,448,000 (2015: $nil) that are past due but not impaired.
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due. The Group’s
approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking
damage to the Group’s reputation. Management and the Board monitors liquidity levels on an ongoing basis.
Maturities of financial liabilities
The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure
purposes.
AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value
measurement hierarchy:
(a)
(b)
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);
inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) (level 2); and
inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (level 3).

The Group did not measure any financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis as at 30
June 2016 and did not transfer any fair value amounts between the fair value hierarchy levels during the year ended 30
June 2016.
(ii) Valuation techniques used to determine level 1 fair values
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives and trading and
available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market
price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.
(iii) Valuation techniques used to determine level 2 and level 3 fair values
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives)
is determined using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data
where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value
an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
•
•
The use of quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments.
The fair value of commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward commodity and
exchange rates at the reporting date.
• Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining
financial instruments.
All of the resulting fair value estimates are included in level 2 except for unlisted equity securities which are included in
level 3.

September 2015 to 30 June 2016.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 July 2015, consolidated pro-forma revenue and loss for the year ended 30 June

Acquisition-related costs
Acquisition and other integration related costs of $65,137,000 are included in acquisition and other integration expenses
in profit or loss and an amount of $12,426,000 is included in operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows.
(c) Recognition and measurement
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity
instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the
fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration
transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement
and the fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited
exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling
interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

These subsidiaries have been granted relief from the necessity to prepare financial reports in accordance with
Class Order 98/1418 issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. For further information refer
to note 29.
On 18 April 2016, Sirius Resources Pty Ltd changed its name to Independence Nova Holdings Pty Ltd and Sirius
Gold Pty Ltd changed its name to Independence Nova Pty Ltd.
This entity was deregistered or dissolved during the year.
On 23 March 2016, Independence Jaguar Limited changed its name to Independence Jaguar Pty Ltd and the
company type was changed from Limited to Pty Ltd.
(b) Principles of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally
accompanying a shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting
rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another
entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated
from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of
the asset
transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the
policies adopted by the Group.

The physical gold delivery contracts are settled by the physical delivery of gold as per the contract terms. The contracts
are accounted for as sales contracts with revenue recognised once gold has been delivered to the counterparties. The
physical gold delivery contracts are considered to sell a non-financial item and therefore do not fall within the scope of
AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Hence, no derivatives have been recognised in
respect of these contracts.
(d) Contingencies
The Group had guarantees outstanding at 30 June 2016 totalling $1,315,000 (2015: $1,315,000) which have been
granted in favour of various third parties. The guarantees primarily relate to environmental and rehabilitation bonds at
the various mine sites.
25 Events occurring after the reporting period
On 31 August 2016, the Company announced a fully franked dividend final dividend of 2 cents per share to be paid on
23 September 2016.
On 27 July 2016, the Company announced it was conducting a fully underwritten institutional placement (Placement) to
raise approximately $250,000,000. The Placement comprises an issue of 66,666,667 new shares in the Company and
was underwritten at a price of $3.75 per share (Placement Price).
The Company also conducted a non-underwritten Share Purchase Plan (SPP)
to facilitate retail shareholder
participation of up to $15,000 per eligible shareholder a the Placement Price, subject to an overall cap of $30,000,000
(or approximately 8 million shares) (the Placement and SPP together being the Equity Raising). The SPP was
oversubscribed, however in recognition of the strong interest in the SPP by eligible retail shareholders, the Company's
Board resolved to accept all valid applications without any scale back. The SPP resulted in the issue of an additional
8,388,689 ordinary shares and raised $31.5 million.
The Company undertook the Equity Raising to strengthen its balance sheet and to provide greater financial flexibility to
fund growth initiatives. Specifically,
the Equity Raising provided funding for the remaining development capital
expenditure for the Nova Project, reducing the requirement for further draw-down under the Company's existing debt
facilities. The Equity Raising will also provide additional funds for the payment of residual acquisition costs (stamp duty),
funding for debt repayment and general corporate purposes including working capital.
Other than the above, there has not arisen in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this
report any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the Director of the
Company, to affect significantly the operations of the consolidated entity, the results of those operations, or the state of
affairs of the consolidated entity, in future financial years, other than as stated elsewhere in the financial report.

Other information
This section of the notes includes other information that must be disclosed to comply with the accounting standards and
other pronouncements, but are not considered critical in understanding the financial performance or position of the
Group.
26 Share-based payments
The Group provides benefits to employees (including executive directors) of the Group through share-based incentives.
Information relating to these schemes is set out below.
(a) Employee Performance Rights Plan
The Independence Group NL Employee Performance Rights Plan (PRP) was approved by shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting of the Company in November 2014. Under the PRP, participants are granted share rights which will
only vest if certain performance conditions are met and the employees are still employed by the Group at the end of the
vesting period. Participation in the PRP is at the Board’s discretion and no individual has a contractual right to
participate in the plan or to receive any guaranteed benefits.

The share-based payments expense included in profit or loss for the year totalled $819,000 (2015: $2,949,000).
(d) Employee share scheme
Share rights granted after 1 July 2014
Vesting of the performance rights granted to executive directors and executives after 1 July 2014 is based on a total
shareholder return (TSR) scorecard. The TSR scorecard for the three year measurement period will be determined
based on a percentile ranking of the Company's TSR results relative to the TSR of each of the companies in the peer
group over the same three year measurement period.
The peer group is to comprise the constituents of the S&P ASX 300 Metals and Mining Index who are engaged in gold
and/or based metals mining in Australia and have the closest market capitalisation to the Company.

Share rights granted prior to 30 June 2014
Vesting of the performance rights granted to executive directors and other executives of the Company prior to 30 June
2014 is subject to a combination of the Company’s shareholder return (with a 75 per cent weighting) and return on
equity (with a 25 per cent weighting), measured over a three year measurement period. Further information is included
in the Remuneration Report.
The performance rights will not be subject to any further escrow restrictions once they have vested to the employees.
Share trading policy
The trading of shares issued to participants under the Company’s PRP is subject to, and conditional upon, compliance
with the Company’s employee share trading policy.
Non-executive Directors
The PRP permits non-executive directors to be eligible employees and therefore to participate in the plan. It is not
currently intended that non-executive directors will be issued with performance rights under the PRP and any such issue
would be subject to all necessary shareholder approvals.
(e) Recognition and measurement
Equity-settled transactions
The fair values of equity settled awards are recognised in share-based payments expense,
together with a
corresponding increase in share-based payments reserve within equity, over the period in which the performance
conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting
date).
The cost of these equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are
granted. The fair value is determined with the assistance of a valuation software using a trinomial tree which has been
adopted by the Boyle and Law (1994) node alignment algorithm to improve accuracy.
In valuing equity-settled
transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares
of Independence Group NL (market conditions).
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects (i)
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and (ii) the number of awards that, in the opinion of the Directors of
the Company, will ultimately vest. This opinion is formed based on the best available information at the reporting date.

83
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
30 June 2016
(continued)
26 Share-based payments (continued)
(e) Recognition and measurement (continued)
Equity-settled transactions (continued)
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a
market condition.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had
not been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of
the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense
not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled
award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new award is treated as
if it was a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Upon the settlement of equity settled share awards, the balance of the share-based payments reserve relating to those
rights and awards is transferred to share capital. The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding rights is reflected as additional
share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
27 Related party transactions
(a) Transactions with other related parties

(e) Recognition and measurement (continued)
(i)
Investments in subsidiaries entities are accounted for at cost in the financial statements of Independence Group NL.
(ii) Tax consolidation legislation
Independence Group NL and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation
legislation.
The head entity, Independence Group NL, and the controlled entities in the tax consolidated Group account for their
own current and deferred tax amounts. These tax amounts are measured as if each entity in the tax consolidated Group
continues to be a stand-alone taxpayer in its own right.
In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, Independence Group NL also recognises the current tax
liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from
controlled entities in the tax consolidated Group.
The entities have also entered into a tax funding agreement under which the wholly-owned entities fully compensate
Independence Group NL for any current tax payable assumed and are compensated by Independence Group NL for
any current tax receivable and deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses or unused tax credits that are
transferred to Independence Group NL under the tax consolidation legislation. The funding amounts are determined by
reference to the amounts recognised in the wholly-owned entities’ financial statements.
The amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement are due upon receipt of the funding advice from the
head entity, which is issued as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year. The head entity may also
require payment of interim funding amounts to assist with its obligations to pay tax instalments.
Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as current
amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the Group.
Any difference between the amounts assumed and amounts receivable or payable under the tax funding agreement are
recognised as a contribution to (or distribution from) wholly-owned tax consolidated entities.
29 Deed of cross guarantee
Independence Group NL, Independence Long Pty Ltd, Independence Jaguar Pty Ltd, Independence Nova Holdings Pty
Ltd and Independence Nova Pty Ltd are parties to a deed of cross guarantee under which each company guarantees
the debts of the others. By entering into the deed, the wholly-owned entities have been relieved from the requirement to
prepare a financial report and directors' report under Class Order 98/1418 (as amended) issued by the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission.
(a) Consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and summary of movements in
consolidated retained earnings
The above companies represent a 'closed group' for the purposes of the Class Order, and as there are no other parties
to the deed of cross guarantee that are controlled by Independence Group NL, they also represent the 'extended closed
group'.
Set out below is a consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and a summary of
movements in consolidated retained earnings for the year ended 30 June 2016 of the closed group consisting of
Independence Group NL, Independence Long Pty Ltd, Independence Jaguar Pty Ltd, Independence Nova Holdings Pty

(a) New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group
The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for first
commencing 1 July 2015:
•
AASB 2014-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards (including Part A: Annual Improvements 2010-2012
and 2011-2013 Cycles and Part B: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions - Amendments to AASB 119)
time in their annual reporting period
Instruments (AASB 9),
issued in December 2009,
AASB 9 Financial Instruments
The following Australian Accounting Standards were early adopted by the Group from 1 July 2015:
•
The Group has early adopted AASB 9 Financial
including
consequential amendments to other standards, with effect from 1 July 2015. The standard has been retrospectively
applied to derivative financial instruments held at 1 July 2015 and comparative amounts have been restated where
necessary.
In accordance with AASB 9, the time value (or extrinsic value) of an option is also designated as the hedging
instrument. This result has resulted in changes in the time value of the option being deferred in other comprehensive
income rather than being accounted for in the profit or loss.
The adoption of this standard had no impact on the net assets of the Group, however resulted in the following
restatement of balances at 1 July 2015:
•
•
a reduction in accumulated losses of $1,036,000; and
a corresponding debit to the hedging reserve of $1,036,000.
(b) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 30 June 2016
reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s assessment of the impact of these new
standards and interpretations is set out below.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the members of Independence Group NL
Report on the Financial Report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Independence Group NL, which comprises the
consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting
policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of the consolidated entity
comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the
financial year.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001
and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the
financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error. In page 38, the directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101
Presentation of Financial Statements, that the financial statements comply with International
Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s
preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.
