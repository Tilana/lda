They checked around their house and discovered the above items stolen.

The accused persons were found at the White House Night Club and taken to the Nadi Police Station. They were searched by police and some of the stolen items were found on the 1st and 2nd accused persons.

The three accused persons were arrested and interviewed under caution wherein they admitted to committing the offences.

They were then charged for the offence of Aggravated Burglary, contrary to Section 313 [1] of the Crimes Decree, No. 44 of 2009 and Theft, contrary to Section 291 [1] of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009.

8.      
Considering the tariff for the offence of Aggravated Burglary in Tabeusi v State HAC 95-113/2010 and Mucunabitu v State HAC 17 of 2010, the Court accepted between 18 months to 3 years as tariff.

9.      
Tariff for the offence of theft was discussed in several cases. In Saukilagi v State [2005] FJHC 13 HAC 0021/2004 (27 January 2005) the Court accepted between 2 to 9 months as tariff for simple theft.

10.     
The first accused person submits that he is a first offender. The second accused person has two previous convictions for similar four charges. The third accused person has three previous convictions for similar charges. 

11.     
Of the $8,710 worth items stolen $6,260 worth items were recovered. The state has also confirmed this position.

12.     
Considering the nature of the offence and all other circumstances, I commence your sentence for the 1st count at 24 months.

All three Accused persons are pleading the Court that they be given another chance in their life.

All three Accused persons are pleading the Court to impose a non custodial sentence.

30.     
The 2nd and 3rd accused persons have several previous convictions and have served jail terms as well. Considering the nature of the offence and all the circumstances, I find the sentence imposed on the 2nd and 3rd accused cannot be suspended. But the sentence imposed against 1st accused can be considered under Section 26 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.

31.     
Section 26 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree states as follows:

On sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a Court may make an order suspending, for a period specified by Court, the whole or part of the sentence, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances.

After considering all circumstances, I act under Section 26 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and suspend 1st accused's sentence to a period of 3 years. The nature of the suspended sentence is explained to the 1st accused.
