Inception Mining Inc.
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Nature of Business
Inception Mining Inc. is a precious metal mineral acquisition, exploration and development
company. The Company was incorporated under the name “Golf Alliance Corporation” under the
laws of the State of Nevada on July 2, 2007 and has focused on precious metal mineral
acquisition and exploration since 2010.
On March 5, 2010, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to (1) to change its name to
“Silver America, Inc.” and (2) increased its authorized common stock from 100,000,000 to
500,000,000. On June 23, 2010 the Company amended its articles of incorporation to change its
name to “Gold American Mining Corp.” On November 21, 2012, the Company implemented a
200-to-1 reverse stock split. Upon effectiveness of the stock split, each shareholder canceled 200
shares of common stock for every share of common stock owned as of November 21, 2012. This
reverse stock split was effective on February 13, 2013.
On February 25, 2013, Gold American Mining Corp. and its majority shareholder (the “Majority
Shareholder”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Inception Development Inc. (the “Subsidiary”),
entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Inception
Resources, LLC, a Utah corporation (“Inception Resources”), pursuant to which the Company
purchased the U.P. and Burlington Gold Mine in consideration for 16,000,000 shares of common
stock of the Company, the assumption of promissory notes in the amount of $950,000 and the
assignment of a 3% net royalty. Inception Resources was an entity owned by and under the
control of the majority shareholder. This transaction was deemed an asset purchase by entities
under common control. The Asset Purchase Agreement closed on February 25, 2013. Inception
was a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended) immediately prior to the acquisition of the U.P and Burlington Gold Mine
pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, and such classification ceased upon the
closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement.
On May 17, 2013, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to
Inception Mining Inc. (“Inception” or the “Company”).
On October 2, 2015, the Company consummated a merger (the “Merger”) with Clavo Rico Ltd.
(“Clavo Rico”). Clavo Rico is a privately held Turks and Caicos company with principal
operations in Honduras, Central America. Clavo Rico operates the Clavo Rico mining
concession through its subsidiaries Compañía Minera Cerros del Sur, S.A de C.V. and
Compañía Minera Clavo Rico, S.A. de C.V., and holds other mining concessions. Pursuant to the
agreement, the Company issued 240,225,901 shares of its common stock and assumed
promissory notes in the amount of $5,488,980 and accrued interest of $3,434,426. As a result of
the Merger, there was a change in control and it has been treated for accounting purposes as a
reverse recapitalization with Clavo Rico, Ltd. being the surviving entity. Clavo Rico’s operations
and workings include several historical underground operations dating back to the early Mayan
and Spanish occupation, as described further below.
The Company’s primary operating mine is located on the 200-hectare Clavo Rico Concession,
located in southern Honduras. This mine was originally explored and exploited in the 16th
century by the Spanish, and more recently has been operated by Compañía Minera Cerros del
Sur, S.A. de C.V. In 2003, Clavo Rico’s predecessor purchased a 20% interest and later
increased its ownership to 99.9%.
On January 11, 2016 the Board of Directors of Inception Mining Inc. (the “Company”) proposed,
and its shareholders approved to effectuate a reverse split of the Company’s outstanding
common stock, at a ratio of up to one post-split share per five and half pre-split shares (1:5.5) (the
“Reverse Split”). The Company subsequently took steps to carry out the execution of the Reverse
Split, including notifying the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). On May 25, 2016,
FINRA approved the Reverse Split, with a market effective date of May 26, 2016.
Immediately before the Reverse Split, the Company had 265,083,479 shares of common stock
outstanding. Immediately after the Reverse Split, the Company had 48,197,495 shares of
common stock outstanding, pending fractional-share rounding-up calculations to adjust for the
Reverse Split.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Going Concern - The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on
a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements during six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred net income of
$3,867,358 and provided $1,038,515 in cash for operating activities, however the Company had
a negative working capital of $12,412,188 and accumulated deficit of $9,560,633. These factors
among others indicate that the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern for a
reasonable period of time.
The Company’s existence is dependent upon management’s ability to develop profitable
operations and to obtain additional funding sources. There can be no assurance that the
Company’s financing efforts will result in profitable operations or the resolution of the Company’s
liquidity problems. The accompanying statements do not include any adjustments that might
result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Management is currently working to make changes that will result in profitable operations and to
obtain additional funding sources to meet the Company’s need for cash during the next twelve
months and beyond.
F-4
Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Inception Mining Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Inception Development,
Corp., Clavo Rico Development Corp., Clavo Rico, Ltd. and Compañía Minera Cerros del Río,
S.A. de C.V., and its controlling interest subsidiaries, Compañía Minera Cerros del Sur, S.A. de
C.V. and Compañía Minera Clavo Rico, S.A. de C.V. (collectively, the “Company”). All
intercompany accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Basis of Presentation - The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All
adjustments have been made consisting of normal recurring adjustments and consolidating
entries, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016, the results of its consolidated statements of comprehensive
income/(loss) for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and June 30,
2015, and its consolidated cash flows for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and June
30, 2015. The results of consolidated operations for the interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results for the full year.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents.
Inventories, Stockpiles and Mineralized Material on Leach Pads - Inventories, including
stockpiles and mineralized material on leach pads are carried at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price of the product
based on current and long-term metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production
and bring the product to sale. Write-downs of stockpiles, mineralized material on leach pads and
inventories to net realizable value are reported as a component of costs applicable to mining
revenue. Cost is comprised of production costs for mineralized material produced and processed.
Production costs include the costs of materials, costs of processing, direct labor, mine site and
processing facility overhead costs, stock-based compensation, and depreciation, amortization
and depletion.
Stockpiles - Stockpiles represent mineralized material that has been extracted from the mine and
is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons
added and removed from the stockpile. Stockpile tonnages are verified by periodic surveys.
Costs are allocated to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled and processed
using current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the material, including
applicable overhead, depreciation, and depletion relating to mining operations, and removed at
each stockpile’s average cost per ton.
Mineralized Material on Leach Pads - The Company utilizes a heap leaching process to recover
gold from its mineralized material. Under this method, the mineralized material is placed on leach
pads where it is treated with a chemical solution that dissolves the gold contained in the material.
The resulting gold-bearing solution is further processed in a facility where the gold is recovered.
Costs are added to mineralized material on leach pads based on current mining and processing
costs, including applicable depreciation relating to mining and processing operations. Costs are
transferred from mineralized material on leach pads to subsequent stages of in-process
inventories as the gold-bearing solution is processed. The value of such transferred costs of
mineralized material on leach pads is based on the average cost per estimated recoverable
ounce of gold on the leach pad.
The estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of
material placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of
material placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage.
Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by
comparing the quantities and grades of material placed on leach pads to the quantities and
grades quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching
process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the
metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on
actual results over time. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from
changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value
are accounted for on a prospective basis.
In-process Inventories - In-process inventories represent mineralized materials that are currently
in the process of being converted to a saleable product through the absorption, desorption,
recovery (ADR) process. The value of in-process material is measured based on assays of the
material fed into the process and the projected recoveries of material. In-process inventories are
valued at the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material
coming from the mines, stockpiles and/or leach pads plus the in-process conversion costs,
including applicable depreciation relating to the process facilities incurred to that point in the
process.
Finished Goods Inventories - Finished goods inventories include gold that has been processed
through the Company’s ADR facility and are valued at the average cost of their production.
Exploration and Development Costs - Costs of acquiring mining properties and any
exploration and development costs are expensed as incurred unless proven and probable
reserves exist and the property is a commercially mineable property in accordance with FASB
ASC 930, Extractive Activities- Mining. Mine development costs incurred either to develop new
gold and silver deposits, expand the capacity of operating mines, or to develop mine areas
substantially in advance of current production are capitalized. Costs incurred to maintain current
production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations. Costs of
abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment. The Company evaluates, at
least quarterly, the carrying value of capitalized mining costs and related property, plant and
equipment costs, if any, to determine if these costs are in excess of their net realizable value and
if a permanent impairment needs to be recorded. The periodic evaluation of carrying value of
capitalized costs and any related property, plant and equipment costs are based upon expected
future cash flows and/or estimated salvage value.
2
The Company capitalizes costs for mining properties by individual property and defers such
costs for later amortization only if the prospects for economic productions are reasonably certain.
Capitalized costs are expensed in the period when the determination has been made that
economic production does not appear reasonably certain.
Mineral Rights and Properties - We defer acquisition costs until we determine the viability of
the property. Since we do not have proven and probable reserves as defined by Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Industry Guide 7, exploration expenditures are expensed as
incurred. We expense care and maintenance costs as incurred.
We review the carrying value of our mineral rights and properties for impairment whenever there
are negative indicators of impairment. Our estimate of the gold price, mineralized materials,
operating capital, and reclamation costs are subject to risks and uncertainties affecting the
recoverability of our investment in the mineral claims and properties. Although we have made our
best, most current estimate of these factors, it is possible that near term changes could adversely
affect estimated net cash flows from our mineral claims and properties and possibly require future
asset impairment write-downs.
Where estimates of future net operating cash flows are not available and where other conditions
suggest impairment, we assess recoverability of carrying value from other means, including net
cash flows generated by the sale of the asset. We use the units-of-production method to deplete
the mineral rights and properties.
Fair Value Measurements - The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be
received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and
financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. The fair value should be calculated based on
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on
assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include
consideration of non-performance risk, including the party’s own credit risk.
Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to
prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization
within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories:
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active
markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be
derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term
of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the
measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or
unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain
cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value
hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within
which the fair value measurement is disclosed and is determined based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The carrying value of the Company’s cash, accounts payable, short-term borrowings (including
convertible notes payable), and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value
because of their short-term maturity.
The Company recognizes its derivative liabilities as level 3 and values its derivatives using the
methods discussed below. While the Company believes that its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with other market participants, it recognizes that the use of different
methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The primary assumptions that
would significantly affect the fair values using the methods discussed below are that of volatility
and market price of the underlying common stock of the Company.
Long-Lived Assets - We review the carrying amount of our long-lived assets for impairment
whenever there are negative indicators of impairment. An asset is considered impaired when
estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. In the event the
carrying amount of such asset is not considered recoverable, the asset is adjusted to its fair
value. Fair value is generally determined based on discounted future cash flows.
Properties, Plant and Equipment - We record properties, plant and equipment at historical cost.
We provide depreciation and amortization in amounts sufficient to match the cost of depreciable
assets to operations over their estimated service lives or productive value. We capitalize
expenditures for improvements that significantly extend the useful life of an asset. We charge
expenditures for maintenance and repairs to operations when incurred. Depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:
7 to 15 years
Building
 3 to 7 years
Vehicles and equipment
Processing and laboratory 5 to 15 years
Furniture and fixtures
 2 to 3 years
3
Reclamation Liabilities and Asset Retirement Obligations - Minimum standards for site
reclamation and closure have been established for us by various government agencies. Asset
retirement obligations are recognized when incurred and recorded as liabilities at fair value. The
liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to earnings. In addition, the asset
retirement cost is capitalized and amortized over the life of the related asset. Reclamation costs
are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the
passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation
and abandonment costs. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed
necessary, the asset retirement obligation at each mine site.
Revenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized from sales when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the price is determinable, the product has been delivered, the title has been
transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. Gold revenue
is recorded at an agreed upon spot price and gold ounce measurement resulting in revenue and
a receivable at the time of sale. Gold revenue is recorded net of refining charges and discounts.
Sales of by-products (such as silver) are credited to costs applicable to mining revenue.
All accounts receivable amounts are due from a single customer. Substantially all mining
revenues recorded in the current period also related to the same customer. As gold can be sold
through numerous gold market traders worldwide, the Company is not economically dependent
on a limited number of customers for the sale of its product.
Stock Issued For Goods and Services - Common and preferred shares issued for goods and
services are valued based upon the fair market value of our common stock or the goods and
services received, whichever is the most reliably measurable on the date of issue.
Stock-Based Compensation - For stock-based transactions, compensation expense is
recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, based on the
estimated fair value on the grant date of the award.
Income per Common Share - Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net
income, less the preferred stock dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Dilutive income per share includes any additional dilution from common stock
equivalents, such as stock options and warrants, and convertible instruments, if the impact is not
antidilutive. Since the Company incurred a net loss for the period ended December 31, 2015, all
equity-linked instruments are considered anti-dilutive. For the period ended June 30, 2016, the
number of common stock equivalents is 201,460.
Comprehensive Income - Comprehensive income is made up of the exchange differences
arising on translating foreign operations and the net income (loss) for the periods ended June 30,
2016 and 2015.
Derivative Liabilities - Derivatives liabilities are recorded at fair value when issued and the
subsequent change in fair value each period is recorded in other income (expense) in the
consolidated statements of operations. We do not hold or issue any derivative financial
instruments for speculative trading purposes.
Income Taxes - The Company’s income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities
reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Significant
judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement
recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating the Company’s ability to recover its deferred
tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including
scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning
strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, the Company
develops assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income,
the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax
planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future
taxable income, and are consistent with the plans and estimates that the Company is using to
manage the underlying businesses. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets for which the Company does not consider realization of such deferred tax assets to be
more likely than not.
Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the
future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
Business Segments – The Company operates in one segment and therefore segment
information is not presented.
Use of Estimates – In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenditures during the reported periods.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Estimates may include those
pertaining to valuation of inventories and mineralized material on leach pads, the estimated
useful lives and valuation of properties, plant and equipment, mineral rights and properties,
deferred tax assets, convertible preferred stock, derivative assets and liabilities, reclamation
liabilities, stock-based compensation and payments, and contingent liabilities.
Non-Controlling Interest Policy – Non-controlling interest (NCI) is the portion of equity
ownership in a subsidiary not attributable to the parent company, who has a controlling interest
and consolidates the subsidiary’s financial results with its own. The amount of equity relating to
the non-controlling interest is separately identified in the equity section of the balance sheet and
the amount of the net income (loss) relating to the non-controlling interest is separately identified
on the statement of operations.

Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period consolidated
financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.

4. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company adopted the provisions of ASC subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825-
10”) on January 1, 2008. ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from
selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and
liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal
or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer
restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825-10 establishes three levels of inputs
that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active
markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be
derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term
of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the
measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or
unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain
cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value
hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within
which the fair value measurement is disclosed and is determined based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The carrying value of the Company’s cash, accounts payable, short-term borrowings (including
convertible notes payable), and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value
because of their short-term maturity.
As of June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any items that would be
classified as level 1 or 2 disclosures.
All items required to be recorded or measured on a recurring basis are based upon level 3 inputs.
The derivative liability as of June 30, 2016, in the amount of $3,681,112 has a level 3
classification.
The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company’s Level 3
financial liabilities as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Debt derivatives – As described above, the Company issued convertible promissory notes
which are convertible into common stock, at holders’ option, at a discount to the market price of
the Company’s common stock. The Company has identified the embedded derivatives related to
these notes relating to certain anti-dilutive (reset) provisions. These embedded derivatives
included certain conversion features. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments
requires that the Company record fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date of
debenture and to fair value as of each subsequent reporting date.
At June 30, 2016, the Company marked to market the fair value of the debt derivatives and
determined a fair value of $3,653,291. The Company recorded a gain from change in fair value of
debt derivatives of $6,214,220 for the period ended June 30, 2016. The fair value of the
embedded derivatives was determined using Binomial Option Pricing Model based on the
following assumptions: (1) dividend yield of 0%, (2) expected volatility of 220.60% to 277.92%,
(3) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 0.20% to 0.36% (4) expected life of 0.02 to 0.50
years, and (5) the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock at each valuation date.
Based upon ASC 840-15-25 (EITF Issue 00-19, paragraph 11) the Company has adopted a
sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to its outstanding convertible
notes. Pursuant to the sequencing approach, the Company evaluates its contracts based upon
earliest issuance date.
Warrant derivatives – The Company issued warrants in conjunction with the issuance with the
Typenex, JMJ Financial and Firstfire Global Convertible Promissory Notes. These warrants
contain certain reset provisions. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments
requires that the Company record fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date (issuance
date) and to fair value as of each subsequent reporting date.
At June 30, 2016, the Company marked to market the fair value of the warrant liability and
determined a fair value of $27,821. The Company recorded a gain from change in fair value of
warrant liability of $54,610 for the period ended June 30, 2016. The fair value of the warrant
liability was determined using Binomial Option Pricing Model based on the following
assumptions: (1) dividend yield of 0%, (2) expected volatility of 209.90%, (3) weighted average
risk-free interest rate of 1.01% (4) expected life of 3.98 to 4.00 years, and (5) the quoted market
price of the Company’s common stock at each valuation date.
Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized as follows:

6. Mine Reclamation Liability
The Company is required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring,
re-sloping, and re-vegetating various portions of our site after mining and mineral processing
operations are completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with plans
reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
The fair value of the long-term liability of $103,956 and $77,716 as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, for our obligation to reclaim our mine facility is based on our
most recent reclamation plan, as revised, submitted and approved by the Honduran Institute of
Geology and Mines (INHGEOMIN) and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment
(SERNA). Such costs are based on management’s current estimate of then expected amounts for
the remediation work, assuming the work is performed in accordance with current laws and
regulations and using a risk free rate of 3.74% and an inflation rate of 2%. It is reasonably
possible that, due to uncertainties associated with the application of laws and regulations by
regulatory authorities and changes in reclamation or remediation technology, the ultimate cost of
reclamation and remediation could change in the future. We periodically review the accrued
reclamation liability for information indicating that our assumptions should change.
The increases in the reclamation liability in 2016 and 2015 were related to the expansion of the
heap leach facility and related infrastructure.

Brunson, Chandler & Jones, PLLC – On January 13, 2016, the Company issued an unsecured
Convertible Promissory Note (“Note”) to Brunson, Chandler & Jones, PLLC (“BCJ”), in the
principal amount of $27,578 (the “Note”) due on July 13, 2016 and bears 10% per annum interest,
due at maturity as settlement of services rendered for the same amount. The Note is convertible
into common stock, at holder’s option, at 10% discount of the lowest VWAP of the common stock
during the 3 trading day period prior to conversion. The Company has identified the embedded
derivatives related to the note. The embedded derivatives relate to conversion features.
The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record
fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date of the notes and to fair value as of each
subsequent reporting date, which at March 31, 2016 was $3,627. At the inception of the notes,
the Company determined the aggregate fair value of $9,247 of the embedded derivatives. The
fair value of the embedded derivatives were determined using the Binomial Option Pricing Model
based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend yield of 0%; (2) expected volatility of 288.75%,

things, (a) discussions about mineral resources and mineralized material, (b) our projected sales
and profitability, (c) our growth strategies, (d) anticipated trends in our industry, (e) our future
financing plans, (f) our anticipated needs for working capital, (g) our lack of operational
experience and (h) the benefits related to ownership of our common stock. Forward-looking
statements, which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies, and
expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” or “project” or the negative of these words or other
variations on these words or comparable terminology. This information may involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or
achievements to be materially different from the future results, performance, or achievements
expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. These statements may be found under
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and
“Description of Business,” as well as in this Report generally. Actual events or results may differ
materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,
including, without limitation, the risks outlined under “Risk Factors” and matters described in this
Report generally. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the
forward-looking statements contained in this Report will in fact occur as projected.
Introduction to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.
Certain statements made in this Form 10-Q are “forward-looking statements” regarding the plans
and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or
achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking
statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and
uncertainties. The Company’s plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving
the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments
with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and
future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many
of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its
assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions
could prove to be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking
statements included in this report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties
inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information
should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the
objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.
The forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-Q and referred to elsewhere are related
to future events or our strategies or future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify
forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “believe,” “anticipate,”
“future,” “potential,” “estimate,” “encourage,” “opportunity,” “growth,” “leader,” “expect,” “intend,”
“plan,” “expand,” “focus,” “through,” “strategy,” “provide,” “offer,” “allow,” commitment,”
“implement,” “result,” “increase,” “establish,” “perform,” “make,” “continue,” “can,” “ongoing,”
“include” or the negative of such terms or comparable terminology. All forward-looking statements
included in this Form 10-Q are based on information available to us as of the filing date of this
report, and the Company assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements,
except as required by law. Our actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking
statements.

regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”). Certain information
and footnote disclosure normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the
Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and notes thereto included in this filing.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments have been made consisting of normal recurring
adjustments and consolidating entries, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial
position of the Company and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016, the results of its consolidated
statements of comprehensive income/(loss) for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2016
and June 30, 2015, and its consolidated cash flows for the three-month periods ended June 30,
2016 and June 30, 2015. The results of consolidated operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and
disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Overview
We are a mining company that was formed in Nevada on July 2, 2007. As a mining company, we
are engaged in the production of previous metals. Our activities are not limited to production and
they also include acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties, primarily for
gold, from owned mining properties. Inception Mining has acquired two projects, as described
below. Our target properties are those that have been the subject of historical exploration. We
have generated revenue from mining operations.
Clavo Rico Gold Mine, Honduras, Central America
On October 2, 2015, the Company consummated a merger with Clavo Rico Ltd. (“Clavo Rico”).
Clavo Rico is a privately held Turks and Caicos company with principal operations in Honduras,
Central America. Clavo Rico operates the Clavo Rico mining concession through its subsidiaries
Compañía Minera Cerros del Sur, S.A de C.V. and Compañía Minera Clavo Rico, S.A. de C.V.
and holds other mining concessions. Its workings include several historical underground mining
operations dating back to the early Mayan and Spanish occupation.
The Company’s primary mine is located on the 200-hectare Clavo Rico Concession, located in
southern Honduras. This mine was originally explored and exploited in the 16th century by the
Spanish, and more recently has been operated by Compañía Minera Cerros del Sur, S. de R.L.
as a small family business. In 2003, Clavo Rico’s predecessor purchased a 20% interest and
later increased its ownership to 99.5%. This company has since invested over five million dollars
in the expansion and development of the mine and surrounding properties.
The operations begin by crushing ore to approximately 3/8-inch size pebbles, which is then
mixed with sand and loaded on the recovery pad for processing. The ore is sprinkled with a
solution that leaches the gold from the rock, and the solution is collected and processed on-site
at Clavo Rico’s own ADR plant. The doré bars that result from this process are shipped to the
USA for refining.
Prior to the expansion, the mine had only been processing approximately 500 tons of ore per
month. The current recovery operation has been sized to handle from 500 to 1,000 tons of ore per
day on a recovery bed that has the capacity to receive up to 800,000 tons of ore. This expansion
represents a sizeable increase in capacity. The company commenced full operations on January
1, 2012 and believes that sufficiently high gold content ore bodies have been located and
blocked out to load the recovery bed to capacity by the end of 2017. The ore body has had some
preliminary drilling undertaken by the company and the assays of samples indicate that the ore
should have grades in the range of 2-5 grams of gold per ton.
The Company relies heavily on the neighboring communities that support Clavo Rico mine
operations. El Corpus, a small village situated just below the mine, is one such community. To
show its gratitude for the support of these people, many of whom are employed by the mine, the
Company is committed to care for their holistic well-being. To that end, Inception undertakes
many efforts to maintain a high quality of life for every living thing in the area, including
reforestation of trees and vegetation; proper treatment and disposal of mine wastewater; wildlife
awareness and preservation; and encouraging education in the community through a trade
school built and operated by the Company.

UP & Burlington Gold Mine, Salmon, Lemhi County, Idaho
On February 25, 2013 the Company acquired certain real property and the associated
exploration permits and mineral rights commonly known as the UP and Burlington Gold Mine
(“UP & Burlington”) pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. We are presently in the
exploration stage at UP & Burlington. UP & Burlington contains two federal patented mining
claims, which Inception Resources acquired for the purpose of the exploration and potential
development of gold on the 40 acres that comprise this property.
Discovered in 1892, UP & Burlington is a private gold property that has been held unused in a
family trust for the past 75 years. UP & Burlington is located in Lemhi County, Northwest of
Salmon, Idaho, at an elevation of 3,994 feet. The UP & Burlington site is located six miles from
the city of Salmon; is 0.6 miles away from the closest major road (Ridge Road); and is 1.56 miles
away from the closest major power line. We believe Salmon, along with the surrounding County
of Lemhi, provides an excellent infrastructure for our mine. Salmon has a population of 3,122 and
Lemhi County has a population of 7,806. In September 2011, heavy maintenance and right-of-
way repair was completed and a new road to UP & Burlington was constructed.
UP & Burlington’s two gold mining claims were brought to patent in 1900, which covers the
Mine’s 40 acres. Subsequently, in 1989, a U.S. Forest Survey was performed on the UP &
Burlington site confirming that the patented claims cover an area that is six hundred feet by three
thousand feet (600’x3000’). The Mine’s patented claims remove the challenges associated when
working on U.S. Forest lands, Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), state or other property types.
With our purchase of UP & Burlington, we have the benefit of working on private land, which
requires only a hauling/road permit to commence significant operations.
The Company has obtained the necessary permitting, cut additional access roads, made surface
improvements, and initiated surface mining on a 2,500 foot per day lighted vein for bulk sampling,
vein definition and ore valuation. In Phase II, we plan to contract an underground mining and
operations plan, expand portal development leveraging existing underground access, and
implement underground mining to a depth based on optimizing costs versus processed ore
value. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in implementing any stage of our plans.
Our tactical plan includes obtaining a Lemhi County Conditional Use Permit, an Idaho
Department of Lands Surface Reclamation Bond, and permitting for the U.S. Forest Service
Access Road, as well as obtaining major contracts such as geotechnical contracts, surface
mining contracts, toll processing contracts and underground mine plan contracts.
The Company and its independent consultants have developed a detailed exploration-drilling
program to confirm and expand mineralized zones in the Mine and collect additional
environmental and technical data. The first phase of confirmation and expansion drilling began in
2013. The Company intends to continue drilling, metallurgical testing, engineering and
environmental programs and studies and has updated the historic feasibility study and
environmental permit applications.
Nevada Exploration
The Company, through its partner, has been conducting greenfield mineral exploration in
Nevada. The focus of the exploration has been on the western segment of the Northern Nevada
Rift. There are two projects on the aeromagnetic feature in the area. Projects are drill-ready with
targets based on selenium soil anomalies, geophysical anomalies, mapped faults and projected
structural intersections. The Company plans to expand and identify this resource with its partner.
In addition to the exploration in the Northern Nevada Rift, the Company plans to continue to
identify possible acquisition targets in Nevada and other locations.
Results of Operations
Six-months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six-months ended June 30, 2015
We had a net income of $3,867,358 for the six-months ended June 30, 2016, and a net income of
$566,068 for the six-months ended June 30, 2015. This change in our results over the two
periods is primarily the result of increased precious metal production, fewer professional and
consulting agreements, where the Company utilizes the expertise, professional relationships,
and knowledge of said consultants, are classified as general and administrative expenses that
have been entered into as well as the decrease in exploration costs, changes in derivatives and
the changes in debt discounts which are included in other income/expense. The following table

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 reflects assets of $3,476,311. We had cash in the amount
of $284,004 and working capital deficit in the amount of $12,412,188 as of June 30, 2016. Thus,
we do not have sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for
the next twelve months. We will need to raise approximately $2,000,000 in order to fully
implement our business plan.

We anticipate generating losses and, therefore, may be unable to continue operations in the
future, if we don’t acquire additional capital and issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic
arrangement with a third party.
Going Concern Consideration
As reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the
Company has no revenue generating operations and has an accumulated deficit of $9,560,633.
In addition, there is a working capital deficit of $12,412,188 as of June 30, 2016. This raises
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional capital
and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Operating Activities
Net cash flow provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was
$265,031, an increase of $471,479 from the $(206,448) net cash outflow during the six months
ended June 30, 2015. This increase in the cash provided by operating activities was primarily
due to the increase in precious metals production by the Company.
Investing Activities
Investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 used $274,416 an increase of
$266,762 from the $7,654 used by investing activities during the six months ended June 30,
2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company purchased $274,416 in fixed
assets.
Financing Activities
Financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 provided $156,481, a decrease
of $43,519 from the $200,000 provided by financing activities during the six months ended June
30, 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company received $1,135,000 in
proceeds from a short-term notes and $387,697 in proceeds from convertible notes with related
parties. The Company also made $1,197,500 in payments on notes payable, including the short-
term notes payable and $168,986 in payments to notes payable to related parties.
We are currently seeking up to $2,000,000 in equity financing in order to fully implement our
business plan.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Preparing financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by
management’s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and
nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial
statements is critical to an understanding of our financials.
Costs of acquiring mining properties and any exploration and development costs are expensed
as incurred unless proven and probable reserves exist and the property is a commercially
mineable property. Mine development costs incurred either to develop new gold and silver
deposits, expand the capacity of operating mines, or to develop mine areas substantially in
advance of current production are capitalized. Costs incurred to maintain current production or to
maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations. Costs of abandoned projects are
charged to operations upon abandonment. The Company evaluates, at least quarterly, the
carrying value of capitalized mining costs and related property, plant and equipment costs, if any,
to determine if these costs are in excess of their net realizable value and if a permanent
impairment needs to be recorded. The periodic evaluation of carrying value of capitalized costs
and any related property, plant and equipment costs are based upon expected future cash flows
and/or estimated salvage value.
The Company capitalizes costs for mining properties by individual property and defers such
costs for later amortization only if the prospects for economic productions are reasonably certain.
Capitalized costs are expensed in the period when the determination has been made that
economic production does not appear reasonably certain.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For recent accounting pronouncements, please refer to the notes to financial statements in Part I,
Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably
likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to investors.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosure under this item.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material
information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to ensure that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer (principal financial
officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under the 1934 Act, as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, because of the Company’s limited resources
and limited number of employees, management concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2016.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
financial statements of the Company in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, or GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
With the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
June 30, 2016 based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on our
evaluation and the material weaknesses described below, management concluded that the
Company’s internal controls were not effective based on financial reporting as of December 31,
2015 and June 30, 2016 based on the COSO framework criteria. Management has identified
control deficiencies regarding the lack of segregation of duties, tax compliance issues and the
need for a stronger internal control environment. Management of the Company believes that
these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the Company’s accounting staff and
reliance on outside consultants for external reporting. The small size of the Company’s
accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future, such as segregation of duties, due
to the cost/benefit of such remediation.
To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct
management oversight of transactions, along with the use of legal and outside accounting
consultants. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us
to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework.
These control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of account balances that would result in
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements
may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, we have determined that these
control deficiencies as described above together constitute a material weakness.
In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order to
conclude that our consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 included
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were fairly stated in accordance with US GAAP.
Accordingly, management believes that despite our material weaknesses, our consolidated
financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 are fairly stated, in all material respects,
in accordance with US GAAP.
This Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting
firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to
attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not
expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in
part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
