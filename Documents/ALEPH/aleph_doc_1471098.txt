Forward Looking Statements.
PART I
This annual report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements relate to 
future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by 
terminology  such  as  “may”,  “should”,  “expects”,  “plans”,  “anticipates”,  “believes”,  “estimates”,  “predicts”, 
“potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only 
predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section 
entitled “Risk Factors” and the risks set out below, any of which may cause our or our industry’s actual results, 
levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, 
performance  or  achievements  expressed  or  implied  by  these  forward-looking  statements.  These  risks  include,  by 
way of example and not in limitation:
•
•
•
•
the  uncertainty  that  we  will  not  be  able  to  successfully  identify  and  evaluation  a  suitable  business 
opportunity; 
risks related to the large number of established and well-financed entities that are actively seeking suitable 
business opportunities; 
risks related to the failure to successfully management or achieve growth of a new business opportunity; 
and 
other risks and uncertainties related to our business strategy.
This list is not an exhaustive list of the factors that may affect any of our forward-looking statements. These and 
other factors should be considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking 
statements.
Forward  looking  statements  are  made  based  on  management’s  beliefs,  estimates  and  opinions  on  the  date  the 
statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates 
and  opinions  or  other  circumstances  should  change.  Although  we  believe  that  the  expectations  reflected  in  the 
forward-looking  statements  are  reasonable, we  cannot guarantee  future  results,  levels  of  activity,  performance  or 
achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not 
intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
Our financial statements are stated in United States dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all 
references to "common stock" refer to the common shares in our capital stock.
As used in this annual report, the terms "we", "us", "our", and "Auror" mean Auror Capital Corp., unless the context 
clearly requires otherwise.
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
We were incorporated as Auror Capital Corp. under the laws of Nevada on March 16, 2006. We are an exploration 
stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. On January 23, 2009, we decided to 
abandon  our  Katrina  mineral  claim  due  to  our  unsuccessful  explorations  to  date  and  our  inability  to  attract 
investment capital to proceed with further exploration on the claim.
- 3 -
We  are  currently  seeking  other  opportunities  in  the  mining  industry.    Simultaneously,  we  are  seeking  business 
opportunities with established business entities for the merger of a target business with our company.  In certain 
instances, a target business may wish to become a subsidiary of us or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than 
merge.  We are currently in negotiations with several parties to enter into a business opportunity but we have not 
entered into any definitive agreements to date and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any 
definitive agreements.  We anticipate that any new acquisition or business opportunities by our company will require 
additional financing.  There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to 
enable us to pursue our plan of operation.  If our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire 
such funds, our business may fail.
We  have  no  revenues,  have  achieved  losses  since  inception,  have  been  issued  a  going  concern  opinion  by  our 
auditors and rely upon the sale of our securities to fund operations.  Accordingly, we will be dependent on future 
additional financing in order to maintain our operations and continue seeking new business opportunities.
Our Current Business
We  are  currently  seeking  opportunities  to  acquire  prospective  or  existing  mineral  properties,  prospective  or 
producing  oil  and  gas  properties  or  other  oil  and  gas  resource  related  projects.    Simultaneously,  we  are  seeking 
business opportunities with established business entities for the merger of a target business with our company.  In 
certain instances, a target business may wish to become a subsidiary of us or may wish to contribute assets to us 
rather than merge.  We are currently in negotiations with several parties to enter into a business opportunity but we 
have not entered into any definitive agreements to date and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter 
into any definitive agreements.  We anticipate that any new acquisition or business opportunities by our company 
will require additional financing.  There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing 
necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation.  If our company requires additional financing and we are 
unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail.
Management of our company believes that there are perceived benefits to being a reporting company with a class of 
publicly-traded  securities.    These  are  commonly  thought  to  include:  (i)  the  ability  to  use  registered  securities  to 
acquire assets or businesses; (ii) increased visibility in the financial community; (iii) the facilitation of borrowing 
from  financial  institutions;  (iv)  improved  trading  efficiency;  (v)  stockholder  liquidity;  (vi)  greater  ease  in 
subsequently raising capital; (vii) compensation of key employees through stock options; (viii) enhanced corporate 
image; and (ix) a presence in the United States capital market.
We may seek a business opportunity with entities who have recently commenced operations, or entities who wish to 
utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities, 
to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes.  We may acquire assets and establish wholly-
owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, 
consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity.  We may also 
acquire stock or assets of an existing business.  Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is likely that our present 
management will no longer be in control of our company. In addition, it is likely that our officer and director will, as 
part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and directors.
As of the date hereof, management has not entered into any formal written agreements for a business combination or 
opportunity.    When  any  such  agreement  is  reached,  we  intend  to  disclose  such  an  agreement  by  filing  a  current 
report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We  anticipate  that  the  selection  of  a  business  opportunity  in  which  to  participate  will  be  complex  and  without 
certainty of success.  Management believes that there are numerous firms in various industries seeking the perceived 
benefits  of  being  a  publicly  registered  corporation.    Business  opportunities  may  be  available  in  many  different 
industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and 
analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  We can provide no assurance that we will 
be able to locate compatible business opportunities.
- 4 -
As an exploration stage company, we are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations.  
Historically, we have been able to raise a limited amount of capital through private placements of our equity stock, 
but we are uncertain about our continued ability to raise funds privately.  Further, we believe that our company may 
have  difficulties  raising  capital  until  we  locate  a  prospective  property  through  which  we  can  pursue  our  plan  of 
operation.  If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose 
some or all of their investment and our business may fail.
Competition
We conduct our business in an environment that is highly competitive and unpredictable.  In seeking out prospective 
properties, we have encountered intense competition in all aspects of our proposed business as we compete directly 
with other development stage companies as well as established international companies.  Many of our competitors 
are  national  or  international  companies  with  far  greater  resources,  capital  and  access  to  information  than  us.  
Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition of prospective properties 
and  on  the  exploration  and  development  of  such  properties.    In  addition,  they  may  be  able  to  afford  greater 
geological  expertise  in  the  exploration  and  exploitation  of  mineral  and  oil  and  gas  properties.    This  competition 
could result in our competitors having resource properties of greater quality and attracting prospective investors to 
finance  the  development  of  such  properties  on  more  favorable  terms.    As  a  result  of  this  competition,  we  may 
become involved in an acquisition with more risk or obtain financing on less favorable terms
Compliance with Government Regulation
We will not know the government regulations and the cost of compliance with such regulations with which we must 
comply until such time as we acquire an interest in a particular mineral or oil and gas property.  If we are successful 
in acquiring a property interest, we will be required to comply with the regulations of governmental authorities and 
agencies  applicable  to  the  federal,  state  or  provincial  and  local  jurisdictions  where  the  property  is  located.  
Exploitation  and  development  of  mineral  and  oil  and  gas  properties  may  require  prior  approval  from  applicable 
governmental regulatory agencies.  There can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained.
If our activities should advance to the point where we engage in mining or oil and gas operations, we could become 
subject to environmental regulations promulgated by federal, state or provincial, and local government agencies as 
applicable.  Environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases or emissions of 
various substances produced in association with the mining industry which could result in environmental liability.  A 
breach or violation of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties.  In addition, certain types 
of  operations  require  the  submission  and  approval  of  environmental  impact  assessments.    Environmental 
assessments  are  increasingly  imposing  higher  standards,  greater  enforcement,  fines  and  penalties  for  non-
compliance.    Environmental  assessments  of  proposed  projects  carry  a  heightened  degree  of  responsibility  for 
companies, directors, officers and employees.  The cost of compliance in respect of environmental regulation has the 
potential to reduce the profitability of any future revenues that our company may generate.
Employees
Currently our only employee is our sole director and officer. We do not expect any material changes in the number 
of employees over the next 12 month period.  We anticipate that we will be conducting most of our business through 
agreements with consultants and third parties.  Our sole officer does not have an employment agreement with us.
Subsidiaries
We do not have any subsidiaries.
Intellectual Property
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Our common shares are considered speculative. Prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set 
out below.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
We are a development stage company with a limited operating history that makes it impossible to reliably 
predict future growth and operating results.
We have not been able to achieve profitable operations and there are no assurances that we will be able to do so in 
the future. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by a new enterprise and the 
high rate of failure of such enterprises. The potential for future success must be considered in light of the problems, 
expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the development of a business in 
general. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, 
and  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  generate  significant  operating  revenues  in  the  future  or  ever  achieve 
profitable operations.
We have no formal written agreement for a business combination or other transaction and there can be no 
assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and evaluate a suitable business opportunity.
As at the date of this report, we have no formal written agreement with respect to acquiring a business opportunity 
or engaging in a business combination with any private entity.  The success of our company following an entry into 
any business opportunity or business combination will depend to a great extent on the operations, financial condition 
and management of any identified business opportunity.  While management intends to seek business opportunities 
and/or business combinations with entities with established operating histories, there is no assurance that we will 
successfully  locate  business  opportunities  meeting  such  criteria.    In  the  event  that  we  complete  a  business 
combination  or  otherwise  acquire  a  business  opportunity,  the  success  of  our  operations  may  be  dependent  upon 
management  of  the  successor  firm  or  venture  partner  firm,  together  with  a  number  of  other  factors  beyond  our 
control.
As  there  are  a  large  number  of  established  and  well-financed  entities  actively  seeking  suitable  business 
opportunities and business combinations, we are at a competitive disadvantage in identifying and completing 
such opportunities.
We  are,  and  will  continue  to  be,  an  insignificant  participant  seeking  a  suitable  business  opportunity  or  business 
combination.  A large number of established and well-financed entities, including venture capital firms, are active in 
seeking suitable business opportunities or  business combinations which may also be desirable target candidates for 
our  company.    Virtually  all  such  entities  have  significantly  greater  financial  resources,  technical  expertise  and 
managerial  capabilities  than  our  company.    Consequently,  we  are  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  in  identifying 
possible  business  opportunities  and  completing  a  business  combination.    In  addition,  we  will  also  compete  with 
numerous other small public companies seeking suitable business opportunities or business combinations.
Upon completion of a business opportunity or combination, there can be no assurance that we will be able to 
successfully manage or achieve growth of that business opportunity or combination.
Our ability to achieve growth upon the acquisition of a suitable business opportunity or business combination will be 
dependent upon a number of factors including our ability to hire and train management and other employees and the 
adequacy of our financial resources.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage any 
business opportunity or business combination. Failure to manage anticipated growth effectively and efficiently could 
have a material adverse effect on our company.
- 6 -
If we complete a business opportunity or combination, management of our company may be required to sell 
or transfer common shares and resign as members of our board of directors.
A business combination or acquisition of a business opportunity involving the issuance of our common shares may 
result  in  new  shareholders  obtaining  a  controlling  interest  in  our  company.    Any  such  business  combination  or 
acquisition of a business opportunity may require management of our company to sell or transfer all or a portion of 
the shares they hold in our company and require such individuals to resign as members of our board.  The resulting 
change in control of our company could result in the removal of one or more of our present officers and directors 
and a corresponding reduction in or elimination of their participation in the future affairs of our company.
If we complete a business opportunity or combination, we may be required to issue a substantial number of 
common shares which would dilute the shareholdings of our current shareholders and result in a change of 
control of our company.
We may pursue the acquisition of a business opportunity or a business combination with a private company.  The 
likely  result  of  such  a  transaction  would  result  in  our  company  issuing  common  shares  to  shareholders  of  such 
private company.  Issuing previously authorized and unissued common shares in the capital of our company will 
reduce the percentage of common shares owned by existing shareholders and may result in a change in the control of 
our company and our management.
Our common stock is illiquid and shareholders may be unable to sell their shares.
There  is  currently  a  limited  market  for  our  common  stock  and  we  can  provide  no  assurance  to  investors  that  a 
market will develop.  If a market for our common stock does not develop, our shareholders may not be able to re-sell 
the  shares  of  our  common  stock  that  they  have  purchased  and  they  may  lose  all  of  their  investment.    Public 
announcements regarding our company, changes in government regulations, conditions in our market segment or 
changes  in  earnings  estimates  by  analysts  may  cause  the  price  of  our  common  shares  to  fluctuate  substantially.  
These fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares.
We may be unsuccessful at identifying, acquiring and operating suitable business opportunities and if we are 
unable to find, acquire or operate a suitable opportunity for our company, we may never achieve profitable 
operations.
We may not be able to find the right business opportunity for our company to become engaged in or we may not 
succeed in becoming engaged in the business opportunity we choose because we may not act fast enough or have 
enough money or other attributes to attract the new business opportunity.  Before we begin to have any significant 
operations, we will have to become involved in a viable business opportunity.  In addition, in order to be profitable, 
we will have to, among other things, hire consultants and employees, develop products and/or services, market our 
products/services,  ensure  supply  and  develop  a  customer  base.    There  is  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to 
identify, negotiate, acquire and develop a business opportunity and we may never be profitable.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK
We have not paid any dividends and do not foresee paying dividends in the future.
Payment of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon 
our  future  earnings,  our  capital  requirements,  financial  condition  and  other  relevant  factors.  We  have  no  plan  to 
declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.
Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC’s penny stock regulations and 
the FINRA’s sales practice requirements, which may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.
Our  stock  is  a  penny  stock.  The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  has  adopted  Rule  15g-9  which  generally 
defines “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an 
exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny
- 7 -
stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than 
established customers and “accredited investors”. The term “accredited investor” refers generally to institutions with 
assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 
$200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction 
in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form 
prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny 
stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny 
stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements 
showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the 
broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to 
effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation. In 
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these 
rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for 
the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may 
have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these 
penny  stock  rules.  Consequently,  these  penny  stock  rules  may  affect  the  ability  of  broker-dealers  to  trade  our 
securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our 
common stock.
In  addition  to  the  “penny  stock”  rules  promulgated  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a 
broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to 
recommending  speculative  low  priced  securities  to  their  non-institutional  customers,  broker-dealers  must  make 
reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and 
other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the National Association of Securities Dealers believes that 
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The 
National Association of Securities Dealers’ requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend 
that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.

available to us free of charge in the future.  We do not own any real property.
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
We know of no material, active or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff 
in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or

1.   We would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or 
2.   Our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed
to  satisfy  the  rights  of  shareholders  who  have  preferential  rights  superior  to  those  receiving  the
distribution.
We have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes 
that  appear  elsewhere  in  this  annual  report.  The  following  discussion  contains  forward-looking  statements  that 
reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward 
looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and 
elsewhere in this annual report.
Our audited consolidated financial statements are stated in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with 
United States generally accepted accounting principles.
Plan of Operation
We are a junior exploration stage company that has not yet generated or realized any revenues from our business 
operations.  We abandoned our Katrina mineral claim on January 23, 2009.
We  are  currently  seeking  opportunities  to  acquire  prospective  or  existing  mineral  properties,  prospective  or 
producing  oil  and  gas  properties  or  other  oil  and  gas  resource  related  projects.    Simultaneously,  we  are  seeking 
business opportunities with established business entities for the merger of a target business with our company.  In 
certain instances, a target business may wish to become a subsidiary of us or may wish to contribute assets to us 
rather than merge.  We are currently in negotiations with several parties to enter into a business opportunity but we 
have not entered into any definitive agreements to date and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter 
into any definitive agreements.  We anticipate that any new acquisition or business opportunities by our company 
will require additional financing.  There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing 
necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation.  If our company requires additional financing and we are 
unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail.
Even if we are able to acquire an interest in a mineral or oil and gas property or enter into a business opportunity and 
obtain the necessary funding, there is no assurance that any revenues would be generated by us or that revenues 
generated would be sufficient to provide a return to investors.
Anticipated Cash Requirements
We anticipate that we will incur the following expenses over the next twelve months:
1.
2.
$20,000 in connection with our company locating, evaluating and negotiating potential mineral or oil and gas
properties or business opportunities; 
 
$20,000  for  operating  expenses,  including  professional  legal  and  accounting  expenses  associated  with  our 
company being a reporting issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and
We  will  incur  additional  expenses  if  we  are  successful  in  entering  into  an  agreement  to  acquire  an  interest  in  a 
prospective or existing mineral property, a prospective or producing oil or gas property or a business opportunity.  If 
we  acquire  any  property  interests,  we  will  require  significant  funds  to  develop  the  property  in  addition  to  any 
acquisition  costs.    It  is  not  possible  to  estimate  such  funding  requirements  until  such  time  as  we  enter  into  a 
definitive agreement to acquire an interest in a property or enter into a business combination.
We  require  a  minimum  of  approximately  $40,000  to  proceed  with  our  plan  of  operation  over  the  next  twelve 
months, exclusive of any acquisition or development costs.  This amount may also increase if we are required to 
carry out due diligence investigations in regards to any prospective property or business opportunity or if the costs 
of negotiating the applicable transaction are greater than anticipated.  As we had cash in the amount of $3,879 and a 
working capital deficit in the amount of $(10,808) as of October 31, 2008, we do not have sufficient working capital 
to  enable  us  to  carry  out  our  stated  plan  of  operation  for  the  next  twelve  months.    We  plan  to  complete  private
- 10 -
placement sales of our common stock in order to raise the funds necessary to pursue our plan of operation and to 
fund  our  working  capital  deficit  in  order  to  enable  us  to  pay  our  accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities.    We 
currently do not have any arrangements in place for the completion of any private placement financings and there is 
no assurance that we will be successful in completing any private placement financings.
Results of Operations
The  following  summary  of  our  results  of  operations  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  audited  financial 
statements for the year ended October 31, 2008 which are included herein.

We  recently  abandoned  our  Katrina  mineral  claim,  have  not  earned  any  revenues  to  date,  and  do  not  anticipate 
earning revenues until such time as we are able to acquire an interest in a mineral or oil and gas property or enter 
into a business opportunity.

The decrease in our general and administrative expenses for the year ended October 31, 2008 compared to October 
31, 2007 was primarily due to: (i) a decrease in professional fees; (i) a decrease in filing fees; and (iii) a decrease in 
exploration expenses.
Professional Fees
Professional fees include our accounting and auditing expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and audit 
of  our  financial  statements  and  professional  fees  that  we  pay  to  our  legal  counsel.  Our  accounting  and  auditing 
expenses were incurred in connection with the preparation of our audited financial statements and unaudited interim 
financial  statements  and  our  preparation  and  filing  of  a  registration  statement  with  the  SEC.  Our  legal  expenses 
represent  amounts  paid  to  legal  counsel  in  connection  with  our  corporate  organization.  Legal  expenses  will  be 
ongoing during fiscal 2009 as we are subject to the reporting obligations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We anticipate that we will incur approximately $40,000 for operating expenses, including professional, legal and 
accounting  expenses  associated  with  our  reporting  requirements  under  the  Exchange  Act  during  the  next  twelve 
months. Accordingly, we will need to obtain additional financing in order to complete our business plan.
Cash Used In Operating Activities
We  used  cash  in  operating  activities  in  the  amount  of  ($42,734)  during  the  year  ended  October  31,  2008  and 
($72,996)  during  the  year  ended  October  31,  2007.  Cash  used  in  operating  activities  was  funded  by  cash  from 
financing activities.
Cash From Investing Activities
No cash was used or provided in investing activities during the years ended October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007.
Cash from Financing Activities
We generated $10,793 cash from financing activities during the year ended October 31, 2008 compared to cash from 
financing activities in the amount of $33,250 during the year ended October 31, 2007. Cash generated by financing 
activities is attributable to the shareholders loans of $10,793.
Going Concern
The financial statements accompanying this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that 
our company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of 
business. Our company has not generated revenues since inception and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely 
to pay dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of our company as a 
going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability of our company 
to obtain necessary equity financing to achieve our operating objectives, and the attainment of profitable operations. 
As  at  October  31,  2008,  our  company  has  accumulated  losses  of  $129,359  since  inception.    We  do  not  have 
sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months.  These 
financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  to  the  recoverability  and  classification  of  recorded  asset
- 12 -
amounts  and  classification  of  liabilities  that  might  be  necessary  should  our  company  be  unable  to  continue  as  a 
going concern.
Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating expenses and the capital expenses noted above in 
their report on the financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2008, our independent auditors included an 
explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements 
contain  additional  note  disclosures  describing  the  circumstances  that  lead  to  this  disclosure  by  our  independent 
auditors.
The  continuation  of  our  business  is  dependent  upon  us  raising  additional  financial  support.  The  issuance  of 
additional  equity  securities  by  us  could  result  in  a  significant  dilution  in  the  equity  interests  of  our  current 
stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and 
future cash commitments.
Future Financings
We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business 
operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance 
that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our 
planned activities.  Ian McBean has agreed to continue to provide loans to a minimal amount to carry on our legal, 
accounting and reporting needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future 
effect  on  our  financial  condition,  changes  in  financial  condition,  revenues  or  expenses,  results  of  operations, 
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Application of Critical Accounting Estimates
The  financial  statements  of  our  company  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles in the United States. Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon 
future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which 
have been made using careful judgement.
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  within  the  framework  of  the  significant  accounting  policies 
summarized below:
Mineral Property and Exploration Costs
We are an exploration stage mining company and have not yet realized any revenue from our operations.  We are 
primarily  engaged  in  the  acquisition,  exploration  and  development  of  mining  properties.  Exploration  costs  are 
expensed  as  incurred  regardless  of  the  stage  of  development  or  existence  of  reserves.  Costs  of  acquisition  are 
capitalized  subject  to  impairment  testing,  in  accordance  with  Financial  Accounting  Standards  144  (“FAS  144”), 
“Accounting  for  the  Impairment  or  Disposal  of  Long-Lived  Assets”,  when  facts  and  circumstances  indicate 
impairment may exist.
We  regularly  perform  evaluations of  any  investment  in  mineral  properties  to  assess  the  recoverability  and/or  the 
residual  value  of  our  investments  in  these  assets.  Also,  long-lived  assets  are  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever 
events or circumstances change which indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Management periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments in mineral leases and claims with internal 
and external mining related professionals. A decision to abandon, reduce or expand a specific project is based upon 
many  factors  including  general  and  specific  assessments  of  mineral  deposits,  anticipated  future  mineral  prices, 
anticipated future costs of exploring, developing and operating a production mine, the expiration term and ongoing
- 13 -
expenses  of  maintaining  mineral  properties  and  the  general  likelihood  that  we  will  continue  exploration  on  such 
project.  We do not set a pre-determined holding period for properties with unproven deposits, however, properties 
which  have  not  demonstrated  suitable  metal  concentrations  at  the  conclusion  of  each  phase  of  an  exploration 
program are re-evaluated to determine if future exploration is warranted, whether there has been any impairment in 
value and that their carrying values are appropriate.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” or 
SFAS 162. SFAS 162 is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or hierarchy, 
for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with 
U.S. GAAP for nongovernmental entities.  SFAS 162 is effective 60 days following the Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s  approval  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board’s  amendments  to  AU  Section  411, 
“The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”.  Our company is 
currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 162 but does not expect that it will have a significant effect on its 
financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
In  May  2008, the  FASB  issued  SFAS No.  163,  “Accounting  for  Financial  Guarantee  Insurance  Contracts  –  An 
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60,” or SFAS 163.  SFAS 163 requires that an insurance enterprise recognize 
a  claim  liability  prior  to  an  event  of  default  when  there  is  evidence  that  credit  deterioration  has  occurred  in  an 
insured financial obligation.  It also clarifies how Statement 60 applies to financial guarantee insurance contracts, 
including the recognition and measurement  to be used to account for premium revenue and claim liabilities, and 
requires expanded disclosures about financial guarantee insurance contracts.  SFAS 163 is effective for financial 
statements  issued  for  fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2008,  except  for  some  disclosures  about  the 
insurance enterprise’s risk-management activities.  SFAS 163 requires that disclosures about the risk-management 
activities  of  the  insurance  enterprise  be  effective  for  the  first  period  beginning  after  issuance.    Our  company  is 
currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 163 but does not expect that it will have a significant effect on its 
financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
No.  141R,  "Business  Combinations"  (“FAS  141R”)  which  replaces  FAS  No.  141  and  establishes  principles  and 
requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable 
assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.  FAS 141R also provides 
guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what 
information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the 
business combination. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date 
is  on or  after  the beginning of  the first  annual reporting  period beginning on or  after  December 15,  2008.  Early 
adoption of FAS 141R is prohibited.  Our company will assess the impact of FAS 141R in the event it enters into a 
business combination for which the expected acquisition date is subsequent to the required effective date.
In  December 2007,  the  FASB  issued  FAS  160,  which  is  effective  for  fiscal  years  beginning  after  December 15, 
2008.  Under FAS 160, the non-controlling interest will be measured at 100% of the fair value of assets acquired and 
liabilities  assumed.    Under  current  standards,  the  non-controlling  interest  is  measured  at  book  value.    For 
presentation  and  disclosure  purposes,  non-controlling  interests  will  be  classified  as  a  separate  component  of 
shareholders’  equity.    In  addition,  FAS  160  will  change  the  manner  in  which  increases/decreases  in  ownership 
percentages are accounted for.  Changes in ownership percentages will be recorded as equity transactions and no 
gain  or  loss  will  be  recognized  as  long  as  the  parent  retains  control  of  the  subsidiary.    When  a  parent  company 
deconsolidates a subsidiary but retains a non-controlling interest, the non-controlling interest is re-measured at fair 
value on the date control is lost and a gain or loss is recognized at that time.  Finally, under FAS 160, accumulated 
losses  attributable  to  the  non-controlling  interests  are  no  longer  limited  to  the  original  carrying  amount,  and 
therefore non-controlling interests could have a negative carrying balance.  The provisions of FAS 160 are to be 
applied prospectively with the exception of the presentation and disclosure provisions, which are to be applied for 
all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is not permitted.  Our company has reviewed 
the standards of FAS 160 and has concluded that it will not have any effect on its financial statements.
- 14 -
In February 2007, the FASB issued No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” 
(SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits Companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain 
other items at fair value.  The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value 
option has been elected be reported in earnings.  SFAS No. 159 is effective for our company beginning in the first 
quarter of fiscal year 2008, although earlier adoption is permitted.  Our company is currently evaluating the impact 
that SFAS No. 159 will have on its financial statements.
In  September  2006,  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  157,  “Fair  Value  Measures”.  This  Statement  defines  fair  value, 
establishes  a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  in  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP),  expands 
disclosures  about  fair  value  measurements,  and  applies  under  other  accounting  pronouncements  that  require  or 
permit fair value measurements.  SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements.  However, the 
FASB anticipates that for some entities, the application of SFAS No. 157 will change current practice.  SFAS No. 
157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which for our 
company would be the fiscal year beginning September 1, 2008.  Our company is currently evaluating the impact of 
adopting SFAS No. 157 but does not expect that it will have a significant effect on its financial position or results of 
operations.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
AUROR CAPITAL CORP.
(An Exploration Stage Company)
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2008
(Unaudited)
(Stated in U.S. Dollars)
F-1
Report of Registered Independent Public Accountants
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders, 
Auror Capital Corp. 
(an exploration stage company) 
 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Auror Capital Corp. (the “Company”) (an exploration stage 
company) as of October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007 and the related statements of operations, cash flows and 
stockholders’ equity for the years then ended and for the period from March 16, 2006 (inception) to October 31, 
2008.  These financial statements are the responsibility  of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Accounting Oversight Board (United States 
of  America).    Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amount and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the 
accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall 
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
In  our  opinion,  these  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial 
position of Auror Capital Corp. as of October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007 and the results of its operations and its 
cash flows for the fiscal years then ended and for the period March 16, 2006 (inception) to October 31, 2008 in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
The  accompanying  financial  statements  referred  to  above  have  been  prepared  assuming  that  the  Company  will 
continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company is in the exploration 
stage, has not yet achieved profitable operations and is dependent on its ability to raise capital from stockholders or 
other  sources  to  sustain  operations.  These  factors,  along  with  other  matters  set  forth  in  Note  1,  raise  substantial 
doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern.  Management plans in regard to their planned 
financing and other matters are also described in Note 1.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments 
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2008
(Unaudited)
1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
(Stated in U.S. Dollars)
Organization
Auror Capital Corp. (“the Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, U.S.A., on March 16, 2006.  
The Company’s principal executive offices are in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
Exploration Stage Activities
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and has not yet realized any revenues from 
its planned operations.  The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring exploration and development 
stage natural resource properties, and is an exploration stage company as defined in the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (“S.E.C.”) Industry Guide No. 7. However, the Company’s October 31, 2008 financial statements 
reflect an impairment charge for all of its natural resource and exploration property and, without natural 
resource property or other business assets, the Company may be considered a public shell entity with a proposed 
business strategy of merging with a private operating company.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going 
concern.
As shown in the accompanying financial statements, for the period from March 16, 2006 (inception) to October 
31, 2008, the Company had no revenue and incurred net losses aggregating $129,359.  The ability of the 
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and/or upon the 
successful merger with a private operating company.  Management has plans to seek additional capital through 
debt, and private and public offerings of its common stock.  The financial statements do not include any 
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and 
classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles in the United States.  Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent 
upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates 
which have been made using careful judgement.

(Stated in U.S. Dollars)
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
The financial statements have, in management’s opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of 
materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below:
a)  Organization and Start-up Costs
Costs of start up activities, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred.
b)  Mineral Property Interests
For  the  periods  covered  by  these  financial  statements,  the  Company  was  an  exploration  stage  mining 
company  and  has  not  yet  realized  any  revenue  from  its  operations.  It  is  primarily  engaged  in  the 
acquisition, exploration and development of mining properties. Exploration costs are expensed as incurred 
regardless of the stage of development or existence of reserves. Costs of acquisition are capitalized subject 
to impairment testing, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards 144 (“FAS 144”), “Accounting 
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, when facts and circumstances indicate impairment 
may exist.
The  Company  regularly  performs  evaluations  of  any  investment  in  mineral  properties  to  assess  the 
recoverability  and/or  the  residual  value  of  its  investments  in  these  assets.  Also,  long-lived  assets  are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances change which indicate the carrying amount of 
an asset may not be recoverable.
Management periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments in mineral leases and claims with 
internal  and  external  mining  related  professionals.  A  decision  to  abandon,  reduce  or  expand  a  specific 
project  is  based  upon  many  factors  including  general  and  specific  assessments  of  mineral  deposits, 
anticipated  future  mineral  prices,  anticipated  future  costs  of  exploring,  developing  and  operating  a 
production  mine,  the  expiration  term  and  ongoing  expenses  of  maintaining  mineral  properties  and  the 
general likelihood that the Company will continue exploration on such project. The Company does not set a 
pre-determined holding period for properties with unproven deposits, however, properties which have not 
demonstrated suitable metal concentrations at the conclusion of each phase of an exploration program are 
re-evaluated  to  determine  if  future  exploration  is  warranted,  whether  there  has  been  any  impairment  in 
value and that their carrying values are appropriate.

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
b)  Mineral Property Interests (Continued)
If an area of interest is abandoned or it is determined that its carrying value cannot be supported by future 
production  or  sale,  the  related  costs  are  charged  against  operations  in  the  year  of  abandonment  or 
determination of value. The amounts recorded as mineral leases and claims represent costs to date and do 
not necessarily reflect present or future values.
The Company’s business activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of 
the environment. These laws are continually changing, generally becoming more restrictive. The Company 
has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations.
The  accumulated  costs  of  properties  that  are  developed  on  the  stage  of  commercial  production  will  be 
amortized to operations through unit-of-production depletion if and when revenue is generated from the 
Company’s business activities.
c)  Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that this Company is not exposed to significant interest 
or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.  The fair value of these financial instruments 
approximates their carrying values, unless otherwise noted.
d) Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 (“SFAS 128”), “Earnings Per 
Share,” the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common 
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted loss per common 
share is computed similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to 
include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common 
shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  At October 31, 2008, the 
Company had no common stock equivalents that were anti-dilutive and excluded in the earnings per share 
computation.  Loss per share is rounded to the nearest penny.

e)
Income Taxes
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 –“Accounting for Income 
Taxes”  (SF  AS  109).    This  standard  requires  the  use  of  an  asset  and  liability  approach  for  financial 
accounting and reporting on income taxes.  If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred 
tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized.
f)  Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar.  Transactions in Canadian currency are 
translated into U.S. dollars as follows:
i)  monetary items at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date;
ii)  non-monetary items at the historical exchange rate;
iii)  revenue and expense at the average rate in effect during the applicable accounting period.
Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded in Stockholders’ Equity as a component of 
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or 
balances are recorded in the Statement of Operations.
g)  Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial 
statements and accompanying disclosures.  Actual results may differ from the estimates.
h)
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (“SFAS 144”), “Accounting for 
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, the Company records impairment losses on long-lived 
assets  used  in  operations  when  indicators  of  impairment  are  present  and  the  undiscounted  cash  flows 
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amount. In such cases, the amount 
of the impairment is determined based on the relative fair values of the impaired assets.

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
i)  Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (“SFAS 143’), 
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”, which requires that an asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) 
associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the period which it 
is incurred and becomes determinable, with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the associated 
asset.
The cost of the tangible asset, including the initially recognized ARO, is depleted, such that the cost of the 
ARO is recognized over the useful life of the asset.  The ARO is recorded at fair value, and accretion 
expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.  The 
fair value of the ARO is measured using expected future cash flow, discounted at the Company’s credit-
adjusted risk-free interest rate.  To date, no significant asset retirement obligation exists due to the early stage 
of exploration.  Accordingly, no liability has been recorded.
3.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The  following  Recent  Accounting  Pronouncements  are  disclosed  as  they  may  be  applicable  to  the  Company’s 
operations and have an impact on the Company’s financial statements:
In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” 
or SFAS 162. SFAS 162 is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or 
hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in 
conformity  with  U.S.  GAAP  for  nongovernmental  entities.    SFAS  162  is  effective  60  days  following  the 
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission’s  approval  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board’s 
amendments  to  AU  Section  411,  “The  Meaning  of  Present  Fairly  in  Conformity  with  Generally  Accepted 
Accounting Principles”.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 162 but does not 
expect that it will have a significant effect on its financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

3.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (Continued)
In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 163, “Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts – An 
interpretation  of  FASB  Statement  No.  60,”  or  SFAS  163.    SFAS  163  requires  that  an  insurance  enterprise 
recognize  a  claim  liability  prior  to  an  event  of  default  when  there  is  evidence  that  credit  deterioration  has 
occurred in an insured financial obligation.  It also clarifies how Statement 60 applies to financial guarantee 
insurance contracts, including the recognition and measurement to be used to account for premium revenue and 
claim liabilities, and requires expanded disclosures about financial guarantee insurance contracts.  SFAS 163 is 
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, except for some 
disclosures  about  the  insurance  enterprise’s  risk-management  activities.    SFAS  163  requires  that  disclosures 
about the risk-management activities of the insurance enterprise be effective for the first period beginning after 
issuance.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 163 but does not expect that it 
will have a significant effect on its financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
In  December  2007,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting 
Standards  No.  141R,  "Business  Combinations"  (“FAS  141R”)  which  replaces  FAS  No.  141  and  establishes 
principles  and  requirements  for  how  the  acquirer  of  a  business  recognizes  and  measures  in  its  financial 
statements  the  identifiable  assets  acquired,  the  liabilities  assumed,  and  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the 
acquiree.    FAS  141R  also  provides  guidance  for  recognizing  and  measuring  the  goodwill  acquired  in  the 
business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to 
evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This Statement applies prospectively to 
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting 
period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Early adoption of FAS 141R is prohibited.  The company will 
assess  the  impact  of  FAS  141R  in  the  event  it  enters  into  a  business  combination  for  which  the  expected 
acquisition date is subsequent to the required effective date.

3.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (Continued)
In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 160, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 
2008.  Under FAS 160, the non-controlling interest will be measured at 100% of the fair value of assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed.  Under current standards, the non-controlling interest is measured at book 
value.  For presentation and disclosure purposes, non-controlling interests will be classified as a separate 
component of shareholders’ equity.  In addition, FAS 160 will change the manner in which increases/decreases 
in ownership percentages are accounted for.  Changes in ownership percentages will be recorded as equity 
transactions and no gain or loss will be recognized as long as the parent retains control of the subsidiary.  When 
a parent company deconsolidates a subsidiary but retains a non-controlling interest, the non-controlling interest 
is re-measured at fair value on the date control is lost and a gain or loss is recognized at that time.  Finally, 
under FAS 160, accumulated losses attributable to the non-controlling interests are no longer limited to the 
original carrying amount, and therefore non-controlling interests could have a negative carrying balance.  The 
provisions of FAS 160 are to be applied prospectively with the exception of the presentation and disclosure 
provisions, which are to be applied for all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is 
not permitted.  The Company has reviewed the standards of FAS 160 and has concluded that it will not have 
any effect on its financial statements.
In  February  2007,  the  FASB  issued  No.  159,  “The  Fair  Value  Option  for  Financial  Assets  and  Financial 
Liabilities”  (SFAS  No.  159).  SFAS  No.  159  permits  Companies  to  choose  to  measure  certain  financial 
instruments and certain other items at fair value.  The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on 
items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings.  SFAS No. 159 is effective for 
the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, although earlier adoption is permitted.  The 
Company is currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on its financial statements.
In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measures”. This Statement defines fair value, 
establishes  a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  in  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP), 
expands disclosures about fair value measurements, and applies under other accounting pronouncements that 
require or permit fair value measurements.  SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements.  
However, the FASB anticipates that for some entities, the application of SFAS No. 157 will change current 
practice.  SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 
15, 2007, which for the Company would be the fiscal year beginning September 1, 2008.  The Company is 
currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 but does not expect that it will have a significant 
effect on its financial position or results of operations.

4.  MINERAL PROPERTY
During 2006, the Company acquired an undivided 100% interest in a mineral claim (known as the “Katrina”)

For the fourth quarter ended October 31, 2008, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $4,582 for its 
Katrina holdings, representing all of its natural resource properties.  The Company determined that indicators of 
impairment were present and that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by this asset was less than 
the carrying amount.
5.  SHARE CAPITAL
On March 16, 2006, the Company issued 5,000,000 common shares to the Company’s founder at a price of 
$0.001 per share.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed 
in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in 
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission’s  rules  and  forms  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and 
communicated  to  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  as 
appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure 
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and 
operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable  assurance  of  achieving  the  desired  control  objectives,  and  management  is 
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our 
disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the controls and procedures 
would meet their objectives.
As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls 
and  procedures  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report.  Based  on  the  foregoing,  our  Chief  Executive 
Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  were  effective  at  the 
reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. 
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley  Act,  management  has  conducted  an  assessment,  including  testing,  using  the  criteria  in  Internal 
Control  —  Integrated  Framework,  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway 
Commission (“COSO”). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable 
assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal 
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Management  has  used  the  framework  set  forth  in  the  report  entitled  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework 
published  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission,  known  as  COSO,  to 
evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management has 
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2008.
This  Annual  Report  does  not  include  an  attestation  report  of  our  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm 
regarding internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting was not subject to 
attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit 
us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.
There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that 
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Company

Business Experience
The following is a brief account of the education and business experience of each director and executive officer 
during at least the past five years, indicating each person’s principal occupation during the period, and the name and 
principal business of the organization by which he was employed.
Ian McBean is our president, secretary and treasurer and our sole director. Mr. McBean has been our president, 
secretary and treasurer and our sole director since our incorporation on March 16, 2006.  Mr. McBean has been the 
president  from  2000  to  present  of  Jealax  Consulting  Inc.,  Mr.  McBean’s  personal  consulting  company,  which 
provides consulting services to small and medium sized companies with respect to real estate issues such as dealing 
with  government  expropriations,  highways,  and  other  land  use  issues.    In  addition,  Mr.  McBean  has  from 
February 2001  to  July  2008  been  the  manager  of  the  Vancouver  operations  of  Scott  Land  &  Lease,  a  company 
involved in the mineral, oil and gas industry that acts as a land agent and secures mineral leases, oil and gas rights, 
right of ways for gas, oil, and water pipelines as well as consults on a broad range of land use related issues.
Term of Office
Our  directors  are  appointed  for  a  one-year  term  to  hold  office  until  the  next  annual  general  meeting  of  our 
shareholders or until removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our officers are appointed by our board of 
directors and hold office until removed by the board.
Significant Employees
We have no significant employees other than the director and officer described above.
Family Relationships
There are no family relationships among our directors or officers.
Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
Our directors, executive officers and control persons have not been involved in any of the following events during 
the past five years:
1.
2.
3.
any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or 
executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
any  conviction  in  a  criminal  proceeding  or  being  subject  to  a  pending  criminal  proceeding  (excluding 
traffic violations and other minor offenses); 
being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any 
court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise 
limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or
- 17 -
4.
being  found  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  (in  a  civil  action),  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities 
or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated.
Audit Committee
The Company’s audit committee is composed of its sole director and officer, Ian McBean.
Audit Committee Financial Expert
Our board of directors has determined that it does not have an audit committee member that qualifies as an “audit 
committee financial expert” as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. We believe that the audit committee 
members are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal 
controls and procedures for financial reporting. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director who 
would qualify as an “audit committee financial expert” would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted 
in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated revenues to 
date.
Code of Ethics
We adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to all of our directors, officers, employees and consultants, which is a "code 
of ethics" as defined by applicable rules of the SEC. Our Code of Ethics is attached as an exhibit to our annual 
report on Form 10-KSB filed on February 13, 2008. If we make any amendments to our Code of Ethics other than 
technical, administrative, or other non-substantive amendments, or grant any waivers, including implicit waivers, 
from a provision of our Code of Ethics to our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or certain other finance 
executives, we will disclose the nature of the amendment or waiver, its effective date and to whom it applies in a 
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 
10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, 
reports  of  changes  in  ownership  and  annual  reports  concerning  their  ownership  of  our  common  stock  and  other 
equity securities, on Forms 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders 
are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file.
Based  solely  on  our  review  of  the  copies  of  such  forms  received  by  us,  or  written  representations  from  certain 
reporting persons, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than ten 
percent beneficial owners were complied with.
ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.
The particulars of compensation paid to the following persons:
•
•
•
our principal executive officer;
each of our two most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers at the 
end of the year ended October 31, 2008; and
up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been provided under (b) but for the fact 
that  the  individual  was  not  serving  as  our  executive  officer  at  the  end  of  the  most  recently  completed 
financial year,
who we will collectively refer to as the named executive officers, for our years ended October 31, 2008 and 2007, 
are set out in the following summary compensation table:

Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract,
arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or
to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of
shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the
power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if
the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of 
which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding
is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these 
acquisition rights. 
  
The percentage of class is based on 7,112,500 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of January 27, 2009.

change of control of our company.

None of the following parties has, since commencement of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, had any material 
interest,  direct  or  indirect,  in  any  transaction  with  us  or  in  any  presently  proposed  transaction  that  has  or  will 
materially affect us, in which our company is a participant and the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,00 or 
1% of the average of our company’s total assets for the last three completed financial years:
(i)   Any of our directors or officers; 
(ii)   Any person proposed as a nominee for election as a director; 
(iii)   Any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, shares carrying more than 5% of the voting
rights attached to our outstanding shares of common stock;
(iv)   Any of our promoters; and 
(v)   Any member of the immediate family (including spouse, parents, children, siblings and in- laws) of any
of the foregoing persons.
- 20 -
Director Independence
Our common stock is quoted on the OTC bulletin board interdealer quotation system, which does not have director 
independence requirements. Under NASDAQ rule 4200(a)(15), a director is not considered to be independent if he 
or she is also an executive officer or employee of the corporation. Our sole director, Ian McBean, is also our chief 
executive officer, president and treasurer.  As a result, we do not have any independent directors.
As  a  result  of  our  limited  operating  history  and  limited  resources,  our  management  believes  that  we  will  have 
difficulty in attracting independent directors.  In addition, we would be likely be required to obtain directors and 
officers insurance coverage in order to attract and retain independent directors. our management believes that the 
costs associated with maintaining such insurance is prohibitive at this time.
National Instrument 52-110
We  are  a  reporting  issuer  in  the  Province  of  British  Columbia.    National  Instrument  52-110  of  the  Canadian 
Securities Administrators requires our company, as a venture issuer, to disclose annually in our annual report certain 
information concerning the constitution of our  audit committee and our relationship with our independent auditor. 
Our audit committee is presently composed of our sole officer and director.  Our board of directors has determined 
that it does not have an audit committee member that qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in 
Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. We believe that the sole audit committee member is capable of analyzing and 
evaluating our  financial  statements  and understanding  internal  controls  and  procedures  for  financial reporting. In 
addition,  we  believe  that  retaining  an  independent  director  who  would  qualify  as  an  “audit  committee  financial 
expert” would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of 
our development and the fact that we have not generated revenues to date.
Since the commencement of our company’s most recently completed financial year, our company has not relied on 
the exemptions contained in sections 2.4 or 8 of National Instrument 52-110. Section 2.4 (De Minimis Non-audit 
Services)  provides  an  exemption  from  the  requirement  that  the  audit  committee  must  pre-approve  all  non-audit 
services  to  be  provided  by  the  auditor,  where  the  total  amount  of  fees  related  to  the  non-audit  services  are  not 
expected to exceed 5% of the total fees payable to the auditor in the fiscal year in which the non-audit services were 
provided. Section 8 (Exemptions) permits a company to apply to a securities regulatory authority for an exemption 
from the requirements of National Instrument 52-110 in whole or in part.
The audit committee has adopted specific policies and procedures for the engagement of non-audit services as set 
out in the Audit Committee Charter of our company. A copy of our company’s Audit Committee Charter is filed as 
an exhibit to this annual report.
Transactions with Independent Directors
Our sole director, Ian McBean, is also our chief executive officer, president and treasurer.  As a result, we do not 
have any independent directors.
Board of Directors
Our board of directors currently acts with one member consisting of Ian McBean.  We have determined that Mr. 
McBean is not independent as that term is defined in National Instrument 52-110 due to the fact that he is our sole 
director and officer.
Our  board  of  directors  facilitates  its  exercise  of  independent  supervision  over  management  by  endorsing  the 
guidelines for responsibilities of the board as set out by regulatory authorities on corporate governance in Canada 
and the United States.  Our board’s primary responsibilities are to supervise the management of our company, to 
establish an appropriate corporate governance system, and to set a tone of high professional and ethical standards.
The board is also responsible for:
• 
•
selecting and assessing members of the Board; 
choosing,  assessing  and  compensating  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  our  company,  approving  the 
compensation of all executive officers and ensuring that an orderly management succession plan exists;
- 21 -
•
•
• 
•
•
reviewing and approving our company’s strategic plan, operating plan, capital budget and financial goals, 
and reviewing its performance against those plans; 
adopting a code of conduct and a disclosure policy for our company, and monitoring performance against 
those policies; 
ensuring the integrity of our company's internal control and management information systems; 
approving  any  major  changes  to  our  company’s  capital  structure,  including  significant  investments  or 
financing arrangements; and 
reviewing and approving any other issues which, in the view of the Board or management, may require 
Board scrutiny.
Orientation and Continuing Education
We have an informal process to orient and educate new recruits to the board regarding their role of the board, our 
committees and our directors, as well as the nature and operations of our business.  This process provides for an 
orientation with key members of the management staff, and further provides access to materials necessary to inform 
them of the information required to carry out their responsibilities as a board member. This information includes the 
most recent board approved budget, the most recent annual report, the audited financial statements and copies of the 
interim quarterly financial statements.
The board does not provide continuing education for its directors.  Each director is responsible to maintain the skills 
and knowledge necessary to meet his or her obligations as directors.
Nomination of Directors
The board is responsible for identifying new director nominees.  In identifying candidates for membership on the 
board,  the  board  takes  into  account  all  factors  it  considers  appropriate, which  may  include  strength  of  character, 
mature  judgment,  career  specialization,  relevant  technical  skills,  diversity  and  the  extent  to  which  the  candidate 
would fill a present need on the board.  As part of the process, the board, together with management, is responsible 
for conducting background searches, and is empowered to retain search firms to assist in the nominations process.  
Once candidates have gone through a screening process and met with a number of the existing directors, they are 
formally put forward as nominees for approval by the board.
Assessments
The board  intends  that  individual director  assessments  be conducted by other directors,  taking  into  account  each 
director’s  contributions  at  board  meetings,  service  on  committees,  experience  base,  and  their  general  ability  to 
contribute to one or more of our company’s major needs.  However, due to our stage of development and our need to 
deal with other urgent priorities, the board has not yet implemented such a process of assessment.
ITEM 14.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES
Audit fees
The aggregate fees billed for the two most recently completed fiscal periods ended October 31, 2008 and October 
31, 2007 for professional services rendered by Jorgenson & Co., Chartered Accountants for the audit of our annual 
consolidated financial statements, quarterly reviews of our interim consolidated financial statements  and services 
normally provided by the independent accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements 
for these fiscal periods were as follows:

In the above table, “audit fees” are fees billed by our company’s external auditor for services provided in auditing 
our company’s annual financial statements for the subject year. “Audit-related fees” are fees not included in audit 
fees that are billed by the auditor for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of 
the audit review of our company’s financial statements. “Tax fees” are fees billed by the auditor for professional 
services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. “All other fees” are fees billed by the auditor for 
products and services not included in the foregoing categories.
Policy on Pre-Approval by Audit Committee of Services Performed by Independent Auditors
The board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors.  All of the above services and 
fees  were  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  board  of  directors  either  before  or  after  the  respective  services  were 
rendered.
The board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by Jorgenson & Co. and believes that the 
provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining Jorgenson & Co.
