<p>*  In its resolution S-7/1, adopted by the Human Rights Council on 22 May 2008, the Council 
requested the Special Rapporteur to invite comments from States and other relevant actors on the 
impact of the global food crisis on the protection of the right to food and the required remedies 
from a human rights perspective, and to report thereon to the Council at its ninth session. Owing 
to the time restraints involved, the present report is submitted late. The footnotes and annexes to

</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The marked increase of the prices of food commodities on the international markets in the 
period 2006-2008 confronts States with a number of dilemmas, related for instance to whether 
the price increases should be combated or actions taken instead to ensure that those increases 
benefit agricultural producers and do not have a negative impact on the most vulnerable, or to the 
conditions under which agrofuels could be developed as an alternative to fossil fuels in the 
transport sector. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food highlights the 
impact of the choices to be made on the right to food, placing them in the framework of States&#8217; 
obligations domestically and internationally. He suggests why a human rights framework should 
be adopted in order both to identify the measures needed to respond to the new situation created 
by the surge in prices and to guide their implementation. Listing both the risks and the 
opportunities of the current situation, the Special Rapporteur explains why continued monitoring 
of initiatives adopted at the national and international levels to respond to the crisis is required. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with resolution S-7/1, adopted by the Human 
Rights Council at its seventh special session on 22 May 2008, on the negative impact on the 
realization of the right to food of the worsening of the world food crisis caused, inter alia, by the 
soaring food prices.<b>1</b> It aims to offer an analysis of the global food crisis and of possible 
solutions which are grounded in the right to adequate food, as recognized under international 
law. In proposing a human rights framework for an evaluation of the initiatives aimed at 
addressing the global food crisis, the report is based on article 25 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, as interpreted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as 
other relevant international standards.<b>2</b> The Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive 
Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security adopted by 
States members of the General Council of the FAO on 23 November 2004 are also taken into 
account, since they offer detailed and practical prescriptions about how States and other actors 
should implement the right to adequate food in a number of areas. 
</p>
<p>2. A number of implications follow from the adoption of this perspective. In identifying these 
implications, the Special Rapporteur is mindful of the fact that the impact of the recent surge in 
food prices on the right to adequate food must be addressed by measures adopted at both the 
national and the international levels. It is the primary responsibility of each State to ensure that 
every man, woman and child under its jurisdiction, alone or in community with others, has 
physical and economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its procurement.<b>3</b> A 
human rights approach will target the most vulnerable segments of the population, who are most 
severely affected by the crisis or who may least benefit from the remedies. It is therefore 
particularly important that States (a) base the measures they adopt on an adequate mapping of 
food insecurity and vulnerability, and (b) that they ensure accountability for violations of the 
right to food. In addition, the present report explains why States should (c) improve the 
protection of the rights of land users, in a context characterized by increased competition for land 
and other natural resources such as water and biodiversity; and (d) strengthen the protection of 
women&#8217;s rights (see sect. III below). It is however the responsibility of all States and of the 
international community as a whole, including international agencies whether or not from the 
United Nations system, to shape an international environment that enables States to effectively 
comply with these obligations. This requires all States and international agencies (a) to 
re-examine policies that have a negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food in other

<p>countries, and to abstain from taking new measures that would have such an impact; (b) to 
protect the right to adequate food by ensuring that third parties, including private actors do not 
interfere with the enjoyment of the right to food; and (c) to contribute to the fulfilment of the 
right to adequate food by cooperating in the identification of the obstacles to the realization of 
the right to food and in the elimination of them (see sect. IV). 
</p>
<p>3. The increase in prices on the international markets during the period 2005-2007 will result 
in increased poverty, which a World Bank study of April 2008, based on a survey of nine 
low-income countries, estimated at 4.5 per cent in the absence of policy measures taken to 
mitigate the price increases, driving an additional 105 million people into poverty.<b>4</b> Given the 
annual poverty reduction of 0.68 per cent since 1984, this 4.5% increase in poverty would 
destroy almost seven years of poverty reduction efforts. It has been estimated that with a 
20 per cent increase in food prices in 2025 relative to the 1996 baseline, the number of 
undernourished people in the world would increase by 440 million.<b>5</b> In addition, rising food 
prices are forcing families to stop buying more nutritious foods as they can barely afford the 
staple foods they need. A reversal of the already slow progress in reducing under nutrition seems 
inevitable. In such a context, it is imperative that policies which measures that could worsen the 
crisis be avoided. 
</p>
<p>4. It is equally clear that efforts aimed at limiting the increase in prices on international 
markets are not sufficient. Even before the current crisis, an estimated 852 million people were 
food-insecure. The current crisis shows that the mismatch between supply of and solvent demand 
for agricultural products may in the future further worsen this situation by making food even less 
affordable for people whose entitlements are insufficient to allow them to procure sufficient 
food. The world population, now at 6.7 billion, increases by some 75 million each year; in 2025, 
there will be 8 billion living on the planet, and 9.2 billion in 2050. It has been estimated that the 
production of food will have to increase by 50 per cent by 2030, and double by 2050, if an 
increase growth in demand is to be met. But if a response to the current crisis is sought 
exclusively in a rise in the overall production of agricultural commodities in order to address the 
imbalance between the supply and the demand for food as a source of tension on the global 
commodities markets, it will largely miss its target. This is not only because tackling food 
insecurity and increasing agricultural investment do not explicitly tackle malnutrition, which 
affects 2 billion people in the world who suffer from micronutrient deficiency. It is also and even 
more importantly overconsumption and wastage by some,<b>6</b> and insufficient purchasing power for

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the many others, the main problem, not food shortage. Producing more food will not alleviate the 
hunger of those who lack the purchasing power required to gain access to the food which is 
available. Moreover, speaking in aggregate terms obfuscates distributional questions. We need to 
produce food in order to raise not just the supply of food, but also the purchasing power of those 
who produce it. 
</p>
<p>5. In addressing the global food crisis, we should therefore constantly remind ourselves of 
who the food insecure are, in order to target our efforts at increasing their purchasing power. 
Most of the food insecure live in rural areas. Agricultural workers are among the most 
vulnerable, owing due to the often informal character of their employment, depriving them of 
legal protection from their employers. They amount to 450 million, and represent 40 per cent of 
the world's agricultural work force.<b>7</b> Another important category of food-insecure people are the 
small-hold farming households.<b>8</b> Unless carefully tailored to increase the purchasing power of 
this category, measures to boost production may lead to investments in large-scale agricultural 
exploitations, working with technologies and providing markets not accessible to small-holders. 
There are approximately 500 million small-holder households, totalling 1.5 billion people, living 
on two hectares of land or less. Many are facing an unprecedented increase in the price of inputs, 
as a result of the increase of the price of oil and, for livestock farmers, of crops, at the very same 
moment that, as net food buyers, they are spending larger amounts of their budgets on food. 
International market price increases will benefit some, particularly in India and China, but not 
many others, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Higher food prices do not always trickle down 
to the farm-gate, where many poor farmers must sell. To increase their yield, they need access to 
credit to pay for fertilizer, seeds, and tools. They need access to technology to boost productivity. 
They will be helped, not by being provided food, but by being supported to produce food, and to 
sell it at a remunerative price and thus, from their position as net food buyers, become net food 
sellers. For them, the alternative is clear: to live from farming their small plots, or to join the 
rapidly expanding slums of the larger cities. 
</p>
<p>6. The challenge we face, in sum, is not simply to increase production; it is also to ensure that 
the current increase in food prices can be seized as an opportunity in order to advance the 
realization of the right to food by the adoption of structural measures, leading to a profound 
reform of the global food system. The section below explains why this is so, and why adopting a 
human rights framework will help to achieve it.

</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  More precisely, it has been estimated that about half of those who are food insecure in the 
</p>
<p>world live in smallholder farming households ; two-tenths are landless ; one-tenth are 
pastoralists, fisherfolk, and forest users ; and the remaining two-tenths are the urban poor 
(U.N. Millennium Project, <i>Halving Hunger: It Can be Done, Summary Version of the Report of 
the Task Force on Hunger</i> (The Earth Institute, Columbia University, 2005), p. 6). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS BASED ON 
BUILDING RESILIENCE 
</b></p>
<p>7. Annex I contains a brief analysis of the drivers of the crisis and of the broader perspective 
within which it should be situated. Two conclusions emerge from the analysis. The first is that 
the surge in prices in 2006-2008 is the result of policies that have systematically undermined the 
agricultural sector in a number of developing countries over a period of 30 years. This not only 
made these countries vulnerable to the volatility of international prices for food commodities, but 
also resulted in a situation where small-holders, owing to the lack of rural infrastructure and 
access to credit, the dismantling of public support schemes, the impact of rushed and 
mismanaged trade liberalization and their position in the food production and distribution chain 
are unable to benefit from the current increase in international markets prices. These factors must 
be addressed in the search for sustainable solutions to the current crisis. 
</p>
<p>8. Adopting a human rights framework can help achieve this objective, because it may guide 
the redefinition of the policy priorities triggered by the current crisis. The question &#8220;for whose 
benefit?&#8221; is at least as important as the question &#8220;how to produce more?&#8221; But there is a risk, in 
the current situation, that the latter question will be treated as the most pressing and that we 
focus on solutions that promote the supply of more food, without paying sufficient attention to 
the question of who produces, at what price and for whom. This would be a mistake with 
far-reaching consequences. One of the opportunities created by the current crisis is that 
investment in agriculture, which has been neglected for many years both in the definition of 
priorities of official development assistance and in national budgets, will be given in the future 
the priority it deserves. But how the investments will be channelled, towards whom, and for 
which purpose, deserves close scrutiny. If, guided by a sense of urgency and a mistaken 
diagnosis about the challenges facing us, investment is planned exclusively with a view to 
increasing the supply of food, it could result in the wrong choices. Instead, investment should be 
guided by the need to promote sustainable forms of agricultural production, benefiting 
small-holders who are most in need of support, and where the impact on poverty alleviation will 
be greatest.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>9. There is a risk that, in a context dominated by the fear of food shortages, opportunities will 
be mistaken for solutions, and that, in the name of raising production, the need for both social 
and environmental sustainability of the solutions devised will be underestimated. One indicator 
of the reality of the risk is the almost complete silence in international discussions about the 
conclusions of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and 
Technology for Development, sponsored by the FAO and the World Bank that &#8220;the way the

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  The difficulty in identifying the best options in this regard is best illustrated by the ongoing 
</p>
<p>discussion on the impacts to be expected from the work of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in 
Africa (AGRA). In order to facilitate a dialogue on the issues raised by the idea of launching a 
second &#8216;green revolution&#8217; in the African context, the Special Rapporteur intends to convene a 
multi-stakeholder meeting in December 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>world grows its food will have to change radically to better serve the poor and hungry if the 
world is to cope with a growing population and climate change while avoiding social breakdown 
and environmental collapse&#8221;.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>10. The search for such sustainable solutions may be more difficult than reliance on 
technological solutions devised elsewhere, and it may be less attractive to private interests. But 
these recommendations are the result of a long process of scientific research and consultation, 
analogous to the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In devising solutions 
to improve the productivity of agriculture, we should first and foremost use the scientific 
expertise already available on the social and environmental impact of technology-led attempts at 
boosting production. 
</p>
<p>11. A second conclusion from the analysis (see annex I9 is that we should resist the temptation 
of seeking answers by simply reversing the clock: by reverting to a &#8216;normal&#8217; situation, in which 
the impoverished countryside feeds the comparatively wealthier inhabitants of the city, and in 
which cheap food is made available on international markets as compensation for the destruction 
of the livelihood of farmers in many developing countries. Instead, we need to build a system 
which ensures a sufficient degree of resilience in the face of the increasing volatility of 
international markets of agricultural primary commodities, and which maintains such volatility 
within acceptable margins. According to the Agricultural Outlook 2008-2017 by FAO and the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), prices of primary 
agricultural commodities will remain at higher average levels over the medium term than during 
the period 1998-2007, but they will then resume their decline in real terms, though at a lesser 
pace than previously. These forecasts are, however, made under rather heroic assumptions.<b>11</b> The 
potential impact of climate change and water shortages were not factored in, although we know 
the threat that they represent for agriculture, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Asia and 
South Asia, where climate change will affect rain, increase the frequency of droughts, raise 
average temperatures, and threaten the availability of fresh water for farming. In addition, policy

</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  The report found that technological innovations in agriculture have generally favoured 
</p>
<p>large-scale producers, and their costs have been borne by small scale producers, their 
communities and the environment. The IAASTD report strongly supported the potential of 
small-scale producers in agricultural development, pointing to the need for dedicated support for 
smallholders if this potential is to be achieved, and to the need to avoid dependency on expensive 
inputs such as inorganic fertilizers whose prices are closely aligned with those of oil, or on 
patented seeds. In order to reduce vulnerability in the food system, it recommended relying on 
locally-based knowledge, innovations, policies and investments. Participatory Plant Breeding 
and Farmer-Researcher groups - not exogenous technologies - were specifically highlighted as 
models for successful technological development. The IAASTD identified several areas ripe for 
investment and public research, among them, low-input and organic systems, biological 
substitutes for agrochemicals, site-specific easily adaptable cultivars, local seed systems, and 
reducing the dependency of agriculture on fossil fuels.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>changes, particularly mandates for the use of agrofuels, the reform of the Common Agricultural 
Policy of the EU, or changes in the regimes governing international trade in agriculture or 
intellectual property rights, per definition, could not be considered in those forecasts. Therefore, 
we should be prepared for not only higher than average prices or a slowing down of the decline 
in prices, but also for price volatility.<b>12</b> As noted by the World Bank, &#8220;managing grain price risk 
is a fundamental requirement in a world characterized by more volatile international grain prices 
and recurring supply shocks that will likely result from global warming&#8221;.<b>13</b> Acknowledging 
uncertainty about the future evolution of prices, rather than potentially misleading forecasts 
about their possible evolution, should be guiding policy choices. For this reason, the present 
report puts resilience, as a condition for coping with uncertainty and thus guaranteeing access to 
food for all, at its centre. 
</p>
<p>12. Annex I also offers a summary of the reactions that followed the global food crisis 
of 2007-2008. It is not the purpose of the present report to review in detail the initiatives taken at 
the operational level by the executive agencies of the United Nations, the international financial 
institutions or regional development banks; nor would it be feasible here to describe the outcome 
of the meetings which, in different forums, focused on the global food crisis and the answers to 
it. A consensus has emerged that the adoption of short-term measures should not only aim at 
alleviating the lot of the hungry, particularly the urban poor, and particularly by the provision of 
food aid , but that, for the reasons explained above, it should also aim at improving the 
productivity of small-holders. The question to be addressed by the Council is how the various 
initiatives and commitments which have been recalled could be guided by a human rights 
framework and what that would imply. With the exception of the resolution adopted by the 
Council at its seventh special session and of reference to the right to food guidelines in the 
outcome document adopted by the High-Level Conference on World Food Security convened by 
FAO in Rome from 3 to 5 June 2008, the human right to adequate food has been almost entirely 
absent from the current discussions. This is not of merely symbolic, or anecdotal, significance. It 
leads to a situation in which an important set of tools that could address the global food crisis is 
neglected. Developing responses under the framework of the human right to food would ensure 
that these responses are better guided by the needs of the hungry and the malnourished. It would 
pave the way for targeting, but also for prioritization, coordination, accountability and 
participation. Whether the right to food has been left out by design or by ignorance of its 
operational consequences, it should now be brought back. 
</p>
<p>13. It is in this spirit that the observations below are submitted. They focus on the future of the 
global food system. The immediate reactions to the crisis are referred to only insofar as they 
provide indications about the risk that the human rights dimension will be neglected in the 
setting-up of mechanisms ensuring improved food and nutrition security for the future.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. NATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR THE REALIZATION 
OF THE RIGHT TO FOOD 
</b></p>
<p>14. Under article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
the principal obligation of States is to take steps to achieve progressively the full realization of 
the right to adequate food. This imposes an obligation to move as expeditiously as possible 
towards that goal.<b>14</b> The human right to adequate food thus requires the adoption of measures 
which, at the national level, might better shield vulnerable segments of the population from the 
impact of increases in the price of food commodities: the net food buyers, whether or not they 
are agricultural producers, and particularly the urban poor and landless labourers. The 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has insisted on the need for States to work 
towards &#8220;the adoption of a national strategy to ensure food and nutrition security for all, based on 
human rights principles that define the objectives and the formulation of policies and 
corresponding benchmarks&#8221;.<b>15</b> Such a national strategy should comprise the establishment of 
appropriate institutional mechanisms in order to (a) identify, at the earliest stage possible, 
emerging threats to the right to adequate food, by adequate monitoring systems; (b) assess the 
impact of new legislative initiatives or policies on the right to adequate food; (c) improve 
coordination between relevant ministries and between the national and subnational levels of 
government, taking into account the impact on the right to adequate food, in its nutritional 
dimensions, of measures taken in the areas of health, education, access to water and sanitation, 
and information; (d) improve accountability, with a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the 
setting of precise time frames for the realization of the dimensions of the right to food that 
require progressive implementation; and (e) ensure the adequate participation, particularly of the 
most food-insecure segments of the population. 
</p>
<p>15. In order to ensure that the measures they take move in the right direction, States should, as 
a matter of priority, inform themselves about the risks to food security under their jurisdiction, 
and about the impact of any measures they intend to take. They should establish mechanisms 
ensuring the accountability of all branches of government in order to ensure that they comply 
with the obligations imposed on them for the realization of the right to food. They should also 
strengthen the rights of land users and of women. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Mapping food insecurity and vulnerability, and monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>16. Acting within a human rights framework first requires States to develop policy responses 
based on an adequate mapping of food insecurity and vulnerability, identifying with the 
necessary precision how interventions should be targeted, and assessing the impact on the right 
to food prior to the adoption of legal or policy measures that could have a negative impact on the 
right to food. Guideline 13 of the Right to Food Guidelines (see paragraph I above) recommends 
establishing food insecurity and vulnerability mapping systems (FIVIMS) to identify those

<p>groups that are food insecure in terms of lack of assets or income, as well as on other grounds. 
Similarly, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) has emphasized the need to strengthen 
the evidence-base for decision-making, with a particular focus on the nutritional risks faced by 
women and children, through nutritional and associated health indicators.<b>16</b> One indicator of the 
usefulness of performing such a mapping exercise at the early stage of policymaking is the 
almost complete neglect in the current discussions of the role of fundamental labour rights in the 
fulfilment of the right to adequate food. Agricultural workers are in a particularly vulnerable 
position, 60 per cent of them living in poverty in many countries.<b>17</b> Mapping food insecurity and 
vulnerability at the national level would help identify the scope of this problem and the 
development of appropriate policies. Impact assessments can also improve significantly the 
quality of lawmaking and policymaking. Guideline 17 of the Right to Food Guidelines contains a 
set of recommendations related to conducting right to food impact assessments, the development 
for monitoring purposes of process, impact and outcome indicators, and the need to prioritize the 
monitoring of the food security situation of vulnerable groups and their nutritional status. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Improving accountability 
</b></p>
<p>17. Mapping threats to food security alone does not suffice, however. The human rights 
approach also leads to an understanding of the requirement of food security in terms of legal 
entitlements and accountability mechanisms. Ensuring that everyone has access to adequate food 
is not enough. It is also important that they have so as a matter of right, and that corresponding 
obligations be imposed on public and private actors who may have an impact on the enjoyment 
of that right. By ensuring that the hungry and the malnourished have legal claims against those 
whose actions or inactions have an impact on their situation, this framework creates security, 
backed by institutional mechanisms. It helps to create the conditions ensuring that people can 
feed themselves. Ensuring that they can do so as a matter of right rather than as a matter of 
policy choice is especially important if we take into consideration the capacity to influence 
decision-makers of the respective groups concerned with food insecurity. It is well known that, 
in developing countries, small-scale farmers form a large but geographically dispersed group, 
with little or no access to resources for political lobbying, and face prohibitive transaction costs 
in the organization of collective action. Urban groups, in contrast, find it easier to mobilize 
through public protests; so do farmers in industrial economies.<b>18</b> With such disparity in access to 
political influence, a rights-based approach constitutes a necessary insurance against the risk of 
public policies being biased in favour of the most influential and well-organized interest groups, 
when they should instead address the needs of those at greatest risk, whether in urban or rural 
populations.

</p>
<p>18. As part of their national strategies, States should adopt a framework legislation ensuring 
that the right to food is justiciable before national courts or that other forms of redress are 
available, so that in situations such as the current one, when the prices of food undergo a sudden 
increase, the other branches of government will not be allowed to remain passive, and so that, in 
the adoption of measures aimed at realizing the right to food, any discrimination in access to 
food or means for its procurement will be effectively prohibited. By defining in a framework law 
the obligations corresponding to the right to adequate food with a greater degree of precision, 
courts or other monitoring mechanisms, such as human rights institutions, will be encouraged 
to contribute to ensure compliance with the right to adequate food. Such accountability 
mechanisms may therefore contribute to ensure that, where macro-economic or social policies 
are misguided or are not well targeted (for instance, because they underestimate the needs of 
certain segments of the population or of certain regions), this will be identified at an early stage 
and corrected. 
</p>
<p>19. While the Comprehensive Framework for Action developed by the High-Level Task Force 
on the Global Food Crisis to provide guidance to Governments advocates the regular assessment 
of food and nutrition insecurity,<b>19</b> this is not couched in human rights terms, and is conceived 
solely as a tool to guide policymaking at the national level. Thus, the dimension of accountability 
remains absent, and the establishment of recourse mechanisms for the victims of violations of the 
right to food is not recommended. Instead, these dimensions would be present if national 
strategies were grounded on the recognition of the right to adequate food, and if courts or other 
mechanisms, including national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights or 
ombudsman institutions, were assigned the task of monitoring whether the different branches of 
Government fulfil their duties under the said national strategy. In order to assist States in setting 
up such a framework, the FAO Right to Food Unit should be strengthened in the context of the 
current reform of the Organization so as to make its work on the right to food less dependent on 
the discretion of voluntary donor contributions. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Securing rights related to the use of land 
</b></p>
<p>20. A particular source of concern is that, despite decades of work on this issue by FAO or the 
World Bank, too little attention has been paid to the rights of those who cultivate land or need 
access to it as a productive resource, among the answers to the global food crisis. While the 
Comprehensive Framework for Action developed by the High Level Task Force on the Global 
Food Crisis does refer to the need to implement &#8220;a transparent land tenure policy for managing 
land effectively while securing access to land rights for communities or individuals, particularly 
marginalized groups (e.g. indigenous people, women)&#8221;<b>20</b> it is not developed in any detail, and 
constitutes an exception in the range of proposals currently developed in response to the global

<p>food crisis.<b>21</b> The statement made by leaders of the Group of eight on global food security makes 
no reference to the issue. No governmental delegation present at the High-Level Conference on 
World Food Security mentioned agrarian reform or the need to protect the security of land 
tenure.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>21. To the extent that the emphasis is on increasing the production of food, the responses to the 
current global food crisis could, however, lead to new threats to security of land tenure. One 
danger in the current situation is that, as a result of the renewed interest in agriculture and the 
race towards the production of agrofuels,<b>23</b> competition will increase for land in what has been 
described as &#8220;&#8216;an uneven playing field - in many cases between large-scale investors and local 
land users who often hold no statutory rights over the land they use&#8221;.<b>24</b> The development of 
transnational investment in agricultural land, by which countries seek to ensure their food 
security by buying land abroad, and the development of monocultures for exports increase such 
pressure even further. In this context, developing countries should be encouraged to ensure 
security of tenure for all land users. While landowners may gain from the increase in the price of 
land, it constitutes a threat for landless labourers or for those whose title to the land they 
cultivate is insecure, and it may make it impossible for small holders to acquire more land in 
order to increase production. Securing land rights would encourage investors seeking to produce 
crops for export to opt for contract farming with small-holders, thus contributing to a better 
livelihood for the producers concerned. 
</p>
<p>22. Not only should the rights of land users on their land be secured; excessive concentration 
of land should also be avoided, and, where necessary, agrarian reform should be pursued to 
ensure that those who depend on land for their livelihood have access to it. Article 11(2) (a) of 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights refers to developing or 
reforming agrarian systems as a means of ensuring the fundamental right to be free from hunger. 
Agrarian reforms should be accelerated, as recommended by Guideline 8.10 of the FAO 
Guidelines on the Right to Food and by the FAO International Conference on Agrarian Reform

<p>and Rural Development since gaining access to land is essential to landless labourers who are 
among the most food- insecure today. In the ministerial declaration adopted by consensus at its 
2008 session the Economic and Social Council recognized &#8220;the crucial importance of enhanced 
access of the rural poor, women and men, to productive assets, in particular land and water&#8221;, and 
stressed that &#8220;priority attention should be given to the adoption of policies and the 
implementation of laws that guarantee well-defined and enforceable land- and water-use rights 
and promote legal security of tenure, while recognizing the existence of different national laws 
and/or systems of land access and tenure&#8221;.<b>25</b> In accordance with Res. 2002/49 of the Commission 
on Human Rights on &#8216;Women's equal ownership, access to and control over land and the equal 
rights to own property and to adequate housing&#8217;, special attention should be paid to the removal 
of all obstacles to the equal enjoyment of land rights by women.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>23. Elsewhere, the previous Special Rapporteur on the right to food explored why the full 
respect for women&#8217;s rights is crucial to the enjoyment of the right to adequate food, particularly 
in its nutritional aspects.<b>27</b> As noted by the World Bank, &#8220;in many societies, women bear the 
primary responsibility for feeding the family, yet without having control of family resources. In 
many countries, women and girls are also frequently less favoured in the intra-household 
distribution of food.&#8221;<b>28</b> The Comprehensive Framework for Action is explicit on this issue.<b>29</b> 
There is a high degree of consensus, therefore, on the need to strengthen women&#8217;s rights, 
particularly in rural areas as required under article 14 of the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and on the contribution this could make to food 
and nutrition security. However, many obstacles remain in the implementation at the national 
level, owing to discriminatory laws or customs. States should be encouraged to move further in 
this direction by making women&#8217;s rights an explicit component of their national strategies to 
respond to the food crisis.

<p>adequate food on their national territories; they are also under an obligation to contribute to the 
realization of the right to food in other countries and to shape an international environment 
enabling national Governments to realize the right to food under their jurisdiction.<b>30</b> It is in this 
light that we should understand the commitment of States under the Covenant, &#8220;taking into 
account the problems of both food-importing and food-exporting countries, to ensure an 
equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to need&#8217; (art. 11.2 (b)). It follows from 
Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations that they must cooperate in the identification and 
elimination of the obstacles to the full realization of the right to food. Although it does not 
provide a catalogue of measures which might constitute &#8216;international assistance and 
cooperation&#8221; as required by the Covenant, it is clear at least from article 23 of the Covenant that 
such an obligation is not limited to the provision of financial assistance.<b>31</b> Rather, it should be 
understood as having three implications, corresponding respectively to (a) an obligation not to 
pursue policies which have a negative impact on the right to adequate food; (b) an obligation to 
ensure that third parties, including private actors, do not interfere with the enjoyment of the right 
to food; and (c) an obligation to cooperate internationally in order to contribute to the fulfilment 
of the right to food. Whether or not they belong to the United Nations system, international 
agencies are also under an obligation to respect the human right to adequate food, under general 
public international law; and the member States of these organizations have a due diligence 
obligation to ensure that international organizations to which they delegate powers exercise them 
in conformity with their human rights obligations.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A. The obligation not to pursue policies that have a negative impact 
on the right to adequate food: the example of agrofuels 
</b></p>
<p>25. International law imposes on all States an obligation to re-examine, with a view to its 
modification, any policy which has been proven to have a negative impact on the right to 
adequate food or on the right of every individual to be free from hunger and malnutrition. It does 
not matter whether such impact is documented within the State which has taken the measure, or 
whether the impact is seen outside the national territory of that State, as long as there exists a 
clear causality link between the policy in question and the enjoyment of the right to adequate 
food.

<p>  This article states that &#8216;international action for the achievement of the rights recognized in the 
present Covenant includes such methods as the conclusion of conventions, the adoption of 
recommendations, the furnishing of technical assistance and the holding of regional meetings 
and technical meetings for the purpose of consultation and study organized in conjunction with 
the Governments concerned&#8217;.

<p>  The preliminary report of the Special Rapporteur to the UN General Assembly contains more 
detailed normative references on these issues. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. It is in the light of this obligation that the policies promoting the use of agrofuels as a 
substitute for fossil fuels in the transport sector must be examined.<b>33</b> These policies take various 
forms and it would be irresponsible to condemn them as a whole, by claiming, for instance, that 
bioenergy production to meet domestic needs and limit dependency on the expensive oil imports 
is the same as large-scale agrofuel production for export purposes; that bioethanol produced from 
sugar was comparable to the bioethanol produced from maize, or from other crops such as 
cassava, wheat, sweet sorghum and sugar beets, or that biodiesel produced from rapeseed oil was 
the same as the biodiesel from palm l or soybean oil. Indeed, not only should distinctions be 
made between different plants used as feed for fuel; in order to evaluate the impact on the right 
to food, the production methods used in each industry should be taken into account, since they 
have a different impact on job creation of, on the environment and food security. 
27. Annex II offers a brief overview of the impact of the development of agrofuels on the 
enjoyment of the right to adequate food. An impact can be witnessed on three levels. 
28. First, the pace of agrofuel development has significantly contributed to the increase in the 
price of certain agricultural commodities on international markets, threatening the enjoyment of 
the right to adequate food. It has been estimated that the number of people suffering from 
undernourishment could increase by 16 million for each percentage point increase in the real 
price of staple food;<b>34</b> the food crops currently used to produce ethanol are also the crops that 
form the largest part of the diets of poor people, maize, sugar cane, soy, cassava, palm oil and 
sorghum provide around 30 per cent of mean calorie consumption of people living in chronic 
hunger.<b>35</b> Such price increases are not per se problematic; under certain conditions, particularly if 
they benefit rural households who are net food sellers and if the net food buyers are protected by 
targeted measures aimed at increasing their purchasing power, such increases may in fact have 
benevolent effects, particularly in a dynamic perspective. Under current conditions, however, 
and owing to the sudden brutality of the price increases and our degree of unpreparedness, the 
negative effects far outweigh the positive ones, and this should be carefully monitored. 
</p>
<p>29. Second, since the production of agrofuels (particularly of bioethanol, which currently 
constitutes the largest proportion) tends to reinforce the concentration of land and the 
development of large-scale agricultural exploitations, it puts additional pressure on 
small-holders, and poses a threat to the use of land by indigenous peoples. It increases the 
competition for cropland and for water resources, and represents a threat to biodiversity. Though

 <p> 
</p>
<p>it may create employment (although this should be weighed against the risk of the livelihoods 
being destroyed as a result of the development of agrofuels production), the working conditions 
in the large plantations typical of the agrofuels industry are often exploitative. 
</p>
<p>30. Third, since their demand is concentrated in industrialized countries, whereas the 
production of agrofuels is more efficient and cost-effective in developing countries given their 
natural comparative advantage in their production in the absence of market-distorting measures, 
agrofuels encourage a form of economic development based on the expansion of cash crops, 
further pitting the interests of a small minority of actors producing crops for exports against the 
interests of both other agricultural producers and the other sections of the population, for which 
the result may be further inflation of food prices. 
</p>
<p>31. The conclusion that emerges from the findings (see Annex II) is that the current path in the 
development of agrofuels for transport is not sustainable, and that if such development goes 
unchecked, further violations of the right to food will result. Pending the adoption of an 
international consensus on this issue, any new large-scale investment into the production of 
agrofuels for transportation should be authorized by government authorities only when its 
detailed and multi-stakeholder assessment is positive in terms of its implications, both at the 
domestic and international levels, for the right to food, social conditions and issues related to 
land tenure, including the displacement of farmers and the indirect environmental impact this 
might cause in terms of land use. All measures encouraging a market for agrofuels (blending 
mandates, subsidies and tax breaks) should be revised, since such measures encourage 
speculation by non-commercial investors, who anticipate that the price of agricultural 
commodities will remain at high levels and rise further as a result of the growing demand for 
agricultural commodities on international markets, linked to the creation of this artificial market. 
</p>
<p>32. Work should be accelerated in the development of an international consensus on agrofuels. 
In the view of the Special Rapporteur, two outcomes should result. First, international guidelines 
on the production of agrofuels should be agreed upon. In addition to environmental standards, 
the guidelines should incorporate the requirements of human rights instruments, particularly with 
regard to the right to adequate food (as elaborated upon in the FAO Right to Food Guidelines), 
the right to adequate housing (including protection from evictions and displacements), the rights 
of workers (including in particular the right to fair remuneration and the right to a healthy 
working environment), the rights of indigenous peoples, and women&#8217;s rights. Countries should 
be encouraged not to allow further investments in agrofuels unless such guidelines are followed. 
In addition, and as a means to encourage such compliance, access to international markets could 
be made conditional upon compliance with the guidelines.<b>36</b> Similarly, States should be allowed, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>36
</b>  In defining the relationship between such guidelines as developed through an international 
</p>
<p>consensus and the international trade regime, lessons should be drawn from the Kimberley 
Process Certification Scheme, which restricts trade between Kimberley participants to certified 
non-conflict diamonds only, and prohibits trade between Kimberley participants and 
non-participants. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in their import policies, to discriminate in favour of countries whose production of agrofuels 
complies with the guidelines, while excluding imports from other, non-compliant States. For 
reasons of legal certainty, a waiver may be sought from the General Council of the World Trade 
Organization, in order to ensure the compatibility of such a scheme with the non-discrimination 
principles of articles I, XI and XIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</p>
<p>33. As a second element of a new international consensus on agrofuels, a permanent forum 
should be established at the international level, in order to both ensure the impartial and 
objective monitoring of compliance with the guidelines and constitute a platform for the 
exchange of best practices in their implementation. Such a forum should have sufficient 
expertise in the human rights issues raised by the production of agrofuels. It should also have the 
resources to evaluate the potential impact of certain investment decisions on the prices of food 
commodities, both at the international and the national levels and thus to provide assessments 
guiding States in the implementation of the guidelines. 
</p>
<p>34. Consideration should also be given to the possibility of allocating quotas to countries for 
the production of agrofuels. Such an allocation should take into account the energy balance of 
each form of production and the impact on the price of agricultural commodities on international 
markets. But it should also include consideration of the risks of distorted development in 
producing countries, working in favour of crop-growers producing feed for fuel but at the same 
time threatening the access to land and water of other producers, particularly small-holders 
producing crops for domestic consumption, and inflating the prices of food on local markets. 
</p>
<p><b>B. The obligation to protect the right to adequate food 
by controlling private actors 
</b></p>
<p>35. There exists an obligation of all States to protect the right to food effectively by regulating 
the activities of companies at all levels of the system of production and distribution of food, 
consistent with article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights<b>37</b> and with the FAO Right to food Guidelines.<b>38</b> The Human Rights Council has requested 
private actors &#8220;to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right 
to food for all&#8221;.<b>39</b> But, as noted by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises in his most 
recent report to the Council, the role of States in ensuring that they comply with their human 
rights obligations remains crucial.<b>40</b>

</p>
<p>36. In the current discussions held at the intergovernmental level no reference has been made, 
to the role of agribusiness and global retailers in identifying solutions to the situation created by 
the increase in prices on the international markets. They are part of the solution, however. The 
gap between farm-gate prices (received by the farmers) and the prices paid by the consumer is 
widening, and while recent price increases hit consumers severely in many countries, they 
mostly do not benefit small-holders. This in turn can be explained by two characteristics of the 
organisation of the food production and distribution chain. First, at the horizontal level, the 
farming sector is increasingly dualized: while the vast majority of farms (85 per cent) are 
small-holder operations, 0.5 per cent of the world&#8217;s farms that exceed 100 hectares in size claim 
a disproportionate share of global farm income and public subsidies in industrialized countries.<b>41</b> 
Second, vertically, agricultural producers face increasingly concentrated interlocutors for both 
acquiring inputs and selling their produce. Farming is one of the few businesses that pays retail 
prices for inputs and sells its products at wholesale prices.<b>42</b> At both ends of the chain (producers 
and retailers) and in the middle (the food processing sector), the degree of concentration is 
particularly high: for instance, the 10 leading food retailers have a 24 per cent share of the 
$3.5 billion global market, and their activities in developing countries have expanded 
dramatically in recent years. 
</p>
<p>37. Private investment in agriculture is vital, and food processing companies and global 
retailers have a crucial function to fulfil by connecting farmers to high-value markets. But these 
imbalances in power are a major obstacle to the efficient functioning of the food chain. Since 
most large agribusiness companies are based in industrialized countries, this further worsens the 
imbalances seen in the global trading system. The World Bank has noted, for instance, that 
because of the high concentration rate of coffee roasters and retailers, the share of the retail price 
retained by coffee-producing countries Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and Viet Nam accounting for 
64 per cent of global production declined from a third in the early 1990s to 10 per cent in 2002, 
while the value of retail sales doubled. It also calculated that developing countries&#8217; claim on 
value added in agricultural commodities declined from around 60 per cent in 1970-1972 to 
around 28 per cent in 1998-2000.<b>43</b> This only underscores the importance of supporting 
small-holder farmers and their organizations, including in the poorest and most remote areas, to 
enable them to play an effective role in meeting the rising demand for food and thus to achieve 
an adequate standard of living, and of exploring with the agribusiness sector what contribution it 
could make to help achieve this objective.

<p>38. In the fulfilment of his mandate, working in close cooperation with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises, the Special Rapporteur will investigate this issue in 
two directions. First, he will seek to enter into a dialogue with the agribusiness sector in order to 
identify how they could contribute to the fulfilment of the right to adequate food, taking into 
account not only their obligations to workers in the food chain, but also how their buying 
practices could lead to fairer forms of trade. Second, he will examine how States could 
implement their duty to protect human rights in the food production and distribution chain, 
including by an improved use of antitrust regulations. 
</p>
<p><b>C. The obligation to cooperate internationally in order to 
contribute to the fulfilment of the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>39. The obligation imposed on all States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations 
to take joint and separate action to achieve the full realization of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms is not limited to abstaining from the adoption of measures which have a negative 
impact on the enjoyment of those rights. As clearly indicated by the wording of article 23 of 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, it may encompass the 
adoption of measures, in particular in the form of the negotiation of international agreements. 
</p>
<p>40. Taking into account these international obligations requires the identification of which 
coordinated reaction from the international community is needed to address the situation created 
by the increase in the price of food on international markets, guided by the obligations of all 
States under international law to respect the right to adequate food. Such a coordinated reaction 
should address not only the short-term impact of the current crisis, but also the structural causes 
leading to soaring food prices. The current crisis has highlighted the need to take action on three 
issues. Addressing these issues should be on the top of the agenda of the new partnership on 
agriculture and food. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  The need for international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Combating the negative impact of speculation 
</b>41. Many observers of the current crisis have noted the role of speculation on the markets of 
primary commodities, particularly food commodities, in the surge of prices in 2006 and 2007.<b>44</b> 
The large influx of funds from financial investors into agricultural futures and options markets 
has raised concerns that this may have driven up prices and contributed to the volatility of prices, 
a volatility which is in the interest of neither consumers, who pay higher prices as a result, nor 
producers, for whom credit may become unaffordable as a result, nor Governments, whose social 
programmes may have to bridge the gap between the incomes of the poorest and their needs. 
Index speculators have a particularly important and potentially destabilizing role, since their 
investment choice in commodities are a purely portfolio-based decisions, unrelated to 
fundamental supply and demand factors. The shift towards primary commodities by such

</b>  <i>OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2008-2017</i>, 29 May 2008, at p. 36. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>investors,<b>45</b> a result of the low returns of stock markets and of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, has 
helped push the international prices of such commodities upwards on specialized boards, such as 
the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</p>
<p>42. Mechanisms such as the constitution of strategic grain reserves at the national, or 
preferably at the local level, could go a long way towards combating the impact of price 
volatility, thus making non-commercial speculation less attractive. Local grain banks in rural 
communities in the most vulnerable parts of the world should therefore be supported. Access and 
control should be entrusted to local communities and, where possible, stocks should be built of 
locally produced and consumed staple food. However, more attention should be paid by the 
international community to this phenomenon, as States acting unilaterally may find it difficult 
to effectively tackle the impact of speculation on the prices on international markets, 
for instance by improving the regulation of investment funds or by taxing such movement of 
funds. 
</p>
<p>43. One proposal made is the pooling of one portion of the strategic grain reserves detained by 
States, in order to establish what the leaders of the Group of Eight referred to as &#8220;a &#8216;virtual&#8217; 
internationally coordinated reserve system for humanitarian purposes&#8221;.<b>46</b> The main objective of 
such a virtual global strategic reserve would be to ensure that States facing an emergency, for 
instance due to a conflict or to weather-related events, could acquire food at a price which is 
reasonable and, especially, predictable, since prices would be based on a commitment of the 
States participating in the global reserve to sell at pre-defined prices. One benefit of such a 
scheme would be that speculation would not be encouraged by sudden shocks, since the 
countries having to import urgently large quantities of food would not be going through the usual 
market mechanisms.<b>47</b> A more ambitious version of this proposal would be to re-establish 
international buffer stocks in order to stabilize the price of food commodities, as was done in the 
1960s and 1970s, for instance through the International Cocoa Agreement or the International 
Coffee Agreement. Provided that such agreements attracted support from a sufficiently large 
number of importing and exporting country members and set target prices at realistic levels, and 
could be funded at sufficiently high levels in order to cover the risks of long periods of low 
prices, they could have an important stabilizing function, to the benefit of exporting and 
importing countries alike. Again, since speculation has its origin in the expectations of future 
prices, price-stabilizing measures such as through the re-establishment of international buffer 
stocks would discourage speculation, preventing its negative effects on spot prices for 
commercial traders and consumers alike.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Encouraging social safety nets by establishing a global reinsurance fund 
</b>44. While necessary, acting on prices alone is not sufficient. In addition, in order to boost 
supply, agricultural producers need to be supported through public programmes improving their 
ability to produce, and countries need to be able to protect their population from the impact of 
the increased volatility of food prices. Indeed, the FAO Right to Food Guidelines recommend 
that States establish and maintain social and food-safety nets to protect those who are unable to 
provide for themselves. But uncertainty about possible future shocks to their economies is a 
major disincentive for poor countries to establish robust social-safety nets, since they know their 
fiscal resources may be strained as a result of adverse shocks brutally increasing the needs of the 
population. In order to address this problem, the establishment of a global reinsurance fund has 
been proposed, providing insurance to poor countries against sudden shocks, whether of internal 
or of external origin, leading to rising demands for social support in ways that might not be 
fiscally sustainable for the countries concerned.<b>48</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(c) The role of international trade 
</b>45. There have been calls for further progress on trade liberalization - and, more precisely, on 
the swift completion of the Doha round of negotiations within the World Trade Organization as 
part of the answers to the crisis. However, not any agreement will do. As noted in the 
Comprehensive Framework for Action, the international trade system needs to be equitable if it 
is to contribute to the objective of food security. There are strong arguments for the view that 
precipitate and inequitable trade liberalization in agriculture, following the prescriptions of the 
international financial institutions in the 1980s, is among the reasons for the lack of development 
of the agricultural sector in certain developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa: in 
addition to being heavily taxed by Governments through a combination of exchange rate 
manipulation, parastatal monopolies in processing and trading and government price setting, 
local farmers were weakened by severely distorted competition from abroad. The Uruguay round 
of trade negotiations leading to the establishment of the World Trade Organization and the 
conclusion of the agreement on agriculture did little to remedy this, and it is still uncertain 
whether the round of negotiations launched in Doha in November 2001 will offer satisfactory 
answers, as called for by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development S&#227;o Paulo 
Consensus.<b>49</b> Indeed, given that larger agricultural producers are in general better positioned to 
benefit from the opportunities created by trade liberalization, since they can more easily adapt to 
the volumes and standards requirements imposed by global food buyers and retailers, there is a 
real risk that export-led agricultural development will further marginalize the position of 
smallholders, worsening their food insecurity instead of improving it.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46. Whether trade liberalization should be listed among the panoply of solutions for the 
establishment of world food security or not will depend on a number of factors, including in 
particular (a) whether the more vulnerable agricultural producers from developing countries can 
be effectively protected from the negative impact of imports of agricultural products sold at 
lower prices on international markets, especially those products being sold for less than their cost 
of production; (b) whether the development of export agriculture induced by trade liberalization 
is possible without discriminatory impacts on smallholders such as those resulting from 
increased competition over productive resources like land, water, irrigation, access to 
infrastructure, as large exploitations tend to capture rural services and infrastructure; (c) whether 
the problems created by excessive concentration in the agribusiness sector are effectively 
addressed ; and (d) which measures will be taken to encourage the ability of small-holder 
producers from developing countries to export to the markets of industrialized countries.<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Intellectual property rights 
</b>47. Finally, it should be noted that nowhere has the protection of intellectual property rights on 
plant varieties or seeds been identified as a potential source of concern. But, as explained in 
detail in the first report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the General Assembly, regimes 
that prevent farmers from re-using and exchanging seeds can have serious implications for 
farmers&#8217; ability to continue farming and for agricultural biodiversity, and thus for the world&#8217;s 
capacity to ensure sustainable food production over the long term. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Towards a new global partnership for agriculture and food 
</b></p>
<p>48. The idea of a global partnership for agriculture and food has emerged as a possible 
institutional response to the global food crisis.<b>51</b> If one is to be established, such a proposal 
should bring true added value and ensure that the establishment of a new, coordinating structure 
is a better solution than the reinforcement of existing agencies. Any discussion should start by 
reconsidering why the World Food Council was abolished in 1996. In addition, whether the 
human right to food will be served by a new institutional initiative will depend on the capacity of 
any structure emerging from the current discussions to tap into strategies developed at the 
national level, with the active participation of those immediately affected by the problems of 
hunger and malnutrition. The Special Rapporteur would like to make, in addition, the comments 
set out in the paragraphs below. 
</p>
<p>49. Any global partnership for food and agriculture should aim at ensuring world food and 
nutrition security, in order to contribute to the realization of the right to food, with attention paid 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>50
</b>  The Special Rapporteur will examine the interactions between international trade in 
</p>
<p>agricultural products and the right to food in a separate report to the Human Rights Council on a 
mission to the WTO. 
<b>51
</b></p>
<p>  See also the proposals emanating from the International Food Policy Research Institute: 
J. von Braun and N. Islam, &#8216;Toward a New Global Governance System for Agriculture, Food 
and Nutrition: What Are the Options?&#8217;, <i>IFPRI Forum</i>, March 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>specifically to the most vulnerable. It should not only focus on boosting the supply of food, but 
also contribute to ensuring compliance with the right to adequate food, including in its nutritional 
aspects. Health, education, trade and the environment - not agriculture alone - should therefore 
be part of any effort to improve international coordination towards meeting this objective. The 
aim should be to ensure household food and nutrition security, which implies more than adequate 
food intake; it also demands attention to health services and proper care for the vulnerable. 
Indeed, one likely impact of the current food crisis is that it will create to more low-income, net 
food purchasing households, whose dietary diversity will be reduced in their effort to maintain 
consumption of staples. This has serious public nutritional health implications, including 
micronutrient malnutrition especially of women and children. Special efforts are therefore 
required to address both food security and general nutrition security; otherwise the benefits for 
the realization of the right to food for good nutrition are less likely to accrue for the most 
vulnerable groups. The important expertise of the Standing Committee on Nutrition should be 
drawn upon in order to ensure that this dimension is adequately taken into account. 
</p>
<p>50. A global partnership for food and agriculture has the potential to improve accountability 
with regard to the follow-up to commitments made by countries, particularly concerning 
contributions to official development assistance and the use of such contributions (including 
levels and predictability of assistance, and the earmarking of a certain proportion of it and of 
national budgets to the needs of the agricultural sector in accordance with local conditions and 
needs), and with regard to the impact of policies pursued at the national, regional and 
international levels on the right to adequate food. If indicators and benchmarks are to be relied 
on in measuring progress towards meeting the objective of world food and nutrition security, 
they should be based on the different components of the human right to adequate food be 
disaggregated in order to measure the impact of the policies pursued on all vulnerable groups, 
particularly women, children, indigenous peoples, displaced persons and refugees, as well as 
small-holders and rural landless labourers. 
</p>
<p>51. If a scientific body is to be established as part of a new global partnership for food and 
agriculture, the experts appointed to that body should be carefully selected in order to ensure 
their full independence and impartiality. It is also crucial that we build on the expertise of the 
important expertise accumulated within the Rome-based agencies of the United Nations (FAO, 
the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Fund Programme), and that, 
in any area already covered by the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science 
and Technology for Development, the latter research be taken as the departure point. Not only 
would there be little point in repeating that enterprise; offering to do so would raise the suspicion 
that the conclusions reached by the Assessment have been set aside because they are 
inconvenient. 
</p>
<p>52. If a new global fund is to be established as part of a new global partnership for food and 
agriculture, it should serve the existing agencies working in these areas. Any competition for 
resources should be avoided. However, a new fund could have the added value of including in its 
mechanisms the global reinsurance fund (see paragraph 44 above); it could also serve to manage 
the virtual international reserve which could be established in order to meet the urgent needs of 
countries without disrupting markets, and to finance international buffer stocks as a part of 
international commodity agreements. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The increase in the price of food commodities on international markets has had a 
severe negative impact on the right to food of the poorest households, who are net food 
buyers, with particularly damaging consequences in countries where there are either no 
social safety nets in place or the ones that exist are too weak to withstand the shock. The 
increase will not benefit many small-holders, either as they face steep rises in costs and lack 
the infrastructure and support they need to increase food supply. Therefore, while the 
tension between supply and demand must be addressed in order to reconstitute the food 
stocks by both increasing the level of agricultural production and limiting waste and 
overconsumption, what matters in human rights terms is who will produce food, and for 
the benefit of whom. The current situation creates opportunities. But opportunities should 
not be mistaken for solutions. While more must be invested in agriculture and rural 
infrastructure in order to make up for years of neglect, how the investments are targeted, 
which forms they take, and what their effects are, must be carefully monitored. If a new 
global partnership for agriculture and food is to emerge from the current crisis, it is crucial 
to ensure that this partnership does not simply seek to boost supply by promoting 
technology-driven recipes, but also empowers those who are hungry and malnourished and 
whose livelihoods may be threatened by precisely this renewed interest in encouraging 
agricultural production. A human rights framework would contribute to keeping the 
search for solutions on this track, because it would ensure that the most vulnerable will be 
given priority, and because it would improve accountability and participation in 
decision-making. It is therefore regrettable that such a framework has been almost entirely 
absent from current discussions.  
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls on the Human Rights Council: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a)</b> <b>To continue monitoring the initiatives adopted by Governments, the private 
sector and international agencies, in reaction to the global food crisis, and contribute to the 
discussion of any future global partnership for agriculture and food, ensuring that it 
includes attention to its human rights dimensions and that it is based on an effective 
participation of rights-holders; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b)</b> <b>To encourage States to build national strategies for the realization of the right to 
adequate food, which should include mapping of the food- insecure, adoption of relevant 
legislation and policies with a right-to-food framework, establishment of mechanisms to 
ensure accountability so that rights-holders are able to claim their right to food, and the 
establishment of mechanisms and processes which ensure real participation of 
rights-holders, particularly the most vulnerable, in designing and monitoring such 
legislation and policies. These strategies should in particular take into account the need to 
strengthen the protection of the human rights of the most vulnerable groups including 
land-users whose land tenure is insecure, landless labourers, women, the displaced, 
indigenous people, minorities, the disabled and the rural and urban poor; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c)</b> <b>To encourage the development of an international consensus on agrofuels, based 
not only on the need to avoid the negative impact of the development of agrofuels on the </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>international price of staple food commodities, but also on the need to ensure that the 
production of agrofuels respects the full range of human rights and does not result in 
distorted development in producer countries; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d)</b> <b>To insist that all States ensure that third parties, including private actors, do not 
interfere with the right to adequate food, and clarify how the private sector can contribute 
to the shaping of a more just food production and distribution system; 
</b> <b>(e)</b> <b>To request further studies on the role of international cooperation in combating 
the negative effects of non-commercial speculation on the price of primary agricultural 
commodities, particularly on the potential roles of a virtual global reserve and 
international commodity agreements; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(f)</b> <b>To examine the contribution the establishment of a global reinsurance fund 
could make to the realization of the right to adequate food. </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>THE GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS AND THE RESPONSES OF 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: A SUMMARY 
</b></p>
<p>1. This Appendix briefly recalls the origins of the current global food crisis (1.), the broader 
historical context in which is can be understood (2.), the main impacts (3.), and the responses of 
the international community (4.). It should be read as a complement to the initial analysis 
provided by the Special Rapporteur of the global food crisis, which included data not repeated 
here.<b>52</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  The origins of the global food crisis 
</b></p>
<p>2. Since a number of studies have been presented on the origins of the surge in the prices of 
food commodities in the international markets in 2007-2008,<b>53</b> a brief summary of the emerging 
consensus may suffice here. While independent observers differ on the relative importance of the 
different factors which have played a role - which indeed, due to their interrelatedness, are 
difficult to disaggregate from one another - there is broad agreement at least on the identity of 
these factors. The increase in the price of oil led to a corresponding rise in the cost of producing 
food, both because of the costs of fertilizers and pesticides and because of the transportation, 
packaging and processing costs, widening the wedge between farmgate prices and prices on 
international markets.<b>54</b> It also led to a higher demand for agrofuel feedstock, particularly maize, 
soybean, and palm oil, creating more competition for cropland between food, feed for livestock, 
and fuel, and a surge in the demand for grain. The resulting tension between supply and demand 
was accentuated, on the supply side, by other factors, some purely conjunctural, others more

<p>  Research from the World Bank indicates that a 10 percent rise in crude oil prices translates 
into a 1.6 per cent increase in agricultural commodity prices. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>structural in nature. Weather-related events in 2005-2006 led to worse-than-expected harvests in 
certain major cereal-exporting countries, although the overall level of production remained 
stable. But more importantly, agricultural production needs time to adapt to price signals, 
because it requires new investments, the absorption of new technologies or the switch to 
higher-priced crops. In the current context, the cost of energy, both for production of food and 
for freight, further slowed down the ability of producers to respond to demand. And in many 
regions, agricultural producers have been unable to continue improving their productivity 
per hectare as they have been doing since the 1960s - either because the productivity is already 
such that margins for improvement are almost non-existent (as in the EU and in the 
United States, Canada or Australia), or because of insufficient access to credit and 
infrastructures, depleted soils, and a system of international trade in agricultural products which 
has reduced agricultural production in those countries to lower-than-subsistence levels after the 
1980s (as in Sub-Saharan Africa where important margins subsist for productivity 
improvements). 
</p>
<p>3. On the demand side, the continuation of levels of consumption in the industrialized 
countries, particularly of animal protein-rich food such as dairy products and meat, which would 
be unsustainable if they were to be replicated universally, and improving diets in large, 
fast-growing economies - although they still lag far behind the levels of consumption achieved in 
the OECD countries - have further contributed to putting pressure on the markets. These 
changes in diets multiply the impact of natural population growth, which increases by about 
75 million persons each year. Finally, the resulting increase of the prices of agricultural primary 
commodities on the international markets was severely exacerbated by (although not caused by) 
the arrival on those markets of non-commercial investors, who massively shifted to primary 
agricultural commodities in 2006 and especially 2007. While there remains disagreement about 
whether this, per se, contributed to the soaring of prices, it certainly did lead to more volatility in 
the concerned markets. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The crisis in historical perspective 
</b></p>
<p>4. There is some analogy between the current crisis and earlier episodes. Following the oil 
price shocks of 1973 and 1979, sudden supply-side shocks already had sent commodity prices 
significantly higher. Especially in 1972-1973, due to wheat harvest failures in the USSR, the 
prices of grain went up in proportions comparable to those we are witnessing today. After the 
Soviet Union decided to buy significant quantities of grain on the world markets, prices trebled 
between mid-1972 and mid-1973. As a result of this peak in prices, the private sector invested 
more into agriculture, and national policies were set in place to encourage production. As a 
consequence of the resulting efficiency gains, prices were brought down to their previous 
levels.<b>55</b> The tendency towards constantly lower prices continued throughout the 1980s and

<p>1990s, with the exception of a small increase in 1979-1980 and during the mid 1990s. These 
evolutions are reflected in the real value of the extended Food price Index of FAO. The index 
reached its peak in 1974 (250) and then it has been followed by a decline in real food prices till 
end of the 1980s (100) followed by a small increase in the mid 1990s, followed by a historical 
low in 1999. Between 2000-2005 it has being increasing at a rate of 1.3 per cent per year and has 
increased to 15 per cent per year since 2006, reaching a level of 160 in 2008.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5. The structural decline in the prices of agricultural primary commodities over the 
last 30 years clearly hindered the development of the agricultural sector in a number of 
developing countries. Prices on the international markets were depressed due to two factors: 
remarkable increases in productivity per hectare by mechanisation and the use of improved seeds 
and other inputs in certain developing countries while the average wages remained low; and 
public support to farmers, including in the form of export subsidies, in industrialized countries 
with high salaries. The result was that for many farmers in the South, there were few incentives 
to produce much beyond subsistence levels, even when they could achieve such levels - which 
often they could not. This was further aggravated by the retreat of the public sector from 
agriculture, in part because institutions such as marketing boards, because they were considered 
inefficient and at times mismanaged, were dismantled following prescriptions of the 
international financial institutions, and in part because too little of the public budget was invested 
into agriculture, rural services, and the development of infrastructure for the rural areas. Massive 
impoverishment of the rural areas and rural flight followed. A number of countries which 
previously were self-sufficient in food became net-food-importing in the 1980s.<b>56</b> The

<p>per year in the 1960s. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), gross 
imports of food by developing countries grew with trade liberalization, turning into a food trade 
deficit of more than US$ 11 billion by 2001 with cereal import bill for Low Income Food Deficit 
Countries reaching over US$ 38 billion in 2007/2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>resulting situation was not sustainable. Even in the cases where these food-importing countries 
could feed their population, particularly the growing number of urban poor having left the 
countryside, thanks to relatively cheap food dumped on the international markets, the decline of 
the agricultural sector made these countries extremely vulnerable to external shocks, and 
particularly to sudden rises in prices of commodities traded on international markets. This is the 
crisis they now face. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The impacts57 
</b></p>
<p>6. The increase of 2006-2008 in the prices of food commodities on international markets was 
almost unprecedented by its scale and brutality. The impact has been severe on the ability of 
international agencies to provide food, especially where the levels of food aid provided by 
governments are calculated in prices rather than in volumes. The surge in prices has also 
increased the import bills of poor net-food-importing countries. The food import bill of the 
Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries is expected to reach US$ 169 billion in 2008, 40 per cent 
more than in 2007. Developing countries as a whole could face an increase of 33 per cent in 
aggregate food import bills, coming on the heels of a 13 per cent increase the year before. The 
balance of payments effects of food price increases are thus significant, especially when 
combined with the impacts of rising fuel prices, which are often even more important. According 
to data from the World Bank, Africa and Asia are the main losers from the food price increase as 
most of these countries are net food importers. Most of the developed world, Russia, 
Latin America, and South East Asia improve their trade balance as a result of the food price 
increase. However, since all food commodity prices have not increased to the same extent, 
consumption patterns vary across countries and countries tend to import some commodities 
while exporting others a careful analysis is needed to determine which countries gain and lose 
due to the current food price increases. In addition exchange rate changes can lower or worsen 
the impact of change in international food prices. Even net food exporting countries could 
worsen their trade balance if the commodities they import show far higher increase in prices as 
compared to commodities they export. So a case by case analysis is needed to determine the 
impact on the country level. 
</p>
<p>7. The map below depicts the impact on trade balances of countries:

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8. The impact of the increase of food prices on international markets has been severe on 
net food buyers in countries in which the consumers are insufficiently insulated from such 
impacts. Particularly at risk are the landless labourers and the urban poor. But among the 
losers are also a large number of smallholders, themselves net food buyers, and who are 
unable to benefit from the increase in prices on the international markets, because the increase 
occurs at a time when the price of their inputs hits record levels and because they are not 
connected to global supply chains.<b>58</b> At the same time, others have benefited: global

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>58
</b>  It has been argued by some analysts that since 1&#176; poverty is concentrated in the rural 
</p>
<p>areas, 2&#176; this is driven by low and declining food prices and 3&#176; the net food sellers are the very 
poor, an increase in food prices might have a positive impact on poverty. M. Ataman Aksoy and 
Aylin Isik-Dikmelik (&#8220;Are Low Food Prices Pro-Poor? Net Food Buyers and Sellers in 
Low-Income Countries&#8221;, The World Bank: Washington, D.C., 2008) argue that although there 
are more poor net food buyers then sellers, about half of net food buying households is marginal 
net food buyers, and thus price increases will have a small effect on their welfare. In their 
analysis for nine countries the average incomes of net food buyers are higher than the average 
incomes of net food sellers in eight of nine countries. Thus, higher food prices will, on average, 
transfer income from richer to poorer households and be pro poor. Also they argue that incomes 
of the net food buying households in the rural areas depends on the expenditures of food selling 
households and an increase in that might positively impact the food buying households. 
However, this analysis presupposes that higher prices for food commodities on international 
markets will translate into higher prices at the farmgate - an assumption which, due to the current 
organisation of the food production and distribution chain, will be valid only in limited contexts, 
particularly in countries such as Vietnam with highly egalitarian distribution of land resources. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>agribusiness firms and food retailers,<b>59</b> traders and speculators, a small number of 
net-food-exporting countries and large agricultural producers, well connected to the international 
markets. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  The responses 
</b></p>
<p>9. The global food crisis led to reactions in three, partly overlapping, phases. During the first 
phase of the crisis, a number of Governments adopted measures on a unilateral basis, without 
coordination. Some countries sought to lower domestic prices by lowering import tariffs or by 
imposing export restrictions, in the form of export taxes or even export bans on certain 
categories of food crops. The lowering of tariffs on imports provided temporary relief to 
consumers, albeit at a high fiscal cost in countries whose public budget is heavily dependent on 
such tariffs. While in certain cases necessary to respond the immediate needs of the population, 
export restrictions also provided such relief, but at the risk not only of penalizing local 
agricultural producers and creating the wrong incentives for them, but also of worsening the 
situation on the international markets. Some countries sought to rebuild largely depleted strategic 
reserves of grain, even though this might have contributed further to the price spikes. Some 
countries sought to strengthen support programmes for the poor, in the form of cash subsidies, 
vouchers, cash- or food-for-work programmes, health and nutrition programmes, or 
schoolfeeding programmes. 
</p>
<p>10. These reactions have been examined in detail elsewhere and shall not be recounted here. It 
should be noted however, that some of these measures (particularly trade policy measures) 
sought primarily to keep the prices low on domestic markets (or to limit their increase), for the 
benefit of all consumers including those who would have been able to support higher prices, 
although targeted measures, particularly social programmes aimed at the poor, would have been 
more efficient. It is also striking that these measures were adopted without consideration of their 
impact on the ability of other countries to feed their populations. This disregards every State&#8217;s 
obligation to uphold the right to food, not only of its own population, but also in other countries. 
It also shows a lack of consistency, since the imposition of export restrictions or the 
reconstitution of strategic reserves precisely when the prices on international markets are high 
have further exacerbated the tensions on the markets and further perpetuated the very 
developments such measures were seeking to react to. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>59
</b>  It has been reported that: &#8220;Cargill, the world&#8217;s biggest grain trader, achieved an 86 per cent 
</p>
<p>increase in profits from commodity trading in the first quarter of this year. Bunge, another huge 
food trader, had a 77 per cent increase in profits during the last quarter of last year. ADM, the 
second largest grain trader in the world, registered a 67 per cent increase in profits in 2007. Nor 
are retail giants taking the strain: profits at Tesco, the UK supermarket giant, rose by a record 
11.8 per cent last year. Other major retailers, such as France&#8217;s Carrefour and Wal-Mart of the 
US, say that food sales are the main sector sustaining their profit increases&#8221; (GRAIN report, 
Making a killing from hunger, April 2008, available from: www.grain.org/articles/?id=39). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>11. International agencies mobilized their efforts in order to address the most immediate 
needs - those of the hungry of course, but also those of the farmers who, because of the increase 
in the prices of agricultural inputs, were unable to prepare for the next harvests. In 
December 2007, the FAO launched its Initiative on Soaring Food Prices (ISFP). It seeks to offer 
technical and policy assistance to poor countries affected by high food prices in order to help 
farmers improve production by facilitating access to inputs such as improved seeds, organic and 
inorganic fertilizer and water. Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Mozambique and Senegal were the first 
countries benefiting from the ISFP; by June 2008, 54 countries were covered, for a total amount 
of 23.8 million US$. This sum is largely insufficient, and it should be complemented by other 
partners. According to FAO, the countries most affected, especially in Africa, will need at least a 
total of US$ 1.7 billion for short-term measures during 2008-2009 just in order to start reviving 
their agricultural systems. In this regard, ISFP should play a catalytic role. In March 2008, the 
World Food Programme launched an emergency appeal for 755 million US$, in order to cover 
the incremental costs of its original 2008 work programme, taking into account the increase in 
the prices of food and fuel ; the appeal gathered 1.2 billion US$, including 500 million US$ from 
Saudi Arabia. In June 2008, 81 million beneficiaries required food assistance, bringing the total 
cost of 2008 activities with 4.9 metric tons of food to just over US$ 4.78 billion. However, it is 
estimated that the WFP&#8217;s requirements for food assistance programs have increased to 
approximately US$ 6 billion annually, as a result of the global food crisis. And on 25 April 2008, 
the International Fund for Agricultural Development announced it would make available up to 
200 million US$ from existing loans and grants to provide an immediate boost to agricultural 
production in the developing world. This sum could be increased soon, since IFAD has identified 
800 million US$ in undisbursed fund that might be suitable for reprogramming in order to boost 
production by providing essential inputs to farmers. 
</p>
<p>12. In order to assist countries to face their balance of payments difficulties, the International 
Monetary Fund provided additional balance of payments support by augmented access to 
12 countries under Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangements, with the first in 
early January 2008.<b>60</b> Discussions are ongoing, at the time of writing, about loosening the 
conditions for access to the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) and the non-concessional 
Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF). 
</p>
<p>13. Important though as they are, these initiatives would have been even more effective if they 
could have begun earlier, prior to the first uncoordinated reactions, including hoarding by traders 
speculating on higher prices and the imposition of export restrictions by net-food-exporting 
States. Although governments responded speedily to the emergency appeal of the WFP, it is 
simply unacceptable that, in order to act effectively in the face of such a crisis, international 
agencies have to spend weeks calling upon international donors in order to fund their response 
programmes: it is as if the firefighters were being recruited after the fire has started. 
</p>
<p>14. A second phase opened with a number of high-level meetings which sought to improve 
coordination between the agencies involved in addressing the global food crisis and, in part 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>60
</b>  The total amount disbursed amounts to some SDR 143 million, about double the access under 
</p>
<p>outstanding loans. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>through these agencies&#8217; activities, between governments. Initiatives were adopted both at the 
operational and political levels. On 28-29 April 2008, the Executive Heads of the UN specialized 
agencies (including the Bretton-Woods institutions), funds and programmes and the World Trade 
Organisation, gathered in Bern in order to agree on a common strategy. The Chief Executives 
Board agreed on the need to address the crisis through short-term measures (including through 
the emergency programme launched by the WFP and by supporting developing country farmers 
for the next harvests), but also through short-to-medium term measures (including support for 
the establishment of safety nets and income generation programmes, and to countries 
experiencing balance of payments difficulties as a result of higher food and oil prices), 
medium-to-long term measures (including support for improved agricultural decision-making to 
boost production and productivity), and long-term measures (including further research on the 
impact of diversion of food crops towards agrofuel production and support for agriculture in 
Africa). Many of these components of the responses to the global food crisis were already 
contained in the &#8220;New Deal for a Global Food Policy&#8221; proposed on 13 April 2008 by the 
president of the World Bank Group, and endorsed by the Development Committee of the 
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The Bern meeting reinforced inter-agency 
cooperation, in particular by setting up a High Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis 
(HLTF), which held its first meeting on 12 May 2008 and launched work on a &#8220;Comprehensive 
Framework for Action&#8221; (CFA). A first draft of the CFA was presented at the High-Level 
Conference on World Food Security held at the FAO headquarters in Rome on 3-5 June. 
</p>
<p>15. The CFA was finalized in mid-July. It is best described as a menu of actions, to be adapted 
according to national specificities, which the UN agencies and the Bretton-Woods institutions 
have identified as constituting the best response to the global food crisis. Two sets of immediate 
actions are listed. One aims at meeting the immediate needs of the vulnerable populations by 
improving access to food and nutrition support and increasing food availability. This translates 
not only into measures of a humanitarian nature, but also into actions to boost smallholder 
farmer-led food production, and trade and tax measures such as the use of strategic grain 
reserves to lower prices. Another set of actions, also to be launched immediately, aims at 
building longer-term resilience and contributing to global food and nutrition security, by 
expanding social protection systems; sustaining the growth of smallholder farmer food 
production; improving international food markets; and developing an international consensus on 
agrofuels. In addition, a third set of actions aims at establishing better global information and 
monitoring systems, particularly by better coordinating existing information systems and by 
developing the practice of comprehensive assessments and monitoring. 
</p>
<p>16. The contribution of the World Bank has been significant. On 29 May, the Bank launched 
the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP), which aims to facilitate a rapid and flexible 
response of the Bank to the crisis, by (i) reducing the negative impact of high and volatile food 
prices on the poor, (ii) supporting countries in designing sustainable policies that mitigate the 
adverse impacts of high and volatile prices on poverty while minimizing long-term market 
distortions, and (iii) supporting efforts to increase productivity in agriculture as well as market 
participation to ensure an adequate and sustainable food supply response. It includes a facility 
drawing on a variety of funding sources, including a new multidonor trust fund, with a total 
authorized ceiling of US$ 1.2 billion. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. At the political level, a number of meetings took place which sought to achieve a 
consensus on what needs to be done by governments about the crisis. The Human Rights Council 
convened in a special session on 22 May. On 20-23 May, the Economic and Social Council also 
held a meeting on the issue. On 28-30 May, the Tokyo International Conference on African 
Development (TICAD IV) adopted an action plan and a follow-up mechanism laying out a road 
map for action-oriented initiatives with measurable targets in order to promote further growth in 
Africa. On 3-5 June, the FAO convened a High Level Conference on World Food Security: The 
Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy, which a large number of heads of State and 
governments attended. The G8 Hokkaido-Toyako Summit adopted a statement on global food 
security. Finally, on 18 July, the General Assembly held a meeting on the food and energy crisis, 
and this theme will again be on the agenda of its sixty-third session. 
</p>
<p>18. Finally, we are now entering a third phase, one during which a new architecture for the 
global food system is being discussed, in order to improve world food security in a sustainable 
fashion. Building on the &#8220;New Deal for a Global Food Policy&#8221; proposed by the World Bank<b>61</b> 
and on a French proposal, the G8 Leaders called for a global partnership on agriculture and food 
&#8220;involving all relevant actors, including developing country governments, the private sector, 
civil society, donors, and international institutions&#8221;. They stated (para. 4): 
</p>
<p>This partnership, strengthening and building on existing UN and other international 
institutions, could provide efficient and effective support for country-led processes and 
institutions and for local leadership, draw on the expertise in existing international 
organizations and, in particular, ensure monitoring and assessment on progress. The UN 
should facilitate and provide coordination. As part of this partnership, a global network of 
high-level experts on food and agriculture would provide science-based analysis, and 
highlight needs and future risks. 
</p>
<p>19. The statement also referred to the need to &#8220;explore options on a coordinated approach on 
stock management, including the pros and cons of building a &#8216;virtual&#8217; internationally coordinated 
reserve system for humanitarian purposes&#8221; (para. 6). The UN Secretary-General, in his 
presentation to the UN General Assembly of 18 July 2008, fully endorsed the idea of a Global 
Partnership for Food. During the next few months, discussions will continue on these proposals.

</b></p>
<p><b>THE IMPACTS OF AGROFUELS PRODUCTION ON THE 
RIGHT TO ADEQUATE FOOD 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the broad sense of the expression, agrofuels include all biofuels produced out of 
agriculture and livestock products. The agrofuels that have been the object of tremendous 
increase in demand and also of fierce debates in recent years, i.e. bioethanol and biodiesel for 
transportation (circled in both Diagram 1 and Figure 1), are only a fraction of agrofuels, and as 
Figure 1 shows, they constitute a tiny fraction of biofuels in general. The debate on liquid 
biofuels for transportation should not obviate all the other non-transport or stationary uses of 
biofuels, including biogas, firewood and even bioetanol and biodiesel for stationary energy in 
rural areas. In this paper, for the ease of convenience unless specified otherwise, the term 
agrofuels refers to liquid biofuels used for transport, i.e. bioethanol and biodiesel.

<p>2. The impact on the right to adequate food of the development of bioethanol and biodiesel 
for transportation occurs at three levels. First, the pace of this development has significantly 
contributed to the increase of the prices of certain agricultural commodities on international 
markets, threatening the enjoyment of the right to adequate food. Second, a number of negative 
impacts on the right to food can be expected from the methods of production of agrofuels, in the 
locations where such production takes place. Third, when produced in developing countries in 
order to satisfy the growth of demand in industrialized countries, agrofuels may lead to a 
distorted development, benefiting only a minority, and worsening the lot of many others. These 
impacts are examined in turn.

credit available to blenders of ethanol of USD 0.51 per gallon and an import tariff of 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of agricultural commodities on the international markets. Estimates vary about the percentage of 
price increases which can be explained by the rise in demand for cropland and feed resulting 
from recent initiatives, particularly in the United States and in the European Union, aiming at 
encouraging the reliance on agrofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels.<b>65</b> But there is a consensus 
that these initiatives have has a significant impact. The IMF estimated that the increased demand 
for biofuels accounted for 70 per cent of the increase in maize prices and 40 per cent of the 
increase in soybean prices.<b>66</b> A recent study on the factors having led to the increase in 
internationally traded food prices from January 2002 to June 2008 concludes that &#8220;the most 
important&#8221; of these was the large increase in biofuels production from grains and oilseeds in the 
U.S. and EU. This study estimates that, while energy prices and related increases in fertilizer 
prices as well as the weak dollar could explain 25-30 per cent of the increase in food 
commodities prices, the remaining 70-75 per cent could be attributed to agrofuels production: 
</p>
<p>Without these increases [in the production of feed for fuel], global wheat and maize stocks 
would not have declined appreciably and price increases due to other factors would have 
been moderate. Land use changes in wheat exporting countries in response to increased 
plantings of oilseeds for biodiesel production limited expansion of wheat production that 
could have otherwise prevented the large declines in global wheat stocks and the resulting 
rise in wheat prices. The rapid rise in oilseed prices was caused mostly by demand for 
biodiesel production in response to incentives provided by policy changes in the EU 
beginning in 2001 and in the U.S. beginning in 2004. The large increase in rice prices was 
largely a response to the increase in wheat prices rather than to changes in rice production 
or stocks, and was thus indirectly related to the increase in biofuels. Recent export bans on 
grains and speculative activity would probably not have occurred without the large price 
increases due to biofuels production because they were largely responses to rising prices.<b>67</b> 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>USD 0.54 per gallon, as well as a biodiesel blenders tax credit USD 1.00 per gallon. The U.S. 
mandated 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2012 in its 2005 legislation and raised the 
mandate to 15 billion gallons of ethanol from conventional sources (maize) by 2022 
and 1.0 billion gallons of biodiesel by 2012 in the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act. 
<b>65
</b></p>
<p>  An IFPRI study suggests price increases of between 16 and 43 per cent at best and between 30 
and 76 per cent at worst, depending upon the commodity (Mark Rosegrant and others, &#8220;Biofuels 
and the global food balance&#8221;, in <i>Bioenergy and Agriculture: Promises and Challenges</i>, 
Peter Hazell and P. K. Pachauri, eds. (IFPRI, 2006); see also Marc Cohen and others, <i>Impact of 
Climate Change and Bioenergy on Nutrition</i>, IFPRI and FAO, 2008). Others consider that in the 
medium-term, when markets will be operating well, the impact on prices will be lower, 
averaging 5 per cent for most crops, although with significantly higher increases for certain 
feedstock crops like oilseeds, maize and sugar cane (<i>The Gallagher Review of the indirect effects 
of biofuels production</i>, The Renewable Fuels Agency, July 2008, at 57-58).

 <p> 
</p>
<p>4. The policies of the U.S. and of the EU are singled out in this respect. In contrast, according 
to this study, &#8220;Brazilian ethanol production from sugar cane has not contributed appreciably to 
the recent increase in food commodities prices, because Brazilian sugar cane production has 
increased rapidly and sugar exports have nearly tripled since 2000. Brazil uses approximately 
half of its sugar cane to produce ethanol for domestic consumption and exports and the other half 
to produce sugar. The increase in cane production has been large enough to allow sugar 
production to increase from 17.1 million tons in 2000 to 32.1 million tons in 2007 and exports to 
increase from 7.7 million tons to 20.6 million tons. Brazil&#8217;s share of global sugar exports 
increased from 20 per cent in 2000 to 40 per cent in 2007, and that was sufficient to keep sugar 
price increases small except for 2005 and early 2006 when Brazil and Thailand had poor crops 
due to drought&#8221;.<b>68</b> 
</p>
<p>5. Considering the impact of the increase of the international prices of food commodities on 
the poorest, policies aimed at promoting the use of agrofuels from feedstock, having an 
inflationary impact on staple foods, could only be justified under international law if very strong 
arguments are offered, showing that the benefits from agrofuels outweigh the negative impacts. 
Indeed, the introduction of mandates for agrofuels and the provision of subsidies encouraging the 
creation of a viable market for agrofuels should be considered as deliberately retrogressive 
measures. Under the doctrine of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, a 
State adopting such measures has the burden of proving that they have been introduced only after 
the most careful consideration of all alternatives and provided only that they are duly justified by 
reference to the totality of the rights provided for in the Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights.<b>69</b> 
</p>
<p>6. For the moment, the Special Rapporteur has serious doubts that this burden can be met. 
The main justifications which have been put forward for the imposition of blending mandates 
and the granting of subsidies to encourage agrofuels production are that this would limit the 
emission of greenhouse gases; that this would ensure a security of supply, limiting the 
dependency of the EU and the U.S., in particular, on crude oil imported from politically instable 
regions; and that this would create employment. But, as already noted in a previous note 
presented by the Special Rapporteur, the first justification has been seriously challenged by 
recent scientific evidence, which demonstrates that, taking into account the full life cycle of the 
product (including the shifts in land-use resulting from an increased demand for cropland for 
agrofuels) as well as the massive volumes of water required to produce fuel from crops, the 
hopes put in agrofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels have been largely misplaced: indeed, with 
the exception of the production of ethanol from sugarcane in Brazil, the carbon balance of other 
agrofuels produced from crops is potentially very negative, particularly when land with high

<p>carbon content, such as forest or peat land, is converted to grow agrofuels.<b>70</b> The second 
justification is highly implausible. Agrofuels cannot constitute an alternative to reliance on fossil 
fuels. This follows from a simple comparison between the shifts in the use of crops for the 
production of agrofuels and the share of agrofuels in the transport fuel market: in 2007, 
approximately 23 per cent of coarse grain production in the U.S. was used to produce ethanol, 
for a share of ethanol in the gasoline transport fuel market of 4.5 per cent in 2008 ; in the EU, 
although 47 per cent of vegetable oil production was used in the production of biodiesel, causing 
higher imports of vegetable oil to meet domestic consumption needs, the biodiesel share of the 
diesel transport fuel market was 3.0 per cent.<b>71</b> The U.S. National Academies of Sciences found 
that even if all the corn and soybeans produced in the U.S. in 2005 were used for bioethanol 
production, this would only replace 12 per cent of the country&#8217;s gasoline demand and 6 per cent 
of its diesel demand.<b>72</b> As to the third justification, it relates to the second level at which the 
development of agrofuels may have an impact on the right to food.

<p><b>2.  The impact on human rights in the country of production 
</b></p>
<p>7. Apart from its impact on the level of certain agricultural commodities, the development of 
agrofuels could have social and environmental impacts, which also may affect the right to food 
as an element of the right to an adequate standard of living. Specifically, the increased demand 
for crops for fuel may raise the price of cropland, making access to land even less affordable 
than it is presently as smallholders will be pit against large producers for the acquisition of land. 
It could lead to the eviction of landusers whose titles to the land are insecure, or to the 
displacement of populations, particularly of indigenous peoples, in order to allow for the

<p><b>70
</b>  The deforestation encouraged by the increased demand for agrofuels may be indirect. For 
</p>
<p>instance, the increased demand for maize in the U.S., a result of the policies encouraging 
production of ethanol from that crop particularly since 2004, has led to restricting the supply of 
soybean by U.S. farmers, attracted by the subsidies linked to the production of maize for ethanol. 
The result has been the expansion of soybean production in Brazil, at the expense of portions of 
the cerrado and of the Amazonian rainforest.

</b></p>
<p>  The situation of Brazil is different. They have imposed blending mandates since 1938, and it 
sought to ensure its energy independence by supporting a domestic ethanol policy, Pro&#225;lcool, 
since 1975. As a result, 54 of Brazil&#8217;s sugarcane crop goes to ethanol, for a share of gasoline 
transport fuel market of 40 percent. These figures are provided in FAO, <i>Bioenergy, food security

<p>development of large plantation-form agricultural exploitations for the production of agrofuels.<b>73</b> 
One study estimates that as many as 60 million indigenous people will be driven from their 
lands, under customary ownership, to clear the way for biofuels plantations, if current investment 
plans are realized.<b>74</b> Because much of the bioenergy industry relies on improved or genetically 
modified seeds which are protected by patents, it further aggravates the concentration of power 
in agriculture in the hands of a limited number of dominant actors, mostly large multinational 
corporations, further marginalizing smallholders.<b>75</b> In many cases, despite commendable efforts 
made by the governments concerned in order to combat this phenomenon, the employment 
which is created in the plantations for bioenergy crop production, because of their scale and of 
the concentrated structure of ownership, is exploitative in nature.<b>76</b> The expansion of 
monoculture plantations of soy, oil palm, jatropha, sugar cane, maize, cassava and other fuel 
crops, may also have detrimental impacts on biodiversity and an impact of diets, since in the 
regions affected the variety of local foods available may be reduced. In addition, it will increase 
the competition for scarce water between current landusers and bioenergy crop production, 
and aggravate water scarcity problems. While employment may be created by the agrofuels 
industry - in 1997, the ethanol sector employed one million in Brazil, 65 percent of which in 
permanent jobs<b>77</b> - these benefits should be measured against these impacts, and in particular the 
potential violations of the right to food and the right to water which may result from such an

<p>evolution. And even if the country as a whole stands to gain from developing the production of 
agrofuels, this should not be accepted as a justification if the situation of the most food insecure 
in the country worsens: indigenous peoples, smallholders and landless labourers are at particular 
risk, since these are the categories whose situation may worsen as a result of the change of 
land-uses for the production of feedstock for fuels. 
</p>
<p>8. None of the above is to say that the production of fuel from crops should be condemned 
per se. In fact, criteria could be developed which, agreed to by international consensus, could 
provide guidance to States about the development of agrofuels on their territory and about the 
conditions they could impose on the import of feedstock for agrofuels from abroad. It is in the 
nature of such criteria that different crops would be evaluated differently. For instance, while the 
production of ethanol from maize has a clearly demonstrated negative impact on food security, 
plantation production of sugarcane for ethanol or the cultivation of jatropha on depleted or dry 
land not suitable for the production of food crops may lead to increased welfare and reduced 
poverty, due to income-earning opportunities, with positive implications for food security.<b>78</b> 
Similarly, the imposition of such criteria could encourage practices, in particular modes of 
production, which contribute most to the reduction of poverty in the source countries, and to 
improving overall food security. Indeed, although in most cases the production of feedstock for 
fuel is more competitive if it relies on economies of scale related to largescale industrial 
production, due to the high investment cost related to processing, other forms of production may 
be encouraged, such as forms of contract farming in which &#8220;the processor purchases the harvests 
of independent (smallholder) farmers under terms agreed to in advance through contracts&#8221;; and 
smallholders could be assisted in &#8220;building cooperatives, marketing associations, partnerships 
and joint ventures, and coordinating their supply into larger production facilities will benefit 
smallholder participation in biofuel markets just as it holds potential for other agricultural 
markets&#8221;.<b>79</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. The impact of international trade in agrofuels: shaping development  
through export crops 
</b></p>
<p>9. The potential impact of the development of agrofuels should also be considered at a third 
level. While the demand for agrofuels is highest in the industrialized countries, particularly the 
U.S. and the EU, these countries do not have enough agricultural lands suitable to grow energy 
crops. In contrast to what is the case in developed countries, large portions of land remain 
unused or are not under intensive use in developing countries. Developing countries also have a 
comparative advantage for the production of agrofuels through their lower wages and labour 
standards. In addition, while the most energy-efficient agrofuel feedstock are sugarcane and (to a 
lesser extent) palm oil, these crops are best grown in tropical and sub-tropical climates.

<p>10. The development of international trade in agrofuels will therefore further aggravate the 
current situation in which, due to the significant purchasing power of consumers in industrialized 
countries, a competition will emerge between the production of food for local consumption in 
developing countries and the production of feedstock for transport and other uses in 
industrialized countries. This is not a new phenomenon, of course: it is one which is linked to the 
problem of cash crops in general, understood as crops which are exported instead of being 
consumed in the country in which they are grown, and the production of feedstock for fuel 
presents a certain analogy in this respect with the production of feed for livestock, in order to 
meet primarily the demand for dairy food and meat in industrialized countries. What is unique 
however about the demand for crops for fuel production is that this demand is much more 
sensitive to price changes than demand for crops for food: while the level of consumption of 
calories and even the composition of diets vary only to a small extent when prices change - 
households usually cut down on education or other non-vital items before limiting their 
consumption of food -, the demand for fuel is much more elastic, although it is driven both by 
the price of oil (with which agrofuels compete) and by the price of crops. This means that the 
volatility of the international markets for agrofuels may be particularly high. Even more 
importantly, the demand for agrofuels is potentially almost infinite. Whereas increased demand 
for crops for food or in order to feed livestock reaches a natural limit - the demand is saturated at 
a certain level -, once crops are turned into bioethanol or biodiesel, the level of demand can be 
such that a very large proportion of crops can be used for that purpose, without a risk of 
saturation of markets before long. Thus, if the production of agrofuels is to develop in the future, 
it will be particularly important to monitor the impact on the non-growers of these crops in the 
producing countries: for even if the crop-growers themselves benefit from producing crops for 
fuel which they export to foreign markets, the impacts could be negative on those other segments 
of the local population, whose food security might suffer, for instance as a result of the increased 
price of land or a diminished availability of food.
