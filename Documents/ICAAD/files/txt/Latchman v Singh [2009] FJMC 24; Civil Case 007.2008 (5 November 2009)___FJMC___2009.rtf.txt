analysis of evidence

The analysis of the evidence for examination as to means is based on the evidence tendered and the financial standing as at the date of examination as to means. 

Income

From the Defendants evidence it is not disputed that the Defendant earns $1177.24 per month from his employment with British American Tobacco. The other income he has is $150.00 per month from rental income. The total income per month is $1327.24. 

The Court here notes that the Defendant apart from denying that he currently owns T1613 (Taxi) has not submitted any supporting evidence to the satisfaction of this Court that he does not own the said taxi. The Plaintiffs have tendered evidence from LTA that as at 2nd September 2009 Vehicle T1613 (Taxi) was held by the Defendant. After the Plaintiff tendered this evidence the onus was on the Defendant to adduce evidence that he did not own the taxi. This could have been by way of an agreement that the Taxi was sold as the Defendant tendered evidence (sale and purchase agreement) for LT613 or other supporting evidence. The Court therefore holds that the Defendant is still the owner of the taxi and derives income from the said taxi. The exact figure cannot be ascertained and is therefore not added to the income of the Defendant. 

EXPENSES

As per the evidence the Defendants expenses are as follows:

(a)     
MH - $88.50 per month. 

(b)     
The defendant pays $305.00 per annum for house insurance which equates to $25.41 per month. 

(c)     
The defendant is also paying a loan to ANZ for $80.00 per month. 

(d)     
Water rates are about $10.00 per month.

(e)     
Electricity is about $25.00 per month. 

(f)     
Town rate is $180.00 per annum which equates to $15.00 per month. 

(g)     
Childrens fare is about$4.00 per day (for both children) which equates to about $80.00 per month. 

(h)     
Groceries expenses $480.00 per month. 

The total expenses for the month amounts to $723.91. 

Income over expenditure /month


	Total income of the defendant is 	$1327.24
	
	The total expenses of the Defendant	$723.91

		-----------	
	Surplus	$ 603.33


The Court allows another $150.00 deduction per month for miscellaneous expenses not accounted for in the examination. That leaves the Defendant with surplus of $450.00 per month. 

The Orders

Following the Examination as to the means the Court Orders as follows:

(a)     
The Defendant within One month of this ruling pays $1000.00 to the Plaintiff.

(b)     
The Defendant is to forthwith pay $450.00 per month until the judgment sum is paid in full.
